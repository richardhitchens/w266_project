MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, everyone, and welcome to today's Bank of America Earnings Announcement. At this time all participants
are in a listen-only mode. Later you have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session.
[Operator Instructions] Please note that this call may be recorded. I'll be standing by if you should need any assistance.
It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. Lee McEntire.
Lee McEntire
Good morning. Thanks to everybody on the phone. Thanks for those that are joining us on the webcast as well.
Welcome to the fourth quarter earnings results presentation. Hopefully everyone has had a chance to review the
earnings that we released. It's available on the Bank of America Investor Relations website. And so before I turn the
call over to Brian and Paul, let me remind you we may make some forward-looking statements. For further information
on those, please refer to either our earnings release documents on our website or our SEC filings.
So with that, I'll turn it over to our Chief Executive Officer, Brian Moynihan.
Brian T. Moynihan
Thank you, Lee, and good morning. Thanks to all of you for joining us this morning to discuss our fourth quarter
results. Before Paul Donofrio takes you through the details of the quarter, I just wanted to provide some overall context
on our progress in 2015 and the opportunities and challenges ahead. As you know for the fourth quarter, we reported

$3.3 billion in earnings or $0.28 per diluted share. For 2015 we had net income of $15.9 billion, that's the highest net
income we've had in a long time. Full year return metrics are 74 basis points for ROA and 9% for return on tangible
common equity.
During 2015 we continued to drive our eight lines of business forward. We focused on driving responsible growth
across all our businesses and as you look at the annual earnings of the company and see how they fell, you can see how
they came through. Our Consumer and Wealth Management businesses serving mass-market customers all the way to
the wealthiest Americans delivered $9.3 billion of net income this year.
Our Global Banking business which provides services to small, medium and large companies around the world
produced $5.3 billion in net income this year. When our institutional investor clients, our Markets business, with its
market-leading research capabilities and a top-tier platform across the globe delivered $3 billion in earnings after
adjusting for DVA in a very challenging market. What's clear in these earnings despite the gyrations in markets,
especially at the end of the year last year, is annuity in nature that we get from our franchise by driving customer and
client flows. That's the power of the company, its balance and scope and its strong customer base. And we aim to
continue to improve it every day for our clients and customers and our shareholders. These results reflect the work
we've done over the past several years to develop a more straightforward and simplified operating model and focus on
responsible growth.
As you can see on slide two, across a variety of measures, loan growth, business activity, capital, liquidity, credit
losses, and cost management, we made meaningful progress and believe we're positioned for a variety of economic
cycles. At the foundation of all this is a strong capital and liquidity base. We added to our record liquidity levels in
2015 and we believe we're well positioned against the 2017 LCR requirements with total global excess liquidity
sources now at over $500 billion. This amount represents nearly a quarter of our balance sheet and we have enough
parent liquidity to last more than three years before we need to tap the market refunding.
Now our liquidity levels were driven by strong growth in deposits this year, and we were able to put that funding to
work to grow loans on an absolute basis for the first time in several years. Loan growth was all driven by organic
activity and consistent with our risk posture. Our tangible common equity of $162 billion of record levels as well,
returned $4.5 billion of shares this year in common dividends and share repurchases. Our tangible book value per share
improved 8% in the past 12 months to a new high of $15.62. Our responsible lending focus also shows in our
underwriting results.
Our net charge-offs were down to $4.3 billion this year, consistent with the last – 2014 but much lower than previous
years. Commercial charge-offs increased off a very low base mostly from oil-related charge-offs while Consumer
losses as a core continue to improve. This reflects both our responsible underwriting as we continue to improving our
legacy portfolios.
And finally, we get to the cost management side. At the heart of our work has been improving expenses which you can
see are down sequentially from last year, mostly on lower litigation costs but also on improved LAS and other
operating costs. And these have improved steadily across the last several years. We began new BAC in 2011 and
completed in 2014. Since then we have been using our simplified and improved initiatives to find savings that more
than offset increased compliance, merit, and other inflationary costs but most importantly the savings fund investments
in our business whether it's in technology, our sales force growth, or other infrastructure costs.
As we move to slide three, we include a few examples of trend business activity in our Consumer side of the house and
Wealth Management side of the house. As you can see, we grew average deposits in Consumer Banking Wealth
Management business $52 billion or 7% compared to year-over-year fourth quarter periods. These deposits are up over
$105 billion in core deposits the end of 2012. This is strong organic growth. It's a result of hard work and improving
the customer satisfaction our franchise by making it easier for customers to do business with our bank and strong
product management simplifying the product set. All this has been done when we've optimized our delivery network
reducing our financial centers, divesting certain markets and also expanding our award-winning mobile capabilities and
the customer base that uses that.

As you can see, this work also extends for our Wealth Management business. We've had long-term net flows for every
quarter for six-and-a-half years in Wealth Management. We have record loan levels and significantly higher deposit
levels. Good products and advising, a growing sales force and two of the leading brands in business positions us well
here.
When you move to our Global Banking Markets area, you can see an institutional side of the house slate set up for us
on slide four, we saw solid activity in 2015. Loans to commercial and corporate clients around the globe have grown
nicely. Client demand has been good and our bankers have met our challenge to capture market share responsibly. This
focus allowed us to demonstrate a strong 12% growth in loans in Global Banking in the past 12 months, and you can
see that deposit growth has been strong here over the last year as well.
If you look at the Markets business, Tom Montag and the team have done a good job reducing assets and lower the
risks and still generating relatively stable revenue. Despite the recent market challenges, we remain quite profitable in
this business and well positioned around the globe with both a strong FICC and equity platform.
As we step back, we remain focused on our core customer strategy. We continue to invest in the future even as we
continue to address the legacy issues of the past. We've been able to grow even as the operating and economic
environment remains in a low growth mode. Our model is solid but there's still plenty of work to do, but also there's
plenty of opportunity ahead for us. Overall, I'm pleased with the progress we made in 2015 and we have more to do in
2016. But in 2016, you should expect us to continue to focus on responsible growth. We'll continue to drive the
investments made in the franchise to deliver the value to you as shareholders. We'll continue our sharp focus on risk
management, and we'll continue our cost discipline as we look to continue to improve return on capital metrics of our
company.
With that, let me hand it over to Paul.
Paul M. Donofrio
Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone.
Starting on slide five, we present a summary of the income statement and returns for this quarter as well as the fourth
quarter of last year, which had similar seasonal aspects. We earned $3.3 billion in the quarter compared to earnings of
$3.1 billion in 4Q 2014. Earnings per diluted share this quarter were $0.28, up 12% versus a year ago.
Results include two significant charges that were previously announced and impacted EPS by $0.06. First, we recorded
a pre-tax charge of $612 million associated with trust preferred securities, which phased out of Tier 2 capital at the end
of 2015. Second, we had a tax charge of $290 million associated with the UK tax changes that were enacted during the
quarter.
Lastly, we had a few other items that benefited EPS this quarter by $0.01 on a net basis. These included a negative net
DVA impact in sales and trading that was more than offset by a positive impact of market-related adjustments in net
interest income and some one-off tax benefits.
Revenue on an FTE basis was $19.8 billion this quarter, up 4% from Q4 2014. Expenses were $13.9 billion,
approximately $300 million or 2% lower than a year ago, driven by good expense discipline across the company.
We also provide returns and a few other metrics on this page. I would remind you that client activity and revenue in our
Global Markets segment tend to be lower or lowest in the fourth quarter, affecting returns and other statistics.
Lastly, as many of you are aware, there was a recent accounting change that requires certain unrealized debit valuation
adjustments to be recorded directly to OCI rather than through the P&L. We early adopted this change effective as of
the beginning of 2015. The slides and the supplemental earnings materials that present 2015 results have been adjusted.
Turning to slide six and focusing on the balance sheet, we grew deposits by $35 billion from Q3, and we used these
increased deposits to fund responsible loan growth. In total, assets climbed $9 billion, as increases in loans and

securities balances of $30 billion were more than offset by reductions in trading-related assets and cash.
Liquidity rose to just over $500 billion, a record level, and time to required funding remains over three years. Tangible
common equity of $162 billion improved modestly from Q3, as earnings were offset by both the return of $1.3 billion
in capital to common shareholders and negative OCI driven by securities values. Tangible book value per share
increased to $15.62, another new record high.
Turning to regulatory metrics, we began reporting regulatory capital under the advanced approaches for the first time
this quarter. Our CET1 transmission ratio under Basel III ended the quarter at 10.2%, and really has no comparable
metric as transition ratios in prior periods were reported under the standardized approach with lower RWA levels. On a
fully phased-in basis, CET1 capital improved modestly to $154.1 billion. Under the advanced approaches compared to
Q3 2015 pro forma estimate, the CET1 ratio increased slightly to 9.8%. RWA was essentially flat, as growth from
commercial exposures was mostly offset by lower activity and balance sheet levels in our Global Markets segment.
We also provide our capital metrics under the standardized approach. Here, our CET1 ratio was flat at 10.8%, with
modest improvements in capital offset by modest increase in RWA. In terms of the supplementary leverage ratios, we
estimate that as of 12/31 we continue to exceed U.S. rules applicable beginning in 2018 at both parent and bank.
Turning to slide seven, we had strong loan and deposit growth this quarter. Reported loans on an end-of-period basis
increased $15 billion from Q3. This is the third consecutive quarter of reported increases in total loan balances.
We continue to see solid loan demand in our primary lending businesses, partially offset by runoff in LAS and All
Other. Excluding the declines in LAS and All Other, ending loans in our primary lending segments increased $22
billion from Q3. $8 billion of this increase was in Consumer loans, as GWIM increased mortgages and securities-based
lending. Consumer Banking also saw a good loan growth in mortgages as well as vehicle loans. We also had some
seasonal growth in Credit Card, partially offset by selling $1.7 billion of card receivables at the end of the quarter.
Commercial loans grew $15 billion, spread across multiple industry groups.
Turning to deposits, on an ending basis, they reached nearly $1.2 trillion this quarter, growing $78 billion or 7% from
Q4 2014. Growth was solid across the franchise. Consumer led the way, growing 9% year over year while both Global
Banking and GWIM each grew at a 6% pace.
Turning to asset quality on slide eight, while still strong, we did see net charge-offs increase modestly from recent
levels. Total net charge-offs increased $212 million versus Q3. $144 million was from Consumer items previously
reserved for and lower recoveries on the sale of NPLs in the fourth quarter versus Q3. We also saw a $73 million
increase in net charge-offs from our energy portfolio. Outside of these two areas, net charge-offs were stable compared
to Q3.
Provision of $110 million in Q4 was relatively flat with Q3. Reserve releases in Consumer Real Estate and Credit Card
were partially offset by reserve builds in Commercial, which were driven by increases in criticized exposures as well as
loan growth. Reserve releases excluding the previously reserved items I mentioned earlier were roughly $200 million.
On slide nine, we provide credit quality data on our Consumer portfolio. Net charge-offs increased $137 million. The
two items of note that make up this increase were reserved for in prior periods and did not impact provision expense in
the quarter. $119 million was the result of collateral valuation adjustments. In addition, we had some small charge-offs
associated with our 2014 DOJ settlement. We expect to complete our commitments under this settlement in the first
half of 2016. Adjusting for these two items, Consumer net charge-offs were relatively flat versus Q3. Delinquency
levels and NPLs continue to decline, and reserve coverage remains strong.
Moving to the Commercial side on slide 10, net charge-offs increased $75 million primarily from losses in our energy
portfolio. Outside of the energy portfolio, commercial losses remained very low. Given the focus on the impacts of low
oil prices on companies in the energy sector, we want to spend a minute to describe our energy portfolio and provide
some perspective.
The pie chart breaks down our $21 billion of utilized exposure to the energy sector. This represents a little more than
2% of our total loan balances. Within that $21 billion, $8.3 billion or less than 1% of total loans is loans to borrowers in

two subsectors: escalation and production as well as oil field services. We consider these two subsectors to have
significantly higher risk than the rest of the energy portfolio. Of our $8.3 billion utilized exposure to these two higher
risk subsectors, $2.9 billion has already been downgraded to criticized. So 35% of the higher-risk subsectors has
already been downgraded to reservable criticized exposure thereby driving a portion of the reserves. And allowances
for loan losses for the entire energy portfolio is approximately $500 million or 6% of the funded exposure of these two
subsectors.
Companies in the vertically integrated subsector represent $5.8 billion of the energy portfolio. We believe this
subsector has a better ability to withstand lower oil prices. Nearly 100% of the companies have a market capital of $10
billion or more, or they're sovereign-owned and the average company has a market cap greater than $60 billion. We
believe the remaining exposure in refining and marketing as well as other is also less dependent on oil prices.
As part of our standard risk management process, we stress test our credit portfolios including our energy portfolio. Our
stress analysis of the energy portfolio includes various sustained low oil prices over extended periods. As an example,
if we held oil prices at $30 per barrel for nine quarters, we estimate our potential losses on the energy portfolio would
be roughly $700 million. In energy and across our commercial sector, we continue to support clients while managing
lending limits and actively engaging with stressed borrowers.
Before moving from asset quality, I want to refocus on total provision expense and how one should think about it over
the next couple of quarters. As we continue to access and react to future changes in the energy sector, we could see
lumpiness that could potentially drive provision expense over $900 million.
Turning to net interest income on slide 11, on an FTE basis NII was $10 billion, increasing roughly $300 million from
Q3. NII included a negative $612 million charge associated with three trust preferred securities. These securities were
scheduled to be completely phased out of Tier 2 capital as of January 1 and with 7% to 8% coupons became expensive
debt. NII also included $160 million of positive market related adjustments to the amortization of bond premiums under
FAS 91. NII, excluding market related adjustments and the charge on the trust preferred, improved $188 million from
Q3 to $10.5 billion. This improvement was driven by increased deposit balances which we used to fund growth in loans
and securities.
As we move into the first quarter, please note the following; first, we will have one less day of interest. Second, recent
changes by Congress will lower the amount of dividends we receive from the FRB by approximately $50 million a
quarter. Having said that, if the forward curve is realized and if we have some modest deposit and loan growth, we still
expect to show some growth in NII in Q1 2016 relative to our adjusted NII of $10.5 billion. With regard to asset
sensitivity, at the end of the fourth quarter, our overall asset sensitivity decreased slightly as a result of increases in
long-end rates as well as security balances. As of 12/31, an instantaneous 100 basis point parallel increase in rates is
estimated to increase NII by approximately $4.3 billion over the subsequent year. A little more than half of that
improvement comes from the increases in short-end rates and a little less than one quarter of the benefit comes from
market-related adjustments.
Turning to expenses on slide 12, noninterest expense was $13.9 billion in Q4, $300 million lower than Q4 2014. This
was driven by driven by good expense discipline across the company. Litigation expense was a little higher this quarter
at $428 million, exhibiting some lumpiness as we work to resolve legacy issues. Keep in mind that annual litigation
expense decreased from $16.4 billion in 2014 to $1.2 billion in 2015. Legacy asset servicing costs, excluding litigation,
finished Q4 a little bit better than our targets of $800 million.
As we have said, our next goal is $500 million per quarter. Expenses, excluding litigation and LAS, were $12.6 billion
and represents the fifth quarter out of the past six below $12.8 billion. We continue to look for ways to streamline and
simplify how we do business. This is important because it allows us to invest in growth while maintaining relatively
flat core expenses in a sluggish revenue environment. And importantly, this relative flatness continued even as we
invested in additional sales professionals and improved technology.
Looking towards expenses in 2016, let me remind you, in the first quarter we will record, as normal, approximately $1
billion in costs for retirement-eligible incentives. In addition, the first quarter typically includes seasonally higher

payroll taxes of roughly $300 million. And if we experience traditional rebound in Q1 sales and trading revenue, this
would also increase incentives and other associated costs.
Turning to the business segments and starting with Consumer Banking on slide 13, Consumer earned $1.8 billion, 9%
greater than Q4 last year. These results reflect good operating levers on increased customer activity. The segment
generated a strong 25% return on allocated capital. Revenue of $7.8 billion was up modestly from Q4 2014. Net
interest income benefited from higher deposit and loan levels. Noninterest income was down slightly from lower
mortgage banking. The decline in mortgage revenue reflects selling fewer nonconforming loans as we hold more on our
balance sheet. In addition, there was the absence of $30 million in quarterly revenue from the Q3 sale of a small
noncore appraisal business.
Expenses declined 2% from Q4 2014 as the savings from reduction in financial centers and personnel more than offset
higher product costs and investment in increased sales specialists. The cost of operating deposit franchise remains low
at 177 basis points. Operating leverage drove improvements in the efficiency ratio to 56% as we continue to experience
shifts in customer activity away from branches towards self-serve options. Mobile banking users increased to 18.7
million, which is up 13% from Q4 2014, and deposit transactions from these devices now represent 15% of deposit
transactions.
slide 14 presents good consumers progress across a number of customer activities. I would like to highlight activities in
three areas: loans, deposits, and brokerage assets where we continue to grow responsibly. These three products are at
the core of our rewards programs where we share benefits with customers who deepen relationships with us. Average
loans grew $12 billion from Q4 2014 in mortgages and vehicle lending. Ending deposit growth was strong at $48
billion or 9% from Q4, while the rate paid declined to four basis points.
Regarding brokerage assets, Merrill Edge asset levels of $123 billion are up 8% from last year even with declines in
equity markets this year. Total mortgage production was up 13% from Q4 last year and stable with Q3.
Looking at card activity, which includes GWIM, card issuance was strong at 1.3 million. Average U.S. card balances of
$89 billion were down modestly from last year but up seasonally from Q3 2015. U.S. card credit quality was strong as
net charge-offs remain at decades-low levels of 2.5% with a risk-adjusted margin of 9.4%. Credit spending volumes
finished on a high note as Q4 spending was 5% higher than last year, outpacing what we believe to be total market
spend levels.
Debit spending was strong as well. For example, on Christmas Eve day, we saw record debit card spending of more
than $1 billion. In our consumer segment, we expect technology adoption by customers to continue to be a cornerstone
of not only improved customer satisfaction but also efficiency gains and operating leverage. The latest examples of this
are around digital selling and appointment setting. Digital sales in the fourth quarter were up more than 31% from last
year. Digital appointments reached more than 16,000 on a recent week. We expect these adoption trends to play an
increasing role in future performance and customer satisfaction as we continue to advance online and mobile
capabilities.
Turning to slide 15, Global Wealth and Investment Management produced earnings of $614 million. Results were
down from Q4 last year, driven by lower transactional revenue and the impacts of the market decline on asset
management fees. Transactional revenue continues to be impacted by the shifting of activity from brokerage to
managed relationships as well as market uncertainty. NII benefited from solid loan growth and solid deposit growth but
was offset by the company's ALM activities, leaving NII relatively flat with Q4 2014.
Noninterest expense was modestly higher than the year ago period. Investment in client-facing professionals continues,
while lower revenue caused a decline in incentive compensation that was more than offset by amortization of stock
awards issued in prior periods. Pre-tax margin was 21%, down from Q4 2014. Beginning in the first quarter of 2016,
we will benefit from lower expense resulting from the completion of amortizations related to advisor retention awards
given at the time of the Merrill Lynch merger.
Moving to slide 16, despite the volatility in market levels, we continue to see solid client activity, and we continue to
invest in the business, growing wealth advisors 5% from Q4 last year. Long-term AUM flows were $7 billion and

remained positive for the 26th consecutive quarter. Deposit flows were strong, growing end of balance – growing end
of period balances $15 billion from Q3. By the way, this may have been driven in part by client concerns of market
volatility. Loans continue to grow, improving 10% from last year. This is the 23rd consecutive quarter of average loan
growth in this segment.
Turning to slide 17, Global Banking earned $1.4 billion, down 9% from Q4 2014 but still generating a 16% return on
allocated capital. The earnings decline from Q4 was driven by a higher provision expense. Provision expense was up
$264 million from Q4 last year, driven by higher energy related charge-offs and reserve builds for loan growth and
energy related risks. Revenue increased modestly from Q4 2014 while expense declined modestly. Driven by higher
loan balances, NII improved despite spread compression and the allocation of the company's ALM activities, including
higher liquidity costs. Noninterest income benefited from higher treasury services revenue, higher leasing revenue, and
a small gain from the sale of a foreclosed property, partially offset by lower IB fees.
Looking at trends on slide 18 and comparing to Q4 2014, IB fees of $1.3 billion were down 17% as leveraged finance
and equity issuance was partially offset by advisory fees that were at the second highest levels since the Merrill merger.
From a market share perspective, we maintained our number three global fee ranking. Looking at the balance sheet,
loans on average were $320 billion, up 12% year-over-year. The growth was broad based across C&I, real estate, and
leasing. We continue to experience some spread compression, although it has moderated relative to a year ago. Asset
quality of new loans was consistent with the overall portfolio. On deposits, we saw good performance with average
deposits increasing by $16 billion or 5% over Q4 2014. The mix of these deposits remains very good, with less than 5%
classified as 100% runoff balances.
Switching to Global Markets on slide 19 and comparing to Q4 last year, we are pleased with the results here given
challenging market conditions as the teams increased revenue while using lower asset levels and less VaR. Global
Markets earned approximately $200 million, but we think one should consider results excluding DVA. On that basis,
adjusted earnings were $308 million, which was relatively flat to Q4 2014 on a similarly adjusted basis. Note that our
net DVA loss this quarter was $198 million and compared to a loss of $626 million in Q4 2014, which included an
initial FV adjustment.
Total revenue excluding DVA improved $313 million or 10% from the fourth quarter last year on improved FICC sales
and trading. Outside of sales and trading global market share of lower investment banking fees was offset by a gain on
the sale of an equity investment. Noninterest expense increased 9% in line with revenue improvements.
Moving to trends on the next slide and focusing on the components of our sales and trading performance, sales and
trading revenue of $2.6 billion excluding net DVA was up 11.5% from Q4 of 2014. Compared to Q4 last year, FICC
sales and trading of $1.8 billion improved 20%, reflecting improvements across most products, notably in rates and
credit-related products. Equity trading of $822 million declined 3%, reflecting lower client activity. Average
trading-related asset levels were down 9% from Q4 2014, while VaR was down 14%.
Turning to Legacy Assets and Servicing on slide 21, this segment lost roughly $350 million, in line with the prior year.
Focus areas here are mortgage banking income, the number of delinquent loans, and expenses, all compared to Q4
2014. First, mortgage banking income, which improved slightly, was driven by three factors. Rep and warranty
provision improved $237 million to a provision of $9 million this quarter. That favorability was offset by a decline in
servicing fees of $108 million as units serviced declined, as well as a decline in net MSR hedge performance of $152
million. Next, the number of first mortgage loans that we service that are 60 days delinquent continued to decline and
are now at 103,000 units. And last, the team did an excellent job lowering expenses. Excluding litigation, we achieved
our goal of $800 million, moving costs down $309 million or 28%.
On slide 22, we show All Other, which reported a loss of $289 million. This was an improvement of $86 million from
Q4 2014. This loss was driven by the $612 million pre-tax charge associated with our trust preferred as well as the
impact on the UK tax law changes. This was partially offset by gains on debt securities sales as well as reserve releases
on consumer real estate loans booked in All Other.

A comment or two on taxes before wrapping up, the company's effective tax rate for the quarter excluding the UK tax
charge was 25%, reflecting reoccurring tax benefits plus a few small one-off benefits. We would expect the tax rate to
be in the low 30% for 2016 excluding unusual items.
Before closing, I want to cover our early adoption of DVA accounting in more detail. In January of this year, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an update to allow early adoption of a new rule regarding recognition of
DVA on financial liabilities from changes in our own credit spreads. The update means that these types of debit
valuation adjustments will now flow through OCI instead of the income statement. We believe this change makes our
earnings comparisons more meaningful and easier to understand. Therefore, we adopted early.
We restated all prior years – excuse me – restated all periods from this year per the FASB rules, and those numbers are
contained in the supplemental package. This has no impact on capital, as it moved dollars between retained earnings
and OCI, but it did impact revenue, earnings, taxes, and EPS in the first three quarters of 2015. The changes reduced
previously reported EPS by approximately $0.02 each in Q1, Q2, and Q3. This accounting standard adoption did not
impact DVA on derivatives, which continued to flow through trading account profits.
Okay, let me conclude by offering a few takeaways. Although the U.S. economy is improving slowly, revenue growth
remains challenging. This quarter we continued our progress on those things we can control and drive. These include
delivering for clients and customers within our risk framework and driving client and customer activities that will result
in sustainable profits and returns. Our results reflect this focus. We maintained a strong foundation of capital and
liquidity. We grew loans, deposits, and investment flows. We continue to invest in our franchise by adding sales
professionals and improved technology. Our strength, global capabilities, and experience allowed us to deliver for
clients in a challenging market environment. And we did all of this while closely managing expenses.
With that, we'll open it up to Q&A.
Q&A

[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Good morning.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Good morning, Matt.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Can you talk about the outlook for the core costs beyond some of the lumpy items
in 1Q? And then specifically, maybe comment on how you feel like your markets business is sized. We've obviously
seen some cost saving announcements at your U.S. and non-U.S. peers and want to get a sense of how you feel you're
positioned for the markets.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: This quarter, the fourth quarter, I think represents, as I said in the comments, the fifth quarter
out of six that we've been below $12.8 billion. As you know, I think we've been talking about maintaining core
expenses below $13 billion, so we feel really good about our progress. I have to remind everybody that we're
maintaining those core expenses at those levels while we're investing in front office professionals, while we're investing
in technology, while we're absorbing the natural increase in pay for our employees and fraud costs and CCAR costs and
other things. So I think we feel good about the work we're doing there. In terms of Global Markets, what was the
question?
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Just in terms of the staffing and the positioning there, how you feel for – I don't
know about the current environment, but just not bouncing back in a big, big way. And obviously, we're seeing
reductions being announced at some of your U.S. and non-U.S. peers. So how are you feeling about the sizing of your
business for the environment you expect?

<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Matt, in the fourth quarter, we did reduce head count in the business, the markets
businesses and the related Capital Markets business. We didn't make a big announcement, but that led to the $130
million in severance in the fourth quarter numbers that you see. So it will continue to adjust that head count. Tom and
his team will continue to adjust it but they've made adjustments in the head count in the fourth quarter, it just didn't
make quite the press other people's did.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: The only thing I'd add, Matt, is my focus was on core expenses. We're going to see total
expenses I think continue to come down as we work on LAS and continue to hopefully see some moderation of legal
expenses.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: And just on the timing of the LAS getting to that below $500 million, you did
disclose a big drop in the head count if we look year over year. And obviously, there's a delay in terms of the costs
themselves coming down. But what's the timing of getting to that $500 million or below?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: I think we've made great progress in terms of getting expenses down. I think we started at
what, $3.1 billion a few quarters ago. So we made great progress getting down to $800 million. Our next milestone is
$500 million per quarter. That's going to be a little bit harder. It's just as you get lower and lower, it's a little bit more
unpredictable. And so we're not really giving a target at this time, but we're going to get there as soon as we can.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: We continue to make good progress towards this, Matt, toward this year. And so as you
look towards the end of the year, we should be getting there.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay, thank you.

We'll move next to Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Good morning, Betsy.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: I just wanted to dig in on a couple of things. One was on energy since it's the flavor
of the day. You gave a lot of color there, and you indicated that if $30 per barrel of oil holds for nine quarters, that's a
loss of $700 million. I just wanted to understand. Is that already reserved for or that's over and above [audio gap]
(41:37 – 41:42) if we go below $30, what you've got baked in because I don't think it's linear? I just wanted to
understand how you're thinking about it.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Sure. As we said in the comments, we've got reserves against that energy portfolio of $500
million. That's 6% of the high-risk sub-sectors. And we develop reserves on an incurred basis. We develop them by
looking at loss getting default, probability of default, exposure of default. We go loan by loan. We have a lot of
imprecision, other factors that we look at for imprecision. We put judgment on all of that. One of the things we look at
when we come up with our judgment of what we should be is our stress testing. And so that's how that gets factored
into our reserve, which again has to be on an incurred basis.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Right. So when you indicated that if $30 holds for nine quarters, your model suggests
a loss of $700 million, that's already reserved for, or that's on top of what you already have reserved?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: In part, Betsy, because the idea is you can only incur for what you see through today in
terms of the operating structure of these companies and the asset-based lending. These are asset-based loans, reserve
based loans. [audio gap] (42:58 – 43:04) If you were nine quarters from now and oil was still at that price, you'd have
to have a reserve for what's left in the portfolio. The exposure has been coming down. It would come down during
those nine quarters by the losses you took at least in resolving this credit. So it's in part covered but not fully because

that's an estimate of a future that we, as Paul said, it's in an incur view of the portfolio.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Yes, okay. I get that.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: The way I would think about it is we've got a $500 million reserve. As you go, theoretically
you go through the nine quarters that $700 million would've come true if our model was perfect. It would go against
that $500 million but you'd be building reserves as you went through that process. So if you told me what you wanted
to end the nine quarters at, if you wanted to end at $500 million, you can do the math. If you wanted to end up at more
or less, it's going to be more or less in terms of your kinds of build.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: And then could you talk a little bit about the reserve release that's still possible from
the other portfolios? You had a $200 million reserve release this past quarter. Just wondering what the legs are on that.
We've seen other institutions essentially finish up the reserve release. I know you had a big legacy book so maybe
there's a little more legs there. Just wanted to understand how you're thinking about the trajectory there.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: I think you've got it. I think we have a legacy – we have a large legacy portfolio on the
consumer side. As we continue to work through that, and if home prices continue to stay where they are or improve, the
economy stays where they are or improve, I think you're going to continue to see reserves from us in 2016 – our reserve
releases, I should say, from us in 2016 but they're going to moderate from what they have been in the past.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Okay. So there are still some legs but at a decelerating pace?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Yes, and some of that swings over to the commercial book...
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Yes.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: As you saw this quarter, Betsy. We have come down from a lot of reserve releases last
year. I think it was $800 million or so in the fourth quarter last year, $700 million, $800 million or something, down to
a couple hundred million and you expect that to mitigate during the course of 2016.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Yes, and we've built reserves in commercial.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: All right. Thanks.

We'll move next to John McDonald of Bernstein. Your line is open.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Hi. Good morning. Paul, I was recalling I think you had for a goal this year to
generate positive operating leverage. Was wondering how you feel about the ability to achieve that. What kind of
revenue environment are you planning for? And how will you manage expenses to try to get some positive operating
leverage this year?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: I think we feel good about the operating leverage we achieved in 2015. You can see that
with the revenue growth relative to the EPS growth. And I think we're looking to continue that trend. We've got a little,
hopefully, a little bit of a tailwind here on rates. We're going to continue to manage expenses carefully. So in terms of
our EPS growth in 2016, we don't give estimates, but in terms of our EPS growth in 2016, I think it will be more of the
same. Revenue growth with some hopefully expense discipline that will get us some operating leverage.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And Brian, could you talk a little bit about what your goals will be with your
2016 CCAR submission? Are you looking to make some progress on both the dividend and buyback potentially? And
if you maybe could share some thoughts about that.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: John, we haven't seen the scenarios yet and stuff like that so I think it's probably premature
to discuss that. Our goal long term is to return more and more capital to shareholders through dividends and stock
buybacks. At this price, obviously stock buybacks are favored but when we see the scenario and play that out, it'd be

getting ahead of the process to talk about it today.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And, Paul, one quick follow-up on the NII. Is there a benefit from the pay
down of trust preferreds that you'll get in 2016? And is that why you're able to grow the core NII a little bit in 2016?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: I wouldn't say that's why but obviously there's a benefit from paying off those trust
preferreds. They had I think it was $175 million in the quarter. Have I got that, right?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Yes.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: And so there's a benefit there. But the way I think about those is we're not going to "replace"
them because they don't count for regulatory capital. So why would we replace them? We're going to have a capital
structure that meets our regulatory requirements which requires us to have a certain amount of CET1. We're going to
have the appropriate amount of preferred and sub debt and of course we have to meet the TLAC requirements. So that's
how I would think about it.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And so it's really just the loan growth and pretty stable rates driving some core
NII growth?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: John, if you look at it with what was affecting us 2013, 2014, was we continued to run off
the portfolios that had yield to them and obviously the reinvestment rates on the investment side of the house as we ran
those off were flattish. That's kind of all run through the system so now what you're seeing is $80 billion of period
deposit growth from fourth quarter last year to this year. And the overall pay rate for that is in the low single-digit basis
points, all core, all in consumer wealth management, and is driven by middle market and the banking business. So that's
the deposit funding side. And the asset build is now good core loans that have reasonable yields to them. You're
starting to see it and then pick up just a hair from that and we expect it to drive it in our quarters as long as the economy
continues to grow a couple percent.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Hey, John. Just real quick, I want to correct one thing I said. The $175 million is full year.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay.
Operator
We'll move next to Paul Miller of FBR & Company. Your line is open.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Yes, thank you very much. On your NPAs, you have really good disclosure. You're getting it
down to 103,000 units. Did you sell any this quarter, or was that all the workouts through your servicing?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: We sold a little bit but not as much as we had in the past.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: It's like, Paul, that's been – it's very incremental at this point on the sale side.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: And then when do you – I mean, like, at this the point, when do you think you can get that down
to – I guess it's not a normal level because you're just going to run this whole portfolio off. Can you have any idea when
that will be over with?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Paul, the 103,000 units is the total portfolio so there's a normal piece in that and an
abnormal piece in it but...
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Okay.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: But we should be driving it down to the 60 days, 103,000 units is across both portfolios.
But that number should come into, I don't know, pick a percent or percent and a half of the service loan unit so it's still
got some room to go. And that's the key that I think Matt pointed out earlier, is the FTE head count and LAS we had a

2,000-person head count drop in the company overall in the fourth quarter, about half LAS, half the rest of the
company. The LAS percentage rate was 8 percentage points not annualized in the quarter of 30%. It's still dropping
head count but it's getting flatter. And now we've got all the old costs to drive out of the portfolio. So in terms of
thinking about real estate and, you know old systems and stuff and so that's what takes a little more time now than just
the people cost.

Operator
We'll move next to Jim Mitchell of Buckingham Research.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Hey, good morning, maybe just a quick question on deposit beta since the rate hike. Have
you seen anything unusual? I would assume it would be more on the institutional side where you would see movement
at this point. And then maybe you can give some update on how you're thinking about the deposit betas this year.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Sure. The short answer is that we have seen no real movement. Of course we're very focused
on making sure that we pay an appropriate deposit rate, but so far there's been no movement. We have been modeling
deposit betas on our interest-bearing deposits in the high 40%.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: And you still think that makes sense or do you think that's relatively conservative?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: We think that makes sense. And given the quality of our deposit base, as Brian walked
through already, the big portion we have in our consumer and GWIM franchises, the number of primary checking
accounts, even on the wholesale side if you look at our deposits less than 5% of them are 100% runoff deposits. So we
feel good about our $1.2 trillion in deposits we took. Even this year the deposit rating came down on the basis point of
four basis points for all deposits. So we feel good about that modeling.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: And, Jim, remember that modeling is not 40% of everything. It's a lot nothing and a lot
less for the first couple of bumps. So I think that's what you're thinking about. So if we continue along with one or two
rate rises, there will be a lot more captured than as it gets up in the higher.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Right. It will be more back-end weighted?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Exactly. If that's what you're asking.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Okay. And just one last question maybe on the expense side. If we look at – I mean, you
guys have done a good job and – but if you look at your core expenses, normalized for all the puts and takes, it still
seems like your efficiency ratio would be, you know, sort of in that 63%, 64% range. A lot of your peers are well below
60%. Is there – is this sort of you grow into the improving efficiency ratio with the revenues as you reinvest, or is there
you think you can get there – just trying to get a sense of how you get the trajectory into more in line with the peer
group on the efficiency ratio side.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: It's looking quite good. If you look at the full year 2015 and you do those puts and takes with
the things that we've talked about full year and you make any sort of a reasonable guess as a progress we're going to
make around LAS, we're sort of in the kind of 65%-ish range. We're going to continue to focus on growing responsibly
and working on our total expenses as we talked earlier. And so with a little help from growth and some more work on
expenses, we think we're in shooting range.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: As we model ourselves and look at the peers and the average efficiency by business units
and model against our business mix, we're going to be a little bit higher because of the high level wealth management...
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Right.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: ...in our business relative to the total. But, look, three things on expenses. Number one,
we're continuing to drive it down and funding all of the growth in FTE for sales side. We had 6% growth in consumer

FTE sales side, 3% Wealth Management, 6% or 8% – maybe 8% in Global Banking year over year. So we're paying for
all that, paying for all the incentives attached to it, paying for all the infrastructure attached to it. So we're going to
continue to drive it down. So just rest assured that is – and then we are not satisfied in the mid-60%s efficiency ratio of
the company. And we should be able to drive that down and it'll come from both just hard work and then as you say
with the rate lifted stuff which affects – we're still affected a little bit more by a low rate structure than other people.
We should pick it back up. But don't think we're complacent on this.

Operator
We'll move next to Glenn Schorr of Evercore. Your line is open.
<Q - Glenn Paul Schorr>: Hi, thanks. So I think you put the heat on a little bit on loan growth over the last couple of
quarters. And if you look at lending in your primary lending segments, it's picked up, and I think that's good. The
question I have is with new information that we have, I mean, the market's digesting and anticipating – I don't know if
I'll call it a recession, but a lot of fear around recession, on lower oil and China-related fears. The question I have is if
you look at the core loan growth, are you still okay running it at this level? Do you feel like your customer base that
you're making these new loans to are a little more insulated to the world that the market is fearful of?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Look, outside of energy, we are not seeing the asset quality change, nor are we seeing a
reduction in appetite for our credit. We – I would remind everybody that we are very, very focused on our customer
framework and our risk framework. But within that framework, we continue to see a lot of opportunities to help our
customers grow their businesses. If you look at this quarter and you just focus on the core, we had 3%
quarter-over-quarter growth, or an annualized growth rate of a little over 12% or $22 billion. I'm not going to sit here
and tell you that's what it's going to be next quarter, but we're not seeing a material decline in conversations with our
clients about how to help them grow.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I think to give additional color, if you think about it, if you go back a couple years, we
grew the international business because we had to round out that franchise. We slowed that down 24 months ago. That
started to drop, Glenn, in terms of growth rate. And so because of the client selection criteria there is very high level,
very high in clients, multinational clients, et cetera. But we slowed it down just to keep the company in balance, and
that's been our watchword. If you think about it in the consumer, no subprime, no lowering FICO scores. If you look at
the coming on FICOs are higher than the portfolio still, which is almost hard to believe, the charge-offs, delinquencies
in both home equities, delinquencies across the last four years continue to come – get lower every year. This year was
the lowest they've been all the way back a long time in both the credit card and home equities.
And then if you look at the client selection in the U.S., a couple of things. One is we're adding officers in the middle
market business, but they're going after our target clients. And this is not go find new industries, et cetera. So whether
it's the way we lend in commercial real estate, which is down – which is very high end real estate developers, et cetera,
the way we lend in middle market is very strong. So if you look across this client selection in the middle market
business has been strong. The best [indiscernible] (57:43) that we're seeing is things in our business banking small
business portfolios.
We're actually starting to see growth there, again, sticking to our credit risk, which is the first time in many years that
we had to run off some stuff that came in through LaSalle and Merrill and everything else that we're finally seeing
phenomenal growth. And so I think as client selection, we slowed down international. It's sort of always watching, and
in fact using your stress test to make sure you stay balanced. And if you look at us, yes, we feel we're pretty balanced
between the consumer and commercial, sort of 50:50. And then within the consumer we're really staying to our
-sticking to our knitting, which is very strong high quality credit-worthy borrowers.
<Q - Glenn Paul Schorr>: Great, one follow-up on the FA growth you noted of 5% year-on-year. I'm just curious.
There's not a heck of a lot of core growth in that business. I'm just curious how much is coming from your training

programs versus recruiting both traditional and nontraditional sources.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: It's coming from both. But the reality is that the number one issue they face in the wealth
investment brokerage services revenue line is the decline in transactional revenue. And it has gone from two years ago
probably $600 million a quarter, even in not robust market times, down to – I don't know – $300 million, $400 million
a quarter. And that is part of the makeup of the annuity stream. So even though they're having record net flows, it's just
the revenue rate on that is less, and so that's the factor. So it's not to do with where they're recruiting. The production
for FA continues to be solid at $1 million plus. It's really that core fundamental issue that they're facing and that
transition is what we're all going through. It's getting to the point where it's become less material and i.e. less material
to the total revenue line from the transaction stuff.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: On the other hand, I would just remind everybody that we've got significant positive loan
base in that business, and so again as – if rates rise, we're going to see some benefit there.
<Q - Glenn Paul Schorr>: All right, thank you very much.

We'll move next to Steven Chubak of Nomura.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Good morning, Steven.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: So I actually have a quick follow-up to a topic that Glenn was just addressing relating to
GWIM and just some of the margin pressures that we've been seeing over the last couple quarters. I wanted to get a
better sense as to how much of that do you think is cyclical versus secular, whether it be DOL-related pressures or just
intensifying competition for advisors. And along those same lines whether a 30% margin target is still achievable once
we get to a more favorable rate backdrop.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Let me start with the last one and pick up on just some comments Brian made again. The
decline in margin had been because of declines in transactional revenue. In addition, over the last couple of quarters,
there has been a lot of market volatility and markets have ended down in certain months, and that affects what we make
on asset management. We would hope in a better market environment we would see some improvement in some
aspects of the transactional business because there's a lot of selling of mutual fund products and other products there.
And then again, as I point out, we've got a business here with – I don't know – close to $140 billion in loans and $240
billion – $260 billion-ish of deposits. And as rates move, we're going to start seeing some benefit from that, on which
the payout ratio is quite different than on the more traditional asset management products. So that I really do think is
the revenue story that will affect margins. And again, in the first quarter of this year, we're going to see a $100 million
reduction in expenses because of the runoff of the compensation programs we put in place around the Merrill merger.
So I think that's what I would say about the margin. What was the second part of the question?
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: It was just about to what extent that you could – how you segregate the secular versus
cyclical headwind components on the revenue side? But I think that you adequately addressed that in your response.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: So I think people ought to think about GWIM, the margins come down. We think it's
flooring out here and will start to pick back up partly because of some of the unfundamental changes in the ATP
program running off and stuff. But we've invested in the PMB program. It cost a few hundred million dollars of drag to
do that. That's the right thing to actually build the advisor base over time and service the clients. And the team, if you
look at it underneath, the flows and stuff are strong and the U.S. Trust business is having some of its best quarters ever
just because of the difference that it didn't have the secular runoff you referred to in terms of the fee-based business. So
it's a good business. It does a good job with its clients. We expect more out of it, and that's the job for John and Keith
and Andy and Terry going forward.

<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Thanks, Brian. And maybe just switching over to the Credit side, I appreciate the detailed
disclosure you guys have given on the energy book. I was just hoping you could provide both exposure and reserve
levels, maybe some other areas of the commodities complex, specifically metals and mining.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: We feel good about our metals and mining exposure. It's about $8 billion. But most of that
exposure is much more short-dated and much more collateral. So we feel good about that exposure.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Okay. And then just as a follow-up to the initial provision guidance you've given, I was
thinking about it from a modeling perspective. Is the right way for us to be thinking about the provision rate for 2016,
taking that $800 million to $900 million on quarterly run rate plus whatever additional energy-driven reserve building
we should be contemplating, which presumably is incremental?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: That's not a bad way to think about it. Again, if you remember our guidance from last
quarter, we said $800 million to $900 million for the first two quarters of 2016. And the way I would think about those
two quarters would be, yes, we could see some lumpiness.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I think the one thing overall is that as you look at the question of exposure that we're also
paying close attention to is it a demand or a supply issue for oil prices. And if it's a supply issue that affects these
companies and related companies and demand from. But if it's a demand in the broadest context, the economies
continue to slow down. And that's the broader concern.
So we're looking at not only the impacts on all the portfolios thinking about who gets the benefits on a portfolio basis
from low energy costs which are serious benefits to the consumers and to companies that consume energy versus those
producing it. And so there's a balance here that we've got to think through. Right now it's pretty isolated. The energy
companies and even if you look at consumers who work for them and our basis by zip code and unemployment levels
and stuff, we've seen relatively modest deterioration or none on the Consumer side of people employed in these
businesses.
So I think as you think about it, the real question is going to come down to for 2016 in terms of all our industry is are
we in a demand-driven issue; i.e., a general economic issue or is the United States going to plug along and if it does
then I think Paul's guidance is the right one. If you're in the supply, it's going to all be localized on these industries.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Look, it's not demand. It's again worth emphasizing. There are a lot of people who are
helped by low oil prices that helps our asset quality, not only on the Consumer side but also in places like India and
manufacturers all around the world.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: All right. Got it, guys, very helpful. Thanks for taking my question.

We'll move next to Eric Wasserstrom of Guggenheim.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Thanks very much. I was just wondering if you could help me think through a little bit your
GAAP and risk-weighted assets over the first half of the year given the growth dynamics that are pretty robust and
some of the runoff and then also some of the changes that are going through on the RWA calculations.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: So you're talking about the first half of 2016?
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Correct.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: On a standardized basis, I think you're going to see RWA trend up if we're able to grow
deposits and loans. On an advanced basis, there are all sorts of puts and takes there. I don't think you'll see as much
growth as you would on a standardized basis. Did I say advanced? On an advanced basis, yes, as you would on a
standardized basis as we continue to work on our RWA.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Okay. And so what are the implications of that then for your regulatory capital ratios?

<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: We need to get to from a regulatory – from a CET1 to an advanced basis, so our goal is to
get to 10% plus a buffer by 2019. So we're at 9.8%. I feel like we have the time to do that. We're certainly not going to
need to take all that time. We would expect to get there soon. But it is impacted by changes of rates, changes in LTI.
We're hopefully returning capital. But look, we feel like we're on track to get to 10% plus an appropriate buffer.
The only other thing I would add is we still have some opportunity to optimize RWA from an advanced perspective.
That's in two fundamental areas. There's always stuff you can do in markets and other areas but in two fundamental
areas. One is the extra RWA we've got on the wholesale side when we exited a parallel run, that's not a permanent
thing. We need to work on our models, work with our regulators, and hopefully over time we can make some
improvements there.
The other one is operational risk. We have $500 billion of RWA for operational risk under the advanced approach. That
is 25% more than the next highest bank. And that operational risk is for businesses that we are no longer in. It's for
products we no longer sell. It's for a risk profile that we no longer tolerate. So again that will take time. But that's
another opportunity for us to lower RWA from an advanced perspective.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Thanks. If I can just sneak in one more, when you talk about an appropriate buffer, are you
thinking of Method 1 or Method 2 as a baseline?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: I think it's the buffer to the capital levels?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Yes.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: We're basically thinking the buffer we need to be above the [indiscernible] (01:09:02)
requirements, that 10%, and we'd say 25 to 50 basis points would be where we're at.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Got it, okay. Thanks very much.

We'll move next to the site of Ken Usdin of Jefferies.
<Q - Kenneth Michael Usdin>: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Just a quick follow-up on the loan growth side. I know you
talked about the credit quality underneath the Commercial side, but after a 13%, 14% loan growth year, do you think
you can maintain that type of pace of growth given some of the concerns we've seen underlying even if quality is
holding up? So just I guess your general outlook for loan growth rates and can it match or maintain what you did last
year? Thanks.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Yes, look, I'm not sure we're in the business of giving guidance on loan growth. We think we
can grow. If you're looking for some perspective from us, I wouldn't even call it guidance – mid-single-digit is what we
would hope we can accomplish.
<Q - Kenneth Michael Usdin>: Okay. Continue to be driven by Commercial, would you say?
[0FP9LX-E Paul Donofrio]>: I think it's going to be – continue to be driven by Commercial but you're going to see
growth in Consumer as well.
<Q - Kenneth Michael Usdin>: Yep. Just a quick second one. You've been growing the mortgage business again.
What's your outlook for continuing to take share in the mortgage business? And have we seen the bottoming of results
on the fee side of mortgage?
[0FP9LX-E Paul Donofrio]>: Well, in our mortgage business, I think we are focused on originating prime and sort of
nonconforming loans. I would – there's been good progress there, I think, if you look over the last year. The number of
nonconforming loans that we are originating has increased meaningfully. And I would remind everybody that those
loans we book on our balance sheet. So that's MBIA when you're booking – when you're selling less loans so it going

to affect your MBIA income, but it's going to come through the NIM on a more annualized basis.
<Q - Kenneth Michael Usdin>: Absolutely.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: So from a broader – we decide the fees because of the geography and how accounting works
when you put – I think we put 67% of loans on balance sheet. In terms of overall production, we expect to continue to
make progress because – and you can see that in the numbers that we're going to – as other people are flattening out,
we continue to have lots of opportunity with our core customers. Seven out of 10 still get a – that are credit-worthy in
our customer base are still getting a mortgage elsewhere and that's what the team is chipping away at. And it's never
going to be the hugest business at Bank of America compared to the things like the Merrill Lynch business in
Consumer or the Credit Card business in Consumer but we expect to get broader market share from each of the
segments.
<Q - Kenneth Michael Usdin>: Got it.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I think it's interesting. I'm not going to sit here and tell you it's directly 100% correlated
and we're done all the work, but we've added sales professionals in our branches that are focused on originating
mortgages that are more prime oriented. We've got them working with our GWIM specialists. That client group is
generally more prime oriented. And we see progress. We see the prime loans growing.
<Q - Kenneth Michael Usdin>: Great. Thanks, guys.

We'll move next to Brian Foran of Autonomous Research.
<Q - Brian D. Foran>: Hi. Good morning. I guess on Commercial, if you could follow-up on the ex-energy
comments. In your experience, what are some of the best leading indicators for the Commercial credit cycle? And what
kind of trends have you seen again at energy in those leading indicators over the past couple months that gives you
confidence that things are stable?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Well, I'd have to think about that. We spend a lot of time – our Credit people do spend a lot
of time just combing through that portfolio and looking at cash flows from the companies and making sure we
understand the collateral, making sure we fully understand our structures. So I think it's just a lot of blocking and
tackling and talking to clients and making sure we understand what's going on with their businesses in terms of the
energy portfolio. I would emphasize again that outside of the energy portfolio, we are not seeing movement in NPL and
criticized assets. Our NPLs continue to come down.
<Q - Brian D. Foran>: And then if I can ask a follow-up along the same lines on the Consumer side, I guess two parts.
One, you made the point that even in energy-heavy geographies you're not seeing any adverse change in the consumer.
In Cards specifically, just since it's such a big credit line, are early delinquencies stilling coming in better than expected
or are they stable? Or how would you characterize the current early delinquency trends? And then on home equity,
since again that's another big outsized portion of the reserve, is there any update you can give us on how the first wave
of HELOC recasts or switching standardization schedules have performed versus what you had modeled.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Sure. So in terms of Card, we – when we look at our credit losses, they are at low points,
historic low points. And they've been bumping around at that level. We've seen a little bit of increase the last couple of
quarters. But that again I think is just a reflection of things just bumping around at really low levels? In terms of the
home equity end of draw, based on the volume we've seen to date which we have seen a lot of volume, the portfolio is
performing, you know, in line with our expectations, and we continue to monitor the end of draw portfolio and continue
to work with our customers to manage the risks. And I just would remind everybody that these borrowers have paid
through the downturn, and this portfolio continues to improve as home prices improve. The risk is an ongoing part of
our reserve process, and we think we're well reserved

<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Just on Card and close to 30 days delinquency or 90 days, they came down during the
quarters of fourth, you know, end of 2014 all the way through 2015 and in both cases is running at multiple-year lows
in both percentage-wise and nominal amounts. So we're seeing no deterioration of credit and we it feel was the same
with the home equities. It's just that home equities just have a little more cleanup because of the Legacy portfolio in
there.

We'll move next to Brennan Hawken of UBS. Your line is open.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Brennan?
Operator
And pardon the interruption. We lost Mr. Hawken. If you would please repress star one. Please repress star one. We'll
move next to Mike Mayo of CLSA. Go ahead, please.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: Hi. I have one question for Paul, one for Brian. Paul, lower energy prices you said can help certain
segments such as Consumers. Can you give any examples of that? And also on the energy topic, if oil stays at $30, then
your provisions for energy would go up by how much? I didn't understand the answer from before.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Oil – well, let me take the last one first. So we've got a reserve on our energy portfolio of
$500 million. That is 6% of those two subsectors that we think are high risk. And we have done modeling, stress test
modeling at various oil prices. The one we've been talking about on this call has been at $30, and that's over nine
quarters. And so if oil stayed at $30 for nine quarters, we would think that our losses over those nine quarters would be
$700 million. Again, that would go against the $500 million we already have reserved, and one would presume we'd be
building reserves during that time period to make up the difference.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: So, Mike, when you look at Consumer benefits from the oil and gas, just to give you a
simple thing, if you look at our card base in the fourth quarter of 2015, the spending on debit and credit cards rose 4%
from the fourth quarter of 2014. And if gas prices would have been stable, it would have grown at 5.7%. And so what
that means is consumers had effectively on that base 1.7% that they received a benefit of – and year-over-year. If you
translate that to dollars, round numbers that's $20 million a day less spending on gasoline by our consumers and our
portfolios per day. And from like $90 million down to $70-ish million or something like that. That is the benefit they
get. And so for a large number of consumers, median income, the cash flow increases. And that gives them more
money to spend.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: So do you think people are being too negative on the decline in oil prices? You're implying it has a
nice stimulative effect, but people sure aren't thinking that these days.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I think, Mike, it comes down to a question of whether you think this is a -oil prices are a
reflection of a broader issue of growth in the economies or we're going to get slow growth, 2.5% in the U.S. and
whatever IMF says, I guess 3.5% in the world. If you're going to get that in 2016, it's going to be isolated. The negative
is going to be isolated to the oil companies and maybe the commodity producers just because of a slow growth
environment. If you're saying it's going to be a much different economic scenario than most – than sort of so-called
consensus predicts, it's a broader-based problem. But right now it's really an oversupply of oil driving prices down and
that's impacting the people in the industry and the rest of the consumers that's – I mean, corporate customers and
consumers that use oil and energy are getting a good benefit.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: And again, Mike, the only thing I would say is – I mean, Brian's spot on, if it's a demand
issue, it's going to – we're going to see it in other parts of the economy. However, we have not seen that yet. We have
not seen a change in our asset quality outside of energy.

<Q - Mike Mayo>: And if I can shift gears, Brian. I know I've asked this question in other years, but I know you're not
satisfied with the mid-60%s core efficiency ratio and I know you're not satisfied with a single digit ROE. So what is
your specific financial target for efficiency in ROE and what is your timeframe to get there?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: As we said, we ran about 9%, adjusting for everything about 9.5% for the year and a return
of tangible common equity. We want to – we believe we have a path to get that to 12%. Rates get us part of it and hard
work on expenses and core revenue growth and driving gets us the rest of it. And so – and LAS expense drop. And
we're chipping away at that. If you look from 2014 to 2015, we made substantial steps and we'll continue to drive away.
But we haven't put a specific timeframe on it. It's just a goal to keep driving and we'll drive beyond that. On efficiency,
it follows that. The efficiency, it follows that sort of math, right now we're operating 66%, 67%. 67% probably
normalized for 2015 and between LAS we can drop that down to 65% and then it's just hard work and we're grinding
away at it every day. You're seeing loans grow, you're seeing the bottoms grow and so you should see an improvement
in 2016.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: Any expense initiative plan, Paul, since you've had a couple quarters now to take a look at that?
Are you looking for like an extra billion, or kind of like a new BAC program, or what are you thinking about there?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Expenses are on our mind every day at Bank of America. We have everybody focused on
expense discipline. That's translating to our culture under our Simplify and Improve program where the teams are
always coming up with ideas to make it simpler for our customers, make it simpler for our employees and improve the
expenses of the company. That's how we're going to achieve our objectives around core expenses that we've talked
about on this call. We're all very focused on expenses.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: All right, thank you.
