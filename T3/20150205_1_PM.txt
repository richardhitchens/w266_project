various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements.
It's now my pleasure to introduce André Calantzopoulos, our Chief Executive Officer. Jacek Olczak, our Chief
Financial Officer, will join André for the question and answer period. André?
André Calantzopoulos
Thank you Nick, and welcome ladies and gentlemen. We anticipated that 2014 would be a particularly difficult and
complex year for PMI and had in fact characterized it as an investment year. We aimed to address specific challenges
in key markets such as Italy, Japan and the Philippines, while also investing behind a number of strategic initiatives
including the pilot launches of iQOS, the roll-out of the Marlboro 2.0 Architecture and the optimization of our global
manufacturing footprint. In addition, we faced an operating environment of continued macro-economic weakness and
unprecedented currency headwinds.
Within this context, I am very pleased to announce that we delivered a solid currency-neutral performance in 2014,
achieving adjusted diluted EPS growth of 7.8%. This result exceeded the 6.5% to 7.5% guidance that we provided last
November, due mainly to better-than-expected performances in the European Union and EEMA Regions. In addition,
we made very substantial progress in addressing our specific key market challenges and successfully executed on our
strategic initiatives.
As anticipated, our fourth-quarter results came in below our exceptionally strong performance in the fourth quarter of
2013. In addition to this challenging comparison, the pattern of our expenses and the timing of key investments in 2014
were skewed towards the final quarter.
Our organic cigarette volume declined by 3.8% for the quarter, due to lower total cigarette industry volumes and
inventory movements in the Asia and EEMA Regions, partly offset by market share gains in the EU and EEMA
Regions. Excluding the adverse impact of inventory movements, volume for the quarter declined by approximately 2%.
Net revenues increased by 1.1%, excluding currency and acquisitions, with favorable pricing across all Regions that
more than offset unfavorable volume mix due principally to the Asia Region. Adjusted OCI declined by 10.6% on the
same basis, due mainly to the aforementioned pattern of expenses and timing of investments.
Fourth-quarter adjusted diluted EPS, excluding currency, of $1.31 decreased by 4.4%, compared to a 19.4% increase,
on the same basis, in the fourth quarter of 2013.
Despite a historically high adverse currency headwind, we enter 2015 with strong business fundamentals and,
accordingly, remain optimistic regarding our business prospects going forward. Consequently, this year we are
targeting currency-neutral annual growth, excluding acquisitions, of 4% to 6% for net revenues and 6% to 8% for
adjusted OCI.
Our reported diluted EPS guidance for 2015, at prevailing exchange rates, is in a range of $4.27 to $4.37, versus $4.76
in 2014, and includes an unfavorable currency impact of approximately $1.15. This guidance represents a growth rate,
excluding currency, of approximately 8% to 10%, compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $5.02 in 2014.
As I will explain later, our 2015 guidance includes incremental spending versus 2014 for the deployment of iQOS and
does not include any share repurchases.
The $1.15 of unfavorable currency, at prevailing exchange rates, included in our 2015 guidance, is driven primarily by
the Russian ruble, the euro, the Japanese yen and the Indonesian rupiah. These four currencies account for
approximately 42%, 13%, 11% and 5%, respectively, or over 70% collectively, of the total unfavorable currency
variance.
We have currently hedged approximately 60% of our 2015 forecast sales to Japan, which, at prevailing exchange rates,
translates to an effective rate of ¥110 to the U.S. dollar.

Let me now discuss our progress in some of our Regions and key markets, beginning with the marked improvement in
the EU Region.
Total cigarette industry volume was down by 2.4% in the fourth quarter, bringing the full-year decline to 3.1%. This
represents a significant moderation versus the 7.4% decline in 2013, which we attribute to the subdued performance of
the e-vapor category, less out-switching to fine cut products, a reduction in illicit trade in several markets and
lower-than-historical average pricing, mainly in Italy. For 2015, we forecast a decline in cigarette industry volume of
approximately 4%.
Our 2014 market share performance in the EU Region was impressive, with a gain of 1 percentage point to 39.9% in
the fourth quarter and 1 point to 39.8% for the full year. This result reflects share growth in all six of the Region's
largest markets by cigarette industry volume, most notably in Italy and Poland.
In fact, our share gains in conjunction with the moderating industry volume decline resulted in essentially stable PMI
cigarette volume in the EU Region last year. This is a remarkable achievement and, by far, the Region's best cigarette
volume performance since the spin.
Marlboro, L&M and Chesterfield were the primary drivers of our share performance in the EU Region. As of 2014,
they represented the top three cigarette industry brands in the Region by volume. For the year, Marlboro share grew by
0.3 points to 19.3%, L&M by 0.2 points to 7.1% and Chesterfield by 1.1 points to 5.5%. The performances of Marlboro
in France and Spain, L&M in Germany, and Chesterfield in Italy and Poland were of particular note.
For 2015, we expect the EU Region to return to low single-digit adjusted OCI growth, excluding currency and
acquisition. The excise tax environment remains rational. Our leading brand portfolio positions us well for further share
gains, driven by the continued roll-out of the Marlboro 2.0 Architecture. In addition pricing is expected to be stronger
than in 2014, in part due to recently increased cigarette prices in key markets such as Italy, Poland and Spain.
Let me briefly discuss the U.K. Government's recent announcement that it intends to proceed with the introduction of
plain packaging. We believe this decision is ill-advised and is not based on scientific evidence. While we maintain an
ongoing dialogue with regulators and hope that reason will ultimately prevail, we are prepared to pursue other
alternatives, including litigation, to ensure the protection of our intellectual property.
Before closing on the EU Region I would like to touch briefly on Italy, where the long-awaited tax reform was
implemented last month. As shown on this slide, it includes a shift to a more specific structure and a higher minimum
total tax, both important steps in the right direction. The reform also covered Reduced-Risk Products, with Marlboro
HeatSticks now subject to a lower excise tax rate compared to cigarette.
We enter the year with favorable share momentum, driven by the strong performance of Chesterfield. And in
mid-January we increased our cigarette prices by €0.20 per pack across our portfolio.
I will now discuss selected markets from our Asia Region, beginning with Japan. Our strategy to stabilize market share
last year was successful. Key drivers were the launch of our Be Marlboro marketing campaign, the introduction of
Marlboro Clear Hybrid, and the strengthening of the Lark brand family through morphing and new launches. We plan
to maintain our focus on these two key brands in 2005 (sic) [2015] (10:58) through a robust innovation pipeline, as
highlighted by the recent launch of Marlboro Fusion Blast, a menthol cigarette with two different capsules that provide
novel taste sensations. And of course Japan was the first market to introduce iQOS, with its pilot launch in Nagoya last
November. We plan to expand nationally in 2015.
Industry volume in Japan declined by 3.4% in 2014, consistent with projected 3.0% to 3.5% decline range. For 2015 we
forecast that the decline will moderate to a range of 2.5% to 3.0%.
In Indonesia industry volume was up by 1.9% in 2014 to 314 billion units. This growth was driven by a 7.5% increase
in the machine-made kretek segment, which now accounts for approximately 74% of the total market, partially offset
by a 13.1% decline in the hand-rolled kretek segment.

Our market share grew over the course of 2014 and reached 35.3% in the fourth quarter. This sequential improvement
was driven by a strong performance in the machine-made kretek segment, due mainly to Dji Sam Soe Magnum and the
successful launch of Dji Sam Soe Magnum Blue in April of 2014. We now hold approximately 30% share of this
growing segment, led by our flagship brand Sampoerna A.
There has been a significant moderation in the volume decline of our hand-rolled products, as competitive brands have
followed Dji Sam Soe above the important IDR 1,000 per stick price point. As hand-rolled products face a significantly
lower excise tax increase in 2015 than machine-made products, this bodes well for the segment where we are the
market leader.
We forecast cigarette industry volume growth in 2015 of up to 2%, although the market will remain sensitive to fuel
and commodity price.
While the Philippines continued to be a challenge and a drain on our 2014 income performance, we have recently
witnessed significant positive price movements at the lower end of the market. After we raised the recommended stick
price of Jackpot from PHP 1.25 to PHP 1.50 in October, our main competitor increased the recommended stick prices
of its brands by PHP 0.25 in December and further increases have occurred since then. This has reduced the stick price
gap to Marlboro from PHP 1.75 in January 2014 to between PHP 1 and PHP 1.25 currently.
We believe that the introduction of tax stamps will further improve the competitive environment in a market where
cigarette consumption remained resilient last year at around 100 billion units. These developments augur well for
profitability to improve over the mid-term, and we remain bullish on the prospects for this market.
I will finish my discussion of the Asia Region with a brief update on Korea. The 120% increase in total tobacco excise
taxes effective January 1 will be disruptive given its impact on the average retail selling price. To pass the tax on we
increased the retail price per pack for both Marlboro and Parliament by KRW 1,800, or approximately 67%, to KRW
4,500.
For 2015 we forecast a decline in the underlying cigarette industry volume of approximately 20% to 25%. From an
income perspective however the tax increase should not have a material impact on our business performance this year,
due to a gain from inventories that we were able to build prior to the tax change.
Let me now turn to Russia, where we performed exceptionally well in 2014. Market share reached 27.1%, up by one
full share point versus prior year. Our share growth was driven by the strong performance of above-premium
Parliament, mid-price L&M and low-price Bond Street, which positions us well for further expansion in 2015.
Cigarette industry volume decreased by 9.2% in 2014, in line with our forecast of 9% to 10%. The decline was due
primarily to significant excise tax-driven retail price increases, which averaged around 22% for PMI. These price
increases helped us boost our unit margins and total profitability in the market, despite a 3.5% lower volume.
For 2015 we forecast a decline in total cigarette industry volume of 8% to 10%, due to excise tax-driven price increases
and a deteriorating macro-economic environment.
Moving on to our brand portfolio Marlboro was a key driver of our continued global market share momentum in 2014,
with growth of 0.3 points in both the EU and EEMA regions. The brand's performance was particularly strong during
the fourth quarter, with share growth in all four regions, providing positive momentum heading into 2015.
Marlboro's share growth was driven by the successful initial roll-out of Architecture 2.0 in 26 markets, starting in the
EU region, and the expansion of the Be Marlboro marketing campaign to additional markets.
Beyond Marlboro we were very pleased by the strong 2014 performances of our other key international brands, which
demonstrate that our investments behind them are clearly paying off.
Of particular note was the continued robust growth of above-premium Parliament, with cigarette volume up by 5.6%
versus 2013 and notable share gains in Russia and Turkey.

Chesterfield had an exceptional year, with cigarette volume growth of 22.6%. In addition to its success in the EU
Region, which I covered earlier, the brand grew cigarette volume in all other Regions.
L&M was also a success in 2014, with cigarette volume essentially stable or growing in three of our four Regions and
notable share gains in Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
The unparalleled strength of our brand portfolio provides us with significant pricing power. 2014 was another robust
year on this front, with a total pricing variance of $1.9 billion. This is in line with our historical annual average and was
driven by the EEMA and Latin America and Canada Regions.
For 2015, we foresee our pricing variance remaining broadly in line with that of last year. Please note that, as of today,
we have implemented or announced approximately 70% of the pricing that is included in our 2015 EPS guidance.
We continue to focus vigorously on our cost base and in 2014 exceeded our gross productivity and cost saving target of
$300 million, with significant savings related to specification rationalization and procurement.
In 2015, we anticipate that our productivity and cost savings programs, combined with savings associated with the
manufacturing footprint initiatives that we implemented in 2014, should result in a total company cost base increase,
excluding RRPs and currency, of approximately 1%.
Turning now to our RRP portfolio, 2014 opened a groundbreaking new chapter in the history of our company with the
commercialization of iQOS in Nagoya, Japan, and Milan, Italy. As a reminder, neither pilot launch is being made with
any health claims. The marketing focus is on innovation and product benefits, such as no ash and less smell.
Although it is still too early for a comprehensive quantitative assessment, I am very pleased to share with you that both
adult smoker and trade response is very positive and that the performance of iQOS is in line with, or exceeds, key
indicators that we established. We should be in a better position to provide data around the middle of this year.
In Nagoya, total iQOS device sales are well-ahead of projections and growing steadily every week. Sales of HeatSticks
are also growing sequentially, but quite naturally do not yet reflect high rates of full conversion. However, as critical
mass and product normalization build up over time, we would expect these rates to be in line with our 2013 whole offer
test results.
Based on our latest estimates, iQOS awareness amongst adult smokers has reached approximately 34% and adult
smoker profiles are on target. Furthermore, the iQOS flagship store concept is a success, our logistics chain is working
well and product defect and return rates are much lower than we had anticipated.
In Milan, where the selling channel is limited by design to a subset of the tobacconist universe and consumer
communication is severely restricted, iQOS device penetration has, as expected, lagged that of Nagoya. However,
HeatSticks sales reflect a higher full conversion rate, consistent with the characteristics of the market. Based on our
latest estimates, iQOS awareness amongst adult smokers has reached approximately 16%. Other indicators are in line
with Nagoya.
In both markets, Marlboro HeatSticks are subject to a lower excise tax rate than cigarettes.
Given the positive initial performance of iQOS, we are confirming our plans to commence national expansion in Japan
and Italy, as well as pilot or national launches in additional markets, later this year. These launches will be supported
by a new release of iQOS that incorporates feedback from the pilot market and features a variety of colors and textures
to broaden the product's appeal amongst adult smokers.
Our 2015 guidance includes incremental spending versus 2014 for the deployment of iQOS, which is skewed towards
the second half of the year.
We continued to reward our shareholders generously in 2014, despite a significant currency headwind that adversely
impacted our free cash flow by $1.6 billion.

Last September, our Board of Directors approved an increase of our dividend by a further 6.4% to $4.00 per share on
an annualized basis. This represents an increase of approximately 117% since the spin-off in 2008 and equates to a
dividend yield of 5.0% based on last Friday's closing share price.
In 2014, we paid $6.0 billion in total dividends to our shareholders and spent a further $3.8 billion to repurchase 45.2
million shares.
We are currently operating in a debt level corridor that is close to the maximum that would still allow us to maintain
our single-A credit rating. We remain committed to returning around 100% of our free cash flow to our shareholders
and are taking appropriate measures to further reduce our working capital and keep capital expenditures flat despite the
expansion of RRPs.
At prevailing exchange rates, the adverse currency impact on our 2015 net earnings would be approximately $1.7
billion, which consequently will impact free cash flow. Furthermore, the currency environment remains extremely
volatile. In this context, we are focused on managing our cash flow prudently and maintaining financial flexibility for
business development opportunities.
Consequently, we do not currently envisage any share repurchases in 2015 and this is reflected in our guidance.
However, we will revisit the potential for such purchases as the year unfolds, depending on the currency environment.
In conclusion, we enter 2015 with confidence in our business outlook. We delivered a solid currency-neutral
performance in 2014, with adjusted diluted EPS growth above our guidance, and successfully executed on a number of
our key strategic initiatives that will generate attractive returns in the years to come. We also made substantial progress
in addressing market-specific challenges.
Our business is supported by strong fundamentals and positive momentum. Our leading brand portfolio is driving
continued robust pricing and market share gains, while our vigorous focus on our cost base, notably through the
optimization of our manufacturing footprint, is enhancing operational efficiency.
These strong fundamentals are enhanced by our investment behind Reduced-Risk Products. We are excited by the
prospects for iQOS and are pleased by its performance thus far.
For 2015, we are targeting currency-neutral annual growth, excluding acquisitions, of 4% to 6% for net revenues and
6% to 8% for adjusted OCI. We are further targeting growth in adjusted diluted EPS of 8% to 10%, excluding currency.
These targets are a clear reflection of the strong confidence that we have in both our business and the outlook for the
year, particularly given our incremental spending behind the deployment of iQOS.
Thank you. Jacek and I will now be happy to answer your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We will now conduct the question-and-answer portion of the conference. [Operator Instructions] Our first
question comes from Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Hi. Good afternoon.
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: Hi, Matt.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Hi, thanks. Just two questions. One, I wanted to ask a bit more about Japan to better
understand the inventory reduction there? Is that a function of how retailers are temporarily managing levels across
manufacturers and consequently is that a timing issue that could reverse next year or was that just a lag result of some
of the share losses you've seen over 2013 and earlier this year?

<A - André Calantzopoulos>: Okay. To put this inventory movement in context, we should all remember that we had
to close Bergen op Zoom during last year. And this is an $80 billion plus cigarette factory and consequently we had to
prepare for the closure and also move production to a number of other factories. We had to build, in the particular case
of Japan, some safety stocks but not only in the case of Japan during the year. And, some of these inventories had to
carry through the yearend and will come back in 2015.
For the particular case of Japan; however, the objective for the year was to adjust inventory levels to both the market
decline in 2014 and anticipated for 2015, and in addition to that, to our lower market share. Okay? And the vast
majority, clearly, of these adjustments as we right-sized will not come back. And as I said because of maintaining some
safety during the year, we had to do this adjustment in the last quarter. So that's basically the whole story.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay. If we're trying to put that into context I think many investors will look at the flat
adjusted operating profit performance this year and the expected acceleration back to 6% to 8% next year and view that
as a fairly high hurdle. If we're trying to look at some of the moving pieces that'll shift from year-to-year those
inventory reductions in Japan over the course of the year that you sort of purposely course-corrected on, how much of a
drag was that on this year's full-year adjusted – total company adjusted operating profit?
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: I think the inventories in the last quarter – I can't quantify or exactly, you appreciate but
probably one point?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: About the one point in the last quarter, it's Jacek here.
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: You see on an adjusted basis what was our volume development in the fourth quarter. I
mean we had it, Andre had it in the André in the remarks, so yes, there was drag clearly coming from this rescheduling
of the supply chain and the subsequent inventory.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay. That's helpful.
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: The key positives for the year clearly is the improvement in the Philippines. I think that
was big, I think, issue we had in 2014. I think we stabilized, in any case, the share in Japan. That was an even bigger
drag on the inventories. I think the business in Europe is doing fine. So we think the issues we had announced we need
to fix in 2014 and we've just been behind that. I think we can look with optimism into 2015 and that clearly explains
the swing we have in terms of OCI growth.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay. Thanks, André. And just, Jacek, perhaps with respect to the dividend, I know this
is a hypothetical question and you may just prefer not to address it, but the payout ratio is obviously extremely high
right now. Are there any guidelines you can provide on how you or the board would react if currency headwinds push
the payout ratio even higher on a reported basis? And would the goal under those circumstances be to sustain some
level of ongoing dividend growth even if it was only modest, if you had let's say a 100% payout ratio?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: I can answer that question but I think André would be even more enthusiastic about answering
those questions.
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: We all understand there is huge currency volatility in 2015. And we have to be a bit
cautious. And clearly dividend is a board prerogative, as you know very well. But I understand where your question
points to or points at. And I see no scenario under which we reduce the dividend in 2015. Okay? Even if we have to
temporarily stay at a very high payout ratio.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay. Okay. Thank you both.

<Q - James Bushnell>: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just to follow up a little bit on the last
point. So you mentioned that the stock reduction in Japan took points off OCI growth in Q4. I'm thinking about Asia,
because that's clearly where you had the most weakness in the quarter. I wonder if you could give us a feeling of the
moving parts there? So was Australia the biggest drag on your profits? And I know there are some other things like the
Philippines and you had some investments, so I just wondered if you'd help us think through what the big drags are
there, and then – that would help in terms of modeling going forward. Thanks.
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: Well, I think you mentioned them. Clearly Australia was a big drag compared to 2013.
And we had Japan overall, as we said at the beginning of the year, because we expect a lower share and some of the
inventory adjustment, clearly Japan would be another drag.
Now we have stabilized our share and quarter-to-quarter clearly Japan on an underlying business basis is rather stable.
But we had to make the timing of this inventory adjustment as I explained previously, because we had to maintain
certain safety stocks until the whole situation of the Bergen op Zoom closure is resolved.
So I would say it's Australia and clearly partially the Philippines. Don't forget that in the Philippines we increased
prices ahead of our main competitor there. Plus during the year we had to absorb partially excise tax.
Now the good news about the Philippines is that we had the price movement at the bottom of the market. The prices per
stick now of virtually any brand that comes [ph] at our PHP 2 (33:10) or above, our price gaps are reducing. So the
Philippines definitely are not going to be of any negativity. And if any, they will turn positive this year. And I think
that's an excellent development. Of course we have to watch the situation pretty carefully, but so far so good. I mean I
feel much better now that I felt six months ago and three months ago, I can tell you.
<Q - James Bushnell>: Okay. Thank you. And I wonder if you could comment also on the – how you see the outlook
in Australia this year please?
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: Look, it is early days. First of all in Australia the market decline is 10.6%. But if we
correct for inventory movements 2013 to 2014 the underlying is roughly [ph] 4.6% (34:05). And as we know this is
entirely driven by the excise-driven price increases that are pretty substantial in Australia.
I think we know about the issues in Australia, is the growth of the low-price, the discount segment, and some
comparative activities. So we said that we have to put in place a strategy to stem the growth. And I think our pricing
strategy that is currently in place is bringing results.
We see a slight deceleration of the deep discount segment. Part of this is technical, part of this is real. But I would not
say yet that we can declare that the deep discount segment has stabilized. But sequentially looks like it doesn't grow
anymore at the pace it used to be.
We also see some positive price movement at the bottom end of the market. That's good news. This needs to be
confirmed, because if there is price movement, it's good, but we have to see how much of that is discounted back. If
that sticks this is also a positive development.
Overall our estimate is that it's unlikely that Australia will contribute positively to our OCI growth this year. But
definitely we don't anticipate this to be the kind of [ph] margin driver (35:42) that we had in 2014. Okay? So it's early
days. We'll see how the next three, four months unfold. I don't know if I answered your question.
<Q - James Bushnell>: Okay. No that was great. Thank you very much.

<A - Jacek Olczak>: Hi.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: So maybe first on FX. I guess just maybe given really the heightened level of FX volatility, can
you talk about if there are any plans to perhaps better align your revenue and cost structure in some of your key markets
like Russia, Japan, and even your exposure to Swiss francs?
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: Look, I think we look at our cost structures constantly, and we're focused on improving
productivity and efficiency. And I think the indication we gave that total costs excluding RRPs are going to grow by no
more than 1%, it's a clear sign that we are very focused on these items.
Now every market is particular, and Jacek will elaborate a bit more on this. But as a matter of principle in many
markets we have costs that are in local currency. But we also have costs that are in euros or in dollars like tobacco leaf
and certain materials. And clearly rebalancing that cost structure is a bit more difficult.
But today I would say that in the vast majority of the markets, even in Russia we are not dollarized in terms of the cost
basis we have and agreements we have with third-parties, other than the materials I explained. So we see a reduction in
the cost base as well as currencies devalued.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: You're absolutely right. Judy, one thing which maybe will help looking at the [ph] thing, (37:57)
an $0.80 EPS negative variance is the currency net in 2014. The transaction impact, negative transaction impact is just
in the range of a 10% of this total amount. So most of the impact, which we are incurring, is coming from translations.
And to André's point, if I take the largest individual markets on net profitability per market, we take Indonesia and
Russia and have a local cost is in the range 65% to 75%. I'm talking total cost, so this is COGS and an all discretionary
marketing, overheads, et cetera, spend. So we have obviously the quite significant portion of the natural hedges for the
cost structures already built in, but as I said earlier, again the impact on us is mainly coming from a translation.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay. That's helpful. And then just maybe looking at Russia and with the industry volumes
down 9.2% in 2014, your volume actually did a lot better down 3.5%. I think you're commenting on 2015 industry
being down in the 8% to 10% range. So, my first question related to that is your confidence in keeping your volume
decline much more modest versus the industry and obviously that implies continued market share in that market. And
then secondly, given that the tax increases in 2015 in Russia is more modest, do you think that 8% to 10% volume
decline is more representative, just of the macro pressures that you're experiencing in that market and unrelated to that,
just a comment on how you're seeing sort of the pricing in that market and the consumer's ability to absorb cigarette
price increases in a pretty inflationary market?
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: Okay. We had a very, very good year in Russia in 2014 and I believe the portfolio
fundamentals were, plus the initiative should, maintain a share growth momentum. Now, whether this can fully
compensate volume or not, this remains to be seen, okay?
The second important thing in Russia is a question of pricing. We had about 22% pricing in 2014 and November and
December price increases were up roughly 13%, way above average, on our portfolio which of course we carry forward
almost entirely in 2015.
You appreciate, I cannot comment about further price increases for the year, but, the situation in Russia we all watch it
very closely. Clearly a combination of the sanctions in oil have an impact on the economy. We start seeing inflation
and what we the unknown is for the year and this is not only particular to Philip Morris, is what would happen with real
incomes and salary. So, as you know, we take pricing decisions trying to balance always consumer affordability, price
gaps, illicit trade and clearly margin improvement and we'll always pursue the opportunity within that equation.
Russia is, because of the macroeconomic environment, we have to assume that we will have a similar decline in 2015
that we had in 2014 despite, as you rightly pointed out, a lower excise tax. Okay? So, how this will unfold, I don't
know. I would be the happiest man on earth if the decline is lower than what we foresee.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Got it. Okay. Thank you both.

Our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Hi, André.
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: Hi.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Hi. I was hoping you could drill down a little further on the consumer behavior surrounding
iQOS in your two test markets? For instance, could you give us a better sense of dual usage, repeat purchase for
example and then cannibalization rates may be on Marlboro combustible or possibly any of your other brands? And
then I'd also like to hear from you, what was the biggest positive surprise and the biggest negative surprise from your
two tests?
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: Okay. A lot of questions here. Bonnie, first of all, I think overall we are obviously
positively surprised by the performance we had. You appreciate I cannot disclose precise numbers for competitive
reasons, but clearly our device, our iQOS device sales were well ahead of what we had initially projected. And we're
talking the thousands of units; we're not talking small quantities. And they continue every week at the pace of 3% to
4%, so this is not bad at all.
Regarding conversion rates, it is a bit premature to measure this because as we are building a consumer base, it takes
time to make the assessment and it takes time for people to fully convert. The numbers we see in terms clearly of
offtake or repeat purchase, and mind you some of the consumers bought cartons at the beginning, so it's difficult to
judge daily purchases of packs, we see that the rate of full conversion is clearly lagging behind the amount of units we
sold, but that's natural and we expect it. Okay?
We also need to understand the situation in Japan that people still have the ability to smoke combustible products in
very many venues. So that's natural that initially they use iQOS in situations like in their houses or in the office where
they can't use combustible products and slowly and slowly, they will eventually convert more and more.
So I don't have yet a sufficient database to know exactly what the full conversion versus occasional are. We'll have a
better reading in a couple of months, but all I'm saying is that the progress is pretty good and steady. Okay? And we
should not be totally impatient and think that everybody will convert in day one. Even the people I know around, they
took some time to convert.
And the awareness of the product is right. I think the consumer profile is on target and as I said also in my remarks, we
are testing our supply chain. Return rates are much lower than we thought; although people have the option to return
the products if they are not happy. And we are learning also a lot in terms of marketing so that we can adjust our
programs when we go national. So overall it's a pretty good experience.
As expected, and I said in my remarks, in Milano because of less marketing freedoms and more difficult – hence higher
difficulty to create awareness, we are a bit behind Nagoya in terms of absolute amount of iQOS units sold, still in the
thousands, but we have an apparently higher full conversion rate also because there are much more restrictions in Italy.
One particularity of Italy is that there is an initial, I would say, reluctance for people who have tried the electronic
cigarettes to try iQOS because they had a bad experience with electronic cigarettes, but the ones who finally try and
buy, they are more committed because they see the difference. But this is more qualitative and anecdotal at this stage
than quantitative. So again, good progress. We decided to go national and in two months, we'll have something that is
really quantifiable, then, of course, we will communicate this to you.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Okay, that's really helpful. Then I just have a question or I guess probably a two-part
question on your margins. First, your margins in the fourth quarter deteriorated quite a bit, so could you drill down on
the key drivers of this? And then in terms of 2015, you mentioned your costs ex-RRP will increase 1%. So just trying to
understand what you're hoping to achieve or accomplish with these higher costs and investments. Clearly, you're
making strategic investments in your business. So how should we think about this in terms of the potential for
accelerated growth in the future?

<A - André Calantzopoulos>: Okay, I'm referring here – the 1% refers to the entire base. We should not forget that
we have the benefit also this year of the manufacturing footprint improvement of last year. We also benefit from
moderating leaf prices. That will continue into the future and clove prices also, that has been a big cost item in 2012
and 2013, are also kind of stabilizing as we had good crops. So from a manufacturing perspective, clearly, we are on
the low end of the costs.
For the rest of the business, we pursue also efficiency improvement programs, but we never stop the investments that
will grow the business further. And for this year, clearly, we have some exciting programs on all the brands. We
continue with the deployment of 2.0 Marlboro. We started with Red, we continue with Marlboro Gold and the other
variants of the brand. So that continues investment and we also essentially revamped and created new marketing
campaigns for all the other key brands in the portfolio that we're also deploying and investing behind them, but as I said
in my remarks, clearly, that pays dividends. So be reassured that we don't stop investing behind the growth of the
business and I think our market share performance has demonstrated that that was the right thing to do.
For the rest, as we said and I said in previous interventions, our long-term objective is to always contain costs between
1% to 3% ex-RRPs and depending on leaf prices, I think we can even, at least for the next two years, remain at the
lower end of this range. So I think we're pretty happy about that. And just to clarify also on RRPs, there is incremental
investment this year compared to last year's incremental investment and the variance is slightly above the range we had
last year or the amount we had last year. So it's about 1 EPS point, just the increment.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: All right. Thank you. That was helpful. Appreciate it.

Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi. Good afternoon.
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: Yes.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi. I just had two question for you, if I could, please. The first one I'm just curious by,
Andre, your view on – you talked a lot throughout 2014 a definite macroeconomic effect on the business. It would
seem like that environment generally is still in place in 2015. I guess related to that, I'm just curious if you could give a
general outlook for volume and also just curious if you're seeing any mix degradation across the business, any
tradedown broadly that is rather than market by market, if that's having an effect on the business in 2015?
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: Okay. It's difficult obviously to appreciate to predict total industry volume this year. I
would see it, and I will explain some of the caveats, in the 2% to 3% range versus what I mentioned previously that
mid-term, I think we can return to 1% to 2%.
First of all, we have all this currency situation that is very difficult to predict what precise effect it's going to have on
the economies around the planet. The second thing, clearly, we had to revise our estimate for the Russian market given
the particular situation there. We thought that 2015 would be in the range of 4% to 6% roughly. Now we think that it
will be at 8% to 10%. Of course, that's an assumption.
And the positive, however, can come from the Philippines because when I say 2% to 3% that assumes that no cigarettes
return to the illegal market in the Philippines. Now hopefully given the developments in the Philippines, we'll see some
more volume coming back to the legal market and that can change clearly the overall equation. So we may end up in
the middle of that range I gave, but that's the best I can do at this stage.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. That's fair.
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: Now – okay. Now, the overall economic outlook, we all know the fundamentals. Oil
prices will be lower, so that helps economics and consumer spending, but, in some places, we're going to see inflation

following devaluation. Not in many because, as you all know, it's only one currency appreciating and all the others
depreciating and remaining in relative parity to each other. So when they trade with each other, they don't have
imported inflation. So Russia is the one that comes to mind first as we discussed previously.
Overall, I don't see an acceleration overall of downtrading at all on a global basis. I think we stay on the same trends as
we were in 2014 if not slightly better. Okay, we know the specifics, Australia, we discussed it and so on.
Obviously there is a bit of geographic mix, but if we look at total market declines in 2014 there is no substantial
difference between OECD and non-OECD, especially thanks to the recovery of the European Union. I mean OECD
declined roughly 3-point something percent and non-OECD 2.5% in 2015. So I would say overall nothing worrisome at
this stage.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay that's helpful. If I could just ask one question just for me to understand just some
perspective on the lack of share repurchase, obviously supporting the dividend. I know that's very important you. I
wanted to understand like throughout 2015 when you're at the margin, you're close to a debt level that would push your
rating down.
Is there any consideration where you would allow for the debt rating to go down? I'm just thinking about acquisitions
for example. So maybe not so much for share repurchase, but from an acquisition standpoint would you or the Board
consider the debt rating – violating the debt rating if you will?
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: We always said and I maintain this, we will not lose our rating for share repurchase
purposes. Now if we have a strategic reason, if there's a strategic acquisition or something, then of course that can be
considered. Okay? Absent that we will do everything we can to maintain our A rating. Okay? And I think we have to be
prudent on how we manage the situation given the currency volatility we're in.
Having said that I want to stress that we are committed to share repurchases. We'll see how the situation unfolds and as
soon as we can resume them, we will. We have not changed our approach to that. It's just a temporary situation that
called for caution given what happens with the currency. Okay?
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Sure. Well that's good perspective. Thank you for your time.
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery of CLSA.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: Good afternoon. So just to I guess connect two things that we've touched on already. If it
came down to it and you had to decide between the dividend and the debt rating, how do those fall on the relative to
each other in terms of priority?
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: I think I tried to clarify this. First of all it's rather speculative, this situation. And I said
that I don't see scenarios under which we will reduce our dividend, unless we have third world war.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: Okay. No, that's helpful. So the dividend would come before – if you had to choose
between the two, the debt rating might suffer before the dividend certainly would? That's fair.
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: Yeah. But even if you do the mathematics, that's a consequential effect. So yeah.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: Okay. No, no. Thank you. And then just looking at the EU, your guidance for the operating
income growth there, does that include the savings from the Netherlands plant? And how much – can you quantify how
much that is?
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: Well that's all baked – yes, it includes obviously the savings from the footprint
optimization. And that's included in the overall guidance and in the cost indications I gave.

<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: So how much does that add from just the plant closure?
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: For a variety of reasons I cannot disclose that number. I'm sorry.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: Okay, no problem. And then just looking at Indonesia, certainly the inflation from the fuel
subsidy cut late in the quarter had an impact on the category volumes there. But with oil prices pulling back, that's
reversed now. Can you give any sense of what – even though it's early in this year, have you seen an improvement in
January? Or what does it look like so far as a start to the year?
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: It's very early to judge the effect, but what you said is correct. I mean the subsidies
were removed, but oil prices are a bit low. We didn't see anything in the month of January that shows any change in the
dynamics in this direction, but it's only one month.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: So there's not an improvement yet, but it's just too early to really say?
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: Yes. We didn't see any effect in January. That's all I can tell you.

Our next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen & Co.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: Hi, good afternoon. In terms of your outlook for pricing for 2015, please, with it being
broadly in line with historical levels, can you talk a little bit about the composition of that pricing contribution?
Because historically it has been fairly well-balanced across your geographies, but clearly in 2014 it was decidedly
weighted towards EEMA and Latin America? Thank you.
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: Yes. In 2015 it is very balanced.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: Okay. And then the second...
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: Sorry, it's factual. That's what we project and now we know the specificities of 2014.
We had Italy that skewed clearly the European Union. And we also had the Philippines absorption that skewed Asia.
And these are the two fundamentals, okay, now.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: Thank you that's very clear. As a follow-up on the EPS growth outlook of 8% to 10%,
impressive that you guys are maintaining that absent the buyback. But as I think about the contribution then from
non-operating items of 200 basis points, clearly you get the residual benefit of the $3.8 billion in share repurchases that
you did this year. But can you comment, Jacek, at all about your outlook either for tax or for interest expense?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: On the tax we should stay broadly in that effective tax rate, which we had in 2014. So you're
talking 29%, slightly below 29%. And on the interest expense you remember I hope that quite a portion of our debt
portfolio is in euros. And so, obviously, to put a bit of the lower pressure reduces the pressure coming from the interest
to serve our bond portfolio. So there is some benefit on us coming due to the overall lower interest rate, lower interest
rate environment and also the composition of our debt portfolio due to the significant portion of our euro debt.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: That's very helpful. Thank you very much.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Thank you.

<A - André Calantzopoulos>: Hi, Erik.
<Q - Erik A. Bloomquist>: Hi, good afternoon. Hello. One of the markets we haven't really talked about today was
Turkey and there we've seen volumes improve a bit. I was wondering if you could comment on the outlook for the
Turkish market. Is the downtrading finished, does it look like it's stable and does that then suggest that there is an
opportunity for perhaps some profit growth and with the volume base remaining stable or have there been some
regulatory moves there that suggest we may have another difficult year following a decent year in Turkey? Thank you.
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: Well, volumes in Turkey are stable. Illicit trade is stable, increased a little bit, which
outlines the underlying volume is even better. I don't see any change at this stage. I mean excise taxes are in. There was
moderate increase in the specific and of the minimum tax. So from a total market perspective, I don't see any particular
change in the trend.
Now regarding the dynamics, clearly, there has been some downtrading, but shares seem to have stabilized now and we
did very well in the premium segment, particularly with Parliament despite all the downtrading. So I think we are there
for a decent year in Turkey going forward.
<Q - Erik A. Bloomquist>: Thank you.

Our final question will come from the line of Owen Bennett of Nomura.
<Q - Owen M. Bennett>: Afternoon, guys. Just a couple of questions. Firstly, I was just hoping you could give an
update on the rollout of Marlboro 2.0 in terms of how is it performing with regards to retaining current Marlboro
smokers and also I guess crucially is it attracting competitive smokers? And also how many more markets are expected
in 2015?
Secondly, just coming back to Russia pricing, and we understand that you may have gotten a pricing benefit in 2014
from your stake in Megapolis, and could you confirm whether this is correct and if so, is there likely to be some
giveback from this benefit in 2015? Thanks very much.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: The rollout of Marlboro 2.0.
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: Okay. On Marlboro, I think we are very pleased with our rollout. We have 100%
retention of existing smokers, which is I think remarkable. And we do see change both in profiles and overall attraction
from competitive smokers and the share performance of the brand in the markets where we have rolled out is a clear
testimony to the success of 2.0 and we will continue rolling it out.
The plan is to be fully done with all the rollouts by early 2016. We are already in 26 markets and growing by the day.
So we pursue the plan and we are very happy with it. Now Megapolis is not in the pricing. It's an item that is below the
OCI line. I'm asking the people that are more – okay.
<Q - Owen M. Bennett>: Hello?
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: It's income from unconsolidated subsidiary; that's what it is. Then we received clearly a
dividend, so, yes, it will be somehow affected by the ruble, etc. temporarily, but that's currency, clearly. So it would
only [indiscernible] (65:50).
