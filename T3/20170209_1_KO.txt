Ahmet Muhtar Kent
Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover a few key highlights before handing off to James to
provide a more detailed operational review of our performance. We're committed to transform our company to a
brand-centric organization, leading a great franchise system. This journey began back in late 2014, when we got behind
a set of strategic actions designed to invigorate growth and increase profitability.
Since then, we've been advancing on a path to deliver greater long-term sustainable value to our shareowners,
associates, partners and stakeholders. We've simplified our organizational structure for speed and flexibility. We're
driving aggressive productivity. We're redeploying more and better marketing. We're driving revenue through
segmented growth strategies and embarking also on the biggest refranchising and bottler restructuring in our history.
2016 was a critical year, as we continued to make strong progress in transforming our company while keeping focused
on our consumers. We continued to gain momentum in building revenue growth through segmented market roles and
disciplined brand investments. Since launching our incremental media investment plan in early 2014, our core business
has accelerated top line performance even with slowing macroeconomic growth. We've strengthened our brands and
portfolios through better and more marketing, innovation and targeted acquisitions. We've brought to market more than
500 new products, nearly 400 of which were teas, juices, coffees, waters or other still beverages. We generated over
$600 million in productivity, for a three-year total of over $1.7 billion, taking a balanced approach to investing in our
brands while leveraging our P&L in 2016.
Finally, we continue to strengthen our bottling system. The world's largest independent Coca-Cola bottler based on
revenue, Coca-Cola European Partners, began operations in a market that represents one of our most valuable profit
centers. We signed definitive agreements to sell our bottling businesses in China and we expect to close these
transactions during the first half of 2017. Our two largest bottlers in Japan agreed to merge, which will create a single
bottler covering roughly 85% of our system's volume in Japan, a very important profit pool again. We successfully
helped to create Coca-Cola Beverages Africa, and we're now working to transition ownership from ABI to a strong
partner of our choice.
Finally, we made substantial progress refranchising our North America bottling operations. At the same time, the North
America business has flourished throughout this process, delivering top-tier FMCG performance with mid-single-digit
organic revenue growth in each of the past two years. Taken together, half of our system revenue has been in motion
through these actions. We accomplished a lot and built a very strong and purposeful foundation for the future.
Now, it's time to write the next chapter in our growth story with the appointment of James Quincey as our next CEO. I
have every confidence in James and our management team. And throughout his career, James has shown insightful
leadership in addressing the changing consumer environment by expanding product offerings and, most recently,
driving systematic portfolio reformulation to reduce added sugar with hundreds of initiatives in progress. He's
absolutely the right leader at the right time. James is well-prepared to deliver the next level, value creation. He knows

that in order to deliver robust and sustainable value creation for shareowners, we will also need to create value for all of
our stakeholders. I'm excited about what's ahead for our company and for our system and James will have my full and
vigorous support as I continue to serve as Chairman of the Board.
Now, I'll hand over the call to James, who will take you through our operating performance in 2016 as well as provide
thoughts on our performance this coming year.
James Quincey
Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thanks, Muhtar. And it will be an honor and a privilege to succeed you as Chief
Executive. This is a pivotal time of change for our company, our system and our industry. We're seeing consumer
preferences evolve, technology and e-commerce transform the retail landscape and, of course, ongoing volatile global
economic conditions.
And the actions we've taken over the past few years have set a strong foundation for our company, and I look forward
to steering us through our next phase of growth. I will take you through some of the hows when we present at CAGNY
in a couple of weeks. So today, let me just cover a few topics: our top line performance for the quarter; a summary of
our actions and performance for the whole year; and a little on our expectations for 2017. Then, I'll hand the call to
Kathy to walk you through some additional financial details.
So let's start with our top-line performance in the fourth quarter. Here, we delivered good organic revenue growth, even
allowing for the fact the quarter had two extra days. Clearly, this was driven by 6% price/mix, while volume didn't
grow. Mostly, this is a result of what we planned for and expected, but with a couple of twists. Firstly, those things we
expected included our continuing focus on momentum in our developed country markets. For example, North America,
which had another very strong quarter. And also, we expected to cycle negative price/mix from last year in Asia
Pacific, producing a strong number this year.
Things we saw occur in the quarter and responded to included, for example, India, where demonetization impacted the
whole CPG landscape. Our system responded quickly by facilitating digital payments, extending credit to mitigate
destocking, and increasing our emphasis on the modern trade. Also, macro conditions worsened in Brazil. Here, we
chose not to drive poor value promotions to overprotect volume, but focused instead on more fundamentally resetting
the price/package architecture to support affordability. And this will take some time to fully implement. These not only
hit our consolidated volume, but, in curious ways, mechanically improved our price/mix as well.
Now, clearly, six points of price/mix is a one-off and is not our destination, nor is a 1% decline in volume. So rather
than focus just on the quarter, let's look at the full year results, which I believe are a better indicator of how we think
about the full-year success in 2016 and going forward into 2017.
For the full-year 2016, we delivered 3% organic revenue growth, amidst more challenging macro conditions than we
expected. Our core, being the company that will exist after the refranchising, our core business grew organic revenue
by 4% and we gained NARTD value share. Given the refranchising of our company-owned bottling businesses, we
look at this core business as an important indicator of the longer-term trajectory of our top line and remain encouraged
that we're growing the core in line with our long-term revenue target, even if at the bottom end.
Finally, we expanded our operating margin through strong price/mix and by balancing over $600 million in
productivity with disciplined investments given the overall macro environment in 2016. These actions enabled us to
grow comparable currency neutral ex-structural income before tax by 8%, at the high end of the target range we laid
out at the beginning of the year.
Now, for some texture on 2016, I'll touch on a few of our operations around the world. We performed well in certain
key markets. We took action in others as needed and managed through some other difficult operating conditions. Our
developed country markets perform well, as we continue to execute against our strategy of transforming the system,
investing in good marketing and better execution. In North America, we saw all elements of this strategy come
together, resulting in 4% revenue growth. Japan and Mexico both performed well. And in Western Europe, increased

investments, coupled with a new reinvigorated bottling partner, drove good results there.
Our developing and emerging markets saw more of a mixed bag of performance. Markets like Nigeria and Pakistan
performed very strongly. China, which began the year with a pretty challenging situation, but through a combination of
adjusted strategies, focus on the consumer, our performance has improved as we moved into the back half of the year.
A few markets faced significant challenges, Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, and they impacted our overall results. There,
we focused on the basics, like the example I gave on packaging in Brazil.
Turning and looking forward to 2017, we expect another year of volatility around the world. I don't need to tell you
about the rapid change that's taking place at geopolitical and macro level and how this will bring continued challenges
and yet also opportunities across the portfolio. Some markets will get better and some will get worse, but net-net, we
see the overall environment to be similar as it did to 2016.
Historically, our approach has been to grow the consumer franchise in each local market by driving: consumer
incidents, effectively, the number of consumers enjoying our brands; value share; and transactions; and to deliver
locally against our comparable currently neutral profit targets. So while we are pleased with our underlying trajectory,
our comparable EPS has not grown over the last several years. So going forward, if currency swings aren't balancing
out over time to let currency neutral result be a proxy for U.S. dollar growth, then we must adapt.
So importantly, we are intensifying our focus on delivering comparable EPS growth each year. We won't sacrifice the
long-term health of the business, but we need to better balance investing to grow the business with delivering earnings
growth in an environment like this. So starting with 2017, even in the face of strengthening dollar, higher tax and
interest rates, we expect to grow comparable EPS before the impact of our M&A transactions, 2017 particularly those
due to refranchising. So while the refranchising effect in 2017 is meaningful, it ultimately has laid the foundation for
accelerated growth. And, as you read in our release, this becomes a much less significant factor to overall growth as we
move into 2018 and beyond.
Now, to deliver all this, it starts with revenue growth and then getting the operating leverage right. Revenue growth will
be built through a consumer-centric brand portfolio by: scaling in regions where we have leadership positions, like U.S.
and Japan; expanding successful brands globally; and continuing to execute bolt-on M&A and partnerships. So, for
example, we launched smartwater and Honest Tea in Western Europe in the past year and plans to further expand in
2017. In the U.S., our investment in fairlife milk is paying off. It captured over one-third of the retail dollar growth in
value-added dairy during its second year on the market. And, of course, sparkling soft drinks remain a key focus as one
of the principal categories in which we complete.
Within our sparkling soft drink portfolio, we are reshaping our growth equation to continue to drive revenue growth,
building on the revenue growth we delivered in 2016. We'll do this through a continued mix of great marketing, great
execution, combined with helping reduce over-consumption of added sugar. This includes the reformulated products to
reduce content, leveraging our One Brand strategy to expand zero-sugar products and driving the availability of small
packs. All of this we're approaching with a mindset of test and learn, knowing that not every strategy will work in every
market, but that speed, flexibility, and adaptation are paramount to success. I look forward to sharing more of what
we're doing at CAGNY.
So, in summary, we're going make the right decisions for the business and for our shareholders, looking out for the
consumer franchise, tasking the local operations to grow locally and managing across the portfolio and the levers of our
business to deliver comparable EPS growth.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Kathy to take you through our outlook.
Kathy N. Waller
Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. As I look back at 2016, I'm pleased with the progress that we've made
against our strategic initiatives. We drove organic revenue growth through segmented market roles and disciplined
investments, further imbedded productivity into our culture and strengthened our system in several key markets.

Importantly, we delivered our profit target amidst a tough operating environment, and we returned $8.3 billion to
shareowners through dividends and net share repurchases.
Now, looking at 2017, we have a strong foundation in place, but we still have a lot of assets across the system in
motion. In North America, we will refranchise more this year than we have cumulatively to-date. In addition, China
will close and Africa is on track. We have strong plans in place and we recognize this level of change requires a
disciplined focus to minimize any potential disruption.
As with any endeavor of this size, it is understandable that timetables may move. So the best way to think about our
refranchising is take both the 2017 and 2018 expected impacts together to arrive at the total expected impact to
revenues and profits. That way, you can understand the dynamics and effectively model what any change in timing this
year means for next year.
Starting at the top, we expect the global environment in 2017 to be roughly similar to that of 2016, with continued
macroeconomic challenges in the emerging and developing world and continued growth in the developed world.
However, there's a significant amount of uncertainty and geopolitical tension which could result in a changing macro
environment. Therefore, we expect 3% organic revenue growth, led more by pricing than by volume growth. And we
expect the core business to outpace our consolidated results, consistent with our performance in 2016. We will take a
disciplined approach to our marketing investments and our operating expenses in 2017, and we'll continue to flow
productivity through to the bottom line.
At the same time, CCR, our company-owned North American bottler, is eliminating stranded costs as quickly as
possible, while transitioning territories to new partners. We expect the elimination of these costs to contribute roughly
two points of underlying operating income growth. Therefore, with another year of price/mix and expense
management, we expect to drive very strong underlying operating margin expansion for the year.
Below the operating line, we expect an impact from higher interest expense, thereby resulting in underlying income
before tax growth of 7% to 8%. As you all know, currencies remain volatile. And since we operate in over 200 markets,
we not immune to this effect. Based on current spot rates, hedging activity and what we are cycling, we expect a three
to four point headwind to income before tax. We expect our effective tax rate will increase in 2017 to 24%, due to
geographic mix, the impact of currencies and bottler transactions.
Though we are encouraged by the prospects for corporate tax reform in the United States, for business planning
purposes, we have not assumed any change to the U.S. tax environment for the coming year. Finally, we expect net
share repurchases of approximately $2 billion.
2017 marks a turning point in our return to a more efficient, capital-light model. It is the largest year for divesting
profitable bottling businesses, primarily in North America. Therefore, we expect a five to six point structural headwind
to income before tax, which will negatively affect our comparable EPS growth. So while this is absolutely the right
thing to do for our company and our system, we expect it will result in a 1% to 4% decline in comparable EPS in 2017.
Now, looking further out to 2018, while it is premature to talk about underlying growth, I wanted to provide some
additional thoughts on a few items in 2018, given all of the complexity impacting our financial performances this year.
First, based on the timing of our 2017 actions, we expect structural headwinds in 2018 of 16% to 17% on revenue, and
1% to 2% on income before tax. Please note, this does not include any impact from the transition of ownership of
Coca-Cola Beverages Africa or the acquisition of any other ABI territories, which would be minimal as we intend to
account for these as discontinued operations given our intent to immediately refranchise.
Second, we are hedged on a number of hard currencies through the end of 2018, but at slightly less attractive rates than
for 2017. Assuming today's spot rates remain constant, we would expect a low single-digit currency headwind to 2018
income before tax. Finally, we expect that, absent U.S. tax reform, our effective tax rate would increase to 26% in
2018. Again, we believe reform is possible in the year ahead; however, the details are still uncertain and, therefore, we
have assumed no change to the U.S. tax environment.

Returning to the immediate future, there are a few items to consider. Our first quarter in 2017 has two fewer days than
first quarter 2016, and Easter will fall in the second quarter this year as compared to the first quarter last year. In some
of the markets experiencing challenges at the end of 2016, these conditions will continue into early 2017. For example,
in India, where we own the majority of our bottling system, the tough operating environment stemming from
demonetization is likely to persist at the start of the year before gradually recovering. And due to the timing of when we
issued debt last year and Fed rate increases, the year-over-year increase in interest expense will be more heavily
skewed to the first half of 2017 than the back half.
We expect structural items to be a 12 to 13 point headwind on net revenue and a 1 to 2 point headwind on income
before tax in the first quarter. Finally, we expect currency to be a 1 to 2 point headwind on net revenue and a 3 to 4
point headwind on income before tax in the first quarter.
Now, for those of you who want to get into greater detail, the IR team will host a modeling call at 11:30 AM today to
take you through additional details as well as answer any questions you might have. Prior to that call, we will post a

Operator, we are now ready for questions.
Q&A
Operator
And our first question comes from Bryan Spillane of BofA Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
<Q - Bryan Spillane>: Hey, good morning, everybody. And I just wanted to offer my congratulations and best of luck
to both you, Muhtar, and to James.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Thank you.
<A - James Quincey>: Thank you.
<Q - Bryan Spillane>: I have a question, James, regarding price, price/mix. And I guess as you're looking out over
what the environment is like over the next couple years, can you just talk a little bit how you're balancing the desire to
get some price/mix in with how you think about that relative volume, and also relative to maybe affordability,
especially in some of the emerging markets where the consumer environment's still pretty tough?
<A - James Quincey>: Sure. Morning, Bryan. A couple of thoughts then, I mean, over the long-term, we've said we're
looking for a balance between price and volume, or price/mix and volume. And that's certainly our long-term objective.
Now, given what's happening, I think it's almost, as you said, it's easier to divide the world into the developed and the
emerging markets. In the developed countries, we're looking to drive probably a little more price than volume. And you
can see that happening in the U.S. marketplace as we focus on smaller packages, as we focus on higher value categories
or subcategories. You see that across North America. Western Europe is a little more balanced and similarly into Japan.
So that's our approach for the developed markets.
In the emerging markets, obviously, over the long-term, we expect them to be a bigger source of underlying volume
growth and that'll bring the total company equation into balance, so they would be more volume-driven and less
price-driven. Now, what's happening is in some of the markets, say, for example, a Brazil, where the macros are really
under pressure – I mean, GDP over the last three years in Brazil has probably declined by more than it did in the great
recession or the lost decade of the 1980s. So there, what we focus on is in any moment that we will do those
promotional things that make sense in returns, so we don't over-protect volume. We do what makes sense on a quarterly
or a monthly basis. And the principal axis we act on is trying to reform the packaging strategy to make it more
affordable, whether that be smaller one-way packaging or more returnable packages, backed up by good marketing that
really empathizes with the economic situation that consumers are in and obviously great execution by the bottling
system.

So net-net, likely over time, developed markets will get more price/mix and slightly less volume and in the emerging
markets, more volume and slightly less price/mix, with that caveat that those markets that struggle, we have a game
plan that we've developed over the years and that we find helps us really build a good strong consumer franchise going
forward and balances the short term.
<A - Timothy K. Leveridge>: Next question, please.
Operator
The next question comes from Steve Powers of UBS. Your line is now open.
<Q - Stephen R. Powers>: Hey. Thanks. And congratulations from me as well to both of you.
<A - James Quincey>: Thank you.
<Q - Stephen R. Powers>: Just following on Bryan's question on price/mix, when you have a great price/mix quarter
like you did here in Q4, I guess the question that is in my mind is why aren't we seeing more flow through to the
bottom line? Because in a vacuum, you'd think five or six points of price and mix would be significantly margin
accretive. So I guess is it the case that what may be mix accretive on the revenue line is actually margin or even penny
profit dilutive on the bottom line? And I'm thinking here really about the structural shift from sparkling to stills, but
perhaps some of the packaging changes and geographic shifts in the balance of your overall business may play a role as
well. Could you just talk about that, why we're not seeing more profit flow thorough on the price/mix?
<A - James Quincey>: Sure. Well, I think you saw lots of flow through actually in the fourth quarter. Operating
income currency neutral ex-structural was up 18% off a gross profit of 8%, so there was 10 points of leverage. So we
got a lot of leverage coming through. The reason that didn't translate from operating income to PBT, is more of those
other factors like interest or other corporate items. Actually, when I talk about PBT growing at 8% in 2016 and what
we've guided in 2017, actually, the underlying operating income performance is actually even better than that. And
then, we've got a bit of a headwind in interest and some of those other items. So there's actually a lot of leverage
coming through from the operation. As we focus on segmented revenue, as we focus on higher value categories, as we
focus on smaller packages, we're getting a lot of operating leverage between that revenue line and the operating income
line. Some of it's getting netted off in the headwinds. So it is there.
In the fourth quarter, just to make the point, 6% is not projectable going forward. You'll see in the numbers, for
example, we were cycling a big negative in Asia Pacific from last year, so we got a big positive this year. We had some
very good results, some improvements where we own bottling operations like China, which was very much weaker in
the first half. So there's some oddities in the fourth quarter. I would encourage everyone to look at maybe the full year
2016, look through to the core operation, where we were drawing at 4%, 8% PBT. Bear in mind some interest
headwinds as a higher operating income growth, lots of leverage. This is the game plan for 2017.

effectiveness in marketing, shift to lower calorie products, et cetera, and any big changes you're planning going forward
to drive improved trends? And then, you also mentioned tuck-in M&A. So how big a role should we expect
diversification into other subcategories to play out over the next few years for your company? Thanks.
<A - James Quincey>: Sure. Of course, I'll save some things for CAGNY. Look, let me start with the sparkling
business is growing revenue. It grew revenue in 2015. It grew revenue in 2016. Momentum's rebuilding. If you look at
the U.S., sparkling was up 1% in the fourth quarter in the U.S., in aggregate, in volume and, obviously, much more in
revenue. So the sparkling category is growing in revenue. Another piece under that, just take a couple of examples, in
this quarter and last quarter as well, total, if you take the combination of Diet Coke, Coke light and Coke Zero, they
came into robust growth in the back of the year. The growth of those altogether, so no-calorie colas, exceeds the growth
of sparkling and actually exceeds the growth of our total portfolio in most of our other categories. So there's robust
growth as we press into zero sugar colas, we're getting the growth.
And in North America and some of the other places where we're pushing smaller packages, we're getting the good
growth. Smaller packs in the U.S. grew almost 10% in the fourth quarter. So the game plan out there of smaller
packages, zero sugar, re-engagement with the sparkling category, is driving the revenue growth and we believe it will
continue to do so. And the shape and the quality of that in terms of sustainability is looking better over time. Obviously,
tuck-on M&A won't be sparkling-related. We've consistently done a few things each year. Hopefully, we'll do a few in
2017. We'll do those that make strategic sense, financial sense and where we find willing partners.

And your next question comes from Ali Dibadj of Bernstein. Your line is now open.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Hey, guys. A couple questions on guidance, especially in the context, James, of your focus on EPS
growth going forward. So for 2017, very helpful in line with kind of our thought process at least, except why only 3%
organic sales growth? For 2018, it seems like your EPS would be barely ticking up, based on an assumption of high
single-digit comparable currency neutral income growth before taxes, so 2017-like kind of based to growth. So 2018
doesn't look like it's growing EPS very much at all. Does that sound right on 2018 and why, or is your statement in the
prepared remarks suggesting that, look, in 2018, we're going to do things like incremental cost cutting, we're going to
do things to really grow the EPS? And then, I can't resist to throw this one in as well, slightly different, but why does
the total growth structural PBT headwind look like something like 9% to 11% versus what you'd said at CAGNY at
7.5%? So thanks for throwing all those. Thanks.
<A - James Quincey>: I'll start, maybe and then, Kathy, if you feel like jumping in at any point, let me know.
<A - Kathy N. Waller>: Sure. Okay.
<A - James Quincey>: The 2017 3%, I think we see a similar year in 2017 in terms of macros that we did in 2016.
And I think we're making a prudent call that, given everything that's going on in the world, on a consolidated basis,
we're expecting a similar outlook and a similar number for the total company. Obviously, as Kathy said, we'd like to
see the core business grow above that, as we did in 2016 where the consolidated was 3% and the core was 4%, which is
the bottom end of our range and then obviously lots of operating leverage. That's how we're seeing it. We just see the
way the world is going.
In terms of 2018, obviously, we're not providing guidance on 2018. We're just providing some of the elements that we
know are important from a modeling perspective. So, obviously, 2018 conversation will have to wait. But we wanted
people to understand the structural piece because, obviously, the timing of when we sell those transactions makes a big
difference. And so as timing varies, the structural adjustment can move backwards and forwards between 2018, so we
just wanted to give people a total perspective. I don't know, Kathy, about number three. I'm not sure we have the thing
in front of us, Ali.
<A - Kathy N. Waller>: Yes. So the bridge of total structural versus what we'd shown at CAGNY, the part of what I
think is misunderstood in structural adjustments is, particularly in this year, we talked about the 5% to 6%. The two

additional things you need to factor in in your structural adjustments, the CCR business is not standing still. It's
continuing to grow, as well as the fact that they are taking out stranded costs.
Now, we think of stranded costs a lot like productivity, if you will. And so, we have embedded those and that's why I
said in my prepared remarks that we had two points of stranded costs that are coming out, as well, in our number. But
the stranded costs of all that productivity in that, they don't just transfer with the territories. There's work to do to get
them out. And, for some reason if they don't transfer, they're a part of our business, and we have to do work to get them
out long term. So the standard costs, we treat that as part of the business. And you can choose to net those or not, to
better understand the structural impact, but that's how they represent themselves in our numbers. And, again, we're not
giving any other underlying growth guidance for 2018 at this point.

And our next question comes from Bill Schmitz of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
<Q - Bill Schmitz>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Morning.
<A - James Quincey>: Morning.
<A - Kathy N. Waller>: Morning.
<Q - Bill Schmitz>: Could you guys just give a little bit more color on what sounds like a little bit lower advertising
spending next year? I think you mentioned in the prepared comments, so is it something that like you realize that
maybe the advertising efficiency isn't as much, so like what the numbers are, Is it going to be lower as a ratio and in
dollars? And then, it seems like there's probably a lot of initiatives you need to support next year also, so like the plan
with getting Coke Zero Sugar out beyond Europe, if that's also in the plan for next year. So I tried to wrap two
questions in one, but it's the absolute and ratio of advertising spending, the rational for reducing it and then if you do, in
fact, plan to take Coke Zero Sugar to other markets outside of Europe. Thanks.
<A - James Quincey>: Sure. Morning, Bill, James here. So firstly, the aggregate amount of marketing spend is slightly
below gross profit. You are correct. Now, what is super important to know within that is we'll continue to increase what
we would call working spend of the marketing ahead of revenue, but we are driving material productivity in the way
we organize and produce the marketing to become much more efficient. So we are able to grow media, if you like, in
all its different forms, ahead of revenue, but with the extra productivity initiatives, we are actually growing total spend
less than revenue. That's how that dynamic is working. So we'll be able to do much more in the marketplace in a more
efficient way.
And then, secondly, on Coke Zero Sugar, absolutely you should expect us to move around the world things that are
successful and that had a great start in GB in the back end of 2016, was growing double digits, very good start. We're
rolling out in Europe. It's just launched in Australia. So you can absolutely expect us to push it into those markets
where we think it can be really effective, including Latin America soon, so absolutely. And I think that is part of why
you're now seeing the continued acceleration of Coke Zero Sugar each year. We grew several points faster in volume in
2015 than 2014 and we grew several points faster in 2016 than the rate we were growing in 2015. And, as I said,
aggregate, no-calorie colas is in good mid-single-digits growth as we exited the year.

<A - James Quincey>: Thank you.
<A - Kathy N. Waller>: Morning.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: First, just a follow-up on price/mix, specifically in North America. Obviously, we've all learned
that the Nielsen data is not perfect, but there seems to be a pretty big disconnect between particularly in the fourth
quarter, where you got the 4% pricing versus the softer pricing that we've seen in the data, so if you can just elaborate
on that as a follow-up. And then, James, I'm just wondering if you can talk a little bit about how much of a priority in
2017 is really a shift towards stills. If I look at 2016 performance, 3% growth that you got in still, it seems like it could
be much stronger in the context of a lot of the categories that seems to be growing at a faster rate. So can you just talk
about either on the innovation front or investment front, how much of that focus that you'll look towards in 2017 on the
still category?
<A - James Quincey>: Sure. Yeah, I mean, clearly there's a disconnect. The Nielsen universe is a much smaller piece
of our total business. Obviously, when you look at the aggregate of North America, fountain is very important to us. It's
almost a third of the volume in North America, and that's not going through Nielsen. And obviously, there's a lot of
warehouse business there where we sell some of the still categories directly. But we have not deviated from our
strategy. We've talked on previous quarters that sometimes the pricing, at least the apparent pricing in Nielsen, will
look a little softer or a little better.
The important message is we have not changed our strategy. We continue to focus on realizing pricing intelligently and
through packaging and pricing in the sparkling category and focusing on those bits of the other categories that we
believe have value in terms of revenue and profitability. And so, every now and again, you will see this disconnect
between Nielsen and our total results, but know that our strategy has not changed. And we plan to continue to pursue it
into 2017.
And then, in terms of the other categories, absolutely we continue to innovate and invest there. I think the underlying
trend is even better than what it jumps out in the volume, bearing in mind, the strategy is to participate in those
categories with the highest value to us, both in revenue and in terms of profitability. So, for example, if you went to
China and you looked at what was happening in some of the stills categories, maybe water, you'd see a growth rate of
X, but what you don't see in the volume is actually we're selling less of the cheap water and more of the higher value
water, as we cycle and re-innovate our business to drive the positioning and the premiumness through different brands
and reset the way we attack some of these categories.
So we're after driving a consumer franchise that's about incidents of consumers, the number of times they drink our
beverages, even if that's a smaller package, and about competing for value on the top and the bottom line.

And our next question comes from Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
<Q - Nik Modi>: Yeah, thanks, and congrats, guys, from me as well. The question, James, I guess is when we look at
North America, numbers have looked pretty good relative to I think most peoples' expectations going back about a year
and a half. A lot of the initiatives that you have put in place have started in North America. So I'm just wondering if
you can help us kind of map out how to think about what's happened in North America and the applicability to the rest
of the world. That would be helpful. Thank you.
<A - James Quincey>: Yeah, Nik, morning. Absolutely, North America's had a great run. The team's done a good job.
The strategy's working. The numbers in 2015 and 2016 have put us at kind of the top end of CPGs in terms of revenue
growth with our customers. We're very pleased with that. I think what you see in the North American strategy, which is
likely what you should expect, is a fusion. And what I mean by that is things that they have done, they have taken from
other parts of the world successfully and they have blended it with new ideas and things that are relevant for the North
American market and that's what's turned into the winning plan they've put in place and they've executed and it's been

doing well.
And so you should expect us always to be taking ideas from one place, applying the learnings in another place. And,
fundamentally, I think North America's a great example of where we reinvest marketing behind the right strategy and a
balanced portfolio with execution by the bottling system. And I underline there the importance of the execution by the
bottling system and our own fountain and wholesale businesses during a time of tremendous change through the
refranchising.

And our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein of Evercore. Your line is now open.
<Q - Robert Ottenstein>: Great, thank you very much. Two questions, first, to the extent that you're able to talk about
it, love to understand the thought process about not purchasing Bai, which Dr Pepper ended up buying. It seemed to
check a lot of boxes. Is it the product? Is it the timing, any color on that? And second, could you discuss whether all the
refranchising, and particularly in Africa, has caused any disruptions in the business, any headwinds through that
process, and a little bit more on the expected timing on Africa? Thank you very much.
<A - James Quincey>: Sure. I don't think it would be appropriate to comment on the M&A process of Bai, so I'm
going skip that one, if I may. Refranchising in Africa, I think there's been a very robust process and I think the
management team of the bottler, both prior to the closing of the SAB transaction under ABI on the board, as well, and
ongoing, the management team has remained focused on doing the right things in the marketplace, so a creditable
performance by the management team in conjunction with the local business unit. So we see no disruption there, and I
think everything is going well.
The refranchising itself, as Muhtar commented and as you've seen, we reached agreement with ABI at the close of last
year. And the rest of the process is ongoing, both from a regulatory process point of view and a selection and
determination of the partner from those that will be strongest and those that are interested.

Next question comes from Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Good morning and congratulations to both of you.
<A - James Quincey>: Thank you.
<A - Kathy N. Waller>: Good morning.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: I was hoping you guys could drill down a little further on headwinds and the consumer in
some of your key emerging markets. And then, how has the overall category been performing in these markets? And
really, how has it been holding up, given some of the headwinds and pressures on consumer spending, and whether
you're taking share? And then, specifically in China, things seemed to reaccelerate in the second half last year. So could
you guys talk a little bit more about current trends, whether that be near and then long-term outlook for China? Thank
you.
<A - James Quincey>: Sure. I think the emerging markets is a very mixed bag. I mean, there are some which are doing
well. I called out some, like Nigeria, which had a very strong year, even the close of the year, as the currency came
under pressure, places like Mexico. There are a number of emerging markets, South Africa, which we did well in. Now,
there are others where the macros were tough, whether that be Venezuela, very tough. Argentina, Brazil and there, we
applied our strategies, a combination of what's the right tactical use of promotions to balance the system. We don't want
to de-scale, but we don't want to overinvest in promotions, while resetting the pack/price architecture to really drive
long-term affordability. So it's very much a mixed bag across the world. Obviously, India is something a lot of people
have commented on. I'm not sure any more I can add on the India example.

In terms of China, I think China's a great example where you see us executing the game plan I talked about for Brazil.
So the China back-end of 2015 coming into the first and the second quarters of 2016 was a very rough period for CPG,
a rough period for beverages in China. We went per our game plan, exactly what I said about Brazil and we started to
do some promotional things and then we reset some of the pack/price architecture. We focused on the right package
sizes in the right brands, doing the marketing in a right way, and a reset of what was important in terms of execution,
where you should execute in terms of channels and focus of the cities.
So in the case of China, the markets are actually doing pretty well in the top-tier cities. There was lots of growth. It
looked more like the strategy of focus on the value end, focus on the premium end of the business. And then in the
more rural and lower-tier cities, really affordability and smaller package sizes.
And then, in the second half of 2016, China rebounded. We grew in both the third and the fourth quarter in volume
terms and in revenue terms in China. So the game plan worked. Obviously, it's not instantaneous, but we know what to
do when markets get into trouble if we focus on understanding the consumer, understanding the customer and getting
organized as a system.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Yeah, Bonnie, I'd just add one point just to complement what James said is that this was
the 38th consecutive quarter for us in gaining value share, 38th in NARTD. And in sparkling, this was the 12th
consecutive quarter of share gains. And then in North America, importantly, 27th consecutive quarter of share gains, so
we continue to gain share as we implement this playbook that's really working. And the business is getting stronger
over a much, much bigger base than any one of our competitors going forward. So I just wanted to add that.

And your next question comes from Mark Swartzberg of Stifel. Your line is now open.
<Q - Mark Swartzberg>: Yeah, thanks. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Morning.
<A - James Quincey>: Morning.
<A - Kathy N. Waller>: Morning.
<Q - Mark Swartzberg>: And my congratulations as well, James and Muhtar. I wanted to, if we could, do kind of a
tale of three countries here, James. And what I mean by that is Mexico, your results, Diageo's results, Walmex,
ANTAD retail data, it seems that the consumer's doing rather fine there and, of course, there's a lot of concern about
Mexico since November 8. So in Mexico specifically, could you just give us a feel for what you're seeing in terms of
broad consumer behavior since November 8?
And then, with Brazil and India, with the pricing you have taken some of it, invisible, if you will, because of what
you're doing with price/pack architecture, what's the level of confidence you have in those markets that the elasticity
that you experience will not be worse than what you've actually – that you have sort of an adverse elasticity impact
greater than what your models say?
<A - James Quincey>: Sure. Well, Mexico, in all honestly, I'm not sure the Mexican consumers in terms of what
happened in the marketplace, the purchasing patterns really changed that much pre and post that date. I think the
Mexican economy, there's been a lot of focus on it. There were the reforms. I think it's performed well, and we have a
great business in Mexico. I think our system there has been innovating. It's truly one of the places where we've been
most innovative and most creative across the total portfolio, where we compete in almost every category. And they've
done a really robust job of building a good business. And I think that that is what you see in the Mexico result. And
they continued to build on a strong 2015 with a stronger 2016. And I think it's a wonderful operation down there. And
they did a very creditable result. And hopefully, that will continue into 2017. Certainly, we think that our system is up
to the challenge, come what may in Mexico.

In terms of Brazil and India, I think they're two very different examples. India, it's certainly a truly one-off event. The
demonetization effectively drained liquidity. I don't think that's about price elasticity. I think that's about the kind of
shock to the circulation in the liquidity. Clearly, we're of the view that a formalization of the economy helps the formal
players. And I think it'll be good in the medium-term and the long-term. We expected the short-term disruptions to kind
of mitigate or to tail-off as we come in 2017, though not from January 1. And I think what we just need to see is some
stabilization there, and we will be able to then come back and execute our game plan. So I don't think that's particularly
about resetting everything we do in India. I think it's about working through the effects of this one-off demonetization.
Brazil is a different thing. Brazil, I've talked about. We've taken quite a bit of pricing in Brazil over the end of 2015 and
the beginning of 2016. I think the consumer environment got worse towards the end of the year in Brazil. I know a
number of the states in Brazil had trouble with some of the public employee payrolls going into the back of the year. So
there was a kind of reduction in the mass of consumer disposable income, perhaps more aggravated Q3 going into Q4.
And I think there, the elasticities and the effects of pricing did become worse.
I mean, the value of the promotions wasn't as good as perhaps the high lows. Wasn't as good as it was at the beginning
of the year or even in 2015 and I think that's what's caused us to do some things in the fourth quarter to balance pricing
and volume, but to recognize we need to come in for 2017 with a more aggressive reset of the pack/price architecture.
Given the circumstances in Brazil, they're not likely to be completely fixed overnight. I think there's some focus on
improving things. And we expect Brazil to slowly get better, but we are going to execute and implement our pack/price,
reset some parts of it, with the expectation that it'll start to rebuild the business as the economics get a bit better.

with the refranchising, that our exposure to commodities goes down significantly, as we talked about at, I think, last

Thanks, James, Kathy and Tim. Last year, we made significant progress as we accelerated the transformation of our
company into a higher margin business, while keeping focused on consumers. With a strong foundation set, now is the
time for a seamless leadership transition. And I have every confidence that James is the best person to take us through
the next phase of our sustainable growth. There's no question that this phase will look different than the past, driven by
a broad consumer-centric portfolio across all categories, while enabling consumers to control their intake of added
sugar. This is going require a change to some of our strategies, many of which have already begun and now need
further scale in regions all around the world.
As always, we thank you for your interest, your investment in our company and for joining us this morning.
