MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Jennifer, and I'll be your conference facilitator, today. At this time, I would like to
welcome everyone to the BlackRock, Incorporated Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Teleconference.
Our host for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer,
Gary S. Shedlin; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade. All lines have been placed
on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period.
[Operator Instructions]
Thank you. Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference.
Christopher J. Meade
Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I'm Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I'd like to
remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your
attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may of course, differ from these statements.
As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which list some of the factors that may cause the results of
BlackRock to differ materially from what we see today. BlackRock assumes no duty, and does not undertake to update
any forward-looking statements.
So, with that, let's begin.

Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the second quarter of 2016. Before I
turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our quarterly financial performance, and business results. While
our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on our as
adjusted results.
Clients are struggling to navigate an incredibly difficult investment landscape. Notwithstanding the recent market rally
over the last 12 months, many global equity markets were down double-digits, and interest rates touched historic lows
worldwide.
The current macro environment, including negative yields in many jurisdictions, Brexit and U.S. election uncertainty is
causing clients to defer investment decision, resulting in significant increases in global cash balances, lower active
flows and a shift from equity to fixed income assets. This environment is also resulting in lower revenue capture across
the asset management industry.
In times like this, growing and evolving our business are critically important as client needs for our investment advice
and risk management capabilities are greater than ever. BlackRock is having richer dialogs with clients than at any time
in our history, and we are well-positioned for growth when client activity accelerates.
Last month, at our 2016 Investor Day, we described how BlackRock is built for change. Our strong foundation drives
consistent financial results and stable cash flows, enabling us to fund innovation and invest in new growth areas. This is
critical to clients, especially during volatile times when other investment managers may be forced to pull back, and to
shareholders as we have an opportunity to win market share.
During the second quarter, strength in our global investment platform and Aladdin risk management business, coupled
with continued expense discipline, enabled us to continue investing in our business despite market headwinds that
impacted both base fees and performance fees on a year-over-year basis.
Second quarter revenue of $2.8 billion was 3% lower than a year ago, while operating income of $1.2 billion was down
6%. Earnings per share of $4.78 was down 4% versus the prior-year quarter. Non-operating results for the quarter
reflected $14 million of net investment gains, primarily attributable to net gains on private equity and hedge
fund-related investments.
Our as adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was 30.6% compared to 30.1% a year ago. We continue to estimate that
31% remains a reasonable projected tax rate for the remainder of 2016, though the actual effective tax rate may differ
as a consequence of non-recurring items that could arise during the year.
Second quarter long-term net inflows of $2 billion reflected $16 billion of net new business from iShares offset by
outflows in active strategies and institutional index mandates. Over the last 12 months, BlackRock delivered long-term
net inflows of $126 billion, representing 3% organic growth.
Second quarter base fees were down 2% year-over-year despite generally flat average AUM, reflecting more than $250
billion in AUM mix change favoring lower fees, fixed income and cash assets, including the impact of divergent equity
beta. While the S&P 500 was down only 1% on average year-over-year, many markets linked to our higher fee equity
products, including emerging markets, Europe, Asia; natural resources and commodities experienced double-digit
declines.
Sequentially, base fees increased 6% driven by higher average AUM following the market rally in March. More recent
market volatility associated with Brexit had a minimal impact on second quarter base fees. While the operational
implications of Brexit will evolve over the coming quarters, we are well-positioned versus the industry as a function of
our globally diversified manufacturing, distribution, and operating platform.
Performance fees of $74 million decreased 46% versus a year ago, reflecting continuing performance challenges in the
hedge fund industry generally, and the impact of high watermarks on certain funds, specifically. The year-over-year
decline was driven primarily by fees associated with hedge fund related and certain long-only equity products.

BlackRock Solutions revenue of $172 million was up 7% year-over-year, and flat sequentially. Our Aladdin business,
which represented 85% of BRS revenue in the quarter, grew 13% year-over-year driven by several sizeable clients
going live on the Aladdin platform during the last year.
We continue to see strong market demand from institutional asset managers evidenced by the recent signing of one of
our largest clients to-date, which will be implemented over the next 18 months to 24 months.
As discussed at Investor Day, the rapidly-changing regulatory and financial landscape is [ph] also (06:42) driving
accelerated conversations with retail intermediaries about leveraging Aladdin's value proposition in the wealth
management space. Aladdin remains a key differentiator and the competitive advantage for BlackRock, enabling us to
communicate more effectively, and to serve clients more holistically and efficiently.
Total expense decreased to 2% year-over-year, driven primarily by lower compensation expense. Sequentially, total
expense increased 3%, driven primarily by higher compensation and AUM-related expense. Employee compensation
and benefit expenses was down [ph] $31 million (07:20) or 3% year-over-year, reflecting lower incentive
compensation. Sequentially, compensation and benefit expense increased $32 million or 3%, reflecting higher incentive
compensation driven by higher operating income and performance fees relative to the first quarter, partially offset by
lower seasonal employer payroll taxes in the current quarter.
Distribution and servicing costs increased 12% sequentially due to the acquisition of BofA Global Capital Management
and reduced money market fund fee waivers, which have historically been shared by our distribution partners. G&A
expense was essentially flat year-over-year and sequentially, reflecting continued expense discipline despite the impact
of recent acquisitions on our run rate. As we mentioned last quarter, and assuming stable markets, we still anticipate
full-year 2016 G&A expense to be roughly in line with 2015 levels.
Our second quarter as adjusted operating margin of 43.9% was down 100 basis points year-over-year, but up 230 basis
points sequentially, primarily reflecting the marginal impact of changes in base and performance fees in the respective
time periods, coupled with G&A expense discipline.
As we've stated in the past, we do not manage the business to a specific margin target. We do remain keenly focused on
delivering long-term value to our shareholders and will continue working to strike an appropriate balance between
organically investing for future growth and practical discretionary expense management.
We remain committed to using our cash flow to optimize shareholder value by first reinvesting in our business and then
returning excess cash to shareholders. In line with that commitment, in the second quarter, we closed the acquisition of
the BofA Global Capital Management, assuming investment management responsibilities for approximately $81 billion
of related cash and liquidity AUM, and leveraging scale of our cash management franchise.
During the second quarter, we also repurchased an additional $275 million worth of shares. Second quarter long-term
net inflows of $2 billion were driven by the diversity of our platform. Importantly, we saw strength in strategic focus
areas, including fixed income ETFs, smart beta, and factor products and infrastructure offerings.
Global iShares generated $16 billion of net new business in the second quarter led by fixed income net inflows of $10
billion. We continue to see investor appetite for risk-aware smart beta products with our minimum volatility funds
raising more than $6 billion during the quarter, and maintaining the number one market share position in the product
category. We also continue to see strong results in the Core Series, which is less sensitive to the macro environment,
raising $12 billion in net flows during the quarter.
Throughout the quarter, investors once again used iShares as their preferred vehicle to navigate market volatility and
express rapidly-changing investment views. Since the UK's decision to exit the EU, we have seen particular strength in
our European iShares range across asset classes, capturing over 70% market share over the past several weeks, as
clients leverage our industry-leading product breadth and liquidity.
BlackRock's global retail franchise saw $6 billion of long-term net outflows in another challenging quarter for the
industry as both domestic and cross-border fund flow suffered in light of political and macroeconomic events. The
global retail market is changing dramatically. DOL, RDR and MiFID are impacting the way wealth managers are

serving clients. Digital and technology offerings are proliferating and efficient beta products continue to take share
from active products.
While year-to-date industry domestic and cross-border active gross sales have slowed significantly due to macro
uncertainty and continued [ph] out-performance (11:21), we are confident that the breadth of our retail platform,
including active and passive investment products, solution and portfolio construction tools, and digital and risk
management capabilities collectively position BlackRock to be a market leader in this new environment.
Our institutional business saw $8 billion of long-term net outflows, primarily due to active fixed income net outflows
of $7 billion, driven largely by client reallocation activity. Despite volatility in EMEA, BlackRock continue to expand
our presence with institutional clients in Continental Europe, generating $8 billion in net inflows during the quarter,
and illustrating that while many clients are taking a wait-and-see approach, BlackRock remains the partner of choice
when they are prepared to invest.
In the United States, our defined contribution business generated net inflows of approximately $4 billion, driven by
LifePath and other target-date inflows and now accounts for over $650 billion of assets under management.
Finally, we saw positive flows in institutional illiquid alternatives, driven by continued momentum in infrastructure.
Illiquid alternatives remain a key area of growth for BlackRock as institutional clients increasingly search for additional
sources of income, and uncorrelated returns. We now have more $10 billion in committed, but uninvested capital to
deploy for clients.
As we communicated at Investor Day, we are intensely focused on adapting ahead of change. While the current market
environment is putting pressure on asset management companies and challenging historic business models, BlackRock
has built the industry's broadest global product and distribution platform to meet the changing needs of our clients and
drive long-term value for our shareholders.
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry.
Laurence D. Fink
Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. As Gary mentioned, our clients are facing
unprecedented challenges as they attempt to navigate the current investment environment, which I'll describe in more
detail in a moment. While this has caused many of our clients to pause their investment activity for the moment, this
also led to a more and deeper conversation with our clients than ever before. They are seeking our advice, they're
looking for our investment solutions and are wanting the risk analytics and technology that BlackRock can uniquely
offer.
We are better positioned, I mean, we, BlackRock, are better positioned than we've ever been to deliver the solutions
they need. Political and macroeconomic uncertainty including Brexit, the upcoming elections in France and the United
States, historically low yields and elevated market volatility, regulatory pressure including the DOL Solvency II. These
factors and others are leading clients of all types to pause as they assess both their own needs and their investment
options available for them.
Our pension clients with 7%-plus return expectations are facing an ever-expanding liability gap. Our insurance clients
with significant regulatory constraints cannot make their business models work in a zero-yield environment. Sovereign
wealth funds have been forced to focus on liquidity and funding needs after years of rapid growth. And individual
savers are wrestling with the choice of too much risk versus too little return, as they face the prospects of their own
underfunded retirement plan.
Where can clients turn to address these challenges? Today, there's $10 trillion of sovereign bonds that are delivering
negative returns and negative yields. Yet, Central Banks continue to be buying and global de-risking continues to bid
up this fixed income prices. Active equity managers as a group have underperformed over a multi-year period and are
seeking record outflows or seeing record outflows.

The blanket data strategy that worked so well post-crisis has come to more volatility, and divergence, and as Gary said,
as many European and Asian equity indexes have fallen year-to-date, even as the S&P is at a record level.
Today, the environment asset managers are operating – this is the operating model that we're seeing and the
environment we're seeing as an asset manager. Clients do not know what to do with their money. They are afraid and
they are pulling back as evidenced by more than $55 trillion in bank deposits sitting in the United States, China and
Japan alone. And even as markets have rallied recently, many clients have missed that upside and find themselves
feeling even further behind.
In difficult times, our clients need BlackRock more than ever. We believe that asset managers must evolve in an
anticipation of the fundamental shifts taking place in our industry, driven by technology, demographics, regulation so
that they are positioned to meet the clients' needs. And we, BlackRock, are doing that.
As we highlight at our recent Investor Day, BlackRock is constantly adapting. The differentiating platform we have
built at BlackRock over the past 28 years is resonating with our clients, and the diversity of product offerings, the risk
capabilities of Aladdin, the market insights offered by the BlackRock Investment Institute, our clients will need to put
their money to work. I can't predict when and how much, but when they do, I am confident that BlackRock has never
been better-positioned to capture those flows.
Whether a client is looking for an illiquid alternative investment or an ETF or an unconstrained fixed income strategy
or a smart beta or factor strategy or a multi-asset income product, we can deliver that solution and many others. But
most important is our ability to fashion solutions from the combination of these strategies to meet the unique needs of
our clients, all backed by our unmatched risk analytics and technology, and that is what's truly differentiating with
BlackRock, and that is what is now resonating with our clients.
As Gary mentioned, we saw $2 billion of long-term net inflows in the quarter. And over the last 12 months, we have
seen $126 billion of long-term net inflows across our platform. These flows are well diversified with $12 billion in
active, and $114 billion in index, including $96 billion from clients in the U.S., $30 billion from international clients.
We saw $39 billion and $85 billion in equity and fixed income net inflows, respectively. And we continue to generate
strong client commitments in our rapidly growing illiquid alternative business.
Since quarter-end, after Brexit, we continue to see accelerated flows in our iShares franchise with approximately $18
billion of net inflows thus far in July, bringing our 2016 net inflows to more than $56 billion. iShares currently has the
number one share of global and European ETF and our fixed income ETF flows year-to-date.
Let me talk about our fixed income flows. The fixed income iShares continue to be a substantial growth opportunity for
BlackRock, and we saw more than $67 billion of net inflows over the past 12 months. For some of you, you may
remember more than five years ago, some of our skeptics were still questioning the overall ETF growth story, and
downplaying the fixed income opportunity. We were outspoken about our ability to innovate and to build this market.
And today, with the fixed income ETF industry reaching $600 billion in total AUM, and our own franchises north of
$300 billion, we are the proven leader in this space, and our focus on the continued penetration of the $100 trillion
fixed income asset class.
And just as we were doing five years ago, today, we're investing to develop the solutions that will meet our clients'
needs in the future, including infrastructure, sustainable investing, big data, machine learning, factors and smart beta,
and also critically in technology, from our allotted franchise to our presence in digital wealth management with future
advisor.
Monetary policy has driven yields to record-low levels, while failing to stimulate economic growth and there's
significant need for a global fiscal policy response. Infrastructure investing will be critical component of that solution,
creating jobs, driving growth, providing investors with long-term opportunities for yield.
We are well-positioned to participate in that activity. Following another strong quarter of capital raising, BlackRock
now manages more than $8 billion in invested and committed capital across our infrastructure platform. Whether in
alternatives or across our active platform to continue to deliver alpha in the new market paradigm, you have to be

connected. You need scale, you have to leverage technology. And of course, you have to be smart and nimble.
BlackRock's Aladdin technology connects our global investor community on a common platform. The scale of our
trading and liquidity platform enables us to access market liquidity that few firms can, and we further enhance that
scale through the Bank of America Global Capital Management acquisition in the quarter.
Our data expertise allows us to turn large unstructured data sets into meaningful investment insights, and our risk and
quantitative analysis teams provide independent oversight to help identify both risks and opportunities. The platform
that we built is also a powerful means to recruit and retain industry's top talent. Most importantly, we announced that
we hired Mark Wiseman to lead our Unified Active Equity franchise.
In the quarter, performance across our active platform remains stable or improved with 80% in Fixed Income, 67% in
Fundamental Equity; 82% in Scientific Active Equity above their benchmark through peer medium for the last
three-year period. We're making significant investments in big data, artificial intelligence and machine learning. And
we saw more than $1 billion in Scientific Active Equity inflows in the quarter.
Factor-based investment strategies helps us bridge the gap between traditional active and index, and further fill out our
offerings as clients increasingly look to achieve access to broad, persistent drivers of return through low-cost efficient
vehicles. During the quarter, our global iShares minimum volatility fund raised more than $6 billion leading the ETF
industry's smart beta category. And BlackRock now manages more than $140 billion in AUM across a range of
factor-based strategies.
Technology has always been a core component of our value proposition, and a significant differentiator for BlackRock.
As the investment landscape evolves, technology is transitioning from a competitive advantage to a competitive
requirement. Those who do not invest in technology will not be able to meet their clients' long-term needs.
Technology remains a key area of focus and investment for BlackRock across all aspects of our business to enhance
our investment process, to enhance our client service, to create operational efficiencies, and are unifying BlackRock
Aladdin technology platform.
Aladdin revenues grew 13% year-over-year, and during the quarter we saw one of the largest clients – we've signed one
of the largest clients to-date. We expect Aladdin to continue to grow as we enhance capabilities to meet clients' current
and future needs as we expand Aladdin to serve additional clients across the financial ecosystem. We are breaking
down legacy systems to connect asset managers to asset servicers through provider Aladdin, and providing wealth
management organizations with institutional quality, risk oversight and analytics through our Aladdin for wealth
platform.
We also believe that the evolving technology and regulatory landscape including the new DOL rule in the U.S., digital
advice will play an integral role in increasing access and transparency for investors, and we continue to see strong
client interests in our future advisor platform as clients look to new and innovative wealth management solutions.
Clients not only turn to BlackRock to manage their assets, but also to help them understand the larger-term impact of
global events. The BlackRock Investment Institute leads that discussion to help clients understand the immediate
results of the Brexit vote. BII hosted two client calls the morning after the vote with more than 10,000 participants
worldwide. This level of engagement and participation is a testament to BlackRock's position in the industry not only
as an asset manager, but as a thought leader, and this allows us to be a greater trusted advisor.
Going forward, we will continue to see changes. We'll see changes in markets, changes in technology, changes in
demographics and regulation. This is all driving the changing needs of our clients, and we will continue to adapt our
business to serve those needs in that ever-changing world. We are in a difficult environment for our clients and our
industry, but challenging environments have always been when BlackRock has been able to make the biggest leaps
forward.
Today, many of our clients are apprehensive, and they are coming to us and asking us for advice. As I've said, our
client dialogs had never been better, and we have never been in a better position to serve our clients' needs. That is why
I have never seen, in our 28-year history, more opportunity for BlackRock than I do today.

Now, let's open it up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Hi, Michael.
<Q - Michael Roger Carrier>: Hi, Larry. How are you doing?
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Good.
<Q - Michael Roger Carrier>: Larry, I guess, just a first question, I think, everyone, when you look at BlackRock,
and you look at all the products that you guys offer, and you've proven that over time, in terms of the organic growth
that you're able to generate. For this quarter, it's a bit surprising, but the backdrop has been anything but normal.
But when you think about some of the comments that you made, particularly on the institutional side in terms of flows,
you look at all the cash on the sidelines, you look at where equity valuations are, where yields are, when you're talking
to clients, is there a risk for the industry that, we see a lot of money remaining on the sidelines for a period of time, just
given the lack of opportunities. Or do you think that there's still enough, I don't know, conversations or drive to allocate
some of these cash into other solutions that can still generate some attractive returns?
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Sure. Well, first and foremost, clients want to put money to work. They're pausing, that's
certainly true. I think, we're seeing an anomaly right now. We're seeing – if you look at our ETF flows since Brexit, I
would say the majority of those inflows are probably – are institutional. Because at the same time, I'm sure you're
looking at the data, there's still outflows in mutual funds, which tells you obviously retail are still selling, but that
divergence is quite stark and shocking to see that type of differential.
The dialogs we're having with clients are, as I said, as robust as possible. Some clients are looking to put money to
work. The issue is, some clients who have regulatory issues or capital issue, investing in bond yields at this time, I
guess, it's more difficult. Some of them are looking to invest in dividend stock.
And so, I believe, we're going to see more unlocking of money over the course of the next 12 months. I can't predict
whether it's the third quarter, but I'm particularly surprised at the sheer volume of inflows in iShares in the first 14 days
of the month, which is public, so I can talk about it; and the dialog we're having institutionally.
We've seen some good flows and awards in alternatives already this quarter. So, it is not as – I won't call it to be
systematic and easy, it is more periodic and idiosyncratic depending on the clients' need, but this is a time for us to be
in front of our clients more than ever before as they are questioning their asset allocation, where should they put
money, how should they think about it.
And so, Michael, I can't predict one quarter over another, but what I can say over a long period of time, there is huge
pent-up demand, and I believe we will be more involved than ever before. I can't say about the industry, though.

<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Hi, Craig.

decent amount of spectrum, I imagine there's a lot of pent-up demand for alternatives, infrastructure, et cetera. What's

your thought on that? When are we going to see some more of this money move and how is BlackRock positioned for
that?
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Well, I think we've been consistent in saying; we're continuing to grow our illiquid alts
business. I said, just from the last question, we have been awarded one or two mandates already this quarter in the alts
space. I think, across the board, we're well-positioned. It really depends on what category; you mentioned
infrastructure. We have a huge emphasis in this. We are continuing to hire people there. We are in dialog with many
different parts of the world related to infrastructure investing. As we find those investments, it's very easy to find the
capital.
So, as you know, we have about $30 billion real asset platform, $15 billion in fund of funds with private equity where
we continue to see growth in private credit. We're well-positioned in some of these products. Other products, we're not
as well-positioned as others. But importantly, I could say, with absolute confidence, the positioning we have in the alts
space with our clients has never been more robust. And obviously, we are not – in some of the platforms, we're not as
strong because it was not one of our core competencies 15 years ago, and we've been building it.
We did a – we have institutional client survey. And in that survey, we did determine that 53% of our clients are going
to be reallocating more into alts and real assets. So, I think that feeds what you just asked. And so, we believe we're in a
very good position for it. I would argue, though, some of the asset classes, the reason why they've done poorly in the
alternative space is because there's so much money chasing these so few investments.
<A - Gary S. Shedlin>: Craig, just recall that when you look at the numbers that you see, it's a little complicated
because remember we've got commitments coming in that don't impact our net new business for the quarter, but we
have return of capital going out that does impact our net new business for the quarter, so on a – we kind of normalize
for that.
In terms of the institutional business for the quarter, we did see NNB before return of capital of about [ph] $800 million
(34:02) – let's call it, [ph] $25 million (34:04), again, infrastructure [indiscernible] (34:08) in BAA as Larry,
mentioned. And we also did, institutionally, another $700 million of commitments in the quarter, again, infrastructure
opportunities to credit and BAA, what I think was critically important. Our total today is about $10 billion of
uninvested, but committed capital that, as you know, will hit NNB as the assets go on the ground.

Your next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Hi, Alex.
<Q - Alexander Blostein>: Thanks. Hey, Larry. Good morning. So, I was hoping to zone in a little bit more on the
active fixed income business for you, guys. I guess, a) just a little bit of color around the reallocation you highlighted in
the second quarter where there was kind of one-off event.
And then just broadly, given the negative yield dynamic that you brought up earlier, I was just hoping you can
comment on your unconstrained bond platform, because it sounds like, that's the product that could solve some of the
issues. And the uptick has been good, but perhaps a little bit slower the last couple of quarters, so maybe you can
comment on that as well. Thanks.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Rob, why don't you...
<A - Robert S. Kapito>: Yeah. So, let me give you a little bit of a deeper dive on the fixed income results for the
quarter. So, clients continue to search for free yield in a low-rate environment, and in the quarter, we saw significant
equity market volatility. So, fixed income has remained a critical component of most clients' portfolios. We continue to
have very strong performance across our fixed income franchise with 80% of assets above the benchmark or peer
median for the three-year period.

iShares had $10 billion of fixed income net inflows, and that was driven by strong flows into investment grade
corporates, broad U.S. or EM debt and TIPS. The fixed income ETF industry recently reached by the way $600 billion
in total AUM, and that's doubled over the past four years. And our own franchise is north of $300 billion, and we see
significant opportunity to increase the penetration of the $100 trillion global fixed income market.
Now, let's drill deeper. Just on July 7, to give you an idea, LQD, which is our corporate bond fund took in $1.1 billion
of net inflows, and that was a record daily inflow for a corporate bond ETF. So, on the retail side, the fixed income
business continues to be strong, and it's led by total return. And it's also led by our strategic municipal offering. We saw
$2 billion of net inflows into retail active fixed income.
And on the institutional side, the active fixed income net outflows of $7 billion were driven primarily by client
reallocation activity in Asia Pac and in the U.S. And clients continue to come in and ask for presentations on strategic
income opportunities. The reason being, giving the portfolio manager more tools, more ability to find different types of
fixed income securities with lower risk, but higher returns in a low interest rate environment. So, we believe that, that
area of the market is going to continue to grow, as well as from the iShares fixed income side.

Your next question is from Bill Katz with Citigroup.
<Q - William Raymond Katz>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Hi, Bill.
<Q - William Raymond Katz>: Good morning. I want to thank you for taking my question. Just to switch gears a
little bit, big picture, Larry. I guess, there's been some talk coming out of D.C. about some building liquidity constraints
or requirements for mutual funds. I was wondering what you – if you could share with us, maybe what you're hearing,
and what the implication might be across the business, if any?
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: I don't know much more. As we said in the last quarter, we are supportive of rules that
enhance investor protection. We are highly enthusiastic with rules that give more confidence to investors, that they
believe it's a level playing field so they can invest. And if we can see that confidence build and unlock some of these
huge cash holdings, we're in a very good position. So, I want to put that in the context of what is being proposed.
We certainly don't know the end results of how liquidity is going to be addressed. The disclosures related liquidity, we
know. And the proposed document that the SEC is looking at different buckets how you analyze and risk, they're going
to set a limit to the illiquid bucket of 15%. Overall, we have been very supportive of these rules, and we believe there's
a need for better disclosure related to the composition of all portfolios.
As you know, we've been founded on a culture of understanding and managing the risks, and importantly, it is rules
like the liquidity rule or even the DOL rule that is, I believe, some of the foundational reasons why we see accelerated
interest in having a dialog with us in a risk platform or a risk technology with Aladdin.
So, I don't know much more than that, Bill, but we are a constructive participant in the dialog with the SEC, and we
hope that we have that transparency in all the funds, and understanding so people – investors can understand what are
the embedded liquidity risk in these funds, and we don't know how they're going to respond to the differentiation
between a mutual fund and a ETF or how they look at them differently. So, we don't know enough and we'll wait and
see when they come out with a final comment period – final proposal and then we'll have another comment period.

<Q - Eric Berg>: Thanks much. Good morning. Given that there has been a decline in the quarter or decline in the
retail business, but the iShare business in terms of your last 12 month organic growth remains as strong as ever. Is it
possible here that what we're seeing is less a slowdown in the investor interest and more just a continued shifting of
investor interest, not a slowdown in retail investor interest, but just a continued shifting of investor preference from
active to the iShares?
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: I think that is a trend. But I think, it's more than that. I think it is, as I said, I think some of
the great growth in the fixed income ETF platform is related to the illiquidity in some of the marketplaces. If people are
looking for exposures, they could go buy an ETF for that type of exposures. But we believe the marketplace – like we
do agree with the notion of what PwC has suggested, that ETFs are going to continue to grow, and maybe double in
size.
I think, the big thing, Eric, maybe a bigger issue is, we're seeing a redefinement of active. As you heard where we're
making our investments, our investments are smart beta, which is a form of active. It's not, we could call it, tethered
active, but it is a form of active, where we're talking about using factors as analysis and our minimum volatility ETF is
a great way of getting active, some form of active returns through a ETF platform.
So, I think it's technology using different instruments like ETFs. But more importantly, I think preferences are
changing. So, the old way of investing maybe just as a – in categories of market capitalization is certainly going to be
changing. And so, I think it's more than just a preference out of active and passive.
I'm a big believer that active will play a role in the future. So, let's be clear about it. We believe whether it is –
alternatives is an active product. We are a big believer that – and in some categories like in Asian equities and
components of European equities and in some areas in the U.S. equity market where active returns can and show
outperformance over index.
But, I think what you're seeing also is a trend that iShares is taking some share away of people buying individual
stocks. That's one thing that I think, and maybe iShares is taking away from buying individual bonds. These are things
that – the dynamics that are changing. We are seeing more investors talk about asset allocation instead of individual
stocks.
And I think, probably the most important thing I want to just allude to, obviously, in the last four months, we've seen
some really accelerated outflows, we, the industry, in active equities. I would not write it off over a long cycle.
And I would just give you a better perspective on BlackRock. We had eight quarters in a row of positive flows. And so,
I'm not – I don't know if this is the beginning of a trend, but we all should pay attention. But I do believe it is the
technology of ETFs, the simplicity of ETFs. A quick, easy way of getting exposures is now driving more demand in
those products. And we believe they will continue to drive demand. And as I said, we do believe the ETF business will
double in size in the next five years.

<Q - Robert Lee>: Thanks. Good morning, Larry.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: [ph] Good morning (45:45).
<Q - Robert Lee>: Hey. How are you? Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to maybe talk a
little bit about – go back to the DOL rule, and a couple of things around that. I guess the first thing is, I mean, even
though it's just kind of announced, it is a relatively short implementation or it was effective next April, which means, I
guess, distributors have to decide soon how they're going to deal with it, and what that means for you guys.

So first thing is, do you have any better sense of how – not so much in terms of more to iShares demand, but maybe
from a cost or expense perspective, how you think this may flow back into BlackRock and your peers in particular?
How does a distributor continue to demand kind of payment for access in a DOL world?
And then, maybe related to that, you did develop the Aladdin for wealth platform or adopt the Aladdin platform for the
wealth market. Kind of curious, any update on how you're seeing the uptake on that or potential uptake on that platform
in the wealth management market?
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: So, really good questions. I don't have much better insight than probably you do at the
moment. We are having constant conversation with all our distribution partners. There are some partners who believe
the DOL will be revolutionary for their business, and there are some of our distribution partners who believe it's
evolutionary. It does mean change for the business, and I think we're very well positioned for those changes in the
business.
As I said in our first quarter results that, once again, if better understanding, better outcome for the ultimate investor
with it, which leads to more investible assets out of cash, that's all good for the ecosystem of our distribution partners,
and really good for the asset management industry.
Two; I think it's – it most certainly as you raised the question related to Aladdin for wealth, most certainly, I think the
DOL, and the responsibilities under the DOL, it's going to mean a much tighter risk management oversight culture with
all of the clients, and we are having robust dialog with everybody on the uptake of Aladdin for wealth, and we'll see
how that plays out. I don't have anything tangible yet to say, but I will say, we are in very deep dialog, and I am very
optimistic that there will be uptake for Aladdin for wealth.
And I do believe, as I said, the DOL puts much more responsibility on the firm, on the financial advisor to act in a
fiduciary way. There's a big dialog, as we know, the DOL is only about retirement assets. The big dialog is, does that
force an upgrading of fiduciary standards for all of the business, that could be debated among different people.
So, I don't know what it means in outcome. I think the positive side – so I am taking this in the long run a positive for
most distribution partners. I think, they will have – they have to obviously have much more oversight and
understanding of the clients' assets as a fiduciary. But I do believe that they're going to have more centralization. I think
they're going to have almost more like a European model, where you have CIOs who determine which mutual funds,
what platform.
And as you know, because we've talked about the European experience now for at least eight years, and one of our
strong positioning in Europe with that CIO model. I believe, the DOL will move the U.S. more to a CIO model.
Obviously, we know it's going to move for those that are appropriate more to a advisory model instead of a
commission-based model. And for those clients that have that advisory relationship, it may build a deeper relationship
between the client and the distribution partner, and their advisor. And I believe because of our scale, our positioning,
we will be a huge beneficiary of that positioning.

Your next question comes Chris Harris with Wells Fargo.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Hi, Chris.
<Q - Chris M. Harris>: Thanks. Hey, Larry. I want to come back to the interest rate discussion for a second. We know
money market funds have been waiving fees for some time now just because rates are so low. If medium to long-term
interest rates continue to decline, might bond funds have to start doing similar things? And if they might have to, are
we getting close to having to worry about this risk?
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Well, if anything, we've had a 25 basis point increase in the United States. So actually
money market funds in many cases are in a better position today than they were a year ago.

You're saying – as you suggested a flattening of the yield curve. I actually don't believe. I mean, we've seen the 10-year
go down to as low as what 135 basis points, and we're 147 basis points right now, [indiscernible] (51:24) 146 basis
points. The two-year note's still trading at 66 basis points or approximately around that area.
If the U.S. goes down that path or we're reversing that increase, and indeed Fed Reserve needs to ease, that's a whole
different issue. I don't see that as an outcome at this moment. I believe, the U.S. economy is growing not as well as we
want it to be, but I think, we will see a 2% economy this year, which would tell – and we still have plus or minus a 5%
unemployment rate in this country.
So, despite all the headwinds and uncertainties, I don't see at this time a Fed Reserve that turns itself into a Central
Bank that has to aggressively ease. So, it may delay their path towards normalizing of interest rates, but I don't see any
possibility at this moment that they will be forced to going back into an easy mode.
I think the actions of the Bank of England, today, is another good example. Marketplace anticipated easing. They
suggested in their commentary that they're going to possibly ease in August and looking for more data. So, if the UK
growth rate does fall like we at BlackRock anticipate, it doesn't mean it falls worldwide. It moves around.
And I would tell you very clearly; the U.S. economy is still the area where people want to invest worldwide. And I
don't see that – I don't see the atmosphere where I have to worry about money market funds in the United States any
time soon. I think we're going to live in this environment at low rates for a long time, now.

Your next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Hi, Mike.
<Q - Michael J. Cyprys>: Hey, Good morning. Just a question on the illiquid strategies, an area of growth that you
guys, have been flagging; can you talk a little bit more about the private credit space, how you're building out that part
of the business? And do you feel that you have all the pieces, parts or would you look to buy anything? And then, if
you could just also touch upon some of the demand trends that you see, especially in light of this low-rate
environment?
<A - Robert Lee>: Yeah. So, the private credit business is really one that is very customized and very specific to the
institutional investor that is looking to find uncorrelated investments in the marketplace, that you'd say are little outside
of the box. And we put together a very, very strong team that has backgrounds in private equity, in venture capital, in
credit and using all of the resources that we have. And you could imagine that for us, at BlackRock, there are so many
resources and so many types of transactions that we see. We never really had a pocket of money to take advantage of
those opportunities.
So, putting this group together, we have been able to source transactions from all across the globe for these institutional
clients that, while they're a little outside of the box, the risk tolerance fits very perfectly, the return profile in most of
these cases is double-digit returns, and they're not correlated at all with various parts of the market to basically
diversify their portfolios.
So, the other part of this, which is quite interesting is that, they come in very large sizes. So, these institutions that are
looking to invest here are north of $1 billion type mandates. The struggle for many institutions in this is to get the
money invested. We haven't had a problem in finding the opportunities. We just never really went after them.
So, this is in the area that we continue to add resources to. We continue to use and coordinate within the firm to source
assets for this, and we're very optimistic and quite frankly, when we were sitting down with a lot of the large
institutions this is exactly what they're looking for.
And I might add one of the things that we're going to have Mark Wiseman, when he comes in, is also help us to source
these assets because in his previous job he is one of the guys that's in the forefront of the industry that has been able to

closing remarks.
Laurence D. Fink
Well, I really truly wanted to say thank you for joining us and your continued interest in BlackRock. Like I promised
you, we will continue to evolve our business to enhance the differentiating platform of BlackRock's diverse and global
platform. I could also probably tell you that our dialogs with our clients were never been deeper, more robust. And
when those opportunities prevail, we will be a component of their future allocations.
Our relentless focus on always improving the firm will drive that future growth, and will continue to create that
long-term value for you as our shareholders. And I believe, we're in a good position to do that. With that, have a good
