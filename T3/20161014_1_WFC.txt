MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Regina and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome
everyone to the Wells Fargo Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent
any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Rowe, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Rowe, you may begin the
conference.
James H. Rowe
Thank you, Regina, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our President and CEO,
Tim Sloan; and our CFO, John Shrewsberry, will discuss third quarter results and answer your questions. This call is
being recorded.
Before we get started, I would like to reminder you that our third quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are

Timothy J. Sloan
Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us today. A lot has happened since our last
earnings call. So our formal presentation this morning will be a little bit longer than usual.
I couldn't be more proud of our financial performance in the third quarter, and John Shrewsberry will be discussing
those results more in a few minutes. But I'd like to focus on the events of the past few weeks and the impact on our
company.
This week, John Stumpf announced that he was retiring from Wells Fargo and the board. He made this decision
because he believed his leadership had become a distraction and therefore the best thing for Wells Fargo was for him to
retire. This action demonstrates the dedication John has had to Wells Fargo throughout his 34 years with the company
including successfully leading us through the financial crisis and the largest merger in baking history. As the new CEO,
my immediate and highest priority is to restore trust in Wells Fargo.
As you know, on September 8, we announced settlements with the CFPB, the OCC, and the Los Angeles City Attorney
related to sales practices in retail banking. I know that this is not the type of activity you expect from Wells Fargo and
is certainly not what we expect from ourselves. We let down our customers, our shareholders, and our team members.
We simply failed to fulfill our responsibility to all our stakeholders.
Our vision of satisfying our customers' financial needs and helping them to succeed financially is about building
lifelong relationships one customer at a time. The core values of Wells Fargo are as true today as they were a month
ago, a year ago, and 164 years ago. However, we had serious problems in our retail bank where products became the
focus rather than the relationships with our customers. Our senior management could have and should have done more.
I am fully committed, along with the entire leadership team, to fixing these issues and taking the necessary actions to
restore our customers' trust.
We have a specific action plan in place to lead our company forward during this period, which is focused on outreach
to everyone who has been impacted by retail banking sales practices including our customers, our team members, our
investors, our regulators, elected officials, and the communities that we do business in. It includes being transparent in
our communication and we've included a lot of information in this quarterly supplement for you.
On pages three and four, we provided some background regarding the sales practices settlements along with details of
the account review that was completed by PricewaterhouseCoopers. I believe most of these facts are familiar to you,
but let me highlight a few key points.
The 2.1 million consumer and small business accounts that were identified as accounts that may not have been
authorized cost Wells Fargo much more than the $2.6 million of fees we received, which we have fully refunded. And
let me clarify that these accounts had a de minimis impact to the retail banking household cross-sell ratio that we report
on a quarterly basis, with the maximum impact in any one quarter of 0.02 products per household or 0.3% of the
reported metric. At no time were all of the identified accounts included in our reported cross-sell ratio because unused
deposit accounts rolled off. While the revenue generated was small relative to our annual income and the impact on our
cross-sell ratio was not material, the implications for our company and on the trust of our customers are significant.
We made several changes to enhance our oversight, expand customer transparency and improve the customer
experience, which we highlight on page five. Effective October 1, we eliminated product sales goals for our retail

banking team members, and next year, we will introduce a new performance plan based on updated metrics around
customer service, growth and risk management. We want to make sure nothing gets in the way of doing what is right
for our customers, and the elimination of product sales goals has been positively received by both our team members
and our customers.
And we have made system and process enhancements, including sending automated emails, application
acknowledgments and multi-factor authentication. We expect to spend a total of over $50 million this year on enhanced
quality assurance monitoring. We've implemented an independent third-party mystery shopper program, targeting
15,000 to 20,000 annual visits to our branches to test actual product purchase interactions. We've added risk
professionals to provide greater oversight and significantly expanded our customer complaint servicing and resolution
process. We will continue to invest in process enhancements and product monitoring or proactive monitoring, and
we're committed to getting it right for our customers.
We're reaching out to all retail and small business checking, savings, credit card and unsecured line of credit customers,
and we are asking them to contact us if they have any concerns about their accounts or any aspect of their relationship
with Wells Fargo. We have dedicated resources available 24/7 for inquiries and questions. In cases where customers
believe they have received a product that they did not want or authorize and they are not satisfied with our resolution,
we are providing an option of mediation through a third-party that is convenient and free for the customer. Our team
members are proactively calling and meeting with our customers in all areas of the company.
Additionally, we've been working on contacting the credit card customers identified by PricewaterhouseCoopers. As a
reminder, their analysis included all credit cards that were opened, but not activated. There are a lot of reasons why
customers don't activate their cards, so we're trying to contact all un-activated credit card customers with open accounts
to confirm whether they want their credit cards. For consumer credit card customers identified, over half have closed
their accounts, in part reflecting the passage of time as some of these accounts were opened five years ago. For those
accounts that are still open, we've called 166,000 un-activated customers so far, and we have spoken with 34,000
customers who have made a decision whether to keep or close their account. Of those customers, 17% have said that
they did not apply for a credit card, and 8% said that they did not recall applying for a credit card.
We are also focused on determining potential additional impacts that the identified consumer and small business
deposit and credit card customers may have incurred. We've allocated significant resources to this effort. We are
contracting with a third-party firm to work with us, as well as with the primary credit card bureaus to develop a plan for
submission to the regulators for their approval. Here is what we've learned so far.
According to FICO, the impact on FICO scores from a credit card application varies based on a person's unique credit
history. But in general, credit inquiries have a small impact on FICO scores. For most people, one additional credit
inquiry will take fewer than five points off their FICO scores for a period of up to 12 months. We are working on
determining potential financial impact for customers who obtained a loan with Wells Fargo or another company during
the 12-month period where their FICO score may have been impacted by the credit inquiry. For example, if the loan
was from Wells Fargo and the customer was impacted by a lower FICO score, we will adjust the line size, modify
pricing and refund any additional costs incurred. As we did with our original account analysis in all circumstances, our
intent is to err on the side of the customer and to make it right.
We have been actively monitoring and tracking our customer activity since the announcement. In order to be as
transparent as possible, on page nine, we are providing data to compare activity levels across a number of metrics in
retail banking. When analyzing these trends versus the prior month, it is important to remember that September had two
fewer business days this year than August.
While it is too early to determine the long-term impact and we're prepared for things to get worse before they get better,
here is what we've observed so far. Our customer traffic to our branches and call centers remained at typical levels for
September. Customers calling and speaking to a phone banker are up 4% from a year ago, and so far, formal
complaints related to sales practices have been less than 1% of the calls we've received.

Historically, approximately 70% of banker interactions are service, not sales related, and this percentage increased
slightly in September. Customer visits with bankers in our branches, a subset of overall customer traffic, were down
10% in September compared with a year ago. The lower level of interactions in September was driven by lower internal
referrals, decreased product offerings, and reduced marketing. We have begun to reintroduce marketing and we'll be
gradually increasing our marketing efforts throughout the coming months.
The drivers of lower banker interactions also resulted in new consumer checking account openings declining 25% in
September compared with openings in September a year ago. To put this in perspective, account openings were down
143,000 from a year ago on a base of 33.2 million accounts.
We continued to have year-over-year growth in primary consumer checking customers, up 4.5% in September. As a
reminder, primary checking customers are those who actively use their checking accounts, and therefore this metric
was not impacted by the accounts identified by PricewaterhouseCoopers. Our deposit customers continue to use their
accounts, with balances up $6.5 billion in September compared with August and debit card transactions up 9% from a
year ago.
Lower referrals, marketing and product offerings also impacted credit card applications, which were down 20% in
September compared with September a year ago. Applications were down 77,000 from a year ago compared with 7.8
million total active cards. We continue to see increased usage among our customers, with active cards up 9%, balances
up 10%, and transaction volume also up 10% from a year ago.
We are also actively monitoring customer experience scores with over 80,000 branch customer surveys completed in
September. Loyalty scores in September were down from an all-time high in August, but were consistent with where
they were as recently as two years ago. We also asked customers about the quality of their most recent branch visit. The
score in September was down from August, but was also consistent with two years ago. Our enhanced focus on service
seeks to bring these scores back to pre-settlement levels as we work to rebuild confidence and trust with our customers.
We're also tracking the impact from the announcement on our other businesses, which we highlight on page 10.
Mortgage referrals from retail banking, which account for 10% of our year-to-date mortgage originations, were down
24% from August to September. Auto originations have been minimally impacted since over 90% of our originations
were through the indirect channel in the third quarter. We remain focused on maintaining our deep and long-tenured
dealer relationships, which drive most of our origination volume in our auto business.
Within Wholesale Banking, our team members are actively meeting with customers and responding to their concerns.
There have been a few state treasurers and municipalities who have made public announcements about temporarily
suspending certain business activity with Wells Fargo, while several others have reaffirmed their relationship with us.
Overall, we did not see any meaningful change in business trends in Wholesale Banking late in the quarter, and deposit
balances were up 4% during the month of September and loan pipelines were in line with the second quarter.
We've also seen minimal impact so far within our Wealth and Investment Management business. September ending
deposit balances were up 1% from August month-end and up 11% from a year ago. Client transaction activity was
muted in September, but largely reflected the market environment. Retail brokerage advisory flows in September were
strong, up $1.6 billion from August. September closed referred investment assets, these are the referrals resulting from
the Wealth, Community Banking partnership, were more than $1 billion, in line with prior trends. But these referred
assets are dependent on banker referrals, so we will be watching this trend very closely.
We've always believed that our team members are our most important asset, and it's been disturbing to hear claims of
retaliations against team members who contacted the EthicsLine. We are investigating these claims. We are also
assisting former team members who left retail banking due to sales performance and who remain eligible for rehire in
applying for available positions at the company.
Leaders throughout Wells Fargo have had ongoing regular outreach with their teams throughout our markets. Mary
Mack, who is the new Head of Community Banking, has met with team members in 10 cities so far to gather ideas,
concerns, and questions from frontline retail managers at all levels to help inform the go-forward strategy for a
service-driven community bank.

Eight additional executive officers and their leadership teams met with more than 116,000 team members across the
country. During these meetings, we're reinforcing our Code of Ethics, Business Conduct, EthicsLine, and
non-retaliation policies. We're also shifting our language in retail banking training and communications to make it more
customer focused, less sales focused and reinforcing our commitment to do what's right for our customers.
We offer all of our team members competitive pay and benefits, which we highlight on slide 12. For example, tellers
and customer service representatives earn at least $12 an hour, 60% above the Federal minimum wage. 99% of team
members are eligible for company-sponsored health benefits, and our benefits programs cover more than 515,000 team
members, spouses/domestic partners, and their dependents.
We believe that team member engagement is critical to our success, and each spring our team members have the
opportunity to take an anonymous survey administered through Gallup. It's a chance for our team members to share
their perspective on what it's like to work at Wells Fargo. In 2016, over 90% of eligible team members participated in
the survey, and Wells Fargo's overall engagement scores were above 88% of the companies represented in Gallup's
database. While we ranked high on the survey, this is not the only mechanism to identify team member concerns like
sales practices and we're implementing other ways for our team members to share their views with management.
Our team members are active in the communities where they live and work, and in 2015, the United Way ranked our
workplace-giving campaign the largest in the U.S. for the seventh year in a row. We've just finished our 2016 campaign
last week, and during the time that has been very challenging for our company, our team members demonstrated their
continued support for their communities. The preliminary contribution results are similar to last year.
We're also committed to team member development, and last year, we invested $300 million in team member training
in credit, risk, technology and customer service. Additionally, we provided $21 million in tuition reimbursement. As
we move through this period, we will continue to be transparent regarding trends across the company.
John Shrewsberry will now discuss the details of our financial results.
John R. Shrewsberry
Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Our strong financial results in the third quarter were relatively
straightforward, and in order to allow extra time to take questions, my prepared remarks regarding our results will be
shorter than usual. I want to start on page 13 with a few key takeaways from our third quarter results, which reflect the
benefit of our diversified business model and the momentum across many of our businesses.
For the 16th consecutive quarter, we generated earnings of greater than $5 billion. Our loan, investment and deposit
balances are all at record levels. Compared with the second quarter, we grew revenue driven by growth in net interest
income. Many of our businesses had their best non-interest income results in five quarters, including strong mortgage
banking results. We grew revenue despite equity gains being at five-quarter lows and $780 million lower than a year
ago.
Expense growth was driven by higher operating losses and a contribution to the Wells Fargo Foundation. Credit quality
improved, including lower losses in our oil and gas portfolio, and our capital position remained strong as we returned
$3.2 billion to shareholders.
Turning to page 15, let me highlight a few balance sheet trends. I believe our balance sheet has never been stronger. We
grew loans and deposits, and our liquidity and capital remained strong. Our funding sources grew in the third quarter
with long-term debt up $10.9 billion on $20 billion of issuances, including $9.2 billion that we anticipate will be TLAC
eligible. We also had strong deposit growth, up $30.4 billion from the second quarter. We purchased $57 billion of
securities during the quarter, primarily agency MBS in our available-for-sale portfolio. The amount of securities
purchased was higher than in prior quarters, but wasn't outsized when factoring in that we did not add duration in the
loan portfolio with interest rate swaps, as we had in prior quarters. We remain asset-sensitive and will benefit if rates
increase.

Turning to the income statement overview on page 16, revenue increased $166 million from second quarter, with net
interest income up $219 million. The slight decline in non-interest income was driven by a $303 million reduction in
market-sensitive revenue, which is at its lowest level in the past five quarters, and a decrease in other income reflecting
the $290 million gain on the sale of our health benefit services business last quarter. The $402 million increase in
expenses from second quarter was primarily driven by a $243 million increase in operating losses on higher litigation
accruals. We also had a $107 million contribution to the Foundation during the quarter. I will provide more detail on
expenses later on the call.
As shown on page 17, loans grew 6% from a year ago and were up $4.1 billion from the second quarter. Commercial
loans grew $1.9 billion from the second quarter on higher commercial real estate and C&I loans. Consumer loans were
up $2.2 billion, with growth in first mortgage loans, auto, credit cards, student lending and securities-based lending.
On page 18, we highlight year-over-year loan growth. I am not going to highlight each portfolio, but as you can see on
this page, we had strong and broad-based growth across many of our commercial and consumer portfolios. As
highlighted on page 19, we had a record $1.3 trillion of average deposits in the third quarter, up $62.6 billion or 5%
from year ago, and included 8% growth in consumer and small business banking deposits. Our average deposit cost
was stable with second quarter at 11 basis points and up 3 basis points from a year ago, reflecting an increase in deposit
pricing for certain wholesale banking customers.
Page 20 highlights our revenue diversification. Our results continued to benefit from our growth in earning assets and
our diversified business model. Net interest income was up $219 million or 2% from the second quarter, reflecting
earning asset growth and one additional day in the quarter. The net interest margin declined 4 basis points from the
second quarter, primarily driven by growth in long-term debt and deposits, partially offset by the benefit of earning
asset growth. Net interest income grew 4% from a year ago, even with a 14 basis point reduction in NIM.
Non-interest income declined $53 million from the second quarter, which included a $290 million gain on the sale of
our health benefit services business, and declined $42 million from a year ago, which included $780 million of higher
gains from equity investments. Across a number of our fee businesses, we had the best results in five quarters,
including deposit accounts, trust and investment, mortgage banking, and lease income.
Our mortgage banking results reflected strong residential and commercial mortgage originations. Residential
origination volume was $70 billion, up $15 billion, or 27%, from a year ago, and up $7 billion from the second quarter,
which is typically the strongest quarter due to seasonality in the purchase market. Applications were up 5% from
second quarter, and we ended the third quarter with a $50 billion unclosed pipeline, the highest since second quarter of
2013. Our production margin on residential held-for-sale mortgages was 181 basis points in the third quarter, up 15
basis points from the second quarter.
Given our strong pipeline at the end of the third quarter, we currently expect origination volume in the fourth quarter to
be up from a year ago, but down slightly from the third quarter due to seasonality in the purchase market. And we
currently expect a production margin in the fourth quarter to be at or above the upper end of the range of the past five
quarters, which was 188 basis points.
As shown on page 23, expenses increased $402 million from the second quarter driven by $243 million of higher
operating losses reflecting increased litigation accruals. Operating losses continue to increase related to outstanding
legal matters such as sales practice issues, as we've disclosed – or as we've disclosed in our 10-K filing RMBS, $125
million in higher salaries due to an extra day in the quarter and FTE growth, $107 million donation to the Wells Fargo
Foundation, and higher FDIC insurance expense reflecting the increase in deposit assessments.
Expenses also reflected lower foreclosed asset expense from commercial foreclosed asset recoveries and lower
commissions and incentive compensation expense, reflecting the forfeiture of unvested equity awards from John
Stumpf and Carrie Tolstedt. Our efficiency ratio was 59.4% in the third quarter and we expect the efficiency ratio to
remain at an elevated level.
While our expenses increased this quarter, we remain focused on managing expenses while actively reinvesting in the
franchise for future growth, which we highlight on page 24. We focus on reducing non-core businesses in order to

simplify our organization and improve our risk profile. We're also working on creating a simpler and more
collaborative way to seamlessly serve customers and team members by aligning similar teams in areas like marketing,
finance and operations. We've also been reducing discretionary spending such as travel and facilities.
Earlier this week, we announced the formation of a new Payments, Virtual Solutions and Innovation group that will be
led by Avid Modjtabai. This new group will bring teams from across the company together to accelerate our focus on
delivering the next-generation of payments capabilities, advancing digital and online offerings, and investing in new
customer experiences and products. This new group includes our innovation, consumer credit card, deposit products,
treasury management and virtual channels teams.
We continue to be active in providing our customers new products, services and technologies. For example, starting in
the third quarter, customers can now send and receive real-time payments with any customer of a bank that participates
in the clearXchange network; and our Wholesale customers can now send and receive same day ACH. We're also
making it easier for our customers to open accounts through mobile channels, including brokerage, Business Direct,
and personal credit products.
Turning to our business segments, starting on page 25, Community Banking earned $3.2 billion in the third quarter,
down 9% from a year ago and up 2% from the second quarter. The decline from a year ago was due to the lower gains
on equity investments. We've already discussed earlier on the call many of the business trends within Community
Banking, so I'll just briefly highlight that our customers continued to actively use our payment and digital products with
debit card transaction volume up 8% from a year ago and credit card purchase dollar volume also up 8%. Mobile active
users grew to 18.8 million.
Wholesale Banking earned $2 billion in the third quarter, up 6% from a year ago, and down 1% from the second
quarter. Revenue was $7.1 billion, down 2% from the second quarter due to the gain last quarter on the sale of our
health benefit services business. Revenue benefited from record net interest income, up 4% from second quarter and
12% from a year ago. Loan growth was driven by acquisitions and broad-based organic growth with average loans up
$48.7 billion or 12% from a year ago, the eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth. During the
third quarter, we closed the portion of our acquisition of GE Capital's Commercial Distribution Finance business, and
earlier this month we completed the final phase of that acquisition.
Wealth and Investment Management earned a record $677 million in the third quarter, up 12% from a year ago and up
16% from the second quarter. WIM generated a pre-tax margin of 27% in the third quarter and had positive operating
leverage on both a year-over-year and linked quarter basis. Positive operating leverage was driven by solid revenue
growth while continuing to invest more in the business. WIM's average deposits were up 10% from a year ago and
average loans increased 12%, the 13th consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year loan growth. Client assets
across WIM reached record highs this quarter driven both by market gains and continued positive net flows.
Turning to page 28, credit results improved from second quarter with only 33 basis points of annualized net
charge-offs. Net charge-offs declined $119 million or 13% from second quarter from lower oil and gas, credit card and
consumer real estate losses and continued commercial real estate recoveries. Non-performing assets decreased $1.1
billion from second quarter with improvement across our consumer and commercial portfolios and lower foreclosed
assets. Non-performing assets were only 1.25% of total loans, the lowest level since the merger with Wachovia in
2008; and for the first time this year, we did not have a reserve build.
Slide 29 provides details on our oil and gas portfolio. Outstandings declined to $16 billion, down 6% from second
quarter and there were no defensive draws again this quarter. Our total oil and gas loan exposure, which includes
unfunded commitments and loans outstanding was down 2% from the second quarter and down 11% from a year ago.
We had $168 million of net charge-offs in the oil and gas portfolio in the third quarter, down $95 million or 36% from
the second quarter, driven by improvements in industry conditions.
Non-accrual loans were $2.5 billion, down slightly from the second quarter, and criticized loans declined $1.1 billion or
13%. While another decline in commodity prices would have a negative impact on the performance of our oil and gas

Turning to page 30, our capital levels remain strong with our estimated Common Equity Tier 1 ratio fully phased in at
10.7% in the third quarter. Our net payout ratio was 61% as we returned $3.2 billion to shareholders through common
stock dividends and net share repurchases. Regarding the new Fed proposal for the stress capital buffer; while the
initial information provided by the Fed was limited, we have performed our internal analysis and the potential impact
appears manageable, and the overall changes to the CCAR framework are generally aligned with our expectations.
I also want to provide an update on where we stand related to TLAC. As I mentioned earlier, we issued $9.2 billion of
debt in the quarter that we anticipate will be TLAC eligible. However, this was partially offset by $2.1 billion of
long-term debt rolling into the less than one-year maturity bucket.
In summary, our results in the third quarter demonstrated strength and momentum in a number of businesses; however,
the impact on future performance from the sales practices-related events late in the quarter is still known. We're
working closely with our customers, our regulators, and our team members to move forward and make things right.
Timothy J. Sloan
Thanks, John. Before we end our prepared remarks, I wanted to address a few of the most common questions that we've
been getting from all of you. The first is, whether Wells Fargo's culture is broken. Our goal of building lifelong
relationships with our customers and appropriately offering them additional products is still the foundation of our
business model. But there was clearly something wrong, and we will make the necessary changes to fix it. The values
we've always embraced, people as a competitive advantage, doing what is right for our customers, diversity and
inclusion, ethics and leadership will continue to guide our company through this challenging period.
Second, we receive questions about the sales practice activities, who was involved, and what the timeline of events
was. We have acknowledged that we've made mistakes. However, our board is conducting an independent investigation
into our retail banking sales practices and related matters, and we're not in a position to discuss those topics today.
Finally, we know there is uncertainty due to the events that have occurred over the last month, including this week. Let
me outline what you should expect from us before we have our next earning call 90 days from now.
First, in our retail banking business, we'll continue our outreach efforts to our customers and focus on making things
right. Second, we will continue to work with the board on their investigation as well as all the other inquiries we have
received including meeting the required deliverables under the consent orders. And third, as you've heard on the call
today, we are committed to being transparent regarding business trends. And you should expect updates on these
activities during the quarter. We're also planning on an off-cycle Investor Day for next year where we will update you
on our business strategies. And finally, I know there is a lot we need to get right, and make no mistake, I get it and our
team is on it.
James H. Rowe
Before we open up the line for questions, for today, to be as fair as possible, we're asking that you limit your questions
to one question and one follow-up, so we can get to as many questions as possible. Thank you.
And with that, Regina, we're ready for questions.

<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Hey, Matt.
Operator
Matt, you may be on mute.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Sorry, can you hear me?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: We can hear you now, Matt. Thanks.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. Apologies.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: It's okay.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: I thought I saw a blurb out there that you're hiring 2,000 employees for various
compliance controls areas and I just want to see if that is true? And then, related to that, as you think about the expense
impact of all of this, any estimates on what that might be?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Matt, the blurb really reflected the fact that we're moving approximately 2,000 of our
team members that are in risk and control positions within our business lines to our corporate risk functions. It's not
necessarily a net increase in the number of team members.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. So I guess the broader question is, there's going to be some cost impact of
the sales practice issue, probably some revenue impact as well; and do you have any estimates of what that might be?
The revenue impact is probably a little bit trickier, but I would think there may be some way to frame some early
thoughts on the cost side of things.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Well, it's tough to be specific, because we will definitely be adding people in control
positions as we build out the go-forward plan, and have it agreed to by our regulators. So it's definitely a cost
headwind. And I guess I would calibrate the relevant range in the tens of millions of dollars for that, specifically as it
relates to this.
And I think you're right on the revenue side. Some of the early trends that we're seeing, just in terms of account
openings, et cetera, don't really have a revenue impact. They may ultimately with respect to how incremental deposits
are redeployed or transactional activity in cards, things like that, but they don't have an immediate revenue impact on
this quarter, next quarter.
The bigger picture, of course, that some people have asked is, what will the business model feel like in Community
Banking with a more service-oriented culture rather than a more sales-oriented culture, and you'll be hearing more
about that as it's fully developed. It's our intention to be successful in providing all of our customers with what they
need in terms of financial products through service-oriented model.
So that'll take some time to develop and to describe for people, and then it'll work its way in over the course of the
coming quarters. But it's a question that people have asked, and it's one that will provide a lot of transparency around,
so that people can understand the impact of that change as it's being made.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: I mean, so these costs and then any revenue give up, do you feel like it's going to
be absorbable in your current earnings power? Or – I think the fear out there in the market is not just the headline risk,
which will go away at some point; but I think the fear is kind of this $4 plus of earnings power, is that meaningfully at
risk when you factor in some of the cost and revenue reduction. And I don't know if you can comment on that? Thank
you.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Thank you. It's tough to say with specificity. We've a very diversified revenue model, as
you know. There's so much coming from Wholesale, there's so much coming from WIM. This will be a headwind in
Community Banking and it's one that we'll intend to absorb. But that's why we're upping our transparency, so that
people can develop their own sense, and we can share facts as they're happening.

Your next question will come from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Good morning, Erika.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Good morning. Maybe I can ask Matt's last question another way, you set out return goals
during Investor Day of 1.1% to 1.4% ROA, and, I guess, really what the question is, given the uncertainty of the
Community Bank impact on revenue and expenses going forward, are there other levers within Wells Fargo in that you
can deliver that 1.1% to 1.4% ROA within the next two years? And can you grow earnings without any help from
macro next year despite this uncertainty?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Hey, Erika. It's a very fair question and let me take the macro orientation of that first. One,
it's always a function of what the economic environment is and what the interest rate environment is. But I think if
you've seen from our third quarter results that the other businesses that drive this company performed quite well in the
quarter and we're excited about their growth. But as John indicated, it's a little bit too new to rate in terms of what the
impact, the longer-term impact of the sales practices issues are going to be within Community Banking. But, boy, I'm
very optimistic about the leadership of Mary Mack, very optimistic about our ability to work through those. But it's
going to take a while. And as we said, it could get a little bit worse before it gets better. But I'll tell you, the team in
Community Banking is up to it.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: I think those are what we announced at the last Investor Day in terms of targets, they're
still reasonable guideposts. I said just a little bit earlier, I think we'll still be at the higher end on expenses. And, of
course, now in addition to what we just talked about with Matt about the compliance costs, we're going to have an
incremental operating loss as a result of this litigation, et cetera; that's got to work its way through. And that'll
definitely be around for a little while.
As Tim mentioned, we're going to have an off-cycle Investor Day next May; and between now and then, we'll be
talking a lot. And if we think that those aren't reasonable guideposts anymore, we'll tell people.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: And my second – my follow-up question is, part of your stock's appeal has always been the
dividend and the overall capital return. And I'm wondering if some of the overhang from these issues from litigation,
from potential DOJ investigation, impact how you think about capital return going forward?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Overall, it doesn't. I mean, we've provided similar metrics in terms of the range of capital
payout and we're well within those this quarter, and our expectation is to continue to stay in those ranges.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yeah. I mean, we certainly account for a broad range of stress outcomes in the capital
planning process as it relates to operational risk and operational losses, that's always been true, it's true for other filers
as well. So it'd certainly be our intention to take a similar path going forward with the approach to distributions that
we've had.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Okay. Thank you.

<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Good morning, Betsy.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Hey. Hey, good morning. Hey, could you give us a sense as to why you chose Mary
Mack to run the retail bank? And give us a sense as to what she's bringing from the wealth management platform from
anything she's done at Wachovia? And what your expectations are for how she's going to deliver?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: All good questions. First, Mary was the best person for the job. I could not be more excited
about what she's been able to accomplish in this environment thus far. She brings experience not only within the
brokerage business, but also in the retail banking business. And my expectations are very high in her, I hope she's
listening, because they're high, and I'm pretty certain that she's going to be able to exceed the expectation. But she was
the best person for the job.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: But is that – I mean, could you just give us a sense of why? Because we're looking
for a culture shift or a culture enhancement, a change in the business model, and that's a big ask. So I'm just wondering
what you saw in her at – while she was running wealth management and...
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Betsy, I saw an executive with decades of experience in financial – the financial services
industry, and decades of experience at Wachovia and Wells Fargo who's been through a variety of challenges in her
career and who is an incredibly effective leader and somebody who, I believe, and our entire senior leadership team and
the board believe that who can effectuate the change that's needed on our retail banking platform.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: And is there opportunities to enhance the efficiency of that platform over time? I
mean, not in the next several quarters as you work with the outreach with your clients, but, over time, given the digital
investment spend that you've been making, and I think given the fact that you've been running them as separate
geographies or maybe I'm wrong there, maybe you've already centralized that.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Well, the short answer is yes, and we talked about that a fair amount at Investor Day, and we
talked about it as part of an omnichannel experience. Our customers continue to use our branches as frequently today as
they have a month ago, a year ago, and so on. But having said that, there's incredible opportunities to continue to
improve our product set, how we offer convenience to our customers, how our products and our people interact with
each other. And candidly, that's one of the reasons why we announced on Monday the creation of the Payments, Virtual
channel and Innovation group (sic) [Payments, Virtual Solutions and Innovation group].
And if you want to ask why we picked Avid for that, because she was the best person for the job. And that change, I
think, I want to just reinforce, is very important, because what we've done is we've brought together all of the payments
businesses, how so many of our customers both retail and commercial interact with us every day, we brought them all
together. And we think that's going to create a fair amount of innovation, but also efficiency over time.

<Q - John Pancari>: Hi. Just I want to go to the Wholesale impact. I know you commented on the select states and
municipalities that have made some decisions to pull back business. Could you just clarify again which states and
municipalities have indicated it? I believe there's California, we've also seen Chicago, and I believe Seattle. And then,
how we should think about that impact? Can you help us quantify the amount of revenue that you generally generate
from that type of business?

<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Sure, John. I'll start and maybe John will want to jump in. I don't have the list of all the states
and municipalities that have either indicated they want to put us on a temporary pause or those that have reaffirmed
their business with us. In our Investor Day materials, we broke out the revenue associated with our government and
institutional banking business. One of the benefits that we have at Wells Fargo is we have this diversified set of
businesses, and so frequently in our list of 90 different businesses, not every one of them is necessarily material to the –
in any one quarter to the impact of the company.
Having said that, our goal is to earn all that business back. I mean, those states and municipalities have chosen to do
business with Wells Fargo for a reason; we have great people, we have great products. Are we disappointed that they
decided to put us on suspension or pause? We are. But given the environment, it's not surprising, and we respect their
decisions. But we're going to work hard to make things right within the company to earn that business back over time.
<Q - John Pancari>: Okay. All right. Thanks. And then, separately, back on to the cost side. I know you flagged the
legal costs for the quarter and then you also alluded to a higher – more focused marketing effort. Wanted to see if you
have any way that you could help us quantify those two items at least for the near term.
And then, separately, the offsets that could come on the expense side to these types of items, I believe you alluded to
branch consolidation potential later on in your slide deck as well as the travel that you flagged on your prepared
comments. So I wanted to just see how we could think about the timing of that type of relief from those items.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Sure. So this is John. There's a lot of puts and takes there, which is why we usually
revert back to the efficiency ratio target, because while we're definitely going to have elevated compliance-related costs
and operational loss-related costs, we've got a lot of initiatives underway, some of which you alluded to. Some are
immediate and some are over the sort of forecast horizon of a couple years. And it's designed to keep us in or below the
high end of 55% to 59%.
So my guidance, at this point, is that we're going to be at the high end of that range accounting for all of those things
that we're showing as levers in order to offset the elevated expense.
<Q - John Pancari>: Okay. And no quantification of the legal cost this quarter, correct?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: It's difficult to do. It's very early for the matters that we filed in our 8-K and that you're
reading about in the newspaper. And as those things mature, over time, then they'll begin to have an impact, but they
don't have a dollar impact yet.

<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Hi, John.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Hi. Good morning. Tim, I know it's early here, but maybe you could talk about what
factors are you going to be balancing when you redesign the sales incentive scorecard? How are you going to make
sure you don't overshoot and cut off legitimate needs-based selling and relationship building, while also making sure
you don't encourage the wrong behavior?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yeah. It's a good question, John. I think the focus is going to be first on – and this is a little
bit high level, but on thinking about what are the drivers of developing those lifelong relationships with our customers.
It's about service. It's about convenience. So think about our bankers being incented to provide good service, and so
we'll be measuring that on an independent basis; to think about our bankers being focused on helping our customers do

more business, but being measured on product usage and activity as opposed to individual product sales; and also about
an overall growth in assets and balances; and also think about it being much more driven to a team approach as
opposed to just on an individual basis.
We think that that is going to be successful. Mary and team are working on the specifics of that right now, and when
we complete the analysis and they recommend the program, that's one of the other areas that we'll provide some
transparency about.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And then just a follow-up for John. On the net interest margin and net interest
income, when we try to assess the impact of what a potential rate hike would do, one rate hike – it's hard to discern
what happened after the December hike last time, because in the first quarter you had a few moving parts. What's your
best guess of kind of what kind of help you would get to your NIM from one rate hike? And then what's the ongoing
impact to NIM on the other side from TLAC issuance, in terms of drag?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: So I would – that the net numbers that I would look to, for ease of modeling. If we got
125 basis point move, would be something on the order of $150 million per quarter in the first year. There's a lot going
into that in terms of asset-liability mix, loan growth, deposit growth, TLAC issuance, et cetera, but that's a reasonable
placeholder that accounts for the net.

<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Good morning, Paul.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thank you very much. Hey, relative to some of the shakeup you guys
had in your executive leadership, has there been any thought to bring somebody from the outside? Because a lot of you
guys have been with the bank for multiple, multiple years, and to bring somebody from the outside to give a fresh look
of the culture.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Well, it's a fair question. It's one we've been getting asked. I think the board, by the changes
that we've made over the last week and few weeks, is comfortable with and very supportive of the management team. I
think over the last few years, really, since the financial crisis, we had a huge opportunity in – eight years ago to reset
the entire team, and we selected the best folks that were available for all the roles. Since then – and one of the great
things about the company has been how we've been able to attract many senior leaders from outside the company, not
only in our business lines, but also in many of our support functions, including corporate risk. So that's already really
happened, from my perspective.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Hello?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yeah, you there? Go ahead.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Oh, yeah, I'm sorry. Yeah. And then on the independent audit, is there any timelines for that?
And did you disclose who is doing the audit?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Well, it's an investigation that's being spearheaded by Shearman & Sterling, which is
working on behalf of the board. It's independent. And we don't have a date by which it's going to be finished.
Hopefully, it'll be finished as soon as practical, but I think independence and thoroughness is much more important
than getting something done in a short period of time.

Your next question will come from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Good morning, Mike.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: Hi. Of the 115,000 accounts that were opened without authorization and charged a fee, how many
customers did those 115,000 accounts reflect? And what's been your retention rate of those customers?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: I think the customer account is somewhat lower than the incidents of the product account at
least with respect to the $1.5 million deposit accounts, which is the bigger number. But the ones that couldn't be rolled
out, that related to 1.1 million customers. So it was sort of a 3:2 ratio there. So I'd say it's somewhat south of 100,000
customers for the 115,000 impacted accounts. And the retention ratio, yeah, I don't have the retention ratio at hand. It's
not something that's independently being measured, at least not at this level.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: All right. I guess a follow-up. This is a long wind-up here, but it's a little frustrating of not getting
that retention information. I think you'd want to know the customers that were impacted the most, what's been your
retention rate. I guess, we can't really ask about the internal investigation, there's no timeframe; we can't ask who knew
what and when; we can't ask why it took so long to stop the problem. This is the first time we've had to ask a question
on the call. We don't have Steve Sanger on this call and so it's a long wind-up, like I said.
Maybe a little bit more on the potential branch closings, you know, slide, I guess, 24, you talk about it could allow you
to review the branch footprint for consolidation opportunities. I mean, you have 6,000 branches and you're having
success with digital delivery, and it's exciting that Avid is promoted into this new position, I'm sure he'll look at that.
But can you give us something concrete as it relates to all this? Maybe when you look at the new chapter, what the
potential might be for efficiency improvements, especially if you're telling us the efficiency should be elevated for
some time?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: You know, Mike, listen, I appreciate your question, and as one of the many stakeholders at
Wells Fargo, I'm sorry that we have disappointed you, but we just spent 30 minutes talking about what's going on at the
company and we've provided a lot of information. We've provided new slides that provide a tremendous amount of
detail on some of the retail sales practices issue, and we deliberately and diligently walked through the performance of
all of our businesses. And you know what, if that doesn't satisfy you, I'm sorry.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: All right. Well, maybe at the next year's Investor Day, do you think we'll hear more about how
you'll configure your branches and kind of the next stage of that?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Oh, sure. Absolutely. I mean, we talked about that at our last Investor Day. And that's one of
the reasons why we want to accelerate the timing of our Investor Day, because we want to provide increased
transparency, which we've done today, and we want to provide a more continuous updates as to how we're operating
the company.

ahead.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Thanks a lot. I was wondering if we could just talk about the environment a little bit. Loan growth
was okay, but certainly we've seen this kind of air pocket on the commercial side a little bit from the industry
perspective. And I'm wondering if you could just talk about what you guys are seeing in terms of commercial demand,
especially. And if you're seeing any just noted changes in terms of customer activity, and whether you think that's either
fleeting or whether you guys are taking a different view of extension of credit at all?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: I think overall in the Wholesale businesses; as you said, every quarter can be a little bit
different in terms of loan growth. We didn't see any trends in any of our Wholesale businesses that would cause us
concern that commercial real estate loans are going one way or our asset-based loans are going another.
One of the reasons why our loan growth in the third quarter was – in commercial wasn't as strong as in prior quarters is
because our energy book declined by – I can't recall the exact figure, $1.5 billion to $2 billion. We're still very active in
the energy industry, but it makes sense that there's a bit of a decline there. We had a few kind of larger underwritings
that either paid off or were transformed into long-term debt or equity for our customers, but nothing alarming from our
perspective.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: All right. And then as a follow-up, John, I noticed that the securities book was $390 billion at the
end of the quarter. Looks like you're moving some of that liquidity maybe also in replacement of some of that loan
growth.
Can you just talk about the reinvestment philosophy, what kind of stuff you're investing in, and are you able to find a
good ROA, ROE on moving the book into securities at this time given where rates are?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Sure. Well, the first call on that liquidity would be loans that we just talked about to the
extent that there was incremental loan demand. Versus how we've deployed liquidity in the past, we obviously have
more of a bias toward things that qualify for HQLA, just because of the environment that we're living in for liquidity.
So you've seen a lot of agency mortgage-backed securities, you've seen some treasuries where we actually got a
program of late to be a little bit more active in Ginnie Mae securities because of their liquidity properties. We also have
a portfolio of – a smaller portfolio on the securities side of somewhat more credit sensitive, so high-grade corporates or
CMBS, things like that, that we replenish every quarter as well.
The returns are okay. We had this lower for longer bias that makes us comfortable deploying capital in that way – or
liquidity in that way and the capital to withstand what happens if we're wrong about rates and we end up in a higher
rate environment. But it's consistent with the approach that we've taken over the last couple of quarters. We paused in
the first quarter while there was a real drop in both market volatility that gave rise to risk-free rates going as low as they
have. But now in the second quarter and the third quarter, we've been back to converting cash into duration, basically.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Thanks, John.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Is that helpful?
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Yup.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Good morning, Brian.
<Q - Brian D. Foran>: Good morning. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about overdraft charges. A few articles out
there have kind of maybe asserted some of the opt-in processes were overzealous, let's call it, at the retail network. So
is that something you've looked at as part of your review? And then we don't get a ton of history from the reg filings,

but it is broken out now. It seems like your overdraft was running about 12% – plus 12% year-over-year in terms of
growth, which is a good bit stronger in the industry. So even separate from the [ph] any of the parents' (01:02:27)
practice stuff. Maybe just what was driving that kind of overdraft key growth?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yeah, sure, Brian. We saw some of the same reports that you did and candidly those were a
little bit of a surprise. Having said that, like all facets of our retail banking business, we're going to review those, and to
the extent there are any issues, we'll deal with them. But we're not aware today that they were a driver of overdraft
income.
<Q - Brian D. Foran>: Great. And then maybe on some of these new account production metrics, it's very helpful, I
appreciate the disclosure. I'm assuming the average life of checking accounts and credit cards is pretty long. So is there
like a rule of thumb translation you can give us? If the run rate of new accounts is down 25% for six months, let's say,
is that a one percentage point headwind to balance growth, two percentage points? How should we think about that in
terms of thinking about balance growth all else equal over the next two years?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yeah, I would separate that into credit cards, one; and deposit accounts, second. I think credit
cards, it's a little bit tricky just because over the last few years we've seen such growth in our credit card business in
terms of penetration, and our usage numbers have been good. But you could imagine a point where there – if credit
card growth is down a little bit that in a year or so from now that we could see some decline. But of course, that
assumes that we don't make any other changes in our credit card products, in our offerings, how we interact with
customers and the like. So I don't have a great rule of thumb there.
And again, as a relates to the deposit accounts, and John, jump in here if you feel differently, we're so new into the
impact and what we try to do in the expanded disclosure is show you the decline on a monthly basis, but also give you
a sense of what the impact was on the total base. I think that's how I would think about it, and I appreciate that you
appreciated our increased disclosure.
<Q - Brian D. Foran>: Thank you.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: And I guess the only thing I would add is that not all deposit accounts are equal in terms
of their contribution to deposit balances, right? Here we have deposits growing by $6 billion when we have new
accounts not opening as quickly.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: But, Brian, that's another reason why we want to continue to provide enhanced disclosure
because we want to make sure that you are comfortable with how any of the headwinds we're facing right now are
affecting the business.

qualitative review as it relates to CCAR or any other kind of regulatory action.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: So let me take the first part of that question. As I mentioned, the board has engaged
Shearman & Sterling to do an investigation of retail sales product issues and other matters, and we want to be very
respectful of their process and we want that process to be taken seriously and to be viewed independently. So I don't
want to comment on the specifics of how they are going to go about their review, but we look forward to...

the press reports this issue went on for several years before management made the board aware. And I'm just
wondering if that issue has been addressed.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Well, here is how I would answer that and that is there's going to be an independent review,
and I think that it would be appropriate to wait for the independent review as opposed to jumping to conclusion about
what media might think. I don't mean to be disrespectful to the media, but I don't know if they have all the facts, and
the review will look at all the facts and we'll make some recommendations, I'm sure.

Your next question will come from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: Hey.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Hi, Marty.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: Hey. You created a new role on the board, Vice Chair, and you put Elizabeth Duke in that role
and appointed her there. She has an extensive amount of industry and regulatory experience. You created that role for a
purpose. Can you frame that a little bit for us and let us understand better how you expect to leverage her in that role?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Sure. So, Marty, I want to be very respectful of the fact that neither John nor I created that
role. The board did. Having said that, we couldn't be – first, we have a terrific board. It's diverse. It's diverse in terms of
the types of industries that they have been involved in, their experience, and we just couldn't be more pleased with the
quality of that board. In particular, having both Steve Sanger and Betsy Duke being willing to step up into these roles
is, I think, absolutely the right decision that the board should be making in these circumstances. Separating the CEO
and Chairman role is something that we've done in the past, but again, in particular, to Betsy to have somebody like
that with not only industry experience but also regulatory experience in this environment to provide assistance for
Steve is exactly what's needed.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: Then not to Monday morning quarterback or rehash what you've done in the past, but, Tim, I
really wanted to ask you, what in this experience has changed the way you think about the role of CEO as you now
assume it, and Wells Fargo as a company or a culture? And what is the key takeaway? Whenever you go through these
extreme crises, there is always something that you learn that will make the company better as you move forward. What
have you learned that you're going to now take to your new role and be able to push forward?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Well, Marty, that's a great question. And by the way, don't apologize for being a Monday
morning quarterback. Candidly, we deserve that and we're used to it over the last few weeks. I also want to preface my
remarks by saying I have been in this role for less than 48 hours and I want you to have high expectations from me, but
actually I want to make sure that those are a bit tempered.
When I think about the retail sales practices issues we've had at the company, I wish that the business had escalated the
issue sooner. I wish when the business escalated the issue, that while the senior management team did a lot in response,
I wish we could've done more. And I highlight that because I think that one of the lessons that I have learned – but one
of the lessons that the entire company has learned and one of the reasons that we are organized the way we are today
and we're making many of the changes that we've talked about are that we have got to escalate issues wherever they
occur within the company sooner, we've got to deal with them sooner, and we've got to make sure that to the extent that
they have any impact on our customers, that we deal with that impact as quickly as we can. So it's about escalation, and
it's about speed and dealing with challenges and also dealing with opportunities as they come, Marty.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: Do you feel that in that vein, being a high performer and being looked at as a high-quality bank
for so long created some blinders, that maybe those blinders now have been taken off, and you're, like you're saying,
reacting and moving quicker at this point?

<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yeah, I don't know. I mean it's a fair question. I don't know if they created blinders. But
again, the fact of the matter is we should have escalated these issues sooner, and we should have dealt with them more
quickly than we did. So to the extent that some of our prior success impacted that, so be it, I can assure you that we've
talked about what you just described a lot, and we're going to make sure that that doesn't create a blinder now or in the

Your next question will come from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Good morning, Chris.
<Q - Chris Kotowski>: Good morning. I never thought I'd ask you about this page of your press release again, but I'm
looking at page 31 at the accretable yield, which usually wiggles and wobbles by $100 million or $200 million a
quarter, and all of a sudden, the expected cash flows are down by almost $5 billion. So can you say what happened
there? And does that – is that a headwind to net interest income going forward?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Well, I'm glad you asked. I wasn't sure whether anybody was going to get there. So the
accretable yield balance was down $4 billion in the quarter, stands at about, I think, $11.2 billion right now. So, what's
happened here is that pre-payments have sped up. We have reached a point where a lot of these borrowers have gotten
themselves in the money for refis because of the path of HBI, and we are experiencing and modeling faster cash flows
as a result of that, and so frankly in the near term, I think we will see an increased interest income as more of that
comes through. But what it means is those loans won't be outstanding for as long as we might have previously
predicted because they will be refi'ing.
<Q - Chris Kotowski>: So, that would be elevated accretion into net interest income then the next couple of quarters,
whatever, as you experience that?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Correct. Correct.
<Q - Chris Kotowski>: Okay. And then a headwind in future quarters after that. Okay. And the other thing I was
wondering is how should we think about the impact of the settlement on op risk RWAs? I mean obviously, the financial
impact is minor, but the impact on your company has been big in terms of management and press and reputation and so
on. And so how quickly does it all get factored in and any light you can shed on whatever the algorithm is?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yeah, so it's tough to say because the chapter hasn't – the middle chapters haven't been
written of what the op risk outcome is. I mean we know what the settlement was. We've got a variety of legal matters
that we have to attend to, all of which will factor into a future view of what the total op risk experience is from it. So it,
at the margin, would be increasing. I think I mentioned earlier, in CCAR, in our own stress analysis, we concoct and
imagine outsized op risk outcomes to demonstrate that we've got the capital and earnings power to overcome them, and
the magnitude of what we're talking about here frankly is, while it's significant, is modest in comparison to what you
can imagine in the stress both in our own scenario as well as in CCAR.
And of course what it means from the regulators perspective as they think about our op risk capacity in the future is up
to them, but it will have an increase at the margin. It doesn't have a material increase in the moment because the
numbers, as you say, have not been that big on the scale of Wells Fargo's balance sheet and earnings power so far. But
it's a headwind [ph] in op risk (01:15:31). We've been fortunate to have had modest op risk outcomes relative to the
GSIB peer group over the CCAR era, and this feels different because of the severity of the reputational harm that's been
created.
<Q - Chris Kotowski>: Okay. All righty. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Hey, Brian.
<Q - Brian Kleinhanzl>: Great. Thank you. Hi. A quick question, just easy one first. On the long-term debt, I know
you said it went up based on the TLAC issuance, but didn't you also have debt that you put on related to the GE deals
for pre-funding those deals that was puttable? Is that still on the balance sheet and did you put that back this quarter as
well?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yeah, it's still on the balance sheet. So it is puttable, and it's FHLB type of financing. So
it shows up as longer term debt. But you can see that on page 15, I think, of today's deck. So it's still in place. Now, of
course, we're just using it as part of the general liability structure overall and we'll use it as long as we think that it is a
good component of the stack.
<Q - Brian Kleinhanzl>: Okay. Thanks. And then on the slide where you're monitoring the customer activity in the
retail banking, you note that consumer checking account opens were down 25% year-on-year, credit card applications
down 20% year-on-year. But if you start to annualize those numbers, they start to get very large as you think about the
credit card applications. I mean they would be down – on a full-year basis down 12% year-on-year relative to the total
outstanding. So is there a way to quantify what that monthly impact was as it relates to revenue? I'm sure like not all
applications actually get opened, but...
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yeah. So the waterfall there is that applications may or may not become approvals, and
approvals may or may not become activated cards, and activated cards have to become utilized, and utilized cards
become balances, and balances accrue interest. So there's a lot of steps that has to be gone through before applications
have an impact on either assets or revenue.
One of the reasons for showing this is to help people understand what the immediate impact is and then to roll it
forward so we can see whether annualizing that September number is really the right way to approach it. September,
obviously, was the first month. It's the month where we pulled back on marketing. It's the month when our team
members were probably the most uncertain in terms of what the go-forward model's going to be as we pivot towards
service. It's the month when our customers and prospects are first reflecting their real dissatisfaction with Wells Fargo.
All those things are together and those are going to change in different ways as we roll it forward.
So it's the installed base that drives the P&L results, and that is where it is. And Tim mentioned that we're going to roll
this forward probably during the quarter, so people can see whether October looks like September, November looks
like October, and then we can start to build a projectable impact on the trend. Hopefully, that's helpful.
<Q - Brian Kleinhanzl>: Right. Yes, it is. Thanks.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yeah.

<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Me, too.
<Q - Vivek Juneja>: A question for both of you. You took a charge in the second quarter for CFPB settlement, which
was announced on September 8. Why no disclosure on the financial filings? And are you planning to change anything
as you think about that aspect as you look forward?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: So it's a tricky one, because we certainly account for these items when they become
known or probable and estimable under GAAP. But separately, we're also – these are also part of confidential
supervisory information that – where there's limitation on how much you can talk about while you're in the middle of a
negotiation with the regulator. Now, they can talk about whatever they choose to, and they do sometimes, and other
times they wait until it ends. So we think about the circumstances in the moment. We obviously would love to be
disclosive and help people understand what's going on. We're certainly taking the charges when we need to take the
charge, but we're not alone in that discussion. And usually the circumstances are governed by, in the case of a
regulator, the regulator. So, that's how I think about that.
<Q - Vivek Juneja>: So not even – without giving us the amount, you couldn't even disclose [indiscernible] (01:20:33)
existence of those discussions?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Well, Vivek, the way that I would think about it is that this stemmed from the lawsuit that the
City of L.A. filed a year before that. And so that there was – there're issues that we were dealing with. But as John said,
we've got to be very careful and respectful of what we disclose in terms of conversations that we have with our
regulators, and that's really important. And so the short answer is we followed appropriate policies, procedures, rules
and disclosure requirements.
<Q - Vivek Juneja>: Okay. Separate question sort of linked to all this regulatory scrutiny that's going on, Tim. As a
G-SIFI bank, scrutiny is obviously now with all of these happenings going to increase for you. Does this have any
bearing on how you think about asset size as one metric? You're almost $1.95 trillion, the third largest bank, with Citi
reported a [indiscernible] (01:21:45) companies to widen with you bidding growing even faster. Is that something that
factors into your thinking about how big is too big or what does it mean longer term?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yeah, it's a fair question. I think – and John, jump in, but we'll focus less on size because size
is ultimately determined by our customers. It's not necessarily determined by us. I mean we want to arm our team
members with the right incentives and have them work together and provide good advice and service to our customers
and make sure that we've got great products out there. That's what's going to drive our size. Having said that, we need
to make sure that as we think about our returns, so putting the lens that you might use which we do all the time, are we
getting and providing the appropriate returns for our investors based upon our size? That's how we think about it.
Having said that, we've looked across the company and you've seen us exit some businesses that we believed would not
provide us with as strong a return as they might provide another owner. We sold our crop business, we sold our HSA
business and so on because we appreciated in this environment and given the amount of liquidity and capital that we
have that we've got to be very mindful in terms of how we deploy our assets.

<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yeah, it's a good question. I do not know the answer to that. The board will decide that.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Okay. So there is no sort of regulatory imperative along with that. I mean I'm assuming the
regulators will have a look at that, but I'm just wondering if there is a transparency issue here that sort of needs to be
overcome.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Well, I wouldn't jump to a conclusion about whether there's a transparency issue or not. As
you can see, we're trying to be more transparent in terms of the operations of the company than we've ever been. But
Betsy, I want to be – or excuse me – Nancy, I want to be very respectful to the board because that's the board's
decision.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Okay. My second question would be this. I mean obviously there're going to be some
near-term issues here, not only retaining customers but in attracting new ones. And I am wondering if there is any
thought being given to deposit pricing or fees, et cetera, as one of the levers to attract new clients.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Nancy, all good ideas in this company are on the table. I mean we've got an impressive
management team. Whenever a company – and it's certainly the case for us – is faced with these kinds of challenges,
it's absolutely appropriate to step back and think about all aspects of how we provide product and service and
convenience to our customers, and we certainly are thinking about price.
Having said that, that when you think about the driver of our company – one of the drivers for our company for decades
is building that lifelong relationship that's not based on price. So could we make some changes in our pricing of certain
products, deposit or otherwise? Sure, we could, but I would not expect us to lead with price.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Okay. And if I could just ask as an add-on to that, I mean obviously your employees have
really been put through the wringer through this whole process. Is there any thought about additional compensation or
bonuses this year or something just as a way of saying we're sorry?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: I think saying that we put our team members through the wringer is an understatement. I
really do. I really do, especially our team members on our retail banking platform.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Right.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: But it's throughout the company. We want to make sure that we retain the best people that we
can, and we think we offer a very competitive set of compensation and benefits. We talked a little bit about that on one
of the slides. But we appreciate that we've got to re-recruit our team in this kind of environment, and all ideas are on the
table.

<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: So you should think about it as an annual range. This quarter, we popped up above it, but
it's still a good annual range. And if we start thinking that it's not, then we'll telegraph that to people. It's hard to be
more specific. The operational or compliance-related issues are one set of cost that maybe can be modeled in the near
term, but to the extent that we've got lumpy operational losses that drive it up, those are just harder to predict, and
they'll happen when they happen. But we will – if we think we're – the band is no longer the right band, then we'll tell
you that.
<Q - Kevin J. Barker>: Okay. And then when we think about the spend on marketing and compliance, are you
expecting that to be offset by the potential to have branch closures or reductions in your branch costs in order to keep
the expenses under control due to other areas, or how should we think about the puts and takes around the expense
number?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yeah, I wouldn't tie the two together, and I certainly wouldn't be focused on branch closures.
I mean what we've talked about, and again I reflect back on how we described our branch platform at Investor Day, that
we continue to update it all the time. We move branches around, we open new branches, we combine branches, we may
close a few. I think this year, in fact, there's going to be a reduction unrelated to what we've talked about here. But as
John described, we've got to look at our expenses and we have been looking at our expenses for some period of time to
be able to keep the efficiency ratio within the range, even though it's at the upper end of the range because we need to
invest not only in compliance, we've got to invest in technology and bringing out new products and cyber defense and
all the above.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: The other thing, Kevin, is as relates- and because other people have asked today with
regard to that whatever might happen on the branch network side of things, that doesn't necessarily give you an
immediate lift if you're thinking about today's elevated compliance cost or today's elevated marketing cost. If we're
making moves on the physical distribution side of our business, that creates benefits in year two, year three, year four,
but it's not really an immediate offset. So as Tim said, I wouldn't think about those as offsetting levers.
<Q - Kevin J. Barker>: Do you think you can stay within your target if rates were to remain flat from where they are
right now?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Well, the way that range was constructed was with our expectation for a range, which is
practically flat, but for example if we get a 25 basis point move in December, that wouldn't be unreasonable, and that's
essentially baked into being in that range. If we stay flat, we're not that far off of that. It's not that big. If we had a big
move up in rates, which I think is highly unlikely, then that would probably move us down in the range. I think we've
said that before.
<Q - Kevin J. Barker>: Yeah, thank you very much.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Thank you.
Operator
Our final question will come from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Good morning.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Good morning. Sneak it in under the wire here. I just wanted to follow up on
Marty's question. Tim, the response seemed largely tactical. And so I guess, as far as thinking about changes that your
leadership might mean, does that mean that your view on the strategic approach versus prior leadership is largely
unchanged? And it's certainly true that you haven't been in the seat very long, but the idea that you would be taking
over is certainly something that wasn't out of the blue. So I'm sure you had some ideas coming in here.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Well, I have lots of ideas, but candidly, I'd be a lot more nervous if I were you if I came out
with some new strategic plan for Wells Fargo in 48 hours. That would be pretty dangerous from my perspective. But

look, when I think about the company that I joined 29 years ago, right, it's so different today. My guess is that Wells
Fargo is going to be different five years from now, 10 years from now and 15 years from now, and you know what, I
hope it is because by changing and adapting to the environment we're in, that's one of the reasons why we've had a
history of success, notwithstanding the last month or so, right?.
The last month or so has been a real challenge as we have talked about on the call today and I'm sure we'll continue to
talk about for a while. But we've made some important announcements this week. Again, you might call them tactical. I
think they're actually in the strategic [ph] bent (01:32:26). The creation of a new business line, the elevation of some
new senior leaders in our Wholesale Banking and our Community Banking business as well as consumer lending.
They're going to bring some new ideas. So I'd have a fair point that it's probably a little bit more tactical than strategic,
but over time you'll see some updates and we'll talk about those over the next few months, and I'm sure we'll talk about
some of that at Investor Day next year.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Sure. And actually, the spirit of my question was actually in response of Marty's
question, I think you had talked about making adjustments to the escalation methods on the back up, right? So, that was
more the reference of tactical rather than the management changes that you've made.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Right.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Okay. Sorry, Tim. Go ahead.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: No, no, I appreciate it. Fair question.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: So a different direction here for the second question. One of your wirehouse
competitors has come out and confirmed the recent stories on their policies for dealing with the DoL rule. Have you
finalized your policies? And can you tell us any details about those?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: So we are – this is John – we're still in the process of refining the overall implementation
approach to be compliant with the rules. I think we're still going to continue to approach every client relationship with
an emphasis on every client having a customized plan that guides their investment activity. We are going to emphasize
advisory solutions and continue to offer traditional brokerage for certain clients that include self-directed options also,
and we'll be sharing more details as we get closer to implementation. I think with each ensuing quarter between now
and later in 2017, you should expect to hear a little bit more about the specifics of the implementation. But we haven't
reached the same conclusion in the same timeframe as the competitor that I think you are referring to.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Thanks for the color.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yeah.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Thank you.
Timothy J. Sloan
I know it's been a busy morning for everybody, and our call has been a little bit longer than normal. But I really want to
thank all of you for your thoughtful questions. The discussion, I think, has been incredibly helpful for both John and
me, and we look forward to continuing to provide additional disclosure to you as we move through the quarter, and we
thank you for your interest in Wells Fargo.
