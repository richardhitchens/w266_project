With that, I would like to turn the presentation over to Mark.
Mark Fields
Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone. Today, we're going to review our fourth quarter and our full-year 2014
financial results, and we'll also update our view of the business environment for 2015 and also our guidance for the
year ahead. So, let's get right into the first slide.
Our results this quarter and for the full year reflect our continued focus on our One Ford plan, which remains
unchanged. Our plan has served us well and will continue to do so going forward. And we're now building on our
success by accelerating the pace of progress throughout our business. We're starting to see the full benefits and strength
of One Ford, and we intend to maximize these opportunities going forward. And here at Ford, we are passionate about
product excellence and leading in innovation, and we're absolutely committed to building on our product strength today
with even more new products and innovations that will deliver growth for our stakeholders and define our company
going forward.
So, now, let's turn to slide two for a look at the fourth quarter and the full year. The fourth quarter was our 22nd
consecutive profitable quarter. Automotive operating-related cash flow was positive, and liquidity remains strong.
Fourth quarter wholesale volume and company revenue were lower than a year ago by 2% and 5% respectively.
Looking at the business units, North America and Asia Pacific were profitable, and Ford Credit once again delivered
strong results.
For the full year, the company delivered its fifth consecutive year of pre-tax profit and positive Automotive
operating-related cash flow, and the results were consistent with guidance. North America was profitable, and we
achieved a record profit in Asia Pacific. Ford Credit's profit was its highest since 2011. And while we reported losses in
other business units, Europe and Middle East and Africa improved from a year ago. Volume was about equal to a year
ago, while company revenue declined 2%. And we achieved record market share in Asia Pacific, driven by record share
in China.
Our global pension plans were underfunded by $9 billion at the end of 2014, which was unchanged from 2013 despite
significantly lower discount rates. For 2015, our company outlook for pre-tax profit, Automotive revenue and operating
margin is unchanged from our September Investor Day guidance. And we expect company pre-tax profit to range from
$8.5 billion to $9.5 billion with Automotive revenue and Automotive operating margin higher than 2014, which is
largely driven by our new products and capacity. And today, we're improving our outlook for Automotive
operating-related cash flow from positive to higher than 2014.
And before getting into the financial details, I'd like to take you though some of our other achievements in 2014, which
you'll see on slide three. We launched 24 all-new or significantly refreshed products globally last year. These included
the all-new F-150 which was awarded the Truck of Texas and named the North American International Auto Show
Truck of the Year earlier this month. And deliveries and sales began in December.
The launches also included the all-new 50th anniversary Mustang, Escort, Ka, Transit and Lincoln MKC. Our
best-selling mid-sized SUV, the Ford Explorer, debuted its new look at the L.A. Auto Show and will be available to

customers in markets around the world later this year. We also revealed the all-new Ford Everest in Asia Pacific.
Ford remained the best-selling vehicle brand in the U.S. and the best-selling automaker in Canada for the fifth year in a
row, and this was supported by continued strong sales of F-Series, which, despite the downtime on F-150 to support the
new vehicle launch, achieved U.S. truck sales leadership for the 38th straight year and U.S. vehicle sales leadership for
the 33rd year in a row. We also set U.S. sales records for Fusion and Escape.
In Europe, we remained the number two selling vehicle brand, and continued to progress our Transformation Plan,
achieving a year-over-year share gain for the Europe 20 markets for the first time since 2009. We also closed our Genk,
Belgium plant, improving our capacity utilization. Our growth in China continued with a record 1.1 million wholesales
in 2014. In addition, our Changan Ford joint venture opened two new plants, and we launched Lincoln in China with
the first nine Lincoln dealerships which began sales of the Lincoln MKZ and MKC.
Consistent with our plan to provide regular and growing dividends that are sustainable over an economic or business
cycle, we increased our 2014 quarterly dividend by 25%. And as you know, we announced an additional 20% increase
earlier this month. We also completed our share repurchase program that reduced our diluted shares by about 3%.
So, now, I'd like to turn it over to Bob who'll take us through the financial results. Bob?
Robert L. Shanks
Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Let's start on the top of slide four where you'll see that fourth quarter
wholesale volume was 1.6 million units and was down to 30,000 units from a year ago, and revenue was $35.9 billion
that was down $1.7 billion. Pre-tax profit was $1.1 billion excluding special items. That was $197 million lower than a
year ago.
After-tax earnings per share at $0.26 were $0.06 lower. Net income attributable to Ford, including pre-tax special item
charges, was $52 million. This was $3 billion lower than a year ago, including a non-repeat of a favorable $2.1 billion
special tax item that we benefited from last year. Earnings were $0.01 a share, and that was down $0.74.
Pre-tax special item charges were $1.2 billion in the quarter, reflecting primarily a onetime loss resulting from a change
in how we account for our Venezuela operations, as well as separation-related actions in Europe and Asia Pacific to
support our Transformation Plan, and charges associated with the settlement of our 2016 convertible notes. You can
find additional detail on the special items in Appendix 3. Automotive operating-related cash flow was $500 million,
and Automotive gross cash was $21.7 billion, exceeding debt by $7.9 billion.
In the full year, our operating effective tax rate, which isn't shown, was 35%. For 2015, we expect the rate, which
excludes the profits of our unconsolidated subsidiaries, to be about equal to our 2014 rate, assuming extension of U.S.
research credit legislation in the fourth quarter.
Full-year vehicle wholesales were about equal to a year ago, while company revenue decreased by 2%. Full-year
pre-tax operating profit excluding special items was $6.3 billion, and as Mark said, in line with guidance. The result
was a decline of $2.3 billion from a year ago, and net income was $3.2 billion, which was $4 billion lower than a year
ago.
As shown on slide five, both of our sectors, automotive and financial services, contributed to the company's fourth
quarter and full year pre-tax profits. Company fourth quarter and full year pre-tax profits were lower than a year ago,
more than explained by automotive. Compared with third quarter, automotive was favorable while financial services
more than explained the $60 million decline in profit.
The key market factors in financial metrics for automotive business in the fourth quarter are shown on slide six. As you
can see in the far left, wholesale volume and revenue declined 2% and 5% from a year ago respectively. The volume
decline is more than explained by North America, while the revenue decline reflects all business units. About half of
the revenue decline is attributable to unfavorable exchange.

Global industry SAAR is estimated at 90.2 million units. That was up 2% from a year ago. The Ford global market
share is estimated at 6.9%, down 0.2 percentage point due to North America. Operating margin was 2.8%, down 0.4
percentage point from a year ago, while automotive pre-tax profit was $713 million, and that was down $250 million.
The decline in both metrics is more than explained by North America.
As shown in the memo below the chart, full year volume was about equal to a year ago, while automotive revenue was
down 3%, more than explained by lower volume from consolidated operations and unfavorable exchange, with the
exchange effect accounting for nearly 60% of the decline. Operating margin at 3.9% was down 1.5 percentage points.
Total automotive pre-tax profit at $4.5 billion was down $2.4 billion. The lower results were driven by the Americas,
all other business units improved. We have included full year key metrics and year-over-year variance slides for the
automotive sector and each of our business units in the appendix.
As shown on slide seven, the $250 million decline in fourth quarter automotive pre-tax profit was driven by higher
costs and unfavorable exchange. Higher net pricing in all regions, except Asia Pacific was a partial offset. And as
shown in the memo, pre-tax profit was about equal to third quarter. The absolute fourth quarter pre-tax results for each
of our automotive operations, as well as other automotive are shown on slide eight. As you can see, North America and
Asia Pacific were profitable, while the other business units reported losses.
On slide nine, we show the factors that contributed to the $2.4 billion decline in total automotive full-year pre-tax
profit. The decline is more than explained by higher costs, including warranty, unfavorable exchange and lower
volume, including product launch effects and supplier part shortages. Higher net pricing was a partial offset.
The absolute full-year pre-tax results for each of our automotive operations, as well as other automotive, are shown on
slide 10. As you can see, North America was profitable, and Asia Pacific delivered a record result. Middle East and
Africa was about breakeven, while Europe and South America incurred large losses as expected.
Now, we'll look at each of the regions within the automotive sector, starting on slide 11 with North America. North
America fourth quarter wholesale volume and revenue were down 5% to 6% from a year ago. While North America
continued to benefit from robust industry sales, our strong product lineup, continued discipline in matching production
with demand and a lean cost structure, our fourth quarter results were affected adversely by the lower volume.
This reflects lower market share and lower dealer stock increases than a year ago, offset partially by higher industry
sales, including the U.S. SAAR of 17.2 million units, 1.2 million units higher than a year ago. Our U.S. market share
deteriorated 1.1 percentage points to 14.3%, and that was largely retail related. This primarily reflects a lower F-150
share as we continue to balance share with transaction prices and stocks during the transition to the all-new F-150.
Shares were also lower for several other products at the end of their product cycles as we transitioned to the new
products launched either in the fourth quarter of last year or early this year.
As shown in appendix eight, our U.S. retail market share of the retail industry was 12.8%. This was down 0.9
percentage point from a year ago, mainly reflecting the factors I already cited. The decline in North America's revenue
is explained by the lower volume. North America operating margin was 7.4%, down 0.8 percentage point from last
year, and pre-tax profit was $1.5 billion, down $252 million. As shown in the memo below the chart, all full-year
metrics declined from a year ago. The change in financial metrics is more than explained by lower volume and higher
warranty cost, including recalls. Operating margin was 8.4%, which was slightly better than our guidance.
On slide 12, we show the factors contributing to North America's lower fourth quarter pre-tax profit. The decline is
more than explained by the impact of new product launches in the quarter on volume and cost. Higher net pricing,
including for new products and lower warranty cost were partial offsets. As shown in the memo, pre-tax profit was
higher than third quarter, more than explained by lower warranty cost and favorable market factors. Higher structural
cost, including the effect of new product launches was a partial offset.
Now let's turn to slide 13 and review South America where we're continuing to execute our strategy of expanding our
product lineup, including replacing legacy products with global One Ford offerings. We're also continuing to manage
the effects of slowing GDP growth, lower industry volumes in our larger markets, weaker currencies, high inflation, as
well as policy uncertainty in some countries.

In the fourth quarter, wholesale volume and revenue decreased from a year ago by 2% and 9%, respectively. The lower
volume is more than explained by an 800,000 unit decline from last year's SAAR of 6.1 million units, reflecting
primarily the impact of import restrictions in Argentina and the weaker economy in Brazil.
South America market share at 9.4% was up 0.9 percentage point, reflecting primarily the new Ka, which was awarded
the most sought-after car of the year award in Brazil from leading magazine, AutoEsporte. Focus also contributed to the
share improvement. The revenue decline is more than explained by weaker currencies and unfavorable volume and
mix, with higher net pricing as a partial offset. Operating margin was negative 7.6%. This was down 2.9 percentage
points from a year ago, and pre-tax loss was $187 million, a deterioration of $61 million.
As shown in the memo below the chart, all full-year metrics deteriorated from a year ago driven by unfavorable
changes and external factors. The full year loss includes $426 million of adverse balance sheet exchange effects, related
primarily to the devaluation of the Venezuela bolivar in the first quarter.
On slide 14 we show the factors contributing to the decline in South America's fourth quarter pre-tax results. Higher
warranty costs including the field service action more than explained the deterioration compared with both the prior
year, and third quarter. The adverse effects in the quarter of weaker currencies and high local inflation were nearly
offset by higher net pricing. Also note that the share growth from new products offset the industry decline.
All right, let's now turn to Europe beginning on slide 15 where we continue to implement our transformation plan
focused on product, brand, and cost.
Europe's wholesale volume improved 5% from a year ago, while revenue declined 2%. The higher volume is more than
explained by a 500,000-unit increase in Europe 20 SAAR to 15.1 million units and a lower dealer stock reduction
compared with a year ago. The focus on product and brand saw continued progress in the quarter with the launch of the
new Focus and all-new Mondeo.
Our Europe 20 market share improved 0.2 percentage point to 7.6%, driven by a 2.8 point improvement in our
commercial vehicle share to 11.7%, reflecting the success of our full line of new Transit vehicles and continued strong
performance of the Ranger compact pickup. The decrease in Europe's revenue is more than explained by unfavorable
exchange.
Europe's operating margin was negative 6.5%, an improvement of 1.1 percentage points from a year ago, and pre-tax
loss was $443 million, an $86 million improvement. As shown in the memo below the chart, all full-year metrics
improved from a year ago.
Slide 16 shows the factors that contributed to the improvement in Europe's fourth quarter pre-tax results. The
improvement is more than explained by favorable market factors, offset partially by Russia. As shown in the memo
below the chart, pre-tax results were about equal to third quarter despite the impact of Russia.
Let's now turn to slide 17 and review Middle East and Africa, where we're focused on building our distribution
capability, expanding our One Ford product offering tailored to the needs of markets in the region, and leveraging
global low-cost sourcing hubs for vehicles in this fast-growing part of the world. Middle East and Africa's wholesale
volume and revenue declined 10% and 2%, respectively. The lower volume primarily reflects an unfavorable change in
dealer stocks to align with near-term market demand.
Operating margin was negative 8.2%, 2 percentage points better than a year ago, and pre-tax loss was $82 million, $22
million better. Higher net pricing and favorable mix more than explained the improvement. As shown in the memo
below the chart, full-year wholesale volume and revenue declined compared with the year ago while operating margin
and profits improved.
Let's now review Asia Pacific on slide 18. We're continuing our strategy in Asia Pacific to invest for growth through
both new and expanded plants, new products and the introduction of Lincoln in China. As shown on the left,
fourth-quarter wholesale volume was up 2% compared with the year ago while net revenue, which excludes our China
JVs, declined 9%. Our China wholesale volume, which isn't shown, was up 5% in the quarter.

The higher volume in the region is more than explained by higher industry volume. We estimate fourth quarter SAAR
for the region at 40.7 million units. That's up 600,000 units from a year ago. Lower market share was a partial offset.
Our fourth quarter market share of 3.5% was down 0.1 percentage point from a year ago. Our market share in China
also deteriorated 0.1 percentage point to 4.3%. This was due to a wholesale industry that was well-above trend.
Asia Pacific's lower revenue reflects lower volume from consolidated operations and unfavorable exchange. Operating
margin was 3.6%, down 0.2 percentage point from a year ago and pre-tax profit was $95 million, down $14 million. As
shown in the memo below the chart, all full-year metrics improved from the year earlier and were records.
In 2014, our China joint ventures contributed $1.3 billion to pre-tax profit, reflecting our equity share of earnings after
tax. Additional detail can be found in the appendix. The balance of results for the region primarily reflect Australia,
where we're implementing our Transformation Plan; India, where we're investing for future growth, including the
launch of two plants later this year; and unfavorable industry and economic factors in ASEAN.
On slide 19, we show the factors that contributed to Asia Pacific's lower fourth quarter pre-tax profit. The decline is
more than explained by higher warranty costs related to a field service action. As shown in the memo, Asia Pacific
pre-tax results improved in the third quarter, more than explained by favorable volume and mix.
All right, let's turn now on slide 20 to Ford Credit, a strategic asset and an integral part of our global growth and
value-creation strategy. Ford Credit provides world-class dealer and customer financial services supported by a strong
balance sheet, providing solid profits and distributions to Ford.
Ford Credit's improved pre-tax profit this quarter compared with the year ago is more than explained by higher volume
and favorable market valuation adjustments to derivatives included in other. The higher volume reflects increases in
consumer finance receivables and operating leases globally, as well as non-consumer finance receivables outside of
North America.
A partial offset is lower margin driven primarily by a one-time reserve in Europe and the run off of higher yielding
assets originated in prior years in North America. As shown in the memo, pre-tax profit was lower than third quarter,
explained primarily by lower margin reflecting the Europe reserve.
Slide 21 provides an explanation of the change in Ford Credit's full-year pre-tax profit compared with 2013. The
improvement is more than explained by higher volume, driven by increases in consumer and non-consumer finance
receivables globally, as well as operating leases in North America. Partial offsets include unfavorable lease residual
performance in North America resulting from lower relative auction values and lower financing margin. The lower
financing margin primarily reflects the Europe reserve previously mentioned, and lower portfolio pricing in North
America.
Next on slide 22 is our Automotive gross cash and operating-related cash flow. Automotive gross cash at the end of the
quarter was $21.7 billion, a decrease of $1.1 billion from the end of the third quarter. This includes the onetime
unfavorable $500 million cash effect associated with the accounting change for operations in Venezuela.
Automotive operating-related cash flow was positive $500 million, more than explained by profits. During the quarter,
debt repayments and pension contributions totaled $600 million while dividends paid were about $500 million.
Full-year automotive operating-related cash flow was $3.6 billion and gross cash declined $3.1 billion
Slide 23 shows that Automotive debt at the end of the quarter was $13.8 billion. That was $1.1 billion lower than third
quarter including actions taken on our 2016 convertible notes. We ended the quarter with net cash of $7.9 billion and
Automotive liquidity of $32.4 billion.
Slide 24 provides an annual update on our global pension plans. Worldwide pension expense, excluding special items,
was $1 billion. That was $600 million lower than 2013, driven primarily by higher discount rates at yearend 2013
compared with 2012. In 2014, we made $1.5 billion in cash contributions to our worldwide funded pension plans, down
$3.5 billion, reflecting our improved funded status. In 2015, cash contributions to our funded plans are expected to be
about $1.1 billion globally, most of which are mandatory.

Worldwide, our pension plans were underfunded by $9 billion at yearend, that's unchanged from the yearend 2013
despite significantly lower discount rates, down 80 basis points in the U.S., and about 100 basis points in non-U.S.
markets. These were offset by strong asset returns, contributions, and favorable exchange. These results are clear
evidence that our de-risking strategy is working. Of the $9 billion underfunded status, about $6.5 billion or about 70%
is associated with unfunded plans.
Asset returns in 2014 for our U.S. plans were 16.4%, and 15.7% for our non-U.S. plans, reflecting fixed income gains
as interest rates fell, as well as strong growth asset returns. We've continued to increase the mix of fixed income assets
with the objective of reducing funded status and volatility. The fixed income mix in our U.S. plans at yearend 2014 was
77%, and that's up from 70% at yearend 2013. The U.S. plans were 97% funded at yearend.
Slide 25 summarizes our 2014 results for our planning assumptions and key metrics compared with the plan we shared
at the beginning of the year. We delivered solid results last year, meeting or exceeding all financial metrics established
at the beginning of the year with the exception of total company pre-tax profit. Despite a challenging environment,
particularly in South America and Russia and an unprecedented number of product launches, we achieved a total
company pre-tax profit of $6.3 billion which, as Mark said, was consistent with our most recent guidance of about $6
billion. Importantly, we also continued to generate positive automotive operating related cash flow.
So, overall, 2014 was a successful step forward in implementing our One Ford plan to deliver profitable growth for all.
So, this concludes our review of the financial details of our fourth quarter earnings. And now, I'd like to turn it back to
Mark, who is going to take us through our outlook for the business in 2015 looking at the environment, as well as our
planning assumptions and key metrics.
Mark Fields
Thanks, Bob. Let's take a look at the 2015 year starting on slide 26 with our view of the business environment going
forward. We project global economic growth to be in the 3% range, which is going to be led by U.S. and China. Global
industry sales are expected to grow to between 88 million and 92 million units after estimated sales of about 88 million
units in 2014. U.S. economic growth is projected in the 3% range. Consumer sentiment is improving, along with lower
fuel prices, which will boost consumer spending, providing support for that growth.
South America faces continued market volatility and policy uncertainty. A weak recovery is expected in Brazil, while
Argentina and Venezuela will remain in recession. In Europe, growth in the euro area slowed after the first quarter of
2014, but it is projected at just above 1% in 2015. In the UK, growth is projected to remain in the 2.5% to 3% range. In
Russia, the combination of lower oil prices, geopolitical events and ruble depreciation will lead to a sharp decline in
GDP and higher inflation.
In Asia Pacific, China's economic growth is projected in the 7% to 7.5% range. Consumer income growth will support
an increase in vehicle sales but at a more moderate pace this year. And with some encouraging signs of improvement,
growth in India is projected to rise above 6% in 2015, supported by a more favorable policy environment. So, stepping
back, despite challenges in some key markets, we do expect the global economy to grow in 2015 and be supportive of
our projection for higher global industry volume this year.
On slide 27, we summarize our 2015 outlook for our Automotive sector and Ford Credit. We expect North America to
be strongly profitable at a level higher than 2014 with an operating margin of 8% to 9%. This outlook includes higher
market share and net pricing, reflecting the impact of launching seven all-new or significantly refreshed products, as
well as the effect of the record 16 launches in 2014, many of which occurred late in the year. And keep in mind, the
F-150 changeover and downtime at our Kansas City plant will impact the first quarter.
In South America, pre-tax results are expected to be substantially improved from 2014, still a loss. This outlook reflects
the continuation of difficult macroeconomic conditions, with industry volume about equal to 2014. We expect higher
market share in 2015 as a result of new product introductions, including the all-new Ka. We also expect higher net

pricing in part due to new products but also to recover, at least in part, the unfavorable effects of weaker currencies and
high local inflation. And finally, our South American results will not include the operating results of our Venezuela
operations, including any impact of currency devaluations.
Moving on to Europe, pre-tax results are expected to improve from 2014 but still be a loss. This outlook reflects higher
market share, volume, and net pricing in the Europe 20 markets despite intense competition across the region, as well
as weak economic growth in the euro area. This is updated from our September Investor Day guidance of a loss of
about $250 million that's largely due to uncertainty around conditions in Russia, as well as higher pension expense in
2015 as a result of even lower discount rates.
Middle East and Africa is expected to deliver a loss somewhat larger than 2014 as we invest for future growth. And in
Asia Pacific, we expect wholesale volume, market share, and pre-tax profit to be higher than 2014 as we continue to
introduce new products and bring online new capacity.
Our Automotive net interest expense is expected to be equal to or higher than 2014. And finally, Ford Credit continues
to implement its growth plan and expects pre-tax profit to be equal to or higher than 2014. This outlook reflects
year-end managed receivables in the range of $123 billion to $128 billion and managed leverage to continue in the
range of 8-to-9 to 1 and distributions of about $250 million.
So, moving on, let's look at the expected calendarization of total company 2015 pre-tax results. So, slide 28 shows
directionally the calendarization of our profits in 2014 will not be consistent with our typical historical trend. In North
America, the all-new F-150 changeover and downtime at the Kansas City plant will affect first quarter results.
We also will incur cost and lost volume in the first half of the year related to our seven 2015 product launches,
including the Edge and Explorer. And we expect to see the benefit of these launches in the second half of 2015. In Asia
Pacific, we're leveraging Ford's global product portfolio to introduce 18 new vehicles in 2015. And this will result in
lower first-half results as we continue to invest in four new plants that will bring new capacity on line for the second
half of this year.
So, now, let's take a look at the total company planning assumptions and key metrics for 2015 which is shown on slide
29. So, for 2015, we now expect U.S. industry volume to range from 17 million units to 17.5 million units, Europe 20
markets to range from 14.8 million units to 15.3 million units, and China to range from 24.5 million units to 26.5
million units.
In terms of our financial metrics, we expect Automotive revenue and operating margin to be higher than 2014,
Automotive operating-related cash flow to be higher than 2014, and as noted earlier, this is an improvement from our
September Investor Day guidance of positive. And this also includes capital spending of about $7.5 billion. Ford Credit
pre-tax profit to be equal to or higher than 2014, and company pre-tax profit to range from $8.5 billion to $9.5 billion.
So, overall, very strong growth and substantially improved financial performance are expected in 2015, driven by our
investments in new products and capacity.
So, closing all this out on the next slide, our priorities remain consistent, and that's to accelerate the pace of progress of
our One Ford plan, deliver product excellence with passion, and drive innovation in every part of our business, and all
of this underpinned with a continuing day-to-day focus on operational excellence. We're committed to our long-term
objectives that we shared with you, and we're making progress towards them as we execute our strategic framework.
And this framework is built on strong brands, serving all markets with a complete family of best-in-class vehicles to
lead in providing innovative mobility solutions through our Ford Smart Mobility initiatives, and deliver operational
excellence that is among the best in the business. And our success depends on a skilled and motivated team. And the
Ford team is among the best in the business, and we intend to ensure that we have the right talent for a rapidly changing
world, and that we maintain the trust and the familiarity that allows us to rely on each other's strengths to tackle any
business issue.
Looking ahead, the global automotive industry presents substantial growth opportunities, as well as rapid change, and
we intend to take advantage of both. 2015 is going to be a breakthrough year for Ford, driven by our unprecedented 24

global product launches in 2014, and another 15 global launches planned this year. So, this is our One Ford story, and
we're confident in its continued success.
So, at this point, we'll have to open it up for questions. George?
Mark Fields
Thanks, Mark. Now we will open the lines for about a 45-minute Q&A session. We'll begin as usual with questions
from the investment community, and then we'll take some questions from the media. Now again, in order to allow for
as many participants as possible within this limited timeframe, please keep your questions brief, and please avoid
asking more than two. Shontelle, can we have the first question.
Q&A
Operator
Yes. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli of Citi. Please proceed.
<Q - Itay Michaeli>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - Mark Fields>: Good morning, Itay.
<Q - Itay Michaeli>: Just a question on Europe. I was hoping we can dig a little bit more into the details around some
of the incremental headwinds. You mentioned the pension expense in 2015. And maybe a big picture view on kind of
what it takes now as you look at the market to return to profitability, maybe an update on what you think the reasonable
timetable there and what else you can do to take action to respond to conditions there?
<A - Mark Fields>: Well, as you step back and you look at Europe, we've had some success in meaningfully
improving the business in Europe, when you look at the three elements of the transformation plan: brand, product and
cost. On the product side, we've introduced over half of the 25 products that we said we were going to introduce. We
increased our shares we mentioned earlier.
Importantly, the investments we made in commercial vehicles are paying off. We've gone from the number-seven
commercial vehicle market share brand to number-three last year. So, we made progress on product, we made progress
on brand, our favorability is improving, our channel mix is improving. And actually our channel mix of retail and fleet
is healthier than the rest of the industry, about 3 points above. And we made progress on cost as we completed the
restructuring actions. And as you know, that will save us ongoing between $450 million and $500 million a year.
As we look at the industry going forward, as Bob mentioned, we're impacted by the lower discount rates which impact
our pension cost. Obviously, the situation in Russia is going to continue to impact us and will be a drag on our earnings
for a period of time. As we look at the industry, we're seeing – we do think that some of the impacts of lower energy
cost will help the consumer, which will be positive. On the same token, we also know that there's still a lot of
challenges that Europe faces.
And our approach going forward, we're going to continue to use our process, Itay, which is used at creating value
roadmap process, continue to look at the business environment, understand any additional actions that we need to take
to improve the business situation, and that's what we're going to do. In terms of guidance on profitability, we're going
to be – our objective is to be profitable as soon as possible using those elements that I just outlined.
<Q - Itay Michaeli>: That's very helpful, Mark. And then just two quick follow-up housekeeping questions. Any
guidance on the year-over-year P&L impact from the Venezuela accounting change, maybe what the 2014 losses were
and what the benefit to be in 2015? And then, maybe I missed this, but if you have a 2015 CapEx outlook, that'll be
great. That's all I have.

<A - Robert L. Shanks>: Okay. On the last one, Mark mentioned on the next to the last slide, I think, that our
guidance is $7.5 billion. That's just a touch up from the $7.4 billion that you saw in 2014. On Venezuela, we don't
generally provide specific profitability on either markets or product lines, but we did lose money in Venezuela. But it's
been very volatile. I think that's the thing that's been the most difficult about the market in terms of financial effect.
So, going forward, as we explained in the 8-K, Itay, there will be no effect on the company's results from what happens
in Venezuela other than if we can obtain cash from the authorities in Venezuela and use that cash to either remit a
dividend or use that cash to purchase components that we could then ship into Venezuela to support production, then
the profit or the cash flow associated with that transaction will be reflected in our results, but otherwise nothing. So
there'll be no effect. If we get no further cash or we don't require components or we can't obtain components to ship in,
there will be no effect on our results from Venezuela.
<Q - Itay Michaeli>: All right, great. That's very helpful. Thanks, everyone.

Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Mark Fields>: Hey, John.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: Just a first question. If we think about the guidance for North America margins of 8% to 9%
for the full year and then the cadence of earnings that you've kind of alluded to on slide 28, it would indicate that the
margins in the second half of the year or maybe even in the second quarter in North America will be 10% or potentially
higher. Should we think about that as a more normal operating environment or more normal level that you might be
able to achieve in the future versus what we'll see early in the year? Just trying to understand that.
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: Yes. Well, what we've said consistently for a number of years is North America should run
between 8% to 10%. Of course, that's going to vary. It depends on the quarter. It depends on where we are in product
cadence, launch cycles, what's happening in the external environment, what competition might be doing. So, but it
should range in there and in fact, if you look at prior to 2014, we kind of averaged a bit over 9% from 2010 through
2013. We did better the last two of those years, but then we got into the big launch period, and we said we'd be in the
8% to 9% range this year. We thought low end. We came in sort of mid, so Joe and the team did a great job in the
fourth quarter, particularly on cost, and so we did better than we had thought.
As we move into next year, 8% to 9% continues to be the guidance. We are affected by the launches in the first quarter,
not just F-Series but some other very high margin products that Mark mentioned, the Explorer and the Edge. And we
actually have still a very active year of launches in North America; I think seven overall. So, it will have an impact in
the first half, primarily first quarter.
So, your thesis is right. We'll see a lower margin than on average through the year in the first quarter. It will start to
recover and be very attractive in the second, third and fourth and give us the type of margin that we're describing for
the full year. And we'll see how things work out. We might have the opportunity to operate at the higher end of that
range, but I think it's a bit too early to say. I'd rather let the year kind of get underway, see how all these launches go,
and as you know, F-Series went very, very well. And then we'll kind of update you as the year goes on.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: Okay. Then just a second question on Asia Pac, it looks like your results in China are coming
through pretty strong. The JV net income or equity income was $1.3 billion almost. Yet it looks like the rest of the
business is really under some pretty significant pressure. For the full year, you posted almost the $700 million loss. I
know you've alluded to some actions there, but is there anything else that you need to do as far as rationalization or
restructuring that business that will be more concrete and provide for better results going forward and what would the
charges look like for that or what would the actions look like for that?

<A - Mark Fields>: Well, when you step back, John, and you look at the results outside, obviously, part of it is due to
just the business environment that we're dealing with there and the currencies. But we focus on the things we can
control. And to your point, as you know, in Australia, we're restructuring the business. We're closing our plant there in
2016. So, we're working our way through that, and also at the same time, we'll have 30% more products in the market
over the next couple years to drive the top line as we're working the cost side to hopefully improve the bottom line.
In India, it's about the investments we're making for growth. As you know, we're opening our second major assembly
facility there, which is not only going to support the domestic market but is going to be an export hub for us as well.
So, we're working on that and we're seeing the upfront investments around that, which is driving the situation.
We're starting to see, as you heard in my remarks earlier, a little bit more encouraging results we expect from an
economic standpoint, which should help domestically. And in ASEAN, working our way through not only the business
environments there but looking at each and every country to make sure that we have the appropriate product lineup that
we take advantage of some of the opportunities and strengths that we have in some of our particular products and use
that to drive our business higher. But the team is very focused on that piece of the business. So in total Asia Pacific can
contribute equally.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: Great. Thank you very much.
<A - Mark Fields>: Thanks, John.

Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
<Q - Rod A. Lache>: Good morning, everybody.
<A - Mark Fields>: Good morning, Rod.
<Q - Rod A. Lache>: A couple things. One, your content cost in North America was like an $18 million headwind,
which seems pretty modest considering the magnitude of the new product ramp that you're going through. I was hoping
you could give us some sense of how we should be thinking about that through 2015.
Looking at the Europe business, perhaps you can give us some brackets around the year-over-year impact you're
anticipating from Russia. And then lastly, since you guys gave guidance, oil prices obviously have dropped pretty
dramatically, 40%, 50%. Europe adopted a pretty aggressive QE. A lot of people view that as likely mitigating rate
increases in the U.S. I guess kind of high level, when you think about the changes that have occurred since the end of
September, how did those influence your views on the outlook for North America into 2015? Because I think you were
expecting pretty flat earnings net of the non-recurrence of charges last year.
<A - Mark Fields>: Thanks, Rod. Bob, why don't you take the first two and I'll take the last?
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: You want to take the last one first?
<A - Mark Fields>: Okay. Yes, sure. In terms of looking at the changes that you mentioned, obviously, the drop in the
oil prices will be good for consumers, and we think that will help the economy. As you saw, Rod, we are expecting
some growth in the industry. So far we haven't – we take a look back and see if there was any correlation between low
fuel prices and growth of the industry, and there's not a lot of correlation there. So we're very comfortable with our call
for the industry, which is really driven by replacement demand, because as you know, the industry has run under
replacement demand for five years, so we think that provides a good foundation.
In terms of the mix and what that means for segmentation, it could be an opportunity, but we really don't know yet the
impact of lower oil prices, what that means for the industry here in the U.S. If we look at the fourth quarter, what we
saw in the fourth quarter was very consistent segmentation changes that we see seasonally over the years. You see
full-size pickups rise because manufacturers are getting more aggressive. You see premium rise as some of the luxury

OEMs go for leadership, and you see small cars actually go down.
So we think we'll see the first quarter will be key to gauge if there's changes in the segmentation, because as you know,
in the first quarter, we usually see small vehicles and small cars actually go up as a percent of the industry. But stepping
back at a high level, we think it's positive for the economy, positive for the consumer, and that is the backdrop. Bob?
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: Okay. Rod, in terms of the first question around content, you didn't see much in the way of
material costs in the quarter because the amount of new product that we actually wholesaled in the quarter wasn't that
material, if you will. You'll start to see that more fully in the first quarter when we report in April. Because what you
had is you had really good, strong material cost reductions that the team delivered that largely mitigated the effect of
what we did see in terms of product cost. So, in 2015, for North America, you're going to see a much, much stronger
business.
As we said earlier, you're going to have a lot of growth in terms of volume. You're going to have higher share. You're
going to have a much stronger net pricing. And that's on the back of the products that we launched last year which will
have full-year effects this year, along with the ones that we will newly launch largely in the first quarter of this year.
But with that, what you will see is you'll see a substantial increase in product cost, and you'll also see higher structural
cost. And particularly, if you go back to the F-150 program, given the scope of that program, the degree at which we
had to change and re-facilitize the facilities, that piece will obviously be with us for most of the year given the timing
of the launch of Kansas City. So, very, very strong improvement in the top line, but you will see cost increases flowing
through both at the product level and structural level.
In terms of Europe, it's interesting. When you look at Europe and you go back to the transformation plan that Stephen
O'Dell and his team announced back in, I think, it was October of 2012, in that Russia was an important element
because we had made a decision to go with a local partner, which has been good. At the time, we were looking at an
industry that could grow to 4 million units. I think it was – by the end of decade, it was – at sometime between then and
the end of the decade going to become the largest industry in Europe. And of course, that's all changed. And it's a
difficult situation.
We're looking now at industry volume this year that's probably sub-2 million units. You've got very high interest rates.
You've got the collapse of the ruble. You've also got, in our case, for example, in all the euro-based manufacturers, very
aggressive pricing to respond to the change of the ruble versus the euro. And then we've got competitors, specifically
the Japanese and then the Koreans as well, who have not had to price as much because their currencies have already
weakened relative to the euro and the dollar. So there's a change in the competitive environment within Russia as well,
which we're trying to respond to.
So, we do expect to see a big headwind from Russia in 2015 and that is the major change in the guidance that we're
providing versus what we said in September. And when you think about it, the question you're going to ask me is, well
you wrote off your equity in the second quarter of your 50:50 JV. So, you had said at the time that that won't have any
financial effect on you if they were to continue to incur losses, which is true. But we still provide components and
make money on those components. We still provide after-service parts, make money on those. We still engineer the
products that they will ultimately build themselves, so we're incurring that expense. And for that, we receive royalties,
which of course are going to be lower. All of that's lower because the volumes are lower.
But in addition, frankly, because of the very difficult situation the business is facing there, the partners are having to
provide additional support for the business. And of course we're working very closely together to respond to what is a
dramatically different environment than what we thought even six months ago.
<A - Mark Fields>: And just to Bob's point, we're acting very proactively in Russia. We've cut production. We
reduced overhead. But also, we're working the top line. As you know, we're introducing six new products between
mid-year last year and the end of 2015. So, I guess I'd term it there's never a bad time to introduce good product in any
market. And that's our approach.

<Q - Rod A. Lache>: Can you bracket the impact that you're expecting? This seems like you've changed a lot over
there, but what is the magnitude?
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: Well, the only thing I would guide you to in the appendix, you can see the year-over-year
effect of Russia on Europe and it was $350 million. And all I'll say is that the environment in 2015 is more difficult.

Your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
<Q - Adam Michael Jonas>: Thanks, everybody. Can you remind us how much of the pickup truck market in North
America last year or whatever period that you have that's recent and relevant, is tied to oil and gas end markets and
maybe the Great Lone Star State, specifically?
<A - Mark Fields>: Well, Adam, this is Mark. We don't have a specific number. But, obviously, it's a piece of it.
Obviously, the biggest piece of pickup truck is the housing market. But what we've seen is there could be some – as we
step back and we look at the energy prices and what that may mean, for example, for wellheads and drilling and all that
kind of – those type of things, it could have a slight negative impact in, let's say, the Southwest. But keep in mind; we
could see positive impact in the rest of the country from lower fuel prices with more money in consumers' pockets.
Plus, the other thing that's encouraging, you look at the latest housing numbers in terms of starts and permits, et cetera,
we could see an offset on that. So, that's basically the way I would characterize it.
<Q - Adam Michael Jonas>: Okay. Thanks, Mark. And just as a follow-up, what would your team rank as a more
worrisome issue to you, the strong U.S. dollar or these CAFE standards that are kind of completely out of touch with
reality beyond 2017. And a follow-on to that, maybe could Ford weigh in on the issue of raising the gasoline tax? You
guys have any dog in that hunt? Thanks.
<A - Mark Fields>: Okay. Well, let me take the last one first. The gasoline tax, our position is we'll leave that to the
policy makers to figure out whether they have support for that. And what we're in support of is the things that we can
control, and what we can control is continue to have the team focused on delivering affordable and fuel-efficient
vehicles to the market that people want and value. So, that's our approach.
In terms of the two things you mentioned, the impact of the strong dollar, as Bob mentioned, we're not seeing a big
bottom-line effect on our financials in 2015 because it's a multifaceted thing. On the positive side, a strong U.S. dollar
indicates strength in our economy, and obviously, that's good given our position in the market here. And it's our largest
and most profitable. Alternatively, a strong dollar has an effect, as Bob mentioned, on our competitive position,
especially against competitors who import here into the U.S. And they could take it through pricing, reduced pricing, or
increased content.
So, as we think about that for exchange, for exchange movements that are driven by the markets and not by
governments, we'll deal with the hand that we're given and use our creating value process to improve the situation.
On the regulatory, it is a big issue, as you know. To meet those requirements, it's going to be very important for
consumers to adopt the new technologies, the electrified vehicles, et cetera. And that's an important part of meeting the
country's goals. And what we're seeing right now is they're not adopting them to the levels anywhere near that we
expected.
So, that's why we're very looking forward to the midterm review with the government, and as you know, to agree to the
one national standard, we wanted to make sure we had a midterm review to look at the feasibility of the goals, cost to
the consumer, impact on jobs, et cetera. So, that's probably the one that – is the one that we focus a lot on because it
requires a market response from that and adoption, and we're not seeing it at this point.

Your next question comes from the line of Colin Langan of UBS. Please proceed.
<Q - Colin Michael Langan>: The first question, can you just give a broad update of the F-150 launch, the Dearborn
plant ramping, is it fully ramped at this point, is Kansas City on schedule? And do you have any color of the new
F-150's pricing and any color around pricing there in particular?
And the second question is on foreign exchange. How are you being impacted by FX because you are expected to lose
money in Europe and South America? So, does some of the volatility there actually shrink the translation of losses? Is
that a net positive to you, or is the intra-region or FX impact more than offsetting that?
<A - Mark Fields>: Okay. Thanks, Colin. I'll take the first one. And I'm surprised it took that long to get an F-150
question, but I'm glad you did. We are exactly on plan where we expected to be with the F-150 launch. We have added
the third crew. It's our Dearborn Truck Plant. We're almost completely through the acceleration curve, a little bit more
time on that, but that's going smoothly.
In Kansas City, we have installed the equipment into the body shop, and the team is going through the debugging right
now. So, that is absolutely on plan. As you look at the market response, as we noted in December, we are seeing very
strong demand for the F-150. It's our fastest-turning vehicle on the lot. And actually, as we look at this month, we have
a few more days to close. If we track as we expected, we could have our best January since 2004, and we'll see a
material increase in terms of the percent of our 2015 F-150s as a percent of our total sales.
The mix has been rich, which is good. And just anecdotally, we were at the NADA convention this weekend, talking
with dealers. And I had a number of dealers telling me that they haven't even driven the truck home yet because,
literally, as soon as they're showing up on the vehicle transports, they're going out. So, very, very encouraging initial
response to the F-150, and we're bang on where we expected to be in terms of our launch. Bob?
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: Yeah. Colin, in terms of your question on exchanges, I'm kind of looking at 2015, it doesn't
– broadly across the company, there's some ups and downs, but doesn't seem to have much of a material impact. I think
you're technically right where we have losses, like in South America and Europe. Just look at the translation effects;
obviously the loss in local currency will translate into fewer dollars. But there are other flows. You've got pounds,
you've got euros, you've got a number of different currencies that are at play there. But broadly, for the whole
company, it's not having much of an effect there.
I won't talk again about the competitive factor. I think that's the bigger concern that we have in terms of the impact on
the businesses, the competitive factor that Mark touched on. But he handled that. So, the only other thing I would say
is, I think when we're having conversations around exchange, and particularly a strong dollar, we probably also should
at least comment on commodities, because there is a correlation between the dollar and commodities and – well, many
currencies and commodities. And what we're seeing, in fact, as the dollar has strengthened, we're starting to see good
news on the horizon from commodities, and it's pretty much across most commodities. And we think that will actually
be a help for the business in 2015.

<Q - Brian Arthur Johnson>: Yes. Good morning.
<A - Mark Fields>: Good morning, Brian.
<Q - Brian Arthur Johnson>: Just given the volatility of fuel prices, I want to ask a question that we haven't really
talked about for a while, which is around the flexibility in your factories to go back and forth between CUV and sedans
because it really seems the consumer is rotating away from sedans towards CUVs. A couple – three questions. One, can
you recap just what factories you have right now that currently can go back and forth between the two? Two, do you
see more scope for doing that, perhaps as you roll over some platforms in the next few years, so you have that
flexibility? And three, do you currently have with work rules, layoffs, reassignment provisions, the kind of flexibility in

your union contracts you would need to kind of get to the nirvana being able to flex to where the customer demand is?
<A - Mark Fields>: Thanks, Brian. Let me take the last one first. When you look at the flexibility, if you recall back in
the 2011 contract, very importantly, we came to agreements with our UAW colleagues around improved flexibility, and
that has worked wonderfully for us over the last number of years in terms of adding Saturday hours or increased shifts,
et cetera.
In terms of the flexibility between cars and CUVs, I don't know the number off the top of my head in terms of the
number of plants. But I would say it's fairly limited in terms of a plant that produces a car and a CUV and utility. But
we do have opportunities as we see the market move, again, using that flexibility, the work rule flexibility that we have
with the unions to either add additional weekend days or, in some cases, increase line rates.
And to your second point about going forward, obviously, that's something that we continue to look at as we plan our
product cycles and our manufacturing, optimizing our manufacturing footprint to take into account shifts and then can
we get the flexibility that we want in our manufacturing plants. I mean, we do have that, for example, in a plant in
Wayne, Michigan where we produce a number of different vehicles and engines. But we'll continue to look at that
going forward.

Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman of JPMorgan. Please proceed.
<Q - Ryan J. Brinkman>: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my call. I know you discussed the impact of fuel
prices on segment mix earlier and that's important. But looking at it from a different perspective, can you help us in
terms of sizing up maybe your annual logistics and freight expense? How to think about how that could be impacted
by, say, a 50% drop in fuel prices, whether we should be taking that into account in our models?
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: Yeah. That's sort of a corollary to the commodities. The oil price decline is going to give us
the opportunities to seek reductions in logistics expenses, and we're already seeing that as an opportunity for this year.
So, you're spot on.
<Q - Ryan J. Brinkman>: Okay. Great. And then, I guess, as a follow-up to that, I know you have pass-through
agreements with suppliers to compensate them when commodity prices rise and to repeat those savings when they fall.
Do you have a way to capture the change in the suppliers' logistics expenses or are they sort of permitted to keep that?
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: That would probably be subject to negotiation with them. But we do – as you said, when we
talked about before, we do have indexing across parts of our supply base related to commodity. So, as they go up,
there's adjustments. As they go down, there's adjustments. I think the logistics impact just as it is, for us, is a more
indirect impact. But certainly, we're aware of that, and we'd hope to capture that as that opportunity occurs at the level
of the supplier.
<A - Mark Fields>: And also, just to add to that, we manage a lot of the inbound logistics into our plant. So, we'll
work that aspect as well as in terms of what we can control.
<Q - Ryan J. Brinkman>: Okay. That's helpful. And then just last question from me on China, lots of talk of China's
slowdown recently, but actually it hasn't slowed. We continue to see all-time record highs there, 25 million-plus SAAR
in December, et cetera. How are you thinking about China industry in 2015? What's the latest you're seeing on the
ground? And then if sales did slow, does that necessarily impact your plan since you're also gaining a lot of market
share?
<A - Mark Fields>: Great, Ryan. As we look at China, we still see growth. As you saw from our projections, we
expect it to be between 24.5 million units and 26.5 million units. And again, a lot of that growth is coming from the
Tier 3 through 6 cities as consumers – their income rises, and they're able to buy a vehicle.

As we look at the industry overall, we had a record market share there last year of 4.5%, and as I mentioned, record
number of wholesales. We expect our business to grow again this year, and the reason for that is because we're bringing
on another plant. We just launched our Escort the end of last year. We have a number of products coming this year,
which are products that actually increase our segment breadth. So it's not just about introducing a new product in the
segment we're already in; it's introducing products into segments we have not been in. So we think that provides a good
basis for us, and we're coming off a position of strength.
The brand is held in high regard. The Focus was the bestselling nameplate again for the second year or third year in a
row. And our buyers tend to be younger and have a higher income than the industry average. And working with our
partners, we have really built out our distribution network, particularly in those Tier 3 through 6 cities. So, we expect
growth, not as much in the industry as we saw last year for the reasons I cited earlier. But we're very encouraged by the
positive response we might get from our new products to help grow our business.

Your next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner of CLSA. Please proceed.
<Q - Emmanuel Rosner>: Hi. Good morning, everybody.
<A - Mark Fields>: Good morning.
<Q - Emmanuel Rosner>: I wanted to drill down a little bit more on the earnings impact from some of the large
investments you made last year. So, in those markets specifically, you were mentioning before you expect stronger
volume, share and pricing, but also a substantial increase in product cost and structural cost. So, I wanted to just ask on
both these things.
First of all, on the product cost versus pricing, do you expect it to be a net positive this year? And then on the structural
cost, I don't know if you'll provide guidance specifically on that but by how much do you expect D&A to increase this
year? Obviously, you've been running at $4 billion-plus when you're spending $7.5 billion on CapEx. So, do you
expect a substantial increase in D&A this year?
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: Yeah. Let me take that. So, if I look at the company and I look at our structural cost, they
will be up more than they were in 2014 versus 2013. The biggest factors of that will actually be engineering and
manufacturing. And some of that is not just because of what we've already done but obviously we're still investing for
even more growth in the years ahead, particularly if you go back to Investor Day and think about the type of growth
that we were projecting out through 2020.
So, those are the two biggest factors. But we will see an increase in D&A. I'm not going to provide a specific number.
It's not, by any means, the largest of the elements that we'll see next year, but it will be a good increase in terms of the
size. And again, that is related to investments that we will have already made or perhaps some made during the year.
In terms of pricing, we'll see strong positive pricing both for product-related actions. And as we always do and that was
evident in the fourth quarter too in terms of the pricing that we achieved around the world that where we can
opportunistically take pricing, unrelated to product, we'll do that. And I would expect that to be the case again in 2015.
But again, we have to be very sensitive to the competitive position, and that plays back into some of the earlier
comments around what the Japanese competitors in particular may do, particularly in the. But we'll have very strong
pricing. And again, obviously, since we expect the results for the company and for North America to be better, we do
expect through the combination of the volume, the revenue that we'll see more of that in terms of the positive effect
than we will through the combination of the cost increases that we see.

<Q - Patrick K. Archambault>: Thanks. Most of my questions have been answered actually. Just one for me. The
increased free cash flow guidance from positive to higher, what are the main drivers behind that?
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: Well, when we gave the guidance of positive, we were just saying that there wasn't going to
be negative – it's still going to be positive cash flow, and that's what we were waiting because obviously, as you know,
cash flow was a change of a change to some extent. So, we wanted to see how we did in 2014. So, now we have a good
baseline and we can look and understand what we're looking at for 2015.
So, clearly, we're going to see it driven by the top line. So, the profitability is going to be a lot stronger. We see about
no change in terms of the CapEx. We've already talked about that, the $7.5 billion versus the $7.4 billion. And then I
think the changes that we'll see in working capital and timing differences are not that material in terms of preventing us
from seeing the fuller flow through of what's happening on the improved profitability. So, I think that the profits are
probably the single biggest driver that will fall through to the operating profitability.

Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak of RBC. Please proceed.
<Q - Joseph R. Spak>: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask another F-150 question, but this one about maybe the
initial fleet reception. I mean, you've talked about maintaining, if not improving, the cost of ownership. Obviously, we
saw the MPGs on the new versus the old and now fuel is a little bit lower, so maybe less of a benefit there. And I'm
sure you've seen the Edmunds report which showed that the labor to replace aluminum could be maybe 4x steel and
maybe 2x the time. So, I was wondering are there offsets to that cost of ownership that we're not considering. I know
the residual is a little bit higher, but wanted to see how that pitch to fleet is going. And then related I guess how are you
supporting the repair shops both for Ford dealers and the independents with getting up-to-speed on aluminum?
<A - Mark Fields>: Great. Thanks, Joseph, for that question. And when you look at the F-150 in terms of the response
from the fleets, obviously, we're just starting to ship. And as you mentioned, total cost of ownership is very important
to them. And their interest in the vehicle is very high. And we're just starting to ship vehicles to them in that regard.
And we think it's going to go well. All you have to do is – I know it's a different vehicle, but if you look at our Transit,
for example, which we launched last year, if you look at even in the month of December, we had our highest share in
the van and business segment since 2006 with a new product. So, as you know, what fleets do is they take a few units
first, they get some experience with them, and once they have good experience with them, they really start ramping up
the orders. And we expect to see that with F-150.
In terms of cost of ownership, and this gets back to what purchasing managers are looking at, as we've said, the total
cost of ownership for the new F-150 is going to be very competitive. We saw the Edmunds report, and unfortunately
the experience with that dealer was incorrect. The amount of time to repair based on the standards that we've developed
and also shared with the dealers it would have been about half the time; so it wasn't quite correct. At the same time, as
you know, we designed the F-150 so that when there are issues, body issues, et cetera, the way we've designed it, from
a modular standpoint, it's actually very efficient to actually repair the vehicle.
So, overall, in terms of what we've done, we've trained over 750 dealers to be certified. Unfortunately, this dealer that
Edmunds went to was not one of them. They've not gone through that yet. But we have certified over 750 and we've
worked with over 1,000 independent body shops to get them ready for the F-150. But overall, a very competitive cost
of ownership.

<Q - Alisa Priddle>: Good morning, gentlemen.
<A - Mark Fields>: Hi, Alisa.
<Q - Alisa Priddle>: Good morning. So, a couple things. First, I didn't catch what the percentage of the mix was of the
new F-150s when you were talking about sales in January. And secondly, Mark, I was hoping you would just talk a
little bit about your continued efforts to make quality a priority given that there was an additional $1.3 billion in
warranty costs in 2014.
<A - Mark Fields>: Very good, Alisa. As I mentioned in December, 5% of our total F-Series was the new F-150. In
January, we still have the month yet to close, but you'll see a number higher than that as we close out January, as we
stock up the units and as we get them to customers; so you'll see a higher number or a higher percentage.
In terms of quality, as you know, we've had a lot of focus on quality. We've had great progress around the world. We've
seen some of our own internal surveys of initial quality be very positive, particularly around the vehicles that we've
launched because traditionally we've had some issues around launch. And I think the team is doing a very good job on
making sure that the quality that we send out on our new products is what customers expect. And we're seeing that
progress verified by third-party results, whether it's J.D. Power or even Consumer Reports. So, we're going to continue
to stay very focused on that.
<Q - Alisa Priddle>: Okay. Were there any lessons learned from what you saw in 2014 or are recalls just too
unpredictable?
<A - Mark Fields>: Well, it's difficult to predict recalls. And some of those were obviously on some older models, and
we took a lot of lessons from 2012 and 2013. And the team has used that to help our launches actually in 2014. So,
hopefully, we'll see that reflected in our quality results and potentially recalls going forward, but we'll wait and see.
<Q - Alisa Priddle>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Ramsey of Wall Street Journal. Please proceed.
<Q - Mike Ramsey>: Hey. Good morning, everybody. So, I know that you guys have new guidance to 2020, but I'm
curious. I know that the midterm guidance for the mid-decade at one point was 8 million sales globally, and we're a
couple million off of that. Did things not go as quickly in terms of ramping up your global sales as expected, and if so,
where was it not as fast as you anticipated?
<A - Mark Fields>: Right. Thanks, Mike. Well, when we actually announced the mid-decade guidance back in 2011,
we said it was – here are our assumptions. And at that point in time, Europe hadn't tanked and South America hadn't
imploded. So when you take all that into account, if you look at what we projected in terms of the number of wholesale,
we had an assumption around industry around the world and the regions. And that's changed dramatically given some
of the realities of the marketplace. That being said, as you look back on a number of things on the mid-decade
guidance, we have actually achieved and we've factored those into our 2020 guidance going forward.
<Q - Mike Ramsey>: Okay. So, do you feel pretty good, though, that – I know South America is a head scratcher a
little bit, but do you think that some of these markets where you've made big investments are going to pick back up
again that we're going to – it was a stumble, and you'll see the previously anticipated growth?
<A - Mark Fields>: Yes, and we spend a lot of time on making sure that the capital that we allocate that we're going to
earn an appropriate return. And if you look at South America, we know that the business environment in the region
remains volatile, which is going to add uncertainty to the near-term outlook. But in the longer term, it's an attractive
and important place to do business. We want to continue to serve our customers there. As you know, the previous
decade, we made very good returns on our investments in South America and we expect that going forward in the
medium to long term.

<Q - Dee-Ann Durbin>: Can you just talk briefly about China market share and where you expect that to go this year?
<A - Mark Fields>: Thanks, Dee-Ann. As we mentioned, we have a number of new products launching in new
segments. We have two new plants coming online in China, one an assembly plant and one an engine plant. So, we
expect in China that to positively impact our sales. We're not giving out a market-share objective. Our objective usually
is – as usual around the world is, we're going to sell as many as people want. And we've seen our share grow pretty
dramatically there over the last two or three years. As we mentioned, we had a record last year at 4.5% in China, and
we expect that to grow based on some of the new segments and what we feel are compelling products for Chinese
consumers.

Your next question comes from the line of Joe White of Thomson Reuters. Please proceed.
<Q - Bernie Woodall>: Hello. This is Bernie Woodall imitating Joe White. Could you do me a favor – and I know
you've talked a little bit about Europe already – but just looking at yesterday, Sergio Marchionne on the Chrysler call
said, things are going to be improved in Europe over a low base, and then Fiat made profit in Europe in the fourth
quarter, General Motors is looking to make – turn a profit next year. But the casual observer might look at this and say,
oh, what's Ford's problem in Europe? Can you address that vis-à-vis your competition there? Thanks.
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: Yeah. Bernie, it's Bob. And I'm sure Mark will add comments. You know, we, again, I think
if you pull apart the business, we've made great, great progress on the European transformation plan, if I put Russia to
the side. And you can see that in the results on a year-over-year basis when you go through the data. We're seeing
improvement in the top line. We gained in share. We actually held price on a year-over-year basis in a very, very
competitive environment, and we saw a reduction in our cost. So everything is moving in the right directions.
But as I said earlier, we've made a bet on Russia. We think that's going to be an important market in the future. It's
going to grow. It's a commodity-based economy, so it's being hurt right now for what's going on in terms of oil prices,
as well as, of course, the geopolitical issues. But we still have confidence that over time, that could be an attractive
market, and we'd like to participate in that. And I don't know to what extent some of the competitors do or don't
participate in the Russian market and what effect it would have on their results. But certainly, that is probably the area
that's had the most impact versus what we had originally expected when we set out the transformation plan.
And as Mark said earlier, we've a lot of work underway to respond to a very changed environment and to make sure
that as that market recovers that we can participate fully in that opportunity.
<A - Mark Fields>: Yeah. And I'd just add. We're going to continue to work our process and, Bernie, as you know,
when you do comparisons it's important that you just – you look at the profiles of the various companies. And in our
case, we're in Russia with our partners. Don't know if that's the case for some of our other competitors. Have to look at
accounting treatments and things that were – that may have been gone away because of bankruptcy or others that
impact results. So, it's really making sure you do the appropriate kind of benchmarking between the two operations.

But we're going to stay focused. It's an important market for us. We've made a lot of progress. We have more
headwinds, a lot of it driven by Russia, and we'll deal with them positively.
<Q - Bernie Woodall>: Thank you. And if I could steal one more, you mentioned earlier, Bob, that by 2020, a few
years ago, you were looking at 4 million in sales in Russia. Is there any venture of what's your guidepost there by the
end of the decade in Russia? Are you making any guess?
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: Yeah, I think it's probably too uncertain to make a call at this point. Clearly, if you look at
outside third party forecasts, those numbers have come way down. But one thing you have to be careful of with any of
these more volatile economies is that, when you're at a high, you've got to be careful you don't project that out. When
you're at a low, you don't want to just say that that's where we're going to be for the next five years either, because what
goes up comes down, vice versa.
But I think it clearly probably is a less positive forecast at this point. But I think once they come out of it, and our
expectations are that Russia will be one of the larger industries in Europe over the mid to long-term.
