Good morning, and thanks for your interest in Lowe's. We delivered another solid quarter with comparable sales
growth of 5.2%, which exceeded our expectations. Our efforts to drive traffic, which Mike will share in more detail,
have resonated with customers, resulting in a 3.6% increase in comp transactions, along with a 1.6% increase in
average ticket.

Our US home improvement business achieved 5.5% comps for the quarter with all 14 regions generating positive
comps and our strong performance in Canada continues with double-digit comps in local currency for the third year in
a row.
During the quarter, we generated positive comps in all 13 product categories. We capitalized on increased demand for
exterior products as a result of warmer weather with strength in lumber and building materials, outdoor power
equipment, lawn and garden and millwork, while at the same time driving strong mid-single-digit comps in interior
project categories such as paint and fashion fixtures, and as a result of our strong brand and service advantages, we
continue to drive strong comps in appliances.
Lastly, our Pro business performed above the company average as we continue to build deeper relationships with the
Pro by enhancing our product and service offering to meet their unique needs. For the quarter, we drove 79 basis points
of adjusted operating margin expansion and adjusted earnings per share of $0.59, a 28% increase over last year's fourth
quarter. For the year, we delivered comparable sales growth of 4.8% and adjusted earnings per share of $3.29, a 21%
increase over 2014.
Delivering our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, in the quarter, we repurchased $562 million of stock
under our share repurchase program and paid $257 million in dividends. For the year, we repurchased $3.8 billion of
stock and paid $957 million in dividends.
As we head into 2016, the outlook for the home improvement industry remains positive. Continued support from steady
job gains and improved incomes as well as favorable trends in housing should keep home improvement growth
buoyant. Further, despite recent volatility in the financial markets, the fundamentals for continued growth in consumer
spending remain intact. Consumers should continue to benefit from improved household financial conditions and lower
gas prices on top of broader job and income gains.
These trends align with results of our most recent consumer sentiment survey where favorable perceptions around
personal finances remained stable even though respondents' assessment of the national economy declined slightly.
For the home improvement industry specifically, we continue to see favorable trends as the desire to invest in home
continues to grow. Roughly half of homeowners believe the value of their home has increased, which is double the
number feeling that way in 2009, and many believe this trend will continue, as we saw a significant increase in future
home value expectations. And while most homeowners indicated their spending levels are staying the same, they're
more likely to allocate funds to home improvement compared to other areas. In 2016, we will continue to leverage the
favorable backdrop for home Improvement, delivering great service to customers while also anticipating how Lowe's
will meet their needs in the future.
We take a prudent approach to managing our portfolio of businesses, making decisions that shape how we serve and
connect with customers. Giving careful consideration to how we position Lowe's favorably for sustainable growth, we
invest to obtain compelling returns over the long run. As we carry out our capital allocation priorities, which remain
unchanged from what we shared previously, our first priority is to invest in the business. We then seek to return excess
cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
We demonstrated our disciplined approach to capital allocation with the recent changes in our international business.
First, after a comprehensive strategic analysis, we decided to exit the Australian home improvement market by
withdrawing from our joint venture with Woolworths. We made decision to focus our resources on areas of business
where we see greater potential return on investment.
Second, seeking to reinforce our portfolio of businesses in North America, we are committed to accelerating our
growth in Canada by announcing our agreement to acquire RONA. The time is right to strengthen the company's
Canadian operations to take advantage of the significant long-term potential we see. We expect to build on the recent
progress our team in Canada has made and the positive results RONA has achieved over the past several years as a
result of their restructuring efforts.

With this transaction, we see opportunities to further increase revenue and operating profitability in Canada, including
enhancing customer relevance by utilizing our strengths as a leading omnichannel home improvement company and
drawing on our customer experience design capabilities, expanding customer reach and serving a new portion of the
market by applying our expertise in certain product categories, including our best-in-class appliance offering, driving
increased profitability in Canada by leveraging shared supplier relationships and enhanced scale as well as Lowe's
private label capabilities in addition to eliminating RONA's public company costs.
At same time, reinforcing our international businesses, our US home improvement business, with a dedicated focus
from Mike and Rick's team, is diligently working to drive profitable share gains within the US market. In 2016, their
efforts will continue to focus on improving our product and service offering for the Pro customer, and differentiating
ourselves through better customer experiences that make us the project authority.
Across the enterprise, we strive to be a customer-centric omnichannel company. So we'll continue to enhance our
omnichannel capabilities, evolving from a multi-channel offering to an omnichannel experience where all of our
channels work in concert with one another. We will support customers at every step of their home improvement
journey and build greater affinity for the Lowe's brand.
This strategic framework, along with our efforts to improve our productivity and profitability give us confidence in our
business outlook for 2016. Bob will share those details in a few minutes. This is an exciting time for Lowe's and I
would like to thank our employees for their incredible contribution they make every day. It's their hard work and
commitment to delivering outstanding customer service that makes this company great, and I look forward to what their
efforts produce in 2016.
Thanks again for your interest. And with that, let me turn the call over to Mike.
Michael A. Jones, Chief Customer Officer
Thanks, Robert, and good morning everyone. As Robert shared with you, we delivered another solid quarter with
positive comps across all regions and product categories. We executed well in the fourth quarter, growing both average
ticket and transaction. We drove traffic through our Black Friday event, which drove sales increases of 8% overall and
26% online with compelling offers and special buys on tools, holiday decor, appliance and other traffic drivers, creating
strong values for customers while remaining true to our strategic focus and core strength in home improvement.
We drove increases in traffic for the quarter through competitive offers, enhanced online selling capabilities and
improved marketing speed and flexibility from the digital capabilities where we tested new concepts like Deal of the
Day. We also rebalanced year-end promotions to take advantage of the extended outdoor selling season.
Looking at product category performance, we recorded above-average comps in lumber and building materials,
appliances, lawn and garden and paint. We saw a particular strength in outdoor project categories led by lumber and
building materials, lawn and garden, and to a lesser extent, outdoor power equipment and millwork as customers took
advantage of mild weather to complete exterior projects such as roofs, fence and decks.
In outdoor power equipment, we drove double-digit comps in off-season products such as pressure washers,
walk-behind and riding mowers. And in lawn and garden, we saw double-digit comps in soil, mulch and lawn care.
Outdoor landscape lighting experienced strong performance as well, bringing outdoor lighting projects to light by
providing inspiration and making selection and installation easy for customers by offering new product technologies
like LED. We also achieved strong comps in appliances for yet another quarter, leveraging our investment in customer
experience both in-store and online.
In-store, our 17 appliances we showcase in coordinate appliances allows customers to visualize how the appliance
purchased will look in their existing or remodeled kitchen, not just as a single replacement purchase, there is a full set
of new appliances and allows us to showcase innovations such as black stainless steel and the appliance finish and new
product collections like the Frigidaire professional collection or Lowe's Home Channel exclusive.

Online, we have enhanced our customer experience and presentation at lowes.com, including improved product search,
integrated and upgraded product videos, enhanced product presentation like (inaudible) reviews and simplified product
groupings to make it easy for customers to make their selection.
Our continued focus on our omnichannel customer experience together with leading brands, breadth of assortment,
competitive price, knowledgeable sales specialists as well as delivery and haul away service combined to drive our
sustained share gains in appliances. In fact, J. D. Power and Associates ranked Lowe's their number one appliance
retailer for 2015.
Paint benefited from increased project activity as well as growing awareness of our three-brand offering. With the
launch of HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams at the beginning of the second quarter, we are now providing customers
with the full suite of top brands they trust for their next paint project.
Olympic provides quality at a great value and easy application. Valspar specializes in color authority with their Love
Your Color Guarantee and HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams provides strong brand recognition, designer
coordinated colors and quality that customers trust.
We are also proud to announce the expansion of HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams with the introduction of Infinity,
our premium one coat paint and primer with exceptional hiding power and coverage available in our stores in March.
As customers engage in both indoor and outdoor projects, we leverage our omnichannel capabilities to help them
achieve great results, not only in our stores and online, but also through our project specialists who meet the customers
in their homes. This capability represents another important element of our omnichannel strategy. We have project
specialists who focus on the exterior of the home available across all US stores and we are expanding our interior
projects specialist program, reaching all stores by the end of 2016.
We are very pleased with our in-home sales program performance with above-average comp again this quarter. With
our ability to coordinate style, provide design expertise and find the right contracts to do the job, we are rapidly
becoming the project authority in home improvement.
And our customer experience design capabilities continue to pay dividends. Leveraging our largest store format and
space initially created for the outdoor living experience, we again showcase our holiday decor experience, an
inspirational holiday showroom where customers can see everything from point centers, and artificial trees to indoor
and outdoor decorations and gifts. Developing collaboration between our merchants, stores and dedicated customer
experience design team, the holiday decor experience inspired customers to decorate, raise their awareness of the
breadth of our holiday decor and gift offerings and provided project solutions relevant to the holiday micro seasons.
The customer response is very positive, driving strong sales and attachments for the products included in the set. We
are now transitioning the space back to our outdoor living experience in preparation for the critical spring selling
season.
Toward the end of the quarter, as Winter Storm Jonas approached, we amply served [ph] customers' needs as they
worked to prepare for and clean up from the storm. Our supply chain demonstrated agility and flexibility as we worked
to move inventories such as snow throwers, generators, ice melt and heaters to the areas in the path of the storm. We're
proud of the way our supply chain teams and associates responded to the needs of our customers during Winter Strom
Jonas.
We also continue to strengthen our Pro business, driving comps above the company average by continuing to advance
our product and service offering to meet their unique needs. Throughout the year, we strengthened our portfolio of Pro
focused brands with the addition of Goldblatt masonry tools, GAF Roofing, Owens Corning insulation, Lennox HVAC
and masonite entry and interior doors. In addition to leveraging our longstanding partnership with Hitachi, Stanley
Bostitch, Bosch, (inaudible) and Paslode to develop a broad Pro relevant selection of tools and fasteners.
We are also proud to introduce Cabot stains, America's most recognized stain brands rolling to our stores in the first
quarter. We continue to incorporate feedbacks from the Pro customer and store employees into a better offering and
experience by working closely with our field-based merchandising managers to identify local market opportunities and

introduce products optimized to local norms to further increase our relevance with Pros.
Along with strengthening our brand portfolio, we relaunched lowesforpros.com at the beginning of the second quarter,
making it easy for Pros to manage multiple properties and easily purchase items for the locations nationwide. We're
also actively starting to grow [ph] through account executive pro services or AEPs. AEPs call out regional customers to
help them order and replenish products across multiple stores. Our AEPs have been very effective in growing our
business with larger Pro customers, especially maintenance, repair and operations or MRO customers.
We currently have over 160 Pro outside sales representatives in the field and are very pleased with the program's
results. Excluding the AEPs we added this year, we saw a double-digit growth in AEP sales, which contributed to solid
Pro comp sales growth in the quarter. Bidding on this success, we plan to add an additional 35 AEPs in the first half of
2016.
We'll also reconnect with Pros who have not recently purchased from Lowe's to show them what's changed in our
stores and online, using targeted marketing as well as Pro-focused events to drive awareness and generate new
business. For example, our Pro services team engaged with customers at the International Builders' Show in Las Vegas,
driving awareness of the platform of services we provide.
We then extended the interaction to our stores for a first-time Builder Week with special product and credit offers for
the Pro. Our focus on strengthening our portfolio of brands, serving Pro customers through our Pro services team as
well as our relaunch of lowesforpros.com are part of broader commitment to build on our strong foundation with the
Pro.
In addition to our efforts to drive top line growth, we continue to focus on driving productivity and profitability. Gross
margin was flat year-over-year as improvements driven by a line review process and inflation were offset by the impact
of product mix and promotions. Once again, our stores effectively managed payroll hours on solid comp sales growth,
driving 25 basis points of payroll expense leverage, while also driving strong customer satisfaction scores.
We also continue to drive productivity in marketing by optimizing our media allocation, increasing our presence in
targeted digital advertising, expanding our social media presence and reducing print advertising, thereby increasing the
efficiency and effectiveness of our media buy, while improving our advertising spend, all while maintaining our
customer reach and improving exposure. And we continue to identify and implement additional expense efficiencies by
consolidating the procurement of similar types of goods and services across our corporate and store functions.
During the quarter, we demonstrated the flexibility and capabilities of our supply chain as our distribution teams
worked efficiently to move inventory to meet customer needs, not only as they prepared for winter storms in the
mid-Atlantic and the Northeast, but also to meet the heightened demand in the Pacific Northwest. While inventory at
quarter end was up 6% from last year, it reflects our commitment to being in stock for items that are most relevant to
our customers as well as timing of spring buys, including the impact of Chinese New Year and a higher level of
inventory to support strong sales growth in categories such as appliances.
As you can see, we are pleased with our fourth quarter results and the progress we continue to make on our initiatives
to drive top line growth, productivity and profitability. We look forward to sharing further progress with you over the
coming quarters.
Thank you for your interest in Lowe's. I will now turn the call over to Bob.
Robert F. Hull, Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Mike, and good morning everyone. Sales for the fourth quarter were 13.2 billion, a 5.6% increase over last
year's fourth quarter. Total transactions increased by 4% and total average ticket increased 1.5% to $67.15. Comp sales
were 5.2% for the quarter. As you heard from Mike, solid execution drove balanced performance in the quarter. Comp
transactions increased 3.6% and comp average ticket increased 1.6%.

Looking at monthly trends, comps grew 2.8% in November, 7.3% in December, and 5.3% in January. For the year,
total sales were $59.1 billion, an increase of 5.1%, driven by comp sales of 4.8% in new stores. For 2015, comp
average ticket increased 2.5% and comp transactions increased 2.2%.
Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 34.66% of sales, which is flat to last year.
In the quarter, product cost deflation and value improvement aided gross margin, but were offset by pressure from the
mix of products sold and promotions. For the year, gross margin of 34.82% of sales represented an increase of 3 basis
points over 2014.
In January, we made the decision to exit our joint venture in Australia. There is a process in the joint venture agreement
for purposes of determining the value of our portion of the joint venture. We are working our way through that process
and expect it to be completed in the next month or so.
We recorded a $530 million non-cash impairment charge in the fourth quarter. The charge includes the cumulative
impact of the strengthening US dollar over the life of the investment, the valuation based on our best estimate of our
one-third interest in the joint venture. This valuation is subject to potential adjustment as additional information
becomes available as we complete the process.
For the quarter, the impairment charge impacted SG&A leverage and EBIT by 401 basis points and earnings per share
by $0.58. For the year, the SG&A EBIT impact was 90 basis points while earnings per share reduction was $0.56.
Finally, as a majority investor, we have been recognizing our share of the losses, which were reflected in SG&A. In
2015, we recorded 11 million and $48 million for Q4 and the year respectively. As a result of our decision to exercise
our put option, we are no longer required to make capital contributions or absorb future operating losses.
My comments from this point will be focused on our operating performance and will exclude the impact of the joint
venture impairment. Adjusted SG&A was 24.55% of sales which leveraged 69 basis points. The leverage came from a
number of areas. Mike mentioned too, store payroll and marketing, which leveraged 25 to 20 basis points respectively.
Utilities expense leveraged 12 basis points primarily as a result of warmer weather.
Employee insurance leveraged 12 basis points in the quarter due to a reduction in both the number and severity of
claims. Also, given the sales growth, we were able to leverage fixed costs. For the year, adjusted SG&A was 23% of
sales and leveraged 62 basis points versus 2014.
Depreciation expense was $369 million for the quarter which is 2.79% of sales and leveraged 10 basis points. Adjusted
earnings before interest and taxes for the quarter were 7.32% to sales, which represented a 79 basis point increase.
For the year, adjusted EBIT of 9.31% represented an increase of 78 basis points over 2014. Interest expense at $144
million for the quarter deleveraged 3 basis points as a percentage of sales.
Regarding the reported tax rate, the impairment gives rise to a capital loss versus an operating loss and therefore is not
immediately deductible. To the extent the company has future capital gains will be able to offset this loss. Adjusted net
earnings for the quarter were $541 million, which increased 20.2% versus last year. Adjusted earnings per share of
$0.59 for the quarter were up 28.3% last year. For 2015, adjusted earnings per share of $3.29 were up 21.4% versus
2014.
Transitioning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter were $405 billion. Inventory at
$9.5 billion was up 547 million or 6.1% over last year. Roughly $200 million or 2.2% of the growth was driven by the
timing of Chinese New Year with the rest of the increase to support sales growth. Inventory turnover was 3.92, an
increase of 7 basis points over last year.
Moving on to liabilities, accounts payable at $5.6 billion was up 509 million or 10% over last year. The increase relates
to both higher inventory levels and a two-day improvement in days payable outstanding. At the end of the fourth
quarter, lease adjusted debt to EBITDAR was 2.14. Return on invested capital increased 18 basis points to 14.1%. We
estimate that the impairment charge negatively impacted ROIC by 238 basis points. 2015 was the third consecutive

year that ROIC improved by more than 200 basis points.
Now looking at the statement of cash flows, cash flow from operations was $4.8 billion. Capital expenditures were 1.2
billion, resulting in free cash flow of $3.6 billion. During the quarter, we repurchased 7.6 billion shares for $562
million through the open market. For the year, we repurchased almost 54 million shares, which included 3.8 billion
from the company's share repurchase program as well as shares withheld from employees to satisfy statutory tax
withholding liabilities for a total of $3.9 billion.
Looking ahead, I'd like to address several of the items detailed in Lowe's business outlook, but first I want to highlight
that fiscal 2016 will include an extra week in the fourth quarter for a total of 14 weeks and 53 weeks for the year.
Lowe's fiscal year ends on the Friday nearest to the end of January. This means we have a 53-week year roughly every
five years. Our last 53-week year was 2011.
For 2016, we estimate that the 53rd week will aid total sales by approximately 1.5%, and earnings per share by $0.05 to
$0.06. Secondly, while we have reached agreement to acquire RONA, we have shareholder and regulatory approvals
ahead of us. As a result, our outlook excludes the impact of the RONA transaction.
Now let's get into the outlook. As Robert noted, the forecast for the home improvement industry remains positive.
While we're optimistic about that forecast, we've taken a prudent approach to our 2016 outlook. For 2016, we expect
total sales increase of approximately 6%, driven by a comp sales increase of 4%, the impact of the 53rd week and the
opening of approximately 45 stores, which includes 20 Orchard locations and 12 stores in Canada largely the result of
the target lease acquisition. For use of modeling, the EBIT and EPS growth rates exclude the impact of the impairment
charge.
We are anticipating EBIT increase of 80 to 90 basis points from a combination of gross margin, SG&A and
depreciation. As you've heard from others, there is wage pressure in the marketplace. Our outlook for 2016 assumes
roughly 7 basis points or $0.03 per share of pressure associated with above-average wage inflation.
For 2016, we expect 25 to 30 basis points of EBIT expansion per point of above 1%. While this is our expectation for
the year, there will be some choppiness quarter-to-quarter. Similar to last year, EBIT expansion will be stronger in the
second half of the year, primarily driven by gross margin bonus and the impact of the 53rd week. As a result, we are
forecasting EBIT expansion of 50 to 60 basis points for the first half and 115 to 125 basis points for the second half of
the year.
And looking at our guidance model relative to first call, the mean estimate for the first half of the year appears to be
heavy by about $0.02 per share in both Q1 and Q2 and the fourth quarter looks wide likely as a result of the 53rd week.
The effective tax rate is expected to be 38.1%. For the year, we expect earnings per share of approximately $4, which
represents an increase of 21.6% over 2015 adjusted EPS. We are forecasting cash flow from operations to be
approximately 5.4 billion. Our capital plan for 2016 is approximately $1.5 billion. This results in estimated free cash
flow of 3.9 billion for 2016.
We expect to issue incremental debt during the year as we manage to the 2.25 lease adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR target.
We had approximately $3.6 billion remaining under share repurchase authorization at the end of the fiscal year. Our
guidance assumes approximately $3.5 billion in share repurchases for 2016. The share repurchase assumption of $3.5
billion is not expected to be affected by the RONA acquisition.
Virginia, we are now ready for questions.

Simeon Gutman, Analyst
Thanks. Good morning. Bob, just a quick follow-up on the progression of the flow-through for the year. I guess that --
we were under the impression there were some indirect costs that had come out in the middle part of the last year and
that would still roll through the model in the first part of '16. And so why, I guess, isn't that the case and then can you
just put a little more color around a wide bonus in GM? I don't know if those were mentioned any part of the year, but
what are the factors that are going to, I think, help you with flow-through in those areas?
Robert F. Hull, Chief Financial Officer
Simeon, there is a variety of factors that contribute to flow through being a little bit heavier in the second half of the
year. Gross margin, really based on the mix of products primarily, we had a greater mix impact in the fourth quarter in
the second half of the year than we did in the year as a whole. That's the primary difference driving a little heavier
gross margin expansion in the second half than the first half.
For bonus, we came into the year expecting to leverage bonus roughly 10 basis points, ending up being flat as a percent
of sales for 2015 relative to 2014. A lot of that difference came in the fourth quarter strength of our sales performance.
Our bonus programs are predicated on sales and earnings performance and based on the strength of the sales results for
the fourth quarter, we increased bonus accruals. As a result, we'll have the opportunity to leverage against that build in
Q4 2015.
Another smaller item, store environment, so just the timing of projects weighted more in the first half versus second
half is to think about 2016 versus 2015 and the impact of the 53rd week, we have roughly $900 million of additional
sales in the fourth quarter. That's going to drive roughly 15 basis points of higher EBIT in the second half of the year as
a result of that. So those are the major factors giving rise to the difference in flow-through second half versus first half.
Simeon Gutman, Analyst
And to clarify, are there incremental indirect costs that could come during the year? And then I'll just ask my follow-up
in case I get cut off. Just the volatility or the variability in the months in the quarter, November was weak I think, but
you mentioned Black Friday was good I think, but November was a little weak, December was great against tough
compares. Does anything explain that, anything strategically, does it sync up with promotions, et cetera?
Robert A. Niblock, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
As it relates to the second question, really tough weather first half of November primarily in the Southeast. So, if you
think about our footprint, our Southeast orientation that had an impact on the first half of November. After that, we saw
much improved performance in the second half of November. As Mike indicated we had pretty good Black Friday
performance. As it relates to other indirect costs, we continue to work on our indirect spend and would expect to see the
leverage throughout 2016 from those efforts.
Simeon Gutman, Analyst

Your next question will come from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please go ahead.
Michael Lasser, Analyst
Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. It's about the promotional activity that you undertook during the
quarter. Is that something that you had planned on doing or was it more in response to what you saw in the marketplace
and then responded in time?
Michael A. Jones, Chief Customer Officer
Good morning, Michael. This is Mike Jones. I would say (inaudible). Most of it was planned. We do make adjustments
as we see the competitive activity in the marketplace and we will at times move out one form of promotion to another.
One of the things that you saw us do was move from credit as a premier form of promotion at certain points in the
quarter into other forms of promotion, but the total activity level is exactly where we planned it to be. The execution
towards that activity level we do make adjustments within the quarter.
Michael Lasser, Analyst
Just trying to interpret what you are saying, Mike, you had planned to do some promotions in the fourth quarter, you
were going to move away from offering extended terms of free financings towards more pricing and discounting that's
how it happened. And is that a right interpretation of how it unfolded?
Michael A. Jones, Chief Customer Officer
I'd say a little different. We planned to do promotions within the quarter. We promoted to the level that we planned to
promote to. And one of the adjustments that we made in the quarter was less financing and work towards -- more
towards discounts is what we did in the quarter. So, total level is exactly where we expected it to be with some
adjustments within the quarter and how we got there.
Michael Lasser, Analyst
Are there signs that the sector is becoming more promotional, maybe some struggle just with their survival. They're
doing things to be more relevant and so you're having to respond or is it just that this is the direction the world is
heading?
Michael A. Jones, Chief Customer Officer
I don't think so. I think with those are having challenges, the challenges are probably something other than just straight
price. I think there are folks having challenges around their format. And I'm not sure they are going to promote the way
out of those kind of challenges. And so I would describe the market as very rational. When we go after what we target
for share gains, we do it in a way that's rational. I think the majority of us do exactly that. So I don't see it become a
more promotional. I don't think I've seen anyone doing anything that's going to suggest that the market goes in a bad
space as a result of people trying to survive. I just haven't seen that.

Robert A. Niblock, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Michael, this is Robert. Also keep in mind, it's not just the promotional cadence that we executed in the quarter versus
our plan. It also comes into play the success of those promotions. So for example, we didn't plan on appliances to be
high single-digit comps for the quarter. There was opportunity there. Obviously as we've talked about in the past that,
particularly the fourth quarter, that's a category of merchandise that is from a competitive standpoint is something that
gets promoted through the holidays and we had great receptivity, great success with the appliance offering, the suites
that Mike talked about being in the stores, not only staying on the program, but the success of what we saw which
drove some of that mix impact as well.
Michael Lasser, Analyst
Understood. Thank you so much.
Robert F. Hull, Chief Financial Officer
Mike, just to clarify, so the product promotions impact gross margin. So we call that the negative impact to gross
margin based on the product promotions. The reduction in finance promotions, in SG&A, so roughly speaking the
EBIT impact of promotions in Q4 was about as planned. The complexion, as Mike described, between gross margin
and SG&A was the big difference.

Your next question will come from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.
Chris Horvers, Analyst
Thanks. Good morning. A couple of follow-up questions. So in January, was there any benefit from the weather in
January? I am assuming the warm weather. Home Depot talked about yesterday that being mainly a December
phenomenon. Was there a benefit from the big storm in January, trying to get an understanding of what's a real good
indication of the underlying run rate of demand in the business that was like a (inaudible) in your guiding to four for the
year?
Michael A. Jones, Chief Customer Officer
I'll start Chris and I'll let Bob talk specifically about how things fell in January. Just kind of as we said in our
comments, if you think about the quarter and year or what, but certainly overall warmer weather for the majority of the
quarter, that extended the season for the outdoor products categories, which is good as we went through the year, kind
of lawn and garden, lumber and building material, that is what we saw really strong -- outdoor power equipment, that
we saw really strong performance for.
But then we had stuff like Hurricane Jonas hit -- I'm sorry, super storm Jonas hit. We were in really great shape with
the products that customers needed at that point in time. So anytime that you're selling snow throwers and ice melt,
those things, you're not selling a lot of other stuff, but when the customer needs that product, being in supply of those
products, which our merchants did a great job with having secured the access to the product. As Mike took you
through, our supply chain did a great job of getting that product in the market where the customer needed it, whether it
was in path for the customer to have that product. So all-in-all, that was great execution in the quarter and taking

advantage of the opportunity that was there. Bob, do you want to talk specifically the weather impact in January?
Robert F. Hull, Chief Financial Officer
So as Robert said, with extreme weather, you're selling the, in fact, the products that your traffic is basically going out
selling into the exterior products. The weather impact for the quarter was largely contained to December roughly 50
basis points impact for the quarter, but as I mentioned, most of that impact was felt in December.
Chris Horvers, Analyst
And then so as a follow-up to that, the 53 in January, maybe thinking about that and then reflecting on the comp
progression throughout the year and how you're thinking about the first quarter, first half or second half?
Robert A. Niblock, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
So, as we think about 2016, we see the four quarters in a relatively tight band. There is some movement up or down,
but it's not substantial for the year. So, as we think about the 4%, it should be fairly consistent across the four quarters.
Chris Horvers, Analyst
Understood. And then one follow-up, which is on the EBIT line. So, we had modeled, I think, almost 20 basis points of
bonus leverage. So, in the fourth quarter, and it sounds like that was flat. Was that basically the delta versus your model
in terms of driving a leverage and as you think about getting to the 25 to 30 basis points next year, it seems like sales
upside results in less margin flow-through as you saw in the fourth quarter. So, I guess trying to reconcile those two
things?
Robert A. Niblock, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
So, the flow-through was impacted in the quarter and for the year by two factors. And we've talked about both, bonus is
one and the mix impact on gross margin is the second. If you have rough math would suggest Chris that those items
combined for a 5 basis point flow-through impact on the year, which would get us into the 25 to 30 basis point range.
We are comfortable with the guided range for 2016. It would also be in that 25 to 30 basis point range.
Chris Horvers, Analyst
Understood. Thank you.

Michael A. Jones, Chief Customer Officer
Good morning, Peter. It's Mike Jones. Yes, from an inventory perspective, I talked earlier to having brought in
inventory a little sooner to be sure that we're prepared for spring, but we are also looking at category performance so
that we can take advantage of what we think is going to be some upside with the way we've made some adjustments to
how we are doing our resets in terms of outdoor patio and some of those categories. So yeah, we're ready for the spring.
We think it could be a good spring for us and we want to be there to take advantage of it. And you saw us do that on the
other side of the fall as well, taking -- carrying some of the fall lines longer into the year to take advantage of what
looked like a longer fall season.
Rick D. Damron, Chief Operating Officer
Peter, this is Rick. I'd also add to that. Just from an inventory perspective, Bob talked about the impact of Chinese New
Year and the timing of that, and the impact that had on inventory layers for the quarter. So majority of that product is
spring-related. So we have that in our systems, it's in our TCs and being loaded into the store. So we feel good both
from a staffing perspective as we play in the quarter as well as the flow of inventory that we'll -- we won't have or we
won't see any significant gaps, if the weather continues to hold as is or accelerate it throughout [ph] the spring.
Peter Benedict, Analyst
Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then just on the big ticket comps, they were solid, 6.6%. Most of those transactions
above 500, but they did slow a little bit or decelerate from the third quarter. Just curious, given what's going on in the
stock markets, some of these energy markets, just curious if you're seeing anything kind of, when you peel back the
onion, any kind of wealth effect impacts on some higher ticket project demand. Again, it doesn't look like it's impacting
the overall business, but anything in particular you can point out there either regionally or what have you? Thank you.
Robert A. Niblock, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
We do not, Peter. Our business continues to be driven by income in housing. So really solid progress on the number of
jobs added throughout 2015 as well as latent years, starting to see some real wage appreciation. As it relates to housing,
continued solid turnover through 2015 as well as (inaudible) price depreciation. So all those factors continue to drive
demand for home improvement and we see similar factors going into 2016.

Thanks. A couple of questions, one to start with deflation, what you're seeing in lumber and copper on the quarter and
what the outlook do you think is for this year?
Robert A. Niblock, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
So those two items, lumber and copper, they really impacted Q4 by 35 basis points. We expect roughly similar impact
in Q1, but in fact dissipate as we progress through 2016.
Greg Melich, Analyst
Okay, great. And then second, I just wanted to make sure I got the CapEx cash flow buyback tied together correctly. It
looks like you'll be generating 3.5 billion of free cash flow, but buying back 3.5 billion of stock and that's excluding the
acquisition or anything you might get from the Australian joint venture. So, if we get the deal in Canada done early,
should we expect that 3.5 billion to be less or does that 3.5 sort of factoring that expenses is kind of out there? And I
guess why CapEx ticked up this year to 1.5 billion?
Robert F. Hull, Chief Financial Officer
So, regarding CapEx, the higher number of store openings is the biggest driver for CapEx. There was some timing of
projects, a couple of stores split from 15 to 16 as well as some other projects, which moved to about $100 million from
2015 to 2016. Adjusting for that, you basically compare 1.4 in '16 to 1.3 in '15. Bear in mind that the '15 number
includes roughly $200 million associated with the purchase of the target DC and leases.
Specific to the buyback and cash flow generation, you are correct that it excludes both the RONA transaction and any
funds received from the joint venture. However, even if the transaction goes through in the middle of the year, we do
not expect that the 3.5 million share repurchase will be reduced.
Greg Melich, Analyst
Okay, great. And then online growth, I think, Mike you mentioned up 26%, but that was around Black Friday. Do you
have a number for the whole quarter?
Rick D. Damron, Chief Operating Officer
Yeah, Greg, this is Rick. For the quarter, the online business was up 26% in total. So, that was the quarter number.

Your next question comes from the line of Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Seth Sigman, Analyst
Thanks. Good morning guys. First a question on the long-term guidance, the 11% EBIT margin goal. I know you said
you would update us at some point, but just as we look at the numbers, it seems to imply a similar margin improvement
in '17 as '16, but of course '16 has that extra week. So, on a 52-week basis, it implies an acceleration. How should we
be thinking about that at this point?
Robert F. Hull, Chief Financial Officer
So still on target for the 11% in 2017. Our guidance is just roughly the same level of EBIT improvement in '17 versus
'16. So you're correct on that. Regarding the 53rd week, while it is an extra week, it's essentially one of our lowest, if
not the lowest volume sales week of the year. So it's not entirely productive sales week. It has some impact on the
second half year, as I mentioned, but EBIT impact is only about 3 basis points for the year, so minimal impact '15
going into -- excuse me, in '16 going into '17.
Eric Bosshard, Analyst
Okay. Got it. And then a question on the Pro side of the business. You mentioned that was performing above the
company average. That seems to be a change versus the last couple of quarters at least. Can you elaborate on that
trend? Do you think that's an industry trend or something specific that's resonating? And then I guess on the other side
of that, does it imply any major change in the trend for the DIY side of the business?
Robert A. Niblock, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
This is Robert. I'll start and I'll let the other guys jump in. Yeah, I think part of what we signaled was given the
favorable weather that we had during the quarter that I think that also helped drive some strength in the Pro business
when you think about the ability for all the project categories that we talked about for them to continue to work and
implement.
And on top of that, a lot of the other initiatives that we've put in place such as lowesforpros.com, the incremental
resources that we put in place after that is resonating with the consumers. So I think part of it is kind of an industry
macro that the weather set up and allowed for incremental opportunity in those product categories, which drove some
of that business. Then on top of that, some of the specific stuff that -- and resources we've put behind our Pro initiative
becoming more relevant with that Pro customer.

Page 15 of 18
Yeah, this is Rick, and I will agree with Robert. Weather had an impact on the Pro when we look at categories'
performance, particularly through the months of December, but I think it also continues to resonate in how that -- the
way the Pro continues to respond to our initiatives both from a brand perspective as the merchants continue to work
with the operations team to make sure that we have the relevant brands that the Pros are responding to, and then also
with our continued focus on making sure that both from a service standpoint and a value standpoint that we remain
relevant to the marketplace in what we are doing there.
So they continue to respond both to the brands. The outside sales organization that Mike highlighted earlier, about 160
people, we are adding another 35 into that organization, continues to perform extremely well and resonate with the
customer, particularly on our large MRO accounts and our national accounts as we continue to see those grow. And the
-- our core programs of our fab ways to save for the Pro customer continues to resonate really well. So, we think we
will continue to build upon the solid foundation that we put in place over the last couple of years.

Your next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.
Eric Bosshard, Analyst
Good morning. Curious if you could talk a little bit about your thoughts on market share with both the DIY customer
and Pro customer. How you evaluate the performance in '15 and how you think about how that performance might
compare in 2016?
Robert A. Niblock, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
I'll start, Eric. Obviously we think that as we look at the market share data that you can get out there that our
performance in 2015 exceeded the growth in the markets. We feel good about our performance had exceeded our own
plans and expectations. I think the team did a good job of capitalizing on opportunity that presented itself in the market.
For example, appliances and how we, the amount of business we did in appliances consistently throughout the year.
As we look forward to what the market looks like in 2016, the initiatives we have in place. I still believe that we feel
good that some of change has taken place in the marketplace. We feel good that we'll continue to, with our initiatives,
gain share in 2016 as well.
Robert F. Hull, Chief Financial Officer
Specific to the numbers for the calendar fourth quarter the makes -- was up 4.6, our comparable growth is up 5.1. We
know that's not a precise measure of the industry, but directionally, we feel like we're growing a little bit ahead of
share. As we think about 2016, we do some work with some partners to try to estimate what the expected growth rate is
for our industry and that would suggest roughly a 4% growth rate for 2016 which is right on top of our comp with
other, with new stores that suggests an opportunity to take share in '16.

I guess specifically, to follow-up on the Pro side, the investments you're making there, especially in the outside selling
efforts. Curious if you think that allows for a notable improvement in your market share performance with the Pro or is
2015 reflective of what that growth rate, what that market share performance is going to continue to look like?
Michael A. Jones, Chief Customer Officer
Eric, this is Mike Jones. We think there is potential for it to continue. If you look at some of the brands that we brought
back in fashion lighting with Kichler, progress lighting in Quoizel. That's a three-brand approach. This approach is a
home channel exclusive. You won't find these brands at any other home channel and if you look at our strength in
fashion lighting through this past quarter, we are up double digits. Paint, above the company average with
Sherwin-Williams, now bringing on (Technical Difficulty) and Olympic, again, another three-band approach. You
won't find this particular project at any of the home channel and with the addition of Cabot to couple with Olympic as
the knockout punch number one and number two, you won't find that at any other home channel as well. That's going to
let us continue to drive share gains in paint.
If you look at our approach in pneumatics with Hitachi pneumatics coupled with Stanley Bostitch, that's the number
one and number two pneumatic brands in the US, you won't find that at any other home channel. I can go through our
portfolio of brands that we brought back and exclusive set we have, and (Technical Difficulty) fantastic job. We think
that positions us to continue to build more relevance with the Pro, and when you couple that with the other initiatives
that we have, we think we got runway.
And we've talked before about GAF coming back, Owens Corning insulation coming back, we talked about the
(Technical Difficulty) exclusive, we talked about Goldblatt coming back. I mean, we've got a portfolio of brands that
we brought back to Lowe's that we think position us for share gains, to Robert's point, both with pro and with DIY. So
while we're comfortable by how we are positioned going into 2016, the team has done a fantastic job of bringing back
brands. We think we continue to build towards being the project authority in home improvement. We are comfortable
by how we're positioned.
Rick D. Damron, Chief Operating Officer
Yeah. Eric, this is Rick. The only thing I would add to that, again, is the introduction of lowesforpros.com in the second
half of the year, just getting its legs under it as we continue to gain traction from that initiative. I think it sets us up well
to continue to gain share from the MRO customer as we continue to get traction with lowesforpros.

Thanks so much guys for squeezing me in. I have two questions. The first relates to big ticket and to some of your
category disclosure. One category you cited as being a bit softer is kitchen, which I know is kind of a traditional big
ticket project-oriented category. And my sense is that that world had had some momentum for you. So anything in
particular holding you back, any macro reading you would take from performance in that category?

This is Mike Jones. No, we don't think there is anything in macro. Kitchens were challenged by some pull-forward due
to (inaudible) There is some reset activity in the kitchen as well. And we talked about these credit promotions. It also
impacted kitchen. So we don't think there is anything macro there.

really what happened was the sales beat by a greater degree than the earnings and the way the incentives are structured.
That essentially worked against you and sort of dug the earnings whole just a little bit deeper. As you think about the
incentive structure for the stores and the way you pay out bonuses. Is there any thought being given to reworking those
in a way that they're more profit or gross profit driven? I understand that the store level associates can't necessarily
think about the earnings for the enterprise, but in a way that incentive sort of the best kind of business that you can do?
Robert A. Niblock, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Matt, this is Robert. I think, yeah, you obviously hit one of the items that pull the pressure on the quarter and that was
the sales growth rate versus the earnings growth rate, if you want to call it. And what I will tell you is that every year
we look at our incentive compensation programs all the way across the organization and try and set us for what we
think is going to drive the right response across the organization to take care of the customer and drive the business.
And this has been an evolution that we've been on all the way back from when we were just single channel and the
incentive compensations were heavily focused to what took place in the four walls of that store to really now today
being an omnichannel organization with a store major, not only compensating on what happens inside their store, but
also what happens in their market as well.
So, it's an evolution we've gone through as we are going from single-channel to multi-channel to now omnichannel, but
that's part of what Rick and his team do every year, is look at the incentive compensation structure and make sure that
it's appropriate line. We're very happy with the behaviors that it's driving, but it is something, as we continue to evolve
the other parts of our business, become bigger parts of the total sales. It is something we look at to make sure that we're
driving the right behavior of keeping the customer in the center and always focused on what's best for the customer.
That's our job, and we'll be doing that.
Matthew Fassler, Analyst
