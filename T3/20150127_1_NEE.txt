With that, I will turn the call over to Moray.
Moray P. Dewhurst
Thank you, Amanda, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy delivered strong performance in the fourth quarter,
capping off an outstanding year overall. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share grew 8.4% while full year adjusted
earnings per share growth was 6.6%, even including a negative impact of $0.15 per share associated with the launch of
NEP.
Just as important, we made excellent progress on our major capital initiatives and Energy Resources had one of its best
years ever in terms of new project origination, signing contracts of roughly 1,400 megawatts of new renewables
projects, as well as partnering with EQT to begin development of the Mountain Valley Pipeline. As a result, we are
very well positioned for future growth and can reasonably expect to be able to extend our long-term track record of
growing adjusted earnings in the 5% to 7% range at least through 2018.
Cash flow from operations grew 7.8%, leading to a slight improvement in our cash flow coverage metrics as expected.
And we maintained our strong credit position, which remains an important competitive advantage in a capital-intensive
industry.
In addition to all these developments, 2014 saw the very successful launch of NEP, the initial assets of which delivered
operating and financial performance in line with expectations. The favorable development of Energy Resources
contracted renewable portfolio, coupled with other factors, led us to conclude that it makes sense to accelerate the
growth of the NEP portfolio in 2015 and we now expect to reach the so-called high splits, which implies LP unit
distributions at an annualized rate of $1.13 by the end of this year.
Late in December, the growth potential of Energy Resources, and by extension NEP, was further supported by the
federal government's action to extend the wind PTC program another year; which we expect will mean that we will be
able to offer our customers very attractive pricing on wind projects with delivery dates through the end of 2016. Longer
term, we continue to believe the growth potential for renewables will be strong, supported by both improving
economics and the EPA's Clean Power Plan. All in all, it was an exceptionally strong year with excellent current
financial performance balanced with equally positive developments in terms of future growth potential. We are very
pleased with the progress we have made.
Now, let's turn to the results of the quarter and the full year. For the fourth quarter of 2014, FPL reported net income of
$286 million or $0.65 per share, up $0.08 per share year-over-year. For the full-year 2014, FPL reported net income of
$1.5 billion or $3.45 per share, up $0.29 per share versus 2013. As a reminder, our 2013 results included a negative
impact of approximately $0.07 from transition costs associated with Project Momentum, our enterprise-wide
productivity initiative.
The principal drivers of growth were continued investment in the business and increased wholesale volumes associated
with two long-term contracts. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $832 million in the quarter, bringing our
full-year capital investments to a total of roughly $3.1 billion and driving year-over-year growth in regulatory capital
employed of 5.8%.
We achieved significant milestones throughout the year, bringing into service the Riviera Beach Clean Energy Center
ahead of schedule and slightly below budget; starting construction on our generation modernization project at Port
Everglades; and continuing to invest in our transmission and distribution network to help us improve our already
outstanding system reliability.
Our regulatory ROE for the 12 months ended December 2014 will be approximately 11.5%, achieving the 2014 target
that we shared with you previously. As a reminder, there is no longer an embedded negative impact to transition costs
associated with Project Momentum. Under the current rate agreement, you will recall that we record reserve

amortization entries to achieve a predetermined regulatory ROE, in this case, the 11.5% that I previously mentioned.
During the fourth quarter, we reduced our accumulative utilization of reserve amortization since 2013 from $155
million to $122 million, a reversal of $33 million, leaving us a balance of $278 million which can be utilized in 2015
and 2016. Relative to the expectations that we discussed on the last call, the smaller reversal reflects the unfavorable
impact of mild weather in the fourth quarter on revenues. However, the $278 million remaining balance is better than
we expected when the rate agreement began, primarily as a result of our productivity initiatives which have been very
successful. Total non-fuel-based O&M costs in 2014 were more than $100 million below where we were in 2012.
Looking ahead, we expect the balance of the reserve amortization, coupled with our weather-normalized sales growth
forecast of 1.5% to 2% per year and current CapEx and O&M expectations, will allow us to support a regulatory ROE
of approximately 11.5% in 2015 and in the upper half of the allowed band of 9.5% to 11.5% through the end of our
current rate agreement.
We are continually working hard to find new ways to strengthen the value proposition that we deliver to our customers
and I'd like to provide updates on three recent positive developments. First, in December, the Florida Public Service
Commission approved the Woodford Project portion of our gas reserves petition, an important long-term hedging
opportunity against potential volatility in the market price for natural gas. We expect the PSC to decide in March on
our proposed guidelines for subsequent investments in natural gas supplies.
Second, 2014 was the second year of FPL's current rate agreement and the second year for the gas and power
optimization program that we proposed as part of that agreement which, of course, the PSC approved. I'm pleased to
report that under this innovative gain-sharing program, FPL delivered roughly $54 million of incremental value to its
customers through optimization activities, and once reviewed and approved by the commission, will be able to record
roughly $13 million of incremental pre-tax income in 2015 under the gain-sharing provisions. This is an obvious
example of a win-win proposition.
Third, we remain optimistic that there is greater potential for additional utility-scale solar projects in Florida. Our
recent focus has been on improving the economics of three roughly 74-megawatt solar PV projects on which we have
already done significant development work and which we expect will be able to enter service in 2016 and qualify for
the 30% ITC.
I'm pleased to report that yesterday we issued a press release confirming that we believe we can now move forward
with these three projects with overall economic benefits to our customers. The total capital investment for these three
projects is expected to be approximately $400 million to $420 million.
Florida's economy continued to improve in 2014 and again did better than the U.S. average on most major measures.
Florida's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in December was 5.6%, down 0.7 percentage points from a year
earlier and in line with that of the nation. However, this masks the fact that Florida's labor force participation rate also
increased as more people were attracted to a healthier employment market. Florida added 230,000 jobs over the
12-month period ending December 2014, largely within the private sector. The corresponding growth rate in jobs of 3%
outpaced that of the nation by 0.9 percentage points. In fact, Florida's rate of job creation outpaced the U.S. in the
majority of individual private sectors, reflecting diversified growth.
Florida's population is also growing at a healthy rate. The U.S. Census Bureau reported recently that Florida's
population increased by more than 290,000 people over the 12-month period that ended July 1 of last year, reaching
19.9 million and moving Florida ahead of New York as America's third-largest state.
In the housing market, the Case-Shiller Index for South Florida shows prices up 9.5% from prior year, and building
permits appear to be stabilizing at healthy levels. The strengthening economy was reflected in improvements in
Florida's consumer sentiment index, which by the end of the year had reached its highest level since February 2007.
Fourth quarter sales volume was down 3.7%, driven by mild weather. FPL's average number of customers increased by
approximately 68,000 or 1.5% compared to the prior-year period, with a roughly comparable estimated impact to
change in sales of 1.4%. As a reminder, the remote connect and disconnect capability enabled by our smart meters was

fully deployed by the fourth quarter of 2013. Consequently, none of the fourth quarter 2014 customer growth is
attributed to this impact. Usage per customer declined by 5% compared to the prior year, with weather accounting for
5.3% of the decrease, offset by a 0.3% increase in underlying usage growth.
In the fourth quarter, inactive accounts were roughly 15% below the level of the prior year comparable period and new
meter connections continued to showed steady improvement by increasing almost 47,000 in 2014, which is over 20%
higher than the 2013 additions.
For the full year, customer growth and mix increased by 1.2% compared to 2013. Year-over-year, weather-normalized
usage per customer increased slightly by 0.1%. This metric was somewhat volatile in 2014, but our long-term
expectation remains at approximately 0.5% per year, net of the impact of efficiency and conservation programs,
through the period of the rate agreement and flat thereafter.
Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported fourth quarter 2014 GAAP earnings of $614 million or $1.39 per
share. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were $178 million or $0.40 per share. Energy Resources' contribution to
adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter was flat compared to last year. Strong positive contributions from new
investments as well as improvements in customer supply and trading were offset by reductions in gas infrastructure,
largely driven by higher depletion rates and by the impact of refueling outages at our Duane Arnold and Point Beach
nuclear facilities.
For the full year 2014, Energy Resources reported GAAP earnings of $985 million or $2.24 per share. Adjusted
earnings were $833 million or $1.89 per share. As a reminder, adjusted results include a negative impact of $0.15 per
share associated with establishing and launching NEP. This, in turn, includes a $0.10 per share non-cash income tax
charge, driven by separating our Canadian projects to enable them to fit into the overall NEP structure.
The growth in Energy Resources' contribution to adjusted earnings per share of $0.06 for the full year was driven
largely by growth in our contract and renewals portfolio, which added $0.29 per share. During the year, we installed
roughly 1,364 megawatts of new wind and 265 megawatts of new solar, making 2014 the strongest year ever for new
renewable capacity coming into service. We elected CITCs for roughly 265 megawatts of solar projects in 2014
compared to approximately 280 megawatts on projects in 2013. We expect to elect CITCs on roughly 365 megawatts
of new solar generation in 2050.
Contributions from our existing business were up $0.06 per share year-over-year. Wind resource for 2014 was slightly
above our long-term expectations following a slightly lower resource in 2013. Customer supply and trading overall
ended the year up $0.04 per share. Asset sales added $0.01 per share year-over-year.
Offsetting these increases was a $0.06 per share decline in gas infrastructure, mainly due to increased depreciation
expense primarily related to higher depletion rates. Increased interest expense negatively affected the comparison to
last year by $0.09 per share due to growth in the business. Contributions from corporate G&A and other decreased
$0.04 per share year-over-year, primarily driven by share dilution.
As we did last year, we have included a summary in the appendix to the presentation that compares Energy Resources'
realized equivalent EBITDA to the ranges we provided in the third quarter of 2013. In addition, we have updated
Energy Resources' projected adjusted EBITDA and cash flow slides and included an additional year forward. The
portfolio financial information for 2015 and 2016 can be found in the appendix to the presentation.
Please note that the slides now reflect the impact of the anticipated accelerated growth at NEP. All expectations
associated with NEP assume future trading yields roughly comparable to today's levels.
Energy Resources' financial performance in 2014 was stronger than may appear from a simple calculation of adjusted
EPS growth, in part because of the impact of the various costs and accounting charges associated with the
establishment of NextEra Energy Partners. Growth in adjusted EBITDA and cash flow were both strong with adjusted
EBITDA growing by 12% and operating cash flow by 29%, although the latter number is affected by intra-company
tax effects and working capital changes. The strong growth in Energy Resources' cash flow reflects the impact of new
contracted renewable projects coming into service.

As I mentioned earlier, Energy Resources had one of our best ever periods of origination activity for new contracted
renewables in 2014. On the last quarterly call, we discussed a number of strong prospects that the team was pursuing
and I'm pleased to report that since that time, we have added roughly 500 megawatts to our backlog of wind and solar
projects. All of these new projects have characteristics that we expect will make them attractive candidates to made
available to NEP over the course of time. We are now well ahead of the expectations that we shared with you at our
March 2013 Investor Conference with positive implications for earnings and cash flow growth in 2017 and beyond.
Contingent upon IRS guidance, we believe that the extension of the wind PTC, along with our development activities
and efforts to safe harbor equipment, should be supportive to our U.S. program through 2016.
The accompanying chart shows our current estimate of megawatts that can be delivered in their respective periods.
Over the last two years, we brought into service approximately 2,285 megawatts of new renewables. And in addition,
we have signed contracts for another roughly 2,115 megawatts, which we expect to bring into service by the end of
2016. If our development program goes as expected, we believe Energy Resources and NEP's combined renewables
portfolios will reach at least 14,200 megawatts by the end of 2016 and likely will be significantly higher. We will
provide a more detailed update on our origination and development activities at our March Investor Conference.
Let me now review the highlights for NEP. As you know, the launch of NEP came at the end of the second quarter.
Consequently, a discussion of full-year results is not meaningful and we will instead simply focus on the fourth quarter.
As a reminder, NEP consolidates 100% of the assets and operations of NEE Operating LP, in which, both NextEra
Energy and NEP LP unitholders hold an ownership interest. Accordingly, the financial values for NEP that we discuss
in these prepared remarks or in the attached slides are presented on a 100% basis. At present, NextEra Energy owns
approximately 80% of the economic interest and NEP LP unitholders own approximately 20%.
NEP's initial portfolio delivered fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA and CAFD of $54 million and $32 million
respectively. The assets operated well. Wind and solar resource were near normal and financial results were generally
aligned with our expectations. During the quarter, NEP also made its initial distribution payment to unitholders.
Earlier this month, NEP completed the acquisition of Palo Duro, the first of two previously announced agreements to
expand its portfolio through project acquisitions from NextEra Energy Resources. Palo Duro is an approximately 250
megawatt wind project in Texas. It entered service in December 2014 and sells 100% of its output under a 20-year
PPA.
NEP paid approximately $228 million in cash consideration, excluding post-closing working capital and other
adjustments, and assumed the differential membership viability of approximately $248 million. NEP continues to
expect a first quarter 2015 closing of its agreement to acquire Shafter, a 20-megawatt contracted solar project currently
under construction in California for estimated cash consideration of $64 million.
As discussed on the third quarter call, these acquisitions are being funded by cash-on-hand including the $150 million
of primary proceeds retained from the IPO and a draw on NEP's existing revolving credit facility. We expect to issue
equity in order to support longer-term financing needs at some point in 2015.
Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy, for the fourth quarter of 2014, GAAP net income
attributable to the NextEra Energy was $884 million or $2 per share. NextEra Energy's 2014 fourth quarter adjusted
earnings and adjusted EPS were $458 million and $1.03, respectively. For the full year 2014, GAAP net income
attributable to NextEra Energy was $2.5 billion or $5.60 per share. Adjusted earnings were roughly $2.3 billion or
$5.30 per share.
For the quarter, the Corporate and Other segment was flat relative to 2013 on an adjusted EPS basis. For the full year,
the Corporate and Other segment was down $0.02 per share on an adjusted basis from 2013.
On the development front, 2014 was a successful year for our pipeline projects. The development of both Sabal Trail
Transmission and Florida Southeast Connection continue to progress well through their respective processes as both
projects submitted the necessary filings with FERC in 2014 and are on track to receive FERC approval in 2015 in
support of a mid-2017 commercial operations date as scheduled.

The Mountain Valley Pipeline joint venture with EQT Corporation continues to progress through the permitting
process, with the FERC application targeted for the fourth quarter of 2015. The project has secured approximately 2
Bcf per day of 20-year firm capacity commitments, with an expected capital opportunity for NextEra of $1.0 billion to
$1.3 billion. The project is expected to be operational by year-end 2018.
NextEra Energy's operating cash flow growth outpaced EPS growth year-over-year and our overall credit metrics
improved and are in line with our expectations and consistent with our ratings. In the appendix of today's presentation,
we have provided actual performance for 2013 and 2014, as well as our projections for 2015. Additionally, you will see
the corresponding ranges that the rating agencies indicate for those metrics at our ratings.
Approximately $15 billion of financing transactions were executed in 2014 by our treasury team to support the growth
of our business. As usual, we employed conventional debt issuances and continued to make use of project level debt
and tax equity partnerships at Energy Resources.
Consistent with our well-established strategy of recycling capital, proceeds generated through the interrelationships
between NextEra Energy and NEP introduced another source of capital integrated into NextEra's ongoing financing
program.
In light of the progress made against our execution objectives, we continue to be comfortable with the 2015 adjusted
EPS expectations we shared with you last quarter of $5.40 to $5.70 per share. For 2016, we are updating our
expectations to a range of $5.75 to $6.25 and we expect to be able to provide more insight into the drivers of earnings
and cash flows for 2016 and beyond at our Investor Conference in March. As always, our expectations are subject to
the usual caveats, including but not limited to normal weather and operating conditions.
Turning now to NEP, our expectations taking into account all the asset acquisitions we are now contemplating, are
unchanged since the last call. For the full year 2015, we continue to expect the NEP portfolio to grow to generate
adjusted EBITDA of $400 million to $440 million and CAFD of $100 million to $120 million. This would support a
distribution level at an annualized rate of approximately $1.13, which corresponds to the upper tier of the IDR splits by
the end of 2015 or possibly slightly earlier.
After 2015, we continue to see 12% to 15% per year growth in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of
expectations for at least the next five years. Assuming current trading levels, this implies 2016 adjusted EBITDA of
$580 million to $620 million and 2016 CAFD of $170 million to $190 million.
That concludes our prepared remarks and we will now open the line for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Hey, good morning, guys.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Good morning, Dan.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Thanks for the updates. I guess, question number one, Jim has been [ph] pointing into (26:16)
the idea that 2016 would be a disappointment if it wasn't at $6. What do you guys – when you saw the guidance
increase today, can you just talk about what you saw that gives you confidence to move that number higher?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: First of all, we've had, really since the Investor Conference, the prior range of $5.50 to $6,
so that was based on the initiatives that we laid out for you at that time. Since then, we have been able to push forward
and execute successfully on, I would say, the vast majority of those initiatives. And we indicated as we went along the
way that we were feeling better about where we might be within that range.

Separately, Jim very clearly articulated a charge to the organization, a challenge to the organization of being at the $6
range; hence, the comment about being disappointed if we didn't get there. And then, in the third quarter, we simply
indicated that we would try and update now once we got past the Florida election and had a chance to roll the numbers
up again.
So all that is preamble to say that based on the success we've had since laying out those capital initiatives in March of
2013, we now think that centering the range around that $6 mark is appropriate, consistent with our normal method of
coming up with our expectations. So, as always, we're telling you what it is we see today. We could be literally
anywhere within that band, but we think that band is appropriate given all the factors that we can see today.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Okay. And I guess, Moray, just on the wind additions and the warehousing of additional
equipment to qualify for the PTC, can you just walk through what you guys are doing to key that up and then how we
should think about the ability to sustain, beyond what's contracted, additional wind growth for 2015 and 2016?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: I'll ask Armando to comment on the specifics on the development side. But just for
general context, I've said on a number of occasions that with the PTC extension which Congress now passed, we'd felt
comfortable that that would provide us good opportunities for projects that would deliver through the end of 2016.
I've also said that if there were no further extension of the PTC, we might well see a drop-off in new development for a
while, but we would expect, even without PTC extension, to see development pick up again later in the decade as the
influence of improving economics and the EPA's Clean Power Plan come into play. So just with that as general context,
Armando, you might want to comment on what we're doing in specific development activities to make sure that we can
get them in by the end of 2016.
<A - Armando Pimentel>: Right. So a couple of things. First, we're on a – I know we give you these numbers on a
quarterly basis, but we're on what I would consider a pretty decent roll with our development activities in the
renewables side. So over the last couple of years, we've signed long-term power purchase agreements for wind and
solar that are just above 2,900 megawatts. Of that 2,900 megawatts, Moray pointed out in the slides this morning that
some of those were built in 2014, but we've still got 2,115, I believe the number is, of megawatts for contracts that we
have in hand that will go COD in 2015 and 2016.
That number does not include any potential for wind projects in 2016. We believe that the IRS is going to provide
similar guidance on this PTC as they did last time. We hope that will be provided before the Investor Conference in
March, and at that time, we'll share with you what our expectations are on the wind side. But it clearly would be a giant
disappointment if we have zero megawatts in 2016. I just don't think that's going to happen.
On the solar front, really, over the last 12 to 18 months, we've done very well in that market. I think it's still way too
early to talk about what's going to happen with tax credits for solar beyond 2016. And as such, we probably have just a
couple of more quarters here where we and others will be able to sign folks up for long-term agreements on the solar
side. But we've got several very promising opportunities on the solar side that I hope will pan out.
To give you an indication, though, of what we've been doing, 2014 was also our highest ever year in terms of bringing
renewable energy megawatts to COD. In 2014, we brought 1,630 megawatts to COD. So we clearly have the
capabilities to do that and I hope we would do that. I'm certainly not committing to that, but we'll have more
information for you in March.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: That's great. Thank you. And just to clarify one thing, that 980 megawatts of wind that you have
on slide 11, that would be all for 2015 delivery because you don't have clarity on the 2016 from the IRS yet. Is that
correct?
<A - Armando Pimentel>: Yes.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Okay. Very good. Thank you, guys.

And we'll take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Good morning.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Good morning, Julien.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: So I wanted to follow up on the solar announcement in Florida and just explore that a
little bit further. First, can you expand a little bit on the regulatory process involved? Obviously, you've kind of alluded
to it and tried it a little bit in the past, but what mechanisms precisely are you looking for? What kind of recovery are
you looking for? And then subsequently, just in terms of timing, can you talk about the ability to scale this up? Or what
total size do you see ultimately in Florida? I know you've delineated at least the first batch here, but is there an ability
to scale this up kind of similarly as you've described gas before in the state?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Sure. On the first part, the regulatory [ph] needs to (33:02) be recovered through base
rates, so we've been working hard to make sure that we can deliver customer value, by which I mean make the addition
positive to our total system economics in the current environment. Not surprisingly, that has meant working very hard
on getting the initial cost down because that's where so much the economics are. And so we have now reached that
point, so since these projects have positive economics for the customer, we believe it's appropriate to go forward, and
in due course, we will recover them through base rates.
On the second part of the question, there's some special characteristics of these projects that make them particularly
attractive right now and we can't quite yet see generally scaling that up to a much larger size. We're going to need some
further improvements in the economics. These are also assisted by the fact that we're going to benefit from the existing
30% ITC, so there's a question, obviously, about future projects from that perspective.
So the answer to the second part of your question is, yes, we think there's huge potential longer term, but we think that
we need to get a little bit further still on the economics before we can go much beyond the three projects that we're
talking about here.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Great. Excellent. And then turning to Hawaii, can you give us a little bit of an update
on where you stand? Just as I imagine you've had conversations with folks from the state, I mean, how do you feel
about being able to execute that, both from a timeline perspective and also just in terms of anything you might have to
provide to get it all executed?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Sure. Jim will have a couple of words.
<A - James L. Robo>: Julien, obviously it's early days. The teams are working on the SEC filings as well as the
Hawaii PUC filing for regulatory approval and things are moving apace. And we are – as I said, it's early days and I
remain optimistic that we're going to be able to finalize things within a 12-month period here by the end of the year.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Great. And just a last detail, any updates on the rate base effort in Florida? Obviously,
you got the first gas approvals here, but just any issues or any changes in the program as you look towards getting the
rest done?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Really, no change. Obviously, we're pleased that they approved the specific project; they
will take up the question of the guidelines in March.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Great. Thank you.

<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Good morning, Paul.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: If we look at the midpoint of your 2016 guidance, are you just kind of using the forward gas
curves as they currently sit?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Yeah. All our expectations are always based on current forward curves, both for
commodities and for interest rates. So every time, as part of our preparation for these quarterly calls, we go through an
update to that outlook. We update all the major driving assumptions, of which the commodity curves are one. So, yes,
they do incorporate current curve. Now, recognize, of course, that those curves are bouncing around literally every day.
And if we...
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Right. Right. That's why you have $0.50 range, I guess.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Well, that's one of the big factors that causes the need for a range, certainly.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: And Moray, over the past couple of years, you've kind of expanded your reach across the
energy platform be it pipeline, gas, reserves. Are there anything else on the backburner we need to look at as far as
potential opportunities?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Well, I mean certainly we are always looking to see whether there are larger coextensions
that flow from the current skill set and current opportunity set. But I think we have articulated to you and to others
pretty clearly the ones that we are active in at the moment. So, obviously, our core is the power business. We have
extensive knowledge of the gas business, built that over time. We're very capable of doing all kinds of large-scale
development and construction infrastructure-type of projects. Transmission development is definitely a focus.
The other one that I probably should remind everybody is, obviously, we have a small effort going in storage in a
variety of different aspects from sort of early stage, following early-stage R&D, early-stage production companies to
actual projects that we either have completed or have in process. So that's kind of the suite of opportunities at the
moment.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: You're talking electricity storage?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Correct.

Now, we'll go next to Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.
<Q - Steven Isaac Fleishman>: Yeah. Hi, guys.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Good morning, Steve.
<Q - Steven Isaac Fleishman>: A couple of quick questions. First, just if you look at this year, I think you came in
around $5.30, and if you added back the $0.15 of one-timers of the NEP kind of restructuring, you're almost kind of in
your range for 2015 just doing that. Just so to kind of round out 2015, is there anything that particularly hits this year,
kind of limits the uptick?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: No, I would say it's the other way around so let me just talk a little bit about 2014. Why
were we able to exceed our original expectations even while absorbing $0.15 of incremental and unanticipated, at the
time, charges? There are a number of reasons, most of them, frankly, having to do with the Energy Resources'
portfolio, most parts of which ended up doing a little better than we originally expected.
First, we had – just plain wind and solar resource was better than the long-term averages; there was probably about
$0.08 worth of goodness from that. Interest rates stayed low, lower than we – because as I implied with my response to

Page 10 of 14
Paul earlier, we marked them to the curve but that curve didn't manifest itself over the year so it was probably –
corporate-wide, actually, it was probably about $0.04 of goodness from there.
And then, the other big one was really performance in the Northeast, so the NEPOOL portfolio was on the order of
$0.10 or so better than we expected, even more than – compensating for the shortfall that we had in the customer
supply business in the first quarter in the Northeast. And that business, in turn, made up that big shortfall over the rest
of the course of the year.
So you add up all of those different things and there was probably somewhere around the order of $0.25 to $0.30 of
unanticipated goodness. Now, to be fair, there was also some unanticipated badness, some smaller factors. But that's
kind of the difference. So again, when we do the expectations, we just go back to sort of baseline normal expectations
where the commodity curves are right now. So it's much more – and that's how we've done in 2015. So it's much more
a matter of fact that we've got $0.20 of, in a sense, unanticipated goodness in 2015 – in 2014 that we can't automatically
expect will carry over into 2015. We certainly hope it will, but we can't count on it.
<Q - Steven Isaac Fleishman>: Okay. And just on 2016 guidance in terms of the renewable backlog, should we
assume what you lay out here that's already contracted kind of gets you maybe to the midpoint? And if you're able to do
more that's how you get toward the higher end?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: No. No, absolutely not. We've covered this actually on a number of occasions. The stuff
that we're doing now in new development is not going to have a significant impact until we reach 2017, 2018 and
beyond. In fact, for the last year, pretty much the development effort has – is generating projects that are really going to
help us in 2017, 2018 and beyond. So there may be some slight timing impacts on 2016, but that's not really going to be
a big driver of where we are in the 2016 range.
<Q - Steven Isaac Fleishman>: Okay. Great. And then finally...
<A - Armando Pimentel>: Steve, Armando. Just remember that, historically, when we build wind, we get most or
virtually of the COD very, very late in the year. So when you're building – and we don't have anything in here for 2016
wind, but we certainly hope to build some and I'd love to be able to build them in January, February or March but,
traditionally, we put those in very, very late in the year. So there's just very little EBITDA that goes into the year.
And on the solar front, you're getting to the point really at this point where it's going to be very difficult to sign
contracts over the next couple of months and expect that you will be a – have a COD anything – at anything other than
very, very late in 2016. So that's why – if you just look, go back and look at history, when we go in COD, it's very late
in the year; it really affects the future year's earnings.
<Q - Steven Isaac Fleishman>: Great. One last question, just I think in your – beginning of your remarks you kind of
reiterated the 5% to 7%, I guess through 2018. But it does seem like your 2016 kind of got you effectively high-end or
above that range. I guess, so just – can you just maybe context the 2016 guidance with the 5% to 7%?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Sure. The 2016 – the center of that range, $6, is squarely within the 5% to 7% back from
2012.
<Q - Steven Isaac Fleishman>: Okay. Okay. Thank you.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Thanks, Steve.

weather-normalized demand growth and you have a lot of the regulatory [indiscernible] (44:26) kind of in your back
pocket to use over the next few years. Just trying to think about things that could offset those.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Yeah. No, there's nothing in particular but recognize that when we started out with the rate
agreement, sort of picture yourself at the beginning of the rate agreement looking forward, in general, you are going to
need to utilize a little more surplus depreciation in the out-years to maintain a given level of profitability just given the
fundamental growth in the regulatory capital deployed, so there's nothing special.
We're just, again, doing the same thing. We're taking our best view of the range of possibilities for 2016 revenue,
including weather variability against that, expectations for 2016 costs, CapEx, et cetera, and the amount of surplus
depreciation remaining. And all of those give us comfort that in 2016, we can be at least above the midpoint of the
formal range, so somewhere between 10.5% and 11.5%.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it. And I know we'll see this in the K and probably at the Analyst Day, but any insight
you can give us on 2015 and 2016 CapEx expectations at just FP&L?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: I'm going to defer on that one because I don't have the specific data in front of me. The K
will be out pretty soon.

And we'll take our next question from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Thanks. Good morning, gentlemen.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Good morning, Greg.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Armando, I just want to make sure I heard correctly that, practically speaking, when I look at
slide 11 and I look at the backlog for wind in the United States, you said that that doesn't have anything in 2016, so that
980 megawatts is really just all for delivery in 2015. Is that right?
<A - Armando Pimentel>: Yeah. That's correct. And let me just give just a clarifying point. That is correct, right. And
all of those 980 megawatts that you see on there, we have committed with the customer to bring those in before the end
of 2015. If for some reason a customer comes back to us and says, okay, now that we feel comfortable about 2016, can
you just slip it into 2016, we'll obviously do that. But what I really meant to say is we have signed no contracts right
now. None of the numbers that you see on here are based on a contract that we signed for a 2016 COD, right?
[indiscernible] (47:25)
<Q - Greg Gordon>: So that looks really good because your backlog went up from like 1,860 megawatts to 2,254
megawatts since the third quarter, and you still have great option on 2016, if you get the extension.
<A - Armando Pimentel>: Yes.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Just based on looking at those slides from the last quarter to today.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Absolutely, yeah. No, it's been a great period.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Shifting to another question, it's become a smaller and smaller piece of variability in your
business, but the Texas market has obviously been under some duress in terms of the gas prices coming down but also
heat rates contracting in the wake of new supply additions and concern over the economy in Texas with oil prices

having come down as much as they have. I know your guidance on 2015 EBITDA and cash flow has moderated a bit.
Can you talk about market conditions there and maybe what you've done to hedge out that risk?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Well, Armando may want to comment as well but I would say that, in general, on the
commodity front, both oil, gas and power, nothing much good has happened recently. And that definitely includes
Texas. In the short term, because we do hedge extensively, there's a relatively modest impact. But I would certainly tell
you that my personal view of the Texas market is less bullish than it was. Armando?
<A - Armando Pimentel>: I'll add just a couple more to that. When I look at our Texas assets, it's really divided into
three sets of assets, right? You've got Lamar and Forney, the 2,800 megawatts of combined cycle. You've got roughly
1,800 megawatts of what we call hedged wind. Then you have a much smaller 400 megawatts or 500 megawatts or so
of contracted wind in Texas. The hedged wind, really the first time that any significant hedges on the hedged wind start
rolling off is 2017 and that's not a very significant portion. You've got hedges after 2020 that start rolling off. So I don't
worry in the near term that much about either the hedged portfolio, hedged wind portfolio, or contracted wind portfolio.
As Moray mentioned, on the combined cycle gas assets, we leveraged those assets last year and part of what we did
was we went out and hedged a good part of the margin for about two-and-a-half years and we have been legging into
additional hedges when we can. That's a market that does not have a lot of liquidity, really, past 2016; and even in
2016, it's not like you can just hit the bid that you see on the screen. So it's not something I'm concerned about at all in
the near term. The longer term economics, as Moray said, on the market, I'm certainly not as bullish as I was a couple
of years ago.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Thank you, gentlemen. Have a good morning.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Thanks, Greg.
Operator
And we'll go next to Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Hugh Wynne>: Thank you. Moray, you had emphasized in your presentation today the improvement in cash
flow from operations and EBITDA which was stronger even than the growth in earnings. I was wondering if you could
drill down into that a little bit and just give us a feel for the primary drivers there and what were the differences with
the growth in earnings.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Sure. At the Energy Resources level, I think the main observation to make is simply that
the strong contributions to cash flow coming from these contracted renewables projects gets masked a little bit,
particularly in the early years, by some other factors. So I'll describe two things. First of all, simply in 2014, we had a
number of non-cash items that affect earnings, of which the largest was simply the impact of some of the NEP launch
costs, which obviously we would not expect to continue. So that's one source of difference between the picture that
you'll get if you look at earnings growth and the picture you'll get if you look at cash flow growth.
But the more fundamental one is that by the nature of these contracted renewable projects, you have virtually all your
investment upfront. And so, in a sense, the faster that you grow that business, the greater the disparity between your
earnings profile – the impact that it has on your earnings profile – and your underlying cash flow profile. So the growth
in cash flow that's coming from the projects is kind of masked in the early years by the fact that they're not as accretive
in the early years as they will be in subsequent years. So there's just – it's almost like a mathematical thing that goes on.
So we simply wanted to highlight the fact that the cash flow growth at Energy Resources is very strong and just to flag
for people that you probably want to look both at its contribution to earnings and its contribution to cash flow.
<Q - Hugh Wynne>: Okay. And if I could, just a quick follow-up on the solar initiative at FPL; if I remember
correctly, those were 375 megawatt projects and you're estimating a cost of $400 million to $420 million. Is that
correct?

<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Correct.
<Q - Hugh Wynne>: And then you're saying that the economics would need to improve for the growth in utility scale
solar to continue. Can you amplify on that at all what you think would be sort of an economic cost per watt for utility
scale solar?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Well, recognize that those projects are advantaged by a couple of things: first of all,
eligibility for the 30% ITC; and secondly by, I'll call it, good siting conditions, so prior development work that's been
done, access to transmission, et cetera. So if you just look at the generic – supposing I wanted to add 200 plus
megawatts of solar somewhere in Florida, you've got to start from a – with a clean slate, find a new site, get
transmission access, all of those things; look at the full cost of the project. That would not be economic today at the
10% ITC level.
So in answer to the direct question of how much more the costs have to come down, I would have to look more closely
at the economics. I'm going a little bit off memory, but, yeah, I would think somewhere in the order of 10% to 15%,
and we certainly think that that's likely to occur over the next few years. So, again, I would feel very optimistic about
doing more later in the decade.
<A - James L. Robo>: Hugh, the only – this is Jim. The other thing I'd say is we're very pleased that in this historically
low-priced commodity environment, that we have some utility scale solar projects in Florida that are cost effective for
customers. And so that 10% or 15% improvement going forward to offset the loss of the ITC and some of the special
advantages that these projects have, one of the ways to do that is to have commodity prices come up a little bit, right?
And so, I am – and we're seeing this throughout the country now, that solar is becoming increasingly cost effective;
utility-scale solar is becoming increasingly cost effective compared to avoided cost at utilities around the country. And
I think that's a very, very positive thing for our customers here in Florida and also for Armando's renewable business
across the rest of the country.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: And just as a reminder to everyone, really, the challenge of making solar work here in
Florida is actually quite a bit more than might appear because of our low-cost structure and hence, low-rate structure
which is effectively what we're competing against.
<Q - Hugh Wynne>: Right. Right, right. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Thanks, Hugh. I think we have time for one more question.
Operator
And we'll take our final question today from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie.
<Q - Angie Storozynski>: Thank you. So, first, on the growth in your wind power installations, we've heard from
other wind developers in the U.S. who seem pretty confident that their projects that will start the operations before the
end of 2017 will still qualify for the PTC given the expansion through the end of 2014. You seem to believe it's only
until 2016. So where is the difference? Are you simply conservative in your assumptions or do you think that it's really
still unclear, given the lack of the IRS interpretation?
<A - Armando Pimentel>: Angie, assuming that the IRS provides similar guidance to what they did last year on
in-construction, we think that that will mean – these are my words – essentially, a safe harbor for projects that would
get COD before January 1 of 2017.
There has always been the question out there that because the IRS or Congress – the IRS is just interpreting, did not
provide a what I'll call a drop-dead date on COD; that if you have continuous construction activities through the period
of COD, that you could qualify for the production tax credit beyond, again, what I call my safe harbor date.

So if some folks are saying, look, we can build at some point in 2017 because we believe that we'll have – will have
met continuing guidance, and the IRS has provided some examples of what those activities are, that is – I think that's
certainly doable. That's certainly a more aggressive interpretation than we would take.
Now, we may have some projects just because of their circumstances that we would feel comfortable building in 2017
to build – I'm sorry, to meet that IRS guidance. But I can tell you that we will try to minimize those projects because
we think they carry more of a risk than those projects that get done by the end of 2016.
<Q - Angie Storozynski>: Okay. And then separately on NEP, so I just wanted to clarify one thing. So if you're talking
about 12% to 15% growth in distributions per share, you are assuming that you will be able to issue equity for each of
the forward years assuming that the yield at the time of the issuance will be close to the 2.8%, 2.9% that we're currently
observing using the projections of the distributed cash per share. Is that correct?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Yes. No, it doesn't necessarily have to be exactly there but that's why we included the
comment about the, assuming roughly, current trading levels, yes.
<Q - Angie Storozynski>: Okay. Thank you.
