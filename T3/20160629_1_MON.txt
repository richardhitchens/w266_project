MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Greetings and welcome to the Monsanto Company third quarter fiscal year 2016 earnings conference call. At this time,
all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation.
[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Laura Meyer, Investor Relations Lead. Thank you. You may begin.
Laura J. Meyer
Thank you, Christine, and good morning to everyone. I'm joined this morning by Hugh Grant, our Chairman and CEO;
Brett Begemann, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and by Pierre Courduroux, our CFO. Also, joining me
from the IR team are Priyal Patel, Ben Kampelman and Christa Chancellor.
Our third quarter call marks the passage of a significant portion of the northern hemisphere ag season. And today, we
will provide a summary of our third quarter results, as well as the outlook for the balance of this year and the years
ahead.
This call is being webcast, and you can access the webcast, supporting slides and the replay at monsanto.com. We have
provided you today with EPS and other measures on both a GAAP and ongoing business basis. Where we refer to
non-GAAP financial measures, we reconcile to the nearest GAAP measure in the slides and in the press release, both of
which are on the website.
This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on
assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may differ

We plan to take a slightly different approach this morning on our format, so to kick us off, I'll hand it over to Hugh.
Hugh?
Hugh M. Grant
Thank you, Laura. Good morning to those on the phone, and thanks very much for joining us today.
Today, in our departure from our previous calls, I'd like to open with a few brief comments and then pass it to Pierre,
who will address our third quarter results and the outlook for the year, followed by the operational outlook for fiscal
year 2017 and beyond with Brett. At the end of this call, I'll close by covering our longer-term strategic view and my
perspective on our unique integrated solutions vision for agriculture.
But first, let me address the Bayer proposal and other strategic alternatives directly. Over the past several weeks, with
the support of our board and advisors, I've personally been in discussions with Bayer's management regarding this
proposal, along with others regarding other strategic alternatives.
Regarding Bayer specifically, there's no formal update at this point. We've said that we remain open, and we believe
that our efforts and continued constructive dialogue could allow our joint teams to explore potential next steps. While
any value discussion is more complex, given the fact that the industry is running a low point in the ag cycle, we
recognize the potential value these types of combinations create, as they accelerate innovation and increased choice for
farmers across a broader set of crops, geographies and production practices, while improving the sustainability of
agriculture around the world.
We continue to believe in the value potential of the right combination. Of course, there can be no assurance that these
discussions will lead to any transaction or on what terms. It's clear that Monsanto remains the partner of choice in this
industry. And I assure you that we'll continue to actively explore these opportunities and pursue value-enhancing
strategic options.
Our belief in the long-term opportunity is unchanged, and our growth prospects beyond fiscal year 2016 with or
without a deal remains strong. The global ag cycle is at a low point, and we've seen a series of recent economic and
political challenges. These are huge events around the world that create instability. Today, however, we see potential
for positive resolution on the horizon for some of these challenges, particularly, for our Argentinian soybean business,
for our Roundup Ready Xtend soybean blockbuster, and the recent announcement on re-registration of glyphosate in
Europe.
As this tide turns, and turn it will, with the changes that we've made to our business, we'll be well-positioned to
strengthen our leadership role in the space, with our financial discipline and our steadfast commitment to innovation.
So with that, let me pass it to Pierre.
Pierre C. Courduroux
Thanks, Hugh, and good morning to everyone.
Despite the fact that this has been a tough year and this was a tough quarter given the events that Hugh alluded to, as a
company, we've remained focused on delivering on our strategy, while taking the necessary actions to set the stage for
future growth, as illustrated by the following.

We have stayed true to our philosophy of pricing to the value of our innovation. We have delivered on significant
strategic portfolio management and licensing commitments, resulting in an approximate $370 million EBIT
contribution for this fiscal year, as compared to $274 million in 2015. We are tracking very well towards our
restructuring plan savings at a cost now closer to the low end of the range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, while
transforming and modernizing the way we work. And we have delivered on our capital allocation commitment.
This demonstrates our ability to maintain our focus on the variables we control despite an unprecedented level of
challenges affecting our business. These actions set us up nicely for momentum going into the anticipated rebound in
the ag cycle, with an expected return to growth in earnings per share in fiscal year 2017, which accelerates to a
mid-teens earnings per share growth rate from fiscal year 2017 to 2021.
With that, let's focus on the here and now and review our third quarter results, as shown on slide four and five. On an
as-reported basis, our third quarter earnings per share is $1.63, reflecting $0.54 for restructuring charges, environmental
and litigation matters, and a charge for Argentine-related tax matters. The Argentine-related tax matter resulted in a
charge of $219 million, which refers primarily to a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, mostly driven
by recent cumulative losses in our Argentine subsidiary. With growth in the business, we would expect to see this
allowance reverse partially or in full over time. On an ongoing basis, this translates into $2.17 of earnings per share.
Although partly offset by the benefits of share repurchases and increased row crop licensing EBIT contributions, we
encountered several headwinds in the quarter. These included the expected absence of last year's Scotts licensing
agreement and the anticipated glyphosate pricing declines, but also, Roundup Ready Xtend-related costs and lower
soybean volumes, amplified by the delayed EU import approval, as well as lower cotton gross profit in India arising
from pricing regulations and declines in planted acres. Finally, our free cash flow year-to-date is a use of $224 million
as compared to a use of $789 million in the prior year, reflecting strong working capital management.
From a year-to-date perspective, our Seeds and Genomic gross profit margin, as a percent of net sales, was nearly flat
at 62%. Global corn gross profit margin was down just slightly, as increased COGS from lower production plans
combined with discounting to counter competitive offers more than offset the mix lift benefit from new hybrid
introductions and price increases in local currency in regions like Brazil.
In global soybeans, gross profit margins declined approximately three percentage points, primarily as a result of costs
associated with Roundup Ready Xtend launch, which were amplified by the delayed European import approval. These
more than offset the pricing benefit from increased Intacta penetration that was partly masked by the weak reais at a
critical point in the season.
Our cotton business gross profit margin reduction was due primarily to Indian pricing controls that were enacted in the
third quarter of this fiscal year, while vegetable margins improved due to lower costs rising from better operations. And
finally, our other crop segment margins improved with closure of the alfalfa licensing deal with Forage Genetics.
Moving to Ag Productivity, gross profit margins declined due to the lower Roundup pricing and the absence of the
$274 million licensing deal with Scotts. Looking forward, we are seeing signs of a positive resolution for several of the
headwinds we've been tracking. First, the EU commission just affirmed that an 18-month extension of the existing
authorization for glyphosate use would be completed by the June 30 deadline. In addition, we anticipate the receipt of
the EU import approval for Roundup Ready Xtend stack shortly thereafter. And finally, Argentina announced an
interim policy that supports mandatory testing for Intacta, leading into what we expect to be a strong start for our
southern hemisphere businesses.
However, despite these positive developments and expectations, with the results of the third quarter, we now expect to
be at the low end of our ongoing fiscal year 2016 earnings per share range of $4.40 to $5.10, which assumes
approximately $0.85 of currency headwinds. After the inclusion of the Argentine-related tax matters and the favorable
change in the expected amount and timing of restructuring expense, this translate into a full year as reported earnings
per share guidance at the low end of an adjusted range of $3.36 to $4.14.
Now, let's take a look at the individual components within our 2016 guidance, as shown on slide 6. First, with recent
revisions, we expect Seeds and Genomics gross profit to be down just under 5% for the full year. Importantly,

exclusive of estimated currency headwinds of roughly $350 million, Seeds and Genomics gross profit is anticipated to
be flat to up slightly. Practically, on a currency-neutral basis, we expect the benefit of the alfalfa license, increased
Intacta penetration and global corn volumes to offset the roughly $150 million impact of the Roundup Ready Xtend
soybeans-related cost and share loss, the impact of the pricing controls in India cotton and decline in planted acres
there.
Of the approximately $370 million EBIT benefit from licensing and strategic deals expected in fiscal year 2016, we
recorded approximately $210 million in gross profit, reflecting the one-time upfront fee related to our alfalfa traits and
technology license to Forage Genetics International. We expect the remainder of the EBIT benefit, which is mostly
derived from the expected $145 million gain from the sorghum joint venture and plant sale, to be recorded in other
income in the fourth quarter.
Our Ag Productivity gross profit outlook is now trending towards the lower end of a range of $900 million to $1.1
billion. As earlier estimates had assumed, one of our smaller licensing and asset sales deal would benefit gross profit,
but was ultimately recorded in other income.
For the full year, we continue to expect to sell a higher ratio of branded Roundup volume as compared to the prior
fiscal year. However, we expect that full-year volumes will be below our roughly 300 million gallons of capacity, but
not to the point of generating material volume variances. From a price perspective, our competitive intelligence leads
us to believe that we are nearing the bottom for generic glyphosate pricing in the market, and we are not expecting
significant moves from this point forward.
We remain on track to deliver $165 million to $210 million in savings from our restructuring actions in fiscal year
2016, primarily benefiting operating expenses. These savings combined with spending discipline and currency benefits
contribute to our expectation that even after increased investments in new platforms, we expect to see operating spend
down slightly before estimated restructuring charges and environmental and litigation matters.
Assuming the Argentine peso exchange rate remains close to a ratio of $1.00 to ARS 14 at the close of the fiscal year,
we now expect other expense net to be relatively flat year over year, as the nearly $180 million impact from the
devaluation in Argentina is now being offset by gains on non-core asset sales of approximately $170 million.
Our tax rate is expected to increase to 32% to 34% for the full year, inclusive of Argentine-related tax matter. Looking
out to fiscal year 2017, we expect our tax rate to be more in the range of 25% to 27%, which is more aligned to recent
prior years. Finally, the net effect of the benefit from our share repurchases, including net financing expense, should
generate a net earnings per share benefit of $0.20 to $0.25, with 437 million shares outstanding at the close of our third
quarter.
Consistent with our updated earnings projections and based on the possible slight delay in the close of the sale of the
Precision Ag Equipment business to John Deere, we now adjusted our free cash flow guidance for the year to be in the
range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, as shown on slide seven.
At the peak of our working capital cycle and after the successful execution of the $3 billion accelerated stock share
repurchase in the second quarter, our net debt to ongoing EBITDA ratio sits at 2.6 times at the close of the third
quarter. We expect this to revert to a ratio in the range of 2.1 to 2.2 times at the end of the fiscal year, following strong
expected collections.
Looking ahead to fiscal year 2017 and assuming relatively stable foreign currencies, we expect to return to growth in
earnings per share, as shown on slide eight. As we shared at Q2, our expectation is that our long-term growth would not
be linear, with next year marking a slower pace as we recover and reset the trajectory with the early days of Roundup
Ready Xtend penetration. This expected growth is driven by the continued penetration of our soybean blockbusters, the
durability of our global corn platform, and an improved cost of goods outlook for both corn and soybeans.
From a year-over-year perspective, this growth is expected to be partially offset by a decline in glyphosate pricing,
particularly in the first half of the fiscal year 2017, by a lower level of non-core licensing deals and by a slight increase
in spend, with inflation and expected increases in commissions and incentives offsetting the benefits from our

restructuring plan.
We also expect a more normalized effective tax rate of 25% to 27% for the coming fiscal year. Once we get a better
line of sight on the closure of the Northern Hemisphere crop season and finalize our operational plans, we will provide
a more refined outlook for 2017.
Beyond fiscal year 2017, the opportunity significantly accelerates as the growth drivers of 2017 are expected to extend,
continuing to generate the best margins amongst our ag peers, with streamlined operations and portfolio advantages
driving our multi-layered growth into the next decade.
We continue to target a mid-teens compounded annual growth rate in earnings per share from fiscal year 2017, now
advancing to fiscal year 2021 from fiscal year 2019, as we move our long-range plan and march forward. Practically,
our estimated EPS for fiscal year 2019 has not changed significantly from our previous guidance. We are now simply
expanding the horizon.
In closing, our financial focus remains consistent: return on innovation, financial discipline, and balanced capital
allocation. These together with a sound and disciplined approach delivering on our integrity solutions strategy support
long-term growth and industry-leading ongoing EBITDA margins and return on capital, as shown on slide nine.
With that, I will pass it to Brett to work through the operational outlook. Brett?
Brett D. Begemann
Thanks, Pierre, and good morning to everyone on the line.
While there are factors contributing to a dynamic environment in ag today, our organization is focused on delivering
against the milestones that set a foundation for rapid growth, and importantly, with an optimized operating cost
structure. This focus is balanced across our broad portfolio and key growth drivers, as outlined on slide 10, whether it is
our Seed business, Crop Protection, or Climate, all of which I'll update you on today in our outlook for fiscal year 2017.
Let's begin with soybeans on slide 11. Our soybean innovation drivers are expected to continue record-setting adoption
rates toward their target opportunity, with both Intacta and Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans anticipated to make a
meaningful step up in penetration next year. Let's start with the 100 million acre insect protection opportunity in South
America, where we are on a good path to penetrate 75 million acres by fiscal year 2019.
After achieving an expected 35 million acres of Intacta Roundup Ready 2 PRO technology penetration across South
America this year, we now believe that Intacta will be planted on 45 million to 55 million acres in South America in
fiscal year 2017. A royalty collection system in Argentina that operates consistently and with integrity would move us
to the high end of that range.
Moving to Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans on slide 12, we now estimate that our introduction this year is just above
1 million acres across our brands and licensees. Despite the repeated delays on the EU import approval, which we
expect shortly, we know that farmers want the technology, and we're producing aggressively to be in a strong position
for the coming selling season.
To that end, our brands and licensees have plans in place to supply roughly 15 million acres of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend
soybeans in fiscal year 2017. In addition, we expect roughly $150 million of incremental cost and soybean share losses
related to the launch and subsequent delays in the EU import approval to decrease by two-thirds next year.
To enable the full benefits of the system, there is also good progress on the herbicide approvals as well. The EPA's
public comment period for the over-the-top use of dicamba herbicide closed late last month, and we're happy to share
that to date, of the more than 850 comments posted so far, more than 75% of those are comments from growers,
dealers, academics, and others in support of the new use. The EPA has indicated they expect to conclude the process
for approval of the label for in-crop use of dicamba formulations by late summer to early fall.

Our plans to enable a reliable supply of those dicamba formulations at our Luling, Louisiana facility continue. And in
the interim, we have supply agreements in place to meet the demand for what we envision will be the number two
molecule in crop protection behind glyphosate.
From a global corn perspective, as shown on slide 13, the factor that stands out is the durability of the portfolio in a
challenging environment. This is illustrated by the expectation that we held or grew our global genetic share. Although
our global germplasm price mix, excluding currency, is expected to be down slightly for this fiscal year, with
anticipated stable to improving corn acres and commodity prices, we expect to see global price mix lift move to the
positive in fiscal year 2017.
As we finalize our price cards, we'll share more. This lift is then expected to accelerate in later years due to
performance from breeding gains. We also expect improved cost of goods from more normalized seed production
plants leading to a significant reduction in the $90 million to $100 million of headwinds we experienced this year.
As we review by region, let's look first at the U.S. We expect planted acres to be in the range of 91 million to 92
million acres and we expect to grow our genetic share on that footprint, delivering the second-highest year of U.S. corn
sales volume in the history of the company. With new generations from our advanced breeding programs and the next
generations of corn insect control traits coming from SmartStax PRO and Trecepta toward the end of this plan, our U.S.
business looks promising.
In Europe, with an estimated eight points of share gain in the past eight years, we look forward to continuing to be the
fastest-growing corn seed brand in the region.
In Argentina, with an expected lift in commodity prices and reduction in export taxes, we believe that corn acres in the
country could increase greater than 20%. Given our historic share in Argentina corn, this bodes well for the season
ahead and beyond.
In Brazil, we also see the outlook improving. We expect that acres planted to corn will increase in the mid-single digits
and that the ramp-up of VT Triple PRO traded hybrids will continue again in 2017 as farmers trade up to better insect
control. I'm also pleased to share that for the upcoming summer season in Brazil, we expect double digit germplasm
price increases in local currency, coming on the back of 20%-plus price increases in Brazil for fiscal year 2016,
offsetting some of the currency downside.
Other notable developments occurred in our complementary crops, as outlined on slide 14. I'll begin with our U.S.
cotton business. The latest addition to that portfolio is Bollgard II XtendFlex cotton in its second year of launch. We
expect it to be on about 3 million acres in the U.S. this year or four times last year's acres. With strong farmer demand
for Bollgard II XtendFlex and our new cotton varieties, we expect to gain three or more brand share points this year or
six points in the last two years.
Our vegetable business is also experiencing positive momentum and operational excellence. We're managing supply
well, now boasting the lowest inventory in seven years while delivering nice GP growth, exclusive of currency.
In our Ag Productivity segment, we're maintaining our emphasis on cost discipline and portfolio optimization. As we
near the anticipated bottom of the generic pricing cycle here in the fourth quarter, we expect the pricing comparison for
the first half of next fiscal year to be a headwind; however, this should be partially moderated by some expected
volume recovery for the full year.
Let's transition to Climate, as shown on slide 15. Last month, we provided an update that highlighted how we were on
track for our targeted penetration of more than 12 million paid acres. That number is now expected to be more than 13
million paid acres for fiscal year 2016. Overall, we are seeing paid offerings up more than two-and-a-half times versus
prior year and now expect to continue that momentum into fiscal year 2017 with targeted penetration of 25 million
acres with paid services, nearly doubling this year's results.
It's clear that farmers are seeing the value the Climate FieldView platform provides, and that step-up to paid acres
builds from the total platform footprint for the technology, which is also ahead of target at more than 92 million acres.
More than 75% of those platform acres are with growers who are monthly active users of our digital tools.

In addition to strong product penetration results, recent farmer survey results indicate that growers now identify the
Climate FieldView platform as the number one Digital Ag brand in the industry. Global expansion of Climate
FieldView is also on track, with a prelaunch in Brazil this fall and a launch in Eastern Canada in the spring of 2017.
Climate has now forged partnerships across more than 10 retail, software, and equipment platforms, with these
relationships serving as yet another strategic differentiator. One of the significant agreements is with John Deere, and
we're on track to launch our in-cab connectivity offering with Deere's new wireless data server technology for the 2016
fall harvest.
In our other new technology platform led by our BioAg Alliance with Novozymes, we're testing microbes this year on
a scale that's unmatched in the industry. At the same time, we are preparing for the launch of our first Alliance
microbial seed treatment for corn, which demonstrated a greater than four-bushel average yield advantage in fiscal year
2015 field trials.
This upstream corn inoculant will be marketed under the Acceleron brand in the U.S. and as JumpStart XL in
remaining geographies. As this product expands to additional crops, it has the potential to penetrate approximately 100
million acres by 2025, making it one of the largest biological products in the ag industry.
Last but no less important is an update on our continued spend discipline, as outlined on slide 16. Our savings are on
track, and with lower estimated cost, we're looking to continue to drive efficiency through the business. We continue to
track towards the expected $500 million of savings from our restructuring and cost savings initiatives by fiscal year
2018, reaching an expected $375 million to $420 million by fiscal year 2017.
With that, I'll hand it to Hugh.
Hugh M. Grant
Thank you, Brett.
Our focus from here forward on the strategic outlook for our business. I mentioned at the outset that our view about
what's to come hasn't changed. Despite ongoing industry dynamics and recent challenges, there's one unwavering
constant, which is our commitment to an integrated solution strategy that brings seeds, traits, chemistry, and data
science tools to farmers around the world. We're uniquely pleased with our seed position and our Digital Ag Platform
with Climate. We believe that this strategy will create tremendous value for society, for farmers, and for our owners, as
outlined on slide 17, and the world's going to need it.
The long-term demand trends remain robust and are reinforced by the most recent WASDE report. It indicates that
year-over-year, global demand growth for soybeans and corn continues to be strong, with another 1 billion bushels of
corn needed for the year ahead. Beyond that, we see robust demand continuing for decades to come.
The need to help farmers meet that demand through sustainable intensification of agronomic solutions remains a global
priority. We continue to see innovation in agriculture as being the answer to satisfy these demand curves, as well as the
differentiator in unlocking incremental yield from existing acres. We are best positioned to answer that need. Our
leadership in this area is evidenced by the industry's most proven pipeline, one with up to $25 billion in expected peak
net sales in core platforms alone.
By better integrating these technological advances, this approach will allow farmers to maximize yield, minimize risk,
improve sustainability, and optimize their overall profit. It's about selecting the right seeds, traits, and weed, insect, and
disease control with accurate data insights so that farmers can manage their operations not just acre-by-acre, but
increasingly, row-by-row.
It's our unique innovation platform that underpins our own strong stand-alone growth plan as well as the industrial
logic for Bayer's proposal to acquire Monsanto, as shown on slide 18. It starts with our leading seed and trait platform
that reaches more than 400 million acres globally and strong or leading germplasm share in corn, soybeans, cotton, and

which that we'll continue to build as we integrate and hub for seeds, traits, and chemistries, and that's clearly
recognized by others in our industry.
To further expand the value of this innovation platform, our technology organization has moved forward with
unprecedented trials of mixed-generation technology in the lab and in the field. Overall, this is stacking up to be
another stellar year with projections of this being the fourth year in a row with more than 20 phase advancements.
You'll get a chance to see our next wave of innovation at Whistle Stop on August 17 and 18, so mark your calendars to
plan – to join us for this event.
To further enhance our unique position to deliver the integrated solution strategy, we're continually optimizing our
portfolio, as shown on slide 19. As a part of this optimization and further bolstering our position as the partner of
choice in innovation, we've recently entered in several distinct technology agreements, some contribute directly to the
bottom line in fiscal year 2016 and importantly, they all contribute to our long-term vision. So, let's take a quick look at
some of the most significant agreements.
We just announced that DuPont Pioneer is a new licensee of the Intacta trait stack, pending Brazil approvals, which is
yet another endorsement of the strength of this rapidly-penetrating technology. We exclusively licensed our alfalfa
traits and technologies to Forage Genetics International, and we're in the process of forming a strategic joint venture
with Remington Holding Company to more effectively manage our elite sorghum germplasm assets. Both transactions
unlock value and they create R&D focus while still generating new technologies for our grower customers in a
collaborative manner.
We also recently negotiated and signed several gene editing agreements that, coupled with our own internally
developed proprietary technologies, are expected to accelerate and enhance the drive to the next generation of seed and
trait solutions.
Finally, consistent with our collaborative approach to new chemistry solution development, as shown on slide 20, we
announced a new agreement with Sumitomo Chemical Company to establish future generation weed control trait stacks
in several crops. It features a new PPO chemistry paired with the related tolerance gene that not only overcomes weed
resistance issues but also controls problematic weeds. Importantly, this new herbicide and trait are being developed in
parallel allowing farmers to access the benefits of this technology earlier than the more traditional sequential
development approach.
We plan to announce other chemistry collaborations in the near future as we continue to evaluate additional
opportunities to drive returns on our innovation and align our portfolio to our integrated solutions vision.
Pierre touched on this earlier. And as I wrap up, I think it bears repeating. Our continued commitment to operate as the
most innovative company in the space with a foundation of disciplined spend and portfolio management will position
us well for the expected rebound in our industry.
Many in this industry have theorized of integrated strategies, but we believe we're the best positioned to make this
strategy a reality. With our truly unique asset position in traits, seeds, and Digital Ag, as well as our pace and our
breadth of proven innovation, we expect to continue elite and define integrated solutions for agriculture while
continuing to deliver industry-leading ongoing EBITDA margins and return on capital across our peer set, along with
strong cash flow to fuel future growth as shown on slide 21. Quite simply, this is what makes partnering with Monsanto
today such an attractive unique proposition.
So with that, Laura, let's move to the Q&A section.

Laura J. Meyer
Thank you. With that, we'd now like to open the call for questions. Dr. Robb Fraley, our Chief Technology Officer, has
also joined us for today's Q&A. As we typically do, I'll ask that you please hold your questions to one per person so
that we can take questions from as many people as possible. You're always welcome to rejoin the queue for a
follow-up.
Christine, I think we're ready to take questions from the line.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna. Please
proceed with your question.
<Q - Don Carson>: Thank you. Hugh, a question on your outlook for 2017. Last quarter, you talked about a return to
rapid g growth in 2017. You talked of an earnings snapback. Now you seem to be downplaying that a bit. I'm just
wondering what is it that's changed in your outlook because both currency and grain price headwinds seem to be
turning in your favor.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Don, thanks for the question. I'll maybe ask Pierre to categorize or put it in a few buckets, but
we're taking a little bit of cautious approach until we see how the year plays out. But, Pierre, maybe if you look at the
dissolution of some of these headwinds and then some of the plus points that are emerging?
<A - Pierre C. Courduroux>: And actually answering into 2017, we indeed believe we have momentum, and this
momentum will carry out into 2018 and 2019, and we will enjoy a couple of tailwinds definitely. So Intacta's rates on
44 million to 55 million acres, as Brett mentioned, this is our assumptions today and the demand in the markets is still
very strong. So we see this one as a key driver for growth.
We also anticipate Xtend on 50 million acres next year, so that's also something that will carry us into 2017 with
momentum. And we also anticipate that some of the headwinds we have this year, we said two-thirds of the headwinds
we've been seeing this year related to the launch of Xtend will disappear. So it's about $100 million of benefits we're
anticipating next year. We also mentioned cost of goods momentum in both corn and soy, and they're again around
$100 million there., and the return to positive pricing in corn. On top of that, obviously there's the – our assumption is
right now we're not going to be seeing a devaluation in Argentina comparable to what we've seen this year.
So these are, Don, all the positive elements that we see as building momentum entering into 2017. However, we have to
balance those. We have a couple of other things we are actually watching at this point in time. What we expect is that
we will have a tough comparison in glyphosates, mostly in the first part of the year. Our expectation is that glyphosate
pricing is going to stay pretty much where it is right now. And if you look at the first half of fiscal year 2016, we
enjoyed pricing way higher than where they are today. So we anticipate this one to be a tough comp for us entering into
2017.
The other elements that we highlighted today is that from a deals perspective, so this year, we have the benefit of $370
million in deals, we are not anticipating at this point in time based on the portfolio of opportunities we have in front of
us that the deals are going to be of that magnitude next year. And we'll give a little more clarity on that when we have
our operation plans in place.
Tax rate will also be a little more challenging next year based on what we are looking at right now. And we also have
to balance the benefit of our restructuring actions with inflationary increase, increased commissions based on the
success of our Channel model in the U.S. and obviously South America, and also incentives. So if you add to that the
impact of India on our cotton business, these are the things we want to clarify, and that's why, as you mentioned, we
wanted to be cautious entering into 2017 although, as you mentioned, we also see a lot of tailwinds there.

<Q - Don Carson>: So if you put that all together, what would that translate into, high single-digit earnings growth, or
do you think you can get to double-digit earnings growth?
<A - Pierre C. Courduroux>: So, Don, at this point in time, we don't want to give an absolute number at this point in
time. And what we mentioned in our prepared remark is we'll come back to you as soon as our operational plans are in
place.

Our next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Yes, hi. Good morning.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Good morning.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: If you look at your grower customers, in the downturn, they seemed unwilling to pay for the
premium seed or innovation. They seem to have traded down in seed technology this year. So do you think that they're
willing to pay up for premium – or the premium pricing only in the upturn and maybe they trade down in the
downturn?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: P.J., thanks for your question. I'll maybe ask Brett to say a few words. I think our observation
over the last 15 years has been growers need innovation in good years and bad, and the seed that we sell out of first is
our best performing. The quantum in that premium changes over those years, but the compromise on reaching for
mediocre or average seed doesn't – that doesn't play out. But, Brett, maybe a few words on the refresh on our portfolio
and how we see that in 2017.
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: I think – P.J., good morning. If you think about our highest premium product that we sell
across the U.S., it's our SmartStax products. And as we look at this year, SmartStax is going to make up a similar
percentage to our overall business as it did last year. So I do not see farmers trading down.
We have farmers on the fringes of rootworm areas that may trade down, but it's not material. We had to make some
adjustments in our pricing ladder that we talked about last year to adjust for the significant pullback in the commodity
price, which now we're seeing rebound a little bit, and we had to address some of the competitive issues in the
marketplace, which we did, I would argue, very effectively. And that's why I'm confident today to say that I actually
think for genetic share we're up, and for brand share we held our own in the marketplace. So I feel really good about
how we ended up in the U.S. corn business.
And when I look to South America, boy, farmers are not slowing down, down there at all. We took significant price
increases in corn last year in Brazil; we're doing it again this year. Now granted, it's a currency offset and it's not
offsetting all of it, but farmers are quickly moving to our new Triple PRO in Brazil to get better bug control.
So I think even in these challenging times, farmers look for the best seed and the best traits to drive productivity on
their farm and they need it more than ever, and I think we see that this year. It's really disappointing that we ended up
with the ongoing delays with the EU, but I have to tell you, farmers were lined up to buy the Xtend technology this
year, and I'm really optimistic about that one next year. So tough conditions do not slow down farmers' appetite as
you've said, they're looking for ways to drive productivity and profitability.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Thank you, Brett. And you mentioned earlier I think $150 million of headwind due to delays in
Xtend.
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yes.

<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Is that what mainly contributed to third quarter weakness in soy, or was there something else?
Thank you.
<A - Pierre C. Courduroux>: P.J., this is Pierre. It definitely was a big part of the third quarter impact from soybeans.
There were a couple of other elements, and the key one is an element of timing. If you remember last year when we
entered into the fourth quarter, so at the end of the third quarter, everybody in the market was looking at the soybeans
market. The expectations were 85 million acres, and the market ended up being 83 million. So you saw a lot of returns
in the third quarter.
Right now, people are looking at a market more in the range of 82 million. So this is – also this element of timing, the
huge return that happened last year and – at the end of the fourth quarter, that's also driving some of the comps when
you're looking at the Q3. But definitely, the delayed in Xtend from a cost perspective but also from a share perspective
has been the big impact in our third quarter.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Thank you, good morning.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Good morning, David.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Hugh, how are you and the board looking at the – or balancing the strong rationale for
integrated solutions in ag, seeds, and chemicals versus potentially selling the company at the bottom of the ag cycle?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Thanks. David, thanks for the question and as I'm sure you understand, there's a limit to what I
can talk about because these have been private conversations, but let me try and give you a little bit the landscape to the
last piece of your point. I think it is complex because we're at the low point of the ag cycle. And I think the tone in
some of the comments today, we see some of the early signs of this cycle beginning to turn. As we look at the Bayer
proposal and as we examine some of the other strategic alternatives that have emerged, I'm personally engaged in those
discussions along with the board, the support of the board, and their advisors.
And I would say this gets down to two things: it gets down to value and it gets down to certainty. So we're convinced –
the longer this runs, we're convinced in the value of that integrated strategy. We've spent a bit of time talking about it
today. We're convinced that we have a unique position as an integrator because of our seed – our unique position in
seed and the emerging strength of our data science position. So in two short years, I think you've seen Climate
transition from theory to reality, and I think in the next two years, that becomes even more important.
So as we look at the trough, as we look at the Bayer proposal and some of these other strategic alternatives, we're
focused – my team and I, we're focused very, very clearly on creation of shareowner value, and that's where this begins
and it's where it ends. So we're going to take a very rational approach to this, bearing in mind where the cycle is and the
need for value creation, and we're going to really focus on the uniqueness of Monsanto and its part as a key integrator.
So I don't know if that answers your question, but it's probably the scope of what I can discuss on a call.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: No, that's very helpful, Hugh. And just on the same subject, Digital Ag, can you discuss
maybe further the challenge of getting paid for this platform at its very early nascent stages of development from other
parties?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: So real briefly, our strategy isn't where it started, but in the early days of working with the
Climate team in San Francisco, they were very adamant and they were right that this is about driving grower
experience, and in the early days it's about delighting growers and sharing data insights with them.

So as Brett talked about, 95 million acres up on the platform, the first round of this for us, David, was gaining
experience in the same way that all apps are developed, so gaining experience and letting growers work with us on their
farms and their fields. The Nitrogen Advisor has been additional functionality, and we have priced for that.
And in the last two short years, we've got all of U.S. retail distribution up on the platform. We are in – we're either in
discussion or concluded with all the machinery manufacturers and I think the next natural step in this is to see some of
our competitors' companies and some alternative offerings up on that platform as well, so the grower experience – he
doesn't need multiple iPads in the cab. And I think as we move through this progression, then pricing to value and
retaining a piece of that value in the same way that we've done with traits becomes a natural next step. And that's – I
think the experience of 15 years of trait development blends beautifully into the next handful of years on data science
development and how we broadly license this platform with others.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Thank you very much, Hugh.

Our next question comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Christopher Evans>: Hey, good morning, guys. This is Chris Evans on for Bob. I was hoping you...
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Hey, Bob (sic) [Chris], you're breaking up. Can you get a little bit closer to the phone?
<Q - Christopher Evans>: I apologize.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: There you go. Thank you.
<Q - Christopher Evans>: I hope that's better.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Perfect.
<Q - Christopher Evans>: I was hoping you could expand a little bit on the eleventh hour sort of reprieve of
glyphosate in Europe, sort of what's the long-term expectation for use of glyphosate in that area? And then if you could
also sort of staying on that topic, talk a little bit about the pricing declines that seemed to have outpaced your
expectations, what's going to – what's the support for pricing?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Bob, thanks for the two elements. Maybe I'll let Robb and Brett talk about this. I'd just say
before he does that there's been an element of frustration in this with some of the bureaucracy in the EU. So it's beyond
the eleventh hour, but it's really good to see this finally come through. And we'd expected that it would, but it's nice to
see the reality I think actually occurred during the call this morning. So, Robb, maybe a few words on this?
<A - Robert T. Fraley, PhD>: I think you captured it right. It's been a very painful process, particularly when you
consider that the EU has just completed the re-review of glyphosate and gave it a very strong safety record, and that
review was largely led by the German regulators. They took four years, did an incredibly detailed review and analysis,
and concluded that the product is absolutely safe and has no indication of carcinogenicity. So what we've seen play out,
unfortunately, over the last six months has been the challenge of operating in the EU system between the
parliamentarian votes and the commission's final decision.
And effectively, we watched the two teams play volleyball for six months. And today, it was great to see that the
commission moved forward on a science-based decision to extend the product. So we're – as Hugh said, the delay has
been tough. We're delighted to have the approval and the extension and – moving forward. And we think that, that –
frankly, this has been a part of the logjam that has delayed our over-the-top Xtend approval, and we're – I think that the
real good news from today's announcement is, I think, it accelerates the timing on the approval for the over-the-top
application of Xtend.

<A - Hugh M. Grant>: And then, Brett, a word to Bob's (sic) [Chris's] question on pricing?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: As we think about the pricing, Bob (sic) [Chris], it's always risky to try to call the bottom
on any of these things. But I do believe that we've kind of reached that bottom range of glyphosate pricing. And it's
bouncing around there the last few months. And I really don't see anything in the near term that's going to shift that and
move it in a different direction. So it's purely looking at where we were priced last year in the first half of the year
versus where we're priced right now. And seeing that, that creates a bit of a headwind for us going into next year that
we'll have to manage against.
I feel good about our position, though, and our cost position, and how we're competing in that industry. We're down a
little bit on volumes this year, but I think that we're going to recover those back next year, as we see the momentum
building across the marketplace. So we're in a good place. It's just going to be the challenging first half with the price
differential between 2016 and 2017.
<Q - Christopher Evans>: Got it. Thanks, guys.

Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Christopher S. Parkinson>: Perfect, thank you. If farmer credits have been a bit of an issue in Brazil and has
also been an impediment in other emerging markets, Eastern Europe, India, and at least previously Argentina, when
you look at your longer-term outlook, how do you think about this in relation to your strategy? How could it affect your
growth aspirations? And are there any things we should think about on how you plan on working with growers,
distributors, co-ops, et cetera? Just any color on that would be appreciated.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Brett?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Thanks for the question. I think, as you go around the world, every farmer finds
themselves in a different position as do we. If you think about Argentina, for example, we use a significant barter for
our business down there. So a big chunk of our sales are through the barter system, which minimizes our credit risk
with the Argentine farmer. They basically use the grain to buy their inputs.
In the case of Brazil, keep in mind with how currency has impacted our business negatively, it helps put the Brazilian
farmer in a pretty good position right now. Buying in local currency and selling in U.S. dollars is not a bad place for
them, so we feel reasonably okay. I mean, with all the disruption that's occurred in Brazil in the last year, I'm actually
optimistic about Brazil right now. With the position of the farmer and their ability to access credit and byproducts,
farming looks good. And we've got Intacta, and we've got a strong corn business that's growing, and we've priced up in
that environment, and it seems to be holding. So we look good in South America.
When you get to Eastern Europe, it's mixed deck over there. As you – in the Far East, there are some real challenges,
call them geopolitical challenges with the Ukraine. We tended to manage our credit very aggressively. In other words,
we don't extend a lot of credit, and we seem to be doing quite okay over there. That has impacted some of the pricing.
Some of the farmers have gone to lower-priced seed, which has impacted our global pricing. But overall, we're in a
good place, and we continue to be conservative on how we manage the credit.
<Q - Christopher S. Parkinson>: Perfect. And just very quickly, on your efforts with Channel in the U.S. over the last
couple years, I imagine the number of seeds has grown fairly significantly. But can you just comment on this issue
quickly, in the long term, on both terms of the go-to-market strategy, how it's working, as well as how growers are
feeling about the brand's technology advancement over the last few years? Thank you.
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: I think the way we look at it is we like to sell seed the way farmers like to buy seed. And
there are clearly farmers that want to buy seed, do a direct relationship that we set up with Channel. There are farmers

that clearly want to buy through retail, which is predominantly our DEKALB/Asgrow brands. So that's the approach,
selling seed the way farmers want to buy it.
The Channel brand has really done well in the last couple of years. We've made some substantial improvements,
moving it to an agency, which created some confusion in our results for a couple of years, as we made that transition,
but it's going really well. And I have to tell you, some of the other companies out there that are struggling with the
performance of their products, the Channel brand is a really interesting one for them to consider to become Seedsmen
for, because they get access to the phenomenal pipeline of genetics and traits from Monsanto and they get to handle a
brand that they sell directly to farmers, which in many cases, they've been used to, and that's the model they came out
of. So we feel really good about the multi-brand strategy and how it's playing out.
<Q - Christopher S. Parkinson>: That's perfect. Thank you.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Thank you very much.

Our next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Stephen Byrne>: Yes, thanks. Let's just continue down that path a little bit on the Channel comment. Brett, you
made a comment earlier about your corn genetics share improving this year. Within that, was there a mix shift, say,
away from your premium brands either to the Channel brands or to your licensees, and what is the impact of any of that
mix shift on price?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: So it's really early to be that specific between the brands. I'm very comfortable saying I
believe that we grew our genetic footprint this year. And yes, there's some strength in some of the licensing business
that participates in that.
On the brand side, let me be really clear. The Channel brand is not an inferior brand to DEKALB. The Channel brand is
positioned right along with DEKALB, and they both are superior brands and targeting to the higher end of performance
in the marketplace. And there's always shifting between the premium brands in the marketplace. That occurs every
year, but I'm comfortable today saying that our direct brand share, we expect it to be flat this year. We're maintaining
our position. So I think when it all settles out in a few months, then we'll have the details around that, but I feel good
with where we're at.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Steve, the only thing I'd add is the good news is we have created genuine optionality. And you
see, it's the best point on your growers buy how and where they want. They get the opportunity – the license fee route,
the opportunity at Channel or a national brand. And we've seen nice migration from some of our competitors because
of that. And that's why that genetic footprint was stretched.
<Q - Stephen Byrne>: And the source of your conviction about improvement in corn and seed pricing next year, is
that driven by mix shift, would you say, or more due to – a price lift due to underlying commodity price gain?
<A - Pierre C. Courduroux>: So what we are expecting is actually to see a normalized market where the elements of
the mix shift are going to be driving our portfolio. And as every year, when we issue our price cards, we readjust our
price cards based on the commodity price, based on the performance of the hybrids. But definitely, the key driver is
going to be the mix lift that we are anticipating based on the introduction of our new hybrids.
<Q - Stephen Byrne>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Thank you very much.

Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - John Roberts>: Good morning. Can you hear me?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Good morning, John. Yes, we can hear you loud and clear.
<Q - John Roberts>: I think the EU announced today that they've opened an antitrust review of the Bayer
combination. I think that's highly unusual given you don't actually have a deal yet. And I think they normally have a
first-to-file process, but I think they've indicated that they would consider any additional deals possibly holistically in
combination with the prior two deals that have been filed. How do we think about the regulatory regime or the approval
regime? Is this a one-off environment, or can we rely on past rules and how things have happened in the past?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: So I think this must have happened while we were on the call, John. I think it's more their
declaration of intent rather than they have, so it's more they intend to do it than they will. My experience with these
reviews the last 15 years is they've been pretty logical and pretty straightforward in Europe. But I did talk earlier, a
previous question about value uncertainty from a shareowner point of view and from a value creation point of view,
that's obviously something that we would treat seriously in any discussion. So I can't really say more than that about it,
but I think the European declaration was one of intent rather than starting.
<Q - John Roberts>: Okay. And then given the uncertainty around Roundup in Europe that we've had recently, do you
think there was channel destocking? I assume it would have affected generics more than you, but I don't know if you
were possibly affected by the supply channel just not wanting to hold as much Roundup inventory during this period of
uncertainty.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: No, we haven't seen that. I don't know what the generic impact has been, but we haven't seen it
with our own brands. The certainty of today definitely helps, but the reality is weeds grow in the spring, and you need
to have the material there on hand to control them. So no, we haven't seen any shift in flow, John.
<Q - John Roberts>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Thanks for the questions.
<A - Laura J. Meyer>: And, Christine, we'll take questions from one more, and then we'll pass it to Hugh to close it.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Very good.
Operator
Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Jeffrey J. Zekauskas>: Thanks very much. Hugh, I have a question about value creation at Monsanto. When you
consider offers from other parties, and I know you're limited in what you can say, do you think about the value of the
offer relative to where Monsanto might trade in three years or five years in this depressed agricultural environment? Or
do you have some – or you and the board have some idea of the intrinsic value of the company that encompasses more
favorable agricultural economic climates? How do you go...
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Hi, Jeff.
<Q - Jeffrey J. Zekauskas>: Yes, please.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Thank you. I'm sorry I interrupted. Thanks for your question. And this will be the last
question. And as I indicated earlier, these are private conversations, so it's difficult to comment substantively.
<Q - Jeffrey J. Zekauskas>: Sure.

<A - Hugh M. Grant>: But we're an agricultural business. We develop technologies on a 10-year horizon. We've been
in existence for about 15 years. So you can't – we've done many of these calls together over the years. You can't look at
the down cycle in an ag economy. Farmers would never farm if they thought about the peaks and troughs. So you have
to see through that when you're either buying a farm or if you're developing technologies.
So I guess the headline in this is if you're valuing a unique company like Monsanto, I would argue you can't look at one
quarter, you can't look at a year. You need to take a 10 or a 20-year view. And that's how we develop technologies. And
when you look at the promise of Climate, or you look at the value of the pipeline that Rob Fraley and his team have
developed, I think you have to take that long view.
We've been very clear since May that we were open to these discussions, but that the value had to be reflected for the
company and the proposition that we have. And the Bayer proposal was financially inadequate. We are looking at that
proposal relative to other strategic alternatives. But you have to take the long view in this, because the vagaries of
commodity markets are either punishing or they're – they develop elation, but you have to kind of take a line through
that. And that's how we've always built our resource models. That's how we've always built these products on a 7-year
and a 10-year development cycle. And that's how we will look this.
I guess I would finish by saying we are absolutely committed to optimizing shareowner value. And we will look at the
proposal in hand, and we will evaluate these other strategic alternatives against that benchmark. That's what we need to
do.
<Q - Jeffrey J. Zekauskas>: Thank you so much. That's very clear.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Thank you for your question.
Hugh M. Grant
And with that, I want to thank you for your patience, because we're a little bit tardy in our finish today. Let me just
make two points or three points at the risk of repetition. And it kind of ties to Jeff's last point on the call. 2016 has been
a challenging year for our industry, it's been a challenging year for the company, but our core businesses have done
well, but have suffered from some regulatory delays that we're beginning to see. Literally, on the call today, we're
beginning to see turn.
Despite this, innovation in this industry is needed, and it's recognized by growers. And I think, today, we're uniquely
placed as a key player in any integrated platform strategy. So regardless of how that integration strategy plays out, we
have a central role in that. So as I mentioned in the last question, I'm personally committed to the optimization of
shareholder value.
So we're really pleased that you joined us this morning. We are moving forward with preparation for Whistle Stop, and
we hope to see you there on August 17 and August 18. And if I was you, I'd be booking a slot soon, because those are
hot tickets, and they're selling fast.
So with that, thanks very much for the call today and for your continued support.
