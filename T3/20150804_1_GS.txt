Harvey and Liz will be happy to take your questions. Harvey?
Harvey M. Schwartz
Thanks, Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in. Starting on slide four, we want to begin with a quick update of our
year-to-date 2015 financial performance. On the left, we summarize our net revenue composition. As you can see, we
have a diversified portfolio of leading businesses. And in the first half of this year, no single revenue component
contributed more than 25% of total net revenues.
If you look at our first half results, excluding the $1.45 billion litigation charge in the second quarter of 2015, you can
see the embedded operating leverage, with expenses flat relative to revenues that are up 7% compared to last year. You
can also see the improvement in several underlying performance metrics. These include a 440 basis point improvement
in pre-tax margin, a 27% increase to net earnings, and a 220 basis point improvement in ROE to 13.1%. These results
show the strength of our client franchise and our commitment to drive strong financial performance.
Before I turn it over to Liz, I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing some of our key credit positives. On slide six, we
summarize the transformation of our balance sheet that we have successfully executed over the past several years. This
includes significant balance sheet reductions, a near doubling of our common equity base, a large increase in our
liquidity resources, and material reductions in leverage and Level 3 assets.
Underpinning these improvements is a comprehensive framework of regulations that require us to maintain strong
liquidity and capital levels. These include regulatory capital requirements, CCAR stress capital requirements, and
liquidity and funding stability requirements, which collectively provide long-term protection for creditors.
Our credit profile is also strengthened by our recovery in resolution planning efforts, where we have invested a
significant amount of energy. It goes without saying that our collective organization works tirelessly so that the firm
will never need to go through a recovery or resolution scenario. Nevertheless, we believe the process of preparing for
such an unlikely event is a valuable exercise. We agree with the goal of ending Too Big to Fail, and embrace the
planning process at Goldman Sachs as another component of our risk management and contingency planning.
With that as a backdrop, let's quickly highlight several important considerations of our resolution plan on slide seven.
First, we have a relatively simple business model and structure. We are not the biggest firm. We have also adapted over
the past several years. This includes exiting our insurance and mortgage servicing businesses.
Second, we continue to have a highly liquid balance sheet, and substantively, our plan reflects that benefit. 97% of our
balance sheet is held at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. This provides enhanced transparency and
increased financial flexibility.
Third, we have taken a number of steps to further reduce systemic risk. The majority of our derivatives are now cleared
or exchange traded, and we are actively participating in the industry's new ISDA [International Swaps and Derivatives
Association] protocol.
My fourth point relates to the strength of our balance sheet, including our abundance of liquidity and capital. We also
have significant TLAC resources, which we estimate to be in excess of 30% of risk-weighted assets.
In short, our credit profile has never been stronger. This is a function of our successful balance sheet transformation.
Importantly, these improvements are further supported by the existing regulatory framework. The end result is a
significantly improved position for creditors.
I'll now turn it over to Liz, who will provide an update on our balance sheet, funding, liquidity, and capital. Liz?

Thanks, Harvey. On slide nine we review our balance sheet trends over the past two years through June 30. As we have
discussed previously, last year in response to the requirements from CCAR and the supplementary leverage ratio, we
reduced the balance sheet by approximately $55 billion, primarily in secured client financing assets. This action helped
position the firm to meet future regulatory requirements without having a material impact on our franchise. The size of
our overall balance sheet has remained relatively flat year to date, with total assets up slightly to $860 billion.
Looking at some of the notable year-to-date balance sheet trends, we continued to grow our lending to our corporate
and private wealth management clients. At the end of the second quarter, our total direct loans in investing and lending
equaled $56 billion, up $9 billion since year end. And total investing and lending assets represent 10% of our balance
sheet, as shown on the right side of the slide.
Turning to our client market making franchise, Institutional Client Services assets declined 5% year to date, primarily
reflecting lower financial inventories and current levels of client demand. Secured Client Financing assets remained
relatively flat following the adjustments made last year. Combined, these two client segments represent approximately
two-thirds of our balance sheet.
Lastly, we continue to hold significant levels of liquidity, which I'll discuss in more detail later. Year to date, our global
core liquid assets are up by approximately $7 billion on an end-of-period basis. And as you can see in the graph on the
right side of the page, 23% of our balance sheet remains in GCLA and cash. Looking forward, the size and composition
of our current balance sheet reflects market conditions, client activity levels, and our current assessment of various
regulations
On slide 10, let's quickly review our primary sources of funding for our balance sheet. As we have discussed in the
past, we take a very conservative approach to funding the balance sheet. We emphasize counterparty diversity and
ensure that the term of our funding is significantly in excess of what our highly liquid balance sheet requires. With
approximately 40% of the balance sheet funded by shareholders equity, long-term debt, and deposits, we have a strong
funding profile. The size and mix of our balance sheet are driven by the demand from our client franchise, our
regulatory requirements, and our internal return discipline. This is managed through a strong and centralized process.
Our funding plan is managed as part of that same process, so we are appropriately resourced for the activities we
undertake. Our funding principles are straightforward. We believe in long-term funding, evenly spaced maturities, and
significant counterparty diversity.
Turning to slide 11, we show a breakdown of our long-term unsecured funding activity. We were an active and
opportunistic issuer year to date, with roughly $21 billion of claims and long-term issuances targeted across various
parts of our capital structure. This included approximately $17 billion of senior unsecured debt raised across a broad
range of tenors and channels, $2 billion of subordinated debt, and $2 billion in non-cumulative perpetual preferred.
Given our long-term debt and capital profile, we are also well positioned for the upcoming total loss absorbing capacity
rules, as Harvey mentioned a few moments ago.
Our funding strategy continues to focus on diversification. Year to date, non-U.S. dollar funding has been 31% of our
issuance. To create more evenly spaced maturities, we have occasionally executed transactions with non-round tenors,
including a four-year four-month and a 5.5-year USD issuance this year totaling $900 million. The result is prudently
spaced maturities, with approximately $20 billion of vanilla debt coming due annually through 2018, as seen on the
bottom of the slide.
Additionally, the term of our funding profile remains a significant focus. Our 2015 year-to-date issuance had a
weighted average initial maturity of approximately 10 years. This compares to a roughly nine-year weighted average
maturity of our overall unsecured long-term debt portfolio. As we have discussed in the past, over the last several years
we have roughly matched our maturities with new issuance, but last year we exceeded our maturities. Given solid
investor demand, our issuance year to date has already slightly exceeded 2015 scheduled maturities. We expect to
continue to be active yet opportunistic in our funding strategy over the next several quarters.
With respect to preferred and subordinated debt, future issuance will depend on a variety of factors, including the
evolution of regulatory requirements and the ability to deploy marginal balance sheet at appropriate returns. We'll

spend a bit more time discussing this topic when we review our capital position in a few minutes.
Let's move on to slide 12. On the top left of the slide, we show the decline in our secured funding liabilities, which are
down by more than 40% since 2013. Over the same period, our balance sheet has decreased by about 6%. This
reduction primarily reflects the balance sheet changes mentioned earlier related to our matched book assets, which
drove a corresponding reduction in client-related secured funding liabilities. Today, secured funding liabilities
represent just 14% of our total balance sheet.
At the bottom of the slide, we review our secured funding book, excluding the funding for GCLA-eligible collateral.
We remain focused on sourcing funding with longer-term contractual maturities, which provides the greatest stability to
the book. As of June 30, the all-in weighted average maturity of our book exceeds 120 days.
We also diversify our counterparties, which provides stability across both individual counterparties and counterparty
types. As of the second quarter, we sourced secured funding for non-GCLA-eligible collateral from more than 80
counterparties across many geographies. In order to achieve this diversification, we have remained flexible in terms of
delivery mechanism, sourcing capacity away from the traditional repo product, and have increased our sourcing efforts
in the form of secured notes and secured loans.
Now let's review our sources of deposit funding on slide 13. As you can see on the bottom right, our $89 billion of
deposits have grown to become a meaningful contributor, representing 12% of our total liabilities. Deposit balances are
up by 26% since 2013 and up more than threefold since the end of 2008. A central component of our stable deposit
base is our time deposits, comprised of $32 billion in broker CDs with a weighted average maturity of approximately
three years. Additionally, since 2013 we have also seen solid growth in our deposits from our private banking clients.
These deposits totaled $36 billion at the end of the second quarter.
Another key source of our deposit base comes from deposit sweep accounts. These deposits come from several third
parties and have important characteristics that help make them more durable. One, we have long-term contractual
relationships providing access to the deposits. And two, our contract terms give priority to Goldman Sachs. Separately,
we also remain focused on growing our international deposits, which reached over $15 billion at the end of the second
quarter.
Moving along, let's next turn to our capital base on slide 14. On the left-hand side, you can see our main capital ratios
as of June 30. We remain very well positioned for all of the minimum requirements. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio is
currently 11.8%, which compares to a fully phased-in minimum requirement of 10%. This includes the estimated GSIB
surcharge from the Federal Reserve's recently finalized rule. Our Tier 1 capital ratio is 13.5%, which compares to a
fully phased-in requirement of 11.5%. And our total capital ratio of 15.9% compares to a fully phased-in requirement
of 13.5%.
In addition, we are well positioned for the supplementary leverage ratio. As of the second quarter of 2015, our
supplementary leverage ratio was 5.7%, well ahead of the 5% holding company 2018 minimums, and 6.8% at GS
Bank, also ahead of the 6% bank requirement.
On the next slide, we show our total, including preferred stock and subordinated debt, in a bit more detail. Today our
Tier 1 and total capital ratios exceed our required stock minimums. Currently, we have $11.2 billion of preferred stock,
representing approximately 1.8% of risk-weighted assets, which serves as a solid foundation of perpetual capital and
funding for our balance sheet.
We also have $13.2 billion of subordinated debt which qualifies as capital, representing 2.2% of risk-weighted assets.
Given the capital treatment stepdown for subordinated debt approaching maturity, we also provide the impact from the
passage of time on our subordinated debt over the next five years. As you can see on the graph on the left, we have a
relatively modest $2.5 billion of debt impacted by the stepdown provisions over the period. And on the right, you can
see how the majority of our subordinated debt has significant remaining terms, with more than 60% having tenors in
excess of 20 years.

Following this year's CCAR results, we feel good about the actions we have taken to date. Going forward, we expect
future issuances of preferred stock and subordinated debt will continue to be opportunistic.
Turning to slide 16, we held $181 billion of global core liquid assets on average in the second quarter. GCLA is just a
bit higher than levels seen over the past year and represents a significant portion of our balance sheet. Our liquidity
pool continues to remain high quality, with approximately 75% made up of U.S. government bonds, overnight cash
deposits primarily held at the Federal Reserve, and U.S. federal agency obligations. The remaining 25% represents cash
and high-quality government bonds from Germany, France, Japan, and the UK. Additionally, based on our best
estimates, we continue to remain in compliance with the fully phased-in liquidity coverage ratio minimum.
In conclusion, we have a conservative balance sheet position with high levels of capital and liquidity. We also have a
significant term embedded across all of our funding sources and broad diversification across instruments, geography,
and counterparties, and we remain confident this conservative position will serve as a solid foundation to support our
client franchise as we go forward.
With that, Harvey and I are happy to take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, we will now take a moment to compile the Q&A roster. [Operator Instructions] Your first
question is from the line of Robert Smalley with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Robert Louis Smalley>: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for doing the call.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Good morning, or good afternoon.
<Q - Robert Louis Smalley>: A couple of questions. First, if we could start off on capital on slide 14, capital ratios are
very strong, including the additional Fed G-SIB charge. Could you talk about what you see as – or if you use a
management buffer, or what's your ideal level of capital? How far above the minimums do you want to keep capital
ratios, and what metrics do you use to get there?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So we're still obviously analyzing the extent to which we want to modify our buffer. As
we communicated in the past, we would run with a 1% buffer above the minimum. And we had looked at whether or
not we would reduce that buffer, but I will tell you that's still a work in process. Now we get there in a way that you
would think we would in terms of our capital planning process, which is continually evaluating the businesses, the
business mix, the demand on the balance sheet and how we would think about stress scenarios, and really making sure
that not only obviously at the minimum that we're ensuring that the firm is protected, but really making sure that we're
positioned in a way that provides us with the flexibility to commit capital to our clients. Now away from that of course,
as has been in the recent past for us and a number of firms, CCAR has been the constraining binding constraint, right?
<Q - Robert Louis Smalley>: Right, so.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: That may be the case going forward.
<Q - Robert Louis Smalley>: And if in fact that's the case and it appears that you have to keep excess or trapped or
stranded capital, would that necessarily lead you to putting it into some more capital-intensive businesses? I know in
the past you've cited the equity I&L business as one that's more capital-intensive. So if we do see this need for more
capital, is that where we can expect that it's going to be deployed?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So again, we think of capital in two ways. We think of it from an offensive perspective in
terms of how we drive our franchise businesses, and obviously we think about it from a defensive position. I think this
notion of trapped capital is a very, very important one from both a risk management perspective, but in terms of a
philosophy of how one has to think about capital because the most important thing is to be disciplined about its

deployment. We're not going to feel pressured to deploy capital because we feel like we're in an excess capital position.
Quite the contrary, we would look to either return that capital or be patient with its deployment. But feeling pressure to
deploy that capital is not a path we would go down.
<Q - Robert Louis Smalley>: Okay, and just two other quick ones. On TLAC, in your calculations, are you including
structured notes at all because there has been a lot of discussion about some component of structured notes coming in
there?
<A - Elizabeth Beshel Robinson>: Sure. In the 30%, greater than 30% estimate that we've provided, we do not include
structured notes.
<Q - Robert Louis Smalley>: Okay, that's helpful. And then finally, laying out the unsecured funding and maturities, I
know on a calendar basis you tend to front-load your issuance in the first quarter. Is that something you're going to
continue to do as well? I know you'll say that you'll look opportunistically, but the year starts and everyone expects a
fair amount of issuance from Goldman. So is there any plan to change that?
<A - Elizabeth Beshel Robinson>: Sure, that's a good question. So let me just take a step back to some of the
principles that underlie our funding and liquidity because I think they're very important in thinking about how we
execute. So first, as you know, we hold a material pool of excess liquidity both for defensive and offensive purposes.
We strive to have good asset/liability management, pulling together both sides of our balance sheet. And again, we look
for a very conservative funding book, long tenor, well spread maturities, to your point, as well as good counterparty
diversification. And within those principles, as you know, we strive to be opportunistic about the timing of tapping into
the market.
As you've seen, we had very strong demand for our debt so far this year, so the issuance you've seen us do very much
was in response to the combination of those principles and the opportunities we saw to execute in the market. For the
remainder of the year, we'll continue to be guided by those principles. In terms of the maturities, we are obviously, as
we said, very conscious about making sure we spread out the maturities, even if that means we do some odd maturity
structures to achieve that. But we will continue to issue opportunistically if it's appropriate and if attractive
opportunities arise in the market.
<Q - Robert Louis Smalley>: That's very helpful, thanks a lot.
<A - Elizabeth Beshel Robinson>: Sure.
Operator
Your next question is from the line of Donna Halverstadt with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Donna L. Halverstadt>: Thank you. I had a couple questions for you this morning. First I was hoping that you
might share some of your thoughts around what you expect to come out of FRTB and what sort of implications and
responses you're thinking about.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So for everyone else, we didn't quite hear you. I think you said the fundamental review of
the training book.
<Q - Donna L. Halverstadt>: Yes.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Okay, fine. I just want to make sure the other callers knew what you were talking about.
So obviously, we were pleased to see because we participated, as you saw in industry letters, around the need for more
work on this, so we're pleased to see the announcement of the QIS [Quantitative Impact Study]. We'll actively
participate in that, as I'm sure other industry participants will.
And so I think it's a little bit early to tell in terms of what the ultimate findings of the committee will be. But again, we
found it good that the committee made the decision to do more work here given how critical their assessment is as it

relates to both balance sheets in the industry, but ultimately liquidity provision to clients in the global markets. I don't
think we can say much more at this stage because we'll go through the QIS process along with other industry folks.
<Q - Donna L. Halverstadt>: Okay. And then another question on your slide 15 where you show the 2.2% of sub
debt, 1.8% of pref [preferred], would you share targets for those ratios? Or if you won't detail targets, would you at
least tell us how those actual ratios compare to targets in terms of being below, roughly at, or above any target you
might have?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: We don't really think in terms of targets. We think about, again, how we manage the
capital structure, quite frankly, and the issuance pattern in the way that Liz and I have both described.
I think the one thing I would say is that – and Liz mentioned it in her comments – one of the important points here is
the marginal cost in terms of that part of the debt stack because, quite frankly, it's pretty expensive. And that was part
of the exercise you saw us go through in terms of our balance sheet repricing last year. And so you saw us after this
year's CCAR do an issuance, but the reality is we're going to be thoughtful about that given the marginal cost and the
related funding and pricing of the balance sheet.
<Q - Donna L. Halverstadt>: Okay. And the last question I had is a couple folks have commented to me recently that
they're wondering if we've all become complacent over the strength of banks. And in turn they're wondering where,
when, how risk will reenter the picture. And one thought on that is we've all seen some companies get into trouble
when they've strayed beyond their areas of expertise and competitive advantage, and not all get into trouble and some
do. So with respect to your consumer lending initiative, which I'm sure you're pursuing with your style of discipline and
thoughtfulness, would you talk about what the timeframes are for considering it, for hiring more people, and then for
ramping up lending? And as you work through those various stages, how do you guard against taking a misstep?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Sure. So it's a great question and obviously one that we're very, very cognizant of. So for
everybody else on the call, there are really two things that we've done. We believe we may have identified a set of
opportunities which to date are not finalized, and work continues. And more importantly, we made a hire with Harit
[Talwar], who quite frankly we're all thrilled to have as our colleague and fellow partner because he brings a wealth of
experience. And I think his hire in and of itself underscores how we're thinking about this because we're very cognizant
of the skill sets we have here, things like our risk management expertise, our core competency in technology. But
you're hitting the right point, which is having the right people. And the most important thing was to really get Harit on
board as we explore this further.
Now we obviously have a history of building new businesses, and so we're going to approach that the same way. And
the way we approach new businesses is with a lot of discipline and moving slowly. So the path here is going to be a
slow one. And as we have more information for you and detail, obviously we'll share it with you. But you should
expect this to be done in characteristically cautious and disciplined, and maybe it will appear pretty slow to you, but
that will be our style.
<Q - Donna L. Halverstadt>: Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Thank you.
Operator
Your next question is from the line of Brian Monteleone with Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brian Monteleone>: Hey, good afternoon. Maybe going back to slide 11, I think maybe six months ago when the
last fixed income investor call was, there was a discussion about $20 billion of maturities in 2015, possibly less than
$20 billion of issuance. That's been eclipsed. So, Liz, I think you spoke a little bit about the principles about how you
think about what kind of debt you want to issue. But can you talk a little bit about how much more debt you think you
need in the second half or would want? Is there any concept of trying to pull forward next year's issuance to get ahead
of TLAC and maybe some of your peers having to issue more in the next couple years than in past years? Just how are

<A - Elizabeth Beshel Robinson>: Look, I don't have an answer because, as I said, it depends on these principles and
the evolution of our businesses, the markets, the opportunities we see, so it would be a little bit as we go. Again, I think
we would continue to be opportunistic if it's appropriate under those principles if attractive opportunities arise. So our
issuance plan will depend on all those factors, but we could look to issue consistently with the remaining maturities we
have in the back half of the year.
<Q - Brian Monteleone>: Okay.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: That likely would be the base case.
<Q - Brian Monteleone>: Issuing consistent with maturities in the second half?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: That's the base case. As Liz says, we certainly will deviate around that as the business
and the market dictates.
<Q - Brian Monteleone>: Got it, okay, and then just one question around the construct of the current long-term debt
on the balance sheet. In the 10-Q, you guys break out the effective coupon, fixed versus floating. That's been trending
more towards fixed. I think it's gone from 20% to 30%. So I don't know if that's just as new fixed rate that is being
issued is not being swapped to floating. Is that a strategic decision or any color about what's going on there?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So I think the disclosure you're talking to reflects the fact that the majority is still fixed.
But you'll see us from time to time – sorry, floating, I misspoke. The majority is still floating. But as you've seen, there
has been a small migration to more fixed. And that's just reflective of the various inputs and considerations that we go
through when we think about our ALM [Asset/Liability Management] strategy.
<Q - Brian Monteleone>: Implying changes on the asset side or what change in the ALM strategy?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: More in terms of how we look at both the asset side and the liability side.
<Q - Brian Monteleone>: Okay, then maybe just one question around Volcker. I think there has been about a little
over $3 billion of funds sold over the last few years. I guess to be Volcker compliant by July 2017, there's something
less than $9 billion, I guess $6 billion, $7 billion, $8 billion of remaining funds that need to be sold. Can you just talk a
little bit about timeline for that?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So as you pointed out, the entire industry got the two-year extension to July 2017. And
the way we've characterized this for everyone because I think it's the simplest way to think through it, is the remaining
amount of capital that we have in those funds that is not yet, for example, monetized in a public IPO, so it's not an asset
that the fund is actually taking public yet, and that number is roughly $6.5 billion at this stage.
<Q - Brian Monteleone>: Okay. And should we be expecting a steady pace of sales, or will that be back-end loaded?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: I think again that would be the base case. But a reminder, we're managing this money on
behalf of our clients and when you're alongside them, and so as the markets present themselves. Now these are older
vintage funds, so I don't think that would be – I think that would be a reasonable expectation. But again, we're
managing these as a fiduciary.
<Q - Brian Monteleone>: Got it, thank you.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Sure thing.

<Q - James D. Strecker>: Hi, guys. Thanks for hosting the call. With the fear of belaboring the point, I was just going
to go back to the capital for a second, if I could, and maybe come at it from a little bit of a different angle. So looking at
your Tier 1 and Tier 2 positions right now, you're in a pretty good position relative to your universal and regional bank
peers. And that makes a lot of sense given that, Harvey, as you mentioned, CCAR is typically your capital governor,
more specifically the stressed Tier 1 ratios. But if we think about the GSIB surcharge and the potential for those to get
included in CCAR, and I'm not looking for any color on that front because I know nobody knows right now. But if it
were included or if they were included, would that theoretically lessen your need to run over 150 and 200 bps
respectively because you're going to have to hold extra common equity anyway?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: I think that there's a whole host of scenarios that you could construct. I think the way you
described it, if I understood it the way you described it, I think that's actually a scenario that is certainly possible. I
think the way we're thinking about it because, as you said, none of us have any transparency beyond next year where
the Federal Reserve has communicated they're not going to make those changes.
<Q - James D. Strecker>: Okay.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: But the way we would approach it is, when we had communication, and this is the way
we approach all of our regulatory reform efforts, we will wait until we see a modification to any rule, and in this case
I'm referring to CCAR as a rule. We would wait until we see the announced modifications to that process before we
would make evaluations about how we would want to think about the capital structure. And as you know, we've spent
time talking to a number of you about it. We look to incorporate all these things in our capital framework, the ROAE
framework. And so as we would get changes, that's how we would incorporate them into the business, and that's when
we would make decisions around how we wanted to think about the right balance of the mix in the capital structure.
Now of course, even that presents a certain amount of important challenges, and ultimately you learn a lot after you go
through the test.
<Q - James D. Strecker>: Okay.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: But that's how we would think about it given where we stand today with the absence of
information about how it might or may or may not be incorporated down the road.
<Q - James D. Strecker>: Okay. No, that's fair. It's definitely a dynamic process. Maybe switching gears to FICC, and
I know it's not as big a footprint for you all versus some of your larger U.S. peers, but just we'll come back at Q2, and I
think we all make way too much of these quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year comps. But if I look at your revenue
line, even on an absolute basis, it seemed to lag the run rate you've been enjoying or putting out maybe since the fall of
2011 at least. Any more color there? I know you mentioned during the earnings call that there was a little bit of client
derisking in Europe around the Greece situation. Any more color there?
And then I guess more broadly, like how should we think about the trading environment longer term? Obviously,
there's puts and takes. Equity did well with the volatility in China, and then in FICC it's still a mixed bag. You've got
some macro products doing okay like [ph] RAIDs (35:23), but even FX is slowing down and credit has just been
sluggish. I mean are you hopeful that your piece of the size of the pie grows as maybe some of the European banks pull
back, or how should we think about this in the near to intermediate term?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yes, so look, I think your first point is worth underscoring. There's always a tendency
obviously to look at the quarter-over-quarter numbers and try and draw conclusions. From a discipline perspective and
the way we run the business, we obviously study all that data also, but we really take a much longer-term perspective.
And quite frankly, we had a very strong first quarter. And when you saw us put out a 14.7% quarterly ROE, we didn't
dramatically change the business in reaction to that and we won't dramatically change the business in the second
quarter.
I think one of the things that we're seeing is, as we go through this part of the cycle, which has for sure been very
stop-and-go, right, first quarter there's lots of conviction from clients and activity levels are high, and then you get a
great example of the contrary in the second quarter where you have things like Greece and other themes enter, and
clients approach the market with less conviction. I think the long-term question you ask is the right one which is, do we

feel well-positioned for our clients over the long haul. And when we look at all the factors that would make one
successful in FICC, long experience in the business, the right global footprint, the right diversification of businesses,
whether it's commodities, currencies, credit, mortgages, interest rates, we feel very well positioned. Now look, in the
end, we can only control what we can control, and we'll see what the demand factors look like.
I will say from a competitive perspective, we did a lot of hard work a couple years ago getting in front of cost structure
adjustments and thinking about the best ways to deploy our capital for our clients. And so look, we might be in a fourth
quartile cyclical environment for FICC, and maybe over the next couple years it ends up translating into a first quartile
competitive environment. But we're in it for the long run.
<Q - James D. Strecker>: Okay. And then maybe if I could squeeze in one last one, Harvey, what are you thinking
about market liquidity these days? Obviously there has been a lot written about the mini Treasury flash rally last
October. Does it affect Goldman on a day-to-day basis? Are you guys thinking a little bit more conservatively around
deploying capital, holding position, holding inventory, or is it just something that's out there as a bogeyman but not
really affecting day-to-day trading from your perspective?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So look, it's a fantastic question. Obviously, there's fierce debate on either side of this in
terms of causes, and I think you can point to a lot of things. I don't think you can dismiss the multiyear contraction in
credit spreads and the growth in investors wanting to deploy those assets and the subsequent growth in asset managers,
which coincided with the reduction in SIFI balance sheets that were obviously driven by regulation.
When we think about it in terms of how we manage risk, obviously liquidity, it's always an input, but it's always been
an input, right. It was an input going into 2008 and it was an input during 2009, and it's an input today. And we're
always going to have to all be very thoughtful about that dynamic. But for us, really the best thing we can do in running
our business is to manage that risk very carefully and then focus on our clients, and then we just look to add value.
Now as Liz pointed out and I talked about, we're holding substantial levels of liquidity and capital, and so we feel well
positioned to help clients navigate these markets. But I don't think we're really going to know the answer to the
liquidity question until we go through a real stressful period.
<Q - James D. Strecker>: Got you.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: We haven't seen that, right. I mean the October flash crash, that was a pretty benign
environment. We just all woke up one morning and Treasuries were super volatile. So it's definitely something to
watch. It's good that you're raising it.
<Q - James D. Strecker>: Okay, I appreciate it. Thanks for the color, guys.

Your next question is from the line of Ian Jaffe with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ian Jaffe>: Good afternoon. I apologize in advance for asking this and I think I know the answer, but I'll ask it
nonetheless. So $1.45 billion of legal accruals this quarter, but $5.9 billion of a range of estimated aggregate losses
potentially in excess of reserves. That's definitely the largest number we have seen in the recent years. I know it's a
litigious environment and heard, Harvey, your comments on the earnings call. Is there anything else you can add
beyond what's disclosed in the 10-Q?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So obviously, and we know this is challenging for you because we're involved in active
discussions and it's hard to comment. I think the best thing we can guide you to do is obviously you can look at the
history of accruals, which we disclose every quarter, in terms of the reserve buildup. And a reminder, the RPL which
you referred to, the reasonably possible loss, actually we think that's a quite helpful disclosure for in effect trying to set
an upper boundary for all those of you who are looking at the 10-Q. Now the reality is that upper boundary could be
above, it could be below, but I think it's good to have that boundary out there, and it's high-quality disclosure. But

Your next question is from the line of Arnold Kakuda with Bloomberg Intelligence Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Arnold Kakuda>: Thanks, guys, for having the call. I really appreciate it.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: We appreciate you dialing in.
<Q - Arnold Kakuda>: Thanks, two questions around the GSIB buffer. Obviously, your capital ratios are well above
or above the requirements needed, including the GSIB buffer, at 3%. But I think you had mentioned that initially based
on the proposal that you were expecting a 2.5% buffer. So I was just curious on what was different from your
assessment to what you finally got, 2.5% versus 3%.
And then also, in the 3% bucket, it seems like you're right in the middle of the range. And so are there certain levers
that you might want to pull to potentially bring your GSIB surcharge down from 3% down to 2.5%? Are there certain
levers that you can pull to do that? Thanks.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: It's a good question. So one of the reasons why you always hear us caveat so heavily all
these estimates is because preliminary rules are not final rules, and that was our best estimate given the preliminary
rule. And there were gives and takes in the final rule which moved us into the 3% bucket.
In terms of how we'll think about that, again, we'll think about the most effective way to comply with the rule now that
we have it. We have a lot of capacity in our capital ratios. So maybe this is oversimplified language, but one wouldn't
want to spend a lot of time and effort given our current capital position and our excess position to reduce it at this stage.
Now having said that, obviously there are incentives to reduce it. And I will say I thought the Federal Reserve did quite
a good job in structuring the way they came out with the rule, and by that, I mean the way they addressed foreign
currency and the fact that they really did set up the structure in a way to incentivize firms to comply in a way that
would reduce risk. And so I thought the rule set was quite good. So we'll look at it and we'll make the best decisions
around. It's always about managing how we want to think about the balance sheet in terms of positioning the firm over
the long term for our clients and how we can drive the business.
<Q - Arnold Kakuda>: Okay, got it. And then just looking at – you highlighted growth in investing and lending on the
balance sheet on the asset side. And then on the liability side, you talked about growth of deposits. And they seem like
they're growing in lockstep. Now is that a coincidence, or are some of the deposits being used to fund I&L?
<A - Elizabeth Beshel Robinson>: Look, as we have discussed, our asset/liability management strategy involves
looking at the asset side of the balance sheet, thinking about the characteristics of the assets, the appropriate type and
term of financing to support them, and on the liability side making sure we're raising appropriate high-quality
financing. Not surprisingly, a large portion of the lending activities that we're doing and that have been growing have
been taking place in our banking entity, which is the natural home of our deposit base. So while there's no explicit
linkage between the two, I think it's safe to say that a chunk of the deposits are going to finance the lending given the
appropriate term that we have in that deposit book relative to the types of lending activity that we're growing.
<Q - Arnold Kakuda>: Okay, great. Thank you very much.

<Q - Ryan Butkus>: Good afternoon. Thank you again for hosting the call.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Sure, good to hear from you.
<Q - Ryan Butkus>: The 2015 capital plan mentioned possible redemption of capital securities. And I was wondering
maybe you could just let us know how you were evaluating opportunities to think about that as the back half of 2015 is
now underway.
<A - Elizabeth Beshel Robinson>: Sure. Look, we're always looking for ways to better optimize our capital structure,
looking across again the assets and the liability side of the balance sheet. So we have done some liability management
in the past. You've seen us purchase some of our trust preferreds, $2 billion last year, $200 million so far this year, as
an example of that. So we'll continue to assess those opportunities. But as I said, our first priority is always the quality
of the funding that we have and the mitigation of liquidity risk.
<Q - Ryan Butkus>: Thank you very much.

Your next question is from the line of David Jiang with Prudential. Please go ahead.
<Q - Chih Wei Jiang>: Hi. I have two quick questions on the advanced approach RWAs. I was wondering. With
regards to the three components: credit, market, and operational risk, as you sell down the funds pursuant to Volcker,
does that impact those numbers or the percentage mix of these RWAs? And then secondly, are those operational RWAs
baked into the increased litigation build that we've seen last quarter?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So on the operational RWAs, obviously that incorporates everything related to litigation
in the second quarter. In terms of the RWAs and the funds, a very good question. The way to think about that is as we
sell down the funds, that actually comes into the – and we talked about this in the past, what we call the significant
financial institution deduction. And that's roughly, that comes straight out of capital today. So that's about $4 billion
that if we didn't have any of those investments in funds accretes back to capital.
So your question, if I nuanced it a bit, would be if I moved all that – if I sold down all those funds, that actually gives
me back $4 billion of capital roughly. And then if I reinvested that same dollar on the balance sheet, it would then
reappear as RWAs. And so we always give you the transitional and the fully phased-in. If all of that happened, the best
way to think about it is we'd roughly be at the midpoint of the transitional and the fully phased in. That's the way to
think about that math. I just gave you a lot. If you want to follow up more with Dane and the team, they can walk you
through it. But that's the high-level framework for how to make that assessment.
<Q - Chih Wei Jiang>: Great, that's very helpful. Thank you.

and whenever it comes out the single counterparty limit, and how you guys are thinking about that and whether that
applies to your client assets. So when I think about your asset management and your brokerage and then the deductions
potentially from TLAC, how are you guys thinking about that going forward?

<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So I want to make sure. You're saying the single counterparty limit under CCAR,
correct?
<Q - Scott Cavanagh>: Yes, the one that the Fed is supposed to come out with a rule on.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Correct. So we have been living with the single counterparty credit limit through the last
test, and obviously the industry participated in a pretty active dialogue with the Federal Reserve on that. And so we
incorporate that into our CCAR analysis like we would any other part of the stress analysis, and so in fact we just
follow the instructions in terms of how to measure the risk.
<Q - Scott Cavanagh>: Okay. But when you think about it as far as for the pending TLAC rules and the deductions
from the capital of holding other SIFI securities, I'm just trying to get. Have you done that analysis, and do you think
that it's going to include the externally managed money?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Right. So I'll come back on the externally managed money, but obviously we look at it in
terms of all the exposures we have, whether it's in inventory or whether it's in derivative format. It's fully inclusive of
how we think about it.
