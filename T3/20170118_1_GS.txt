I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it
relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, global core liquid assets, and
supplementary leverage ratio. And you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial
measures that is posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com. This audiocast is copyrighted
material of the Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent.
I'll now pass the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Harvey Schwartz; who's also joined by our Deputy CFO,
Marty Chavez. Harvey?
Harvey Mitchell Schwartz
Thanks, Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in. As many of you are aware, Marty will be assuming my position in
April. As you would expect, we are already working side by side to ensure a smooth transition in the coming months.
Over his career, Marty held positions of increasing responsibility in Investment Banking, Institutional Client Services,
and then most recently, as our Chief Information Officer. During that time, Marty established a track record of creating
tremendous value for both our clients and our firm.
Having worked closely with him for over a decade, I have full confidence that Marty will continue that track record as
our Chief Financial Officer. With that, Marty would like to make a few comments.
R. Martin Chavez
Thanks, Harvey, just a few brief words from me. I really enjoyed the opportunity to meet many of you in my prior role
as CIO. I look forward to building upon existing relationships, and building new ones in the months and years ahead.
I've always found our conversations to be extremely insightful and valuable to effectively managing our firm. Goldman
Sachs has a long tradition of vigilantly focusing on risk management, operational excellence, and maintaining a
conservative financial profile. In my new role, I have every intention of continuing that focus and tradition.
With that, I'll turn it back to Harvey.
Harvey Mitchell Schwartz
Thanks, Marty. Okay, now let's walk through the fourth quarter and full-year results that Marty and I are happy to
answer any questions.
Briefly on the fourth quarter, net revenues were $8.2 billion. Net earnings were $2.3 billion. Earnings per diluted share
were $5.08, and annualized return on common equity was 11.4%. With respect to our annual results, we had firm-wide
net revenues of $30.6 billion, net earnings of $7.4 billion, earnings per diluted share of $16.29, and a return on common
equity of 9.4%. We grew book value per share by 6.7% year over year.
When reviewing 2016, it's helpful to contrast the performance between the first half of the year and the second half.
The year began with a number of challenges that ultimately ended with a lot of positive momentum. For example, the
start of the year, which has historically been a period of high activity, was instead impacted by significant concerns
regarding the economic outlook. Equity markets posted substantial declines and credit spreads widened materially at
the start of the year. This combination of factors translated into a difficult operating environment for our clients, and by
extension for our firm.
In the second quarter, concerns regarding global economic growth moderated, but other concerns including the
potential implications of the Brexit vote surfaced. Ultimately, net revenues in the first half of the year declined by 28%
year over year, with the vast majority of that decline occurring in the first quarter.

Switching to the back half of the year, the global economic outlook improved, reflecting solid economic reports,
particularly in U.S. The prospect of diverging monetary policy and more pro-growth policies in United States drove,
both activity levels and asset prices higher. For example, various Fixed Income market volumes in the second half of
2016 rose double-digits year over year. U.S. investment-grade credit spreads tightened by nearly 40 basis points. U.S.
high-yield spreads tightened by over 150 basis points, and the MSCI World Index climbed 6% during the period.
Ultimately, this drove improved client sentiment and a better environment. As a result, net revenues in the back half of
2016 increased by nearly 16% year over year, and included two consecutive quarters of 11-plus percent returns on
equity. In short, we ended the year with positive momentum and a significantly improved operating environment. With
that as a background, let's discuss the individual businesses in greater detail.
As it relates to the quarter, Investment Banking produced net revenues of $1.5 billion, 3% lower than the third quarter.
A pickup in M&A was more than offset by a decline in underwriting. For the full-year, Investment Banking net
revenues were $6.3 billion, down 11% from 2015, and a decrease in equity underwriting and Financial Advisory
revenues. This was partially offset by record debt underwriting revenues of $2.5 billion. Our franchise remains very
well-positioned. We ended the year as a leader in global announced and completed M&A, and as a leading equity and
debt underwriter globally.
Breaking down the components of Investment Banking in the fourth quarter, Advisory revenues were $709 million.
The 8% improvement relative to the third quarter reflects an increase in the number of completed M&A transactions.
We advise on a number of significant transactions that closed during the fourth quarter, including Procter & Gamble's
$12.5 billion merger of its Beauty business into Coty; Fortis Inc.'s $11.8 billion acquisition of ITC Holdings Corp., and
Rackspace Hosting's $4.3 billion sale to Apollo.
We also advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the fourth quarter, including
Qualcomm's $47 billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors, B/E Aerospace's $8.3 billion sale to Rockwell Collins;
and Capsugel's $5.5 billion sale to Lonza Group.
Moving to underwriting, net revenues were $777 million in the fourth quarter, down 12% sequentially as debt and
equity issuance slowed. Equity underwriting net revenues of $212 million were down 7% compared to the third quarter
as follow-on offerings decreased. Debt underwriting net revenues decreased 13% to $565 million from robust issuance
levels in the third quarter.
During the fourth quarter, we actively supported our clients' financing needs participating in, innogy's €4.6 billion IPO,
Tesoro's $1.6 billion high-yield bond offering, and Athene's $1.2 billion IPO. Our Investment Banking backlog
improved from the third quarter, it was lower compared to a very strong level at the end of 2015.
Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our FICC and Equities businesses, net revenues were
$3.6 billion in the fourth quarter, down slightly compared to the third quarter. For the full-year, $14.5 billion in the
revenues were down modestly compared to 2015. FICC client execution net revenues were $2 billion in the fourth
quarter, up slightly quarter over quarter as many businesses benefited from increased client activity. This more than
offset typical year-end seasonality.
Commodities increased significantly during the quarter as higher energy prices drove better market making conditions
and more client activity. Currencies was higher compared to the third quarter amid increasing client activity. Rates was
down slightly relative to the third quarter. Client activity was solid driven by divergent monetary policies. Credit and
mortgages decreased in an environment that included less issuance and generally tighter spreads.
For the full-year, FICC Client Execution net revenues was $7.6 billion. This translated into a 6% increase year over
year, excluding DVA gains from 2015 results. Given the difficult market conditions in the first quarter of 2016, 6%
growth, particularly notable.
In Equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees and securities services, net revenues for the
fourth quarter were $1.6 billion, down 11% sequentially. Equities client execution net revenues were $459 million,
down significantly across both derivatives and cash products.

Commissions and fees were $736 million, up slightly relative to the third quarter as global client volumes increased
modestly. Securities services generated net revenues of $398 million, up modestly on a sequential basis.
For the full year, Equities produced net revenues of $6.9 billion, down 12% year over year. In 2016, we were impacted
by less favorable market conditions and lower client activity in equities client execution. This compared to a relatively
robust performance in the first half of 2015.
Turning to risk, average daily VaR in the fourth quarter was $61 million, up from $57 million in the third quarter.
Moving on to our Investing & Lending activities, collectively these businesses produced net revenues of $1.5 billion in
the fourth quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $1 billion, reflecting corporate performance as well as
sales and gains in public equity investments. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $457 million, which was
largely driven by net interest income of roughly $300 million.
For the full year, Investing & Lending generated net revenues of $4.1 billion, driven by $2.6 billion in gains from
equity securities and $1.5 billion of net revenues from debt securities and loans.
Our net interest income within debt securities was more than $1 billion for the year.
In Investment Management, we reported fourth quarter net revenues of $1.6 billion. This was up 8% from the third
quarter, primarily as a result of $224 million in incentive fees, largely from alternative investment products.
For 2016, Investment Management net revenues were $5.8 billion, down 7% year over year, largely due to lower
incentive fees.
For the fourth quarter assets under supervision finished at a record $1.38 trillion. The $32 billion increase versus the
third quarter was driven by $17 billion of long-term net inflows, $31 billion of net inflows into liquidity products,
partially offset by $16 billion of market depreciation.
On a full-year basis, we had $42 billion of long-term net inflows, primarily driven by fixed income and $52 million of
liquidity product inflows.
Now, let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of
prior-year equity awards and other items such as benefits, was down 8% for 2016, reflecting the decline in net
revenues. This translated into a compensation in net revenues ratio of 38.1%.
Fourth quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.3 billion. The quarter included a $114 million donation to Goldman
Sachs Gives, our donor-advised charitable fund.
For the full year, non-compensation expenses were down significantly due to a decrease in provisions for litigation and
regulatory matters. Excluding litigation provisions, non-compensation expenses would have been down slightly year
over year.
Now I'd like to take you through a few key statistics for the end of the year. Total staff was approximately 34,400,
down slightly from the third quarter. Our effective tax rate for the year was 28.2%. Our global core liquid assets ended
the fourth quarter at $226 billion, and our balance sheet was $862 billion. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.5%
using the standardized approach. It was 13.1% under the Basel III advanced approach. Our supplementary leverage
ratio finished at 6.4%.
Our prudent approach to capital management is demonstrated by the strength of our capital ratios and has supported our
return of excess capital to shareholders. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 7.6 million shares of common stock for
$1.5 billion. For the full year, we repurchased $6.1 billion at an average purchase price of roughly $166 per share. As a
result, we reduced our basic share count by approximately 27 million shares for the year, reaching a new record low. In
addition, we paid out approximately $1.1 billion of common dividends over the course of the year. In total, we returned
$7.2 billion of capital to shareholders in 2016.

Before taking questions, a few closing thoughts. As we have said many times before, we have a healthy respect for the
dynamic nature of our industry, and we have an established track record of being responsive to changes in operating
environments. As we discussed, the first half of 2016 was challenging. In response, we undertook and completed a
$700 million expense initiative in the first half of the year. We continued those efforts in the second half of the year and
ultimately generated nearly $900 million of run rate savings.
When undertaking any expense initiative, it's all about finding the right balance. You want to protect near-term results
without impacting long-term prospects. We believe we found the right balance in 2016. This can be seen in our ability
to effectively serve our clients as activity picked up in the second half of the year. It's also reflected in our continued
investment in technology and infrastructure, including our launch of Marcus. Most importantly, our expense discipline
and the strength of our client relationships leaves us well-positioned to deliver significant operating leverage to our
shareholders in a better operating environment.
In summary, we enter 2017 from a position of strength. We have a robust financial profile, ending the year with $226
billion in liquidity, more than a quarter of our balance sheet. All of our risk-based capital ratios are well in excess of
regulatory requirements, while our share count sits at a record low. Importantly, this means we have the flexibility to
navigate shifts in the operating environment, including the positive scenario where we experienced a significant
increase in client activity.
Finally, our global franchise remains as strong as ever, reflecting our commitment and investment to serve our clients.
Meeting their core objectives will continue to be the basis for our long-term success.
Thank you again for dialing in. Marty and I are happy to answer your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Please go ahead.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Hi, thanks.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Hey, good morning, Glenn.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Good morning. So I have a Fixed Income related question. Back in the first quarter of 2015, the
Swiss repegged and things went bonkers for a couple weeks and you guys made a ton more money, but then things died
down for like six quarters. This quarter, we obviously had the election and a couple other events, and things went
bonkers. But it feels very different to me and more permanent, and client needs are changing and we have monetary
policy diversion. So I'm leading the witness here, but does it feel different to you guys? And does that equate to – this
could be the first year in many that the Fixed Income fee pool could grow?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: It's a great question. The quarter you're reflecting on, obviously the first quarter of
2015, very strong quarter for us. We had nearly a 15% ROE. That was the quarter, as you point out, there were
monetary policy announcements, and I think there was a little bit of a relief activity there because that was viewed as
increased monetary policy, QE, and that was a trend. Now, as we all saw, over a period of time, that ultimately led
more to concerns about lackluster growth and it led to concerns about deflation, and then it led to concerns ultimately
that actually QE policies at the limit may not be effective and may actually present risks.
I would say you can look at our fourth quarter, but I think it'd be better to look really at the second half of the year. And
what we saw from clients in the second half of the year was basically a build of confidence, an expectation that we
might see stronger fiscal policy, convergence of interest rates that we weren't headed into a deflationary cycle, more
confidence about economic growth. And so I would say there was increased optimism around the world. Now those are
the kind of things that always drive our business. Our clients are very sensitive to that, it changes sentiment. So I would
say that that felt more like a trend across the past six months of the year.

<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Okay. Maybe some of your ex-colleagues can send some more tweets and increase the activity
levels – I'm kidding. Last question on I&L, it's good to have that reprieve on terms of the I&L funded divestments. I'm
curious, if it changes at all, how you approach the way we had asked you every quarter about what's left in equity, what
do you need to divest, and that whole game plan, so I'm curious on your thoughts there.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: I'm happy to walk you through it. So the waterfall I walk3e you through every
quarter, Volcker covered fund, $6.7 billion. You take out an amount that conforms, so that's $200 million. That leaves
you with $6.5 billion. Of the $6.5 billion, $1.8 billion of that is in a fund, but those entities are already public. They're
trading publicly on exchanges, so they're already liquid, they're just in a process of being sold down.
So now with respect to Volcker, as it was more or less expected by the marketplace, because you'll remember, under
the original construct of Volcker, it was never designed to force sales. It was obviously very encouraging of
compliance, so there was an expectation everyone would do what they could in good faith to comply. But again, there
was no desire for fire sales. And so the expectation here is that we've now submitted for the extensions. We'll go
through the extension process, but we've been a good-faith actor. And if you read their communication, you would
expect the extensions to be approved broadly across the industry.
For us, it hasn't changed the approach of the business. It's always been about ensuring that we provide the best returns
for our clients because, as you know, we're invested alongside our clients in these funds. It's probably more than you
wanted, but I just figured I'd cover the whole thing.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: I appreciate it. Thank you. Go ahead. We can go on to the next person. Thanks.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: All right. Thanks, Glenn.
Operator
Your next question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Good morning, Harvey, and then welcome on board, Marty.
<A - R. Martin Chavez>: Thank you.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: So I hate to nitpick in a strong quarter, but performance in Equities was noticeably weaker than
peers. I'm curious if there were any one-time items in the quarter or anything that you think drove underperformance.
And then maybe more broadly, if you could, update us on how you're feeling about the competitive positioning in that
business.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So look, I think you're right to point out it wasn't our strongest quarter. In terms of
the franchise, we feel great about the franchise at this stage, and certainly we feel quite good about the competitive
dynamic. No matter how you look at the business, whether you look at it as our global footprint, prime services, our
ability to commit capital, our position in underwriting, we feel incredibly good about it. Quarter to quarter, there are
always going to be one-offs. There are a handful of things that were less than perfect this quarter, but I wouldn't read
anything into it.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Okay. And then since it's your last one, I'll give you a pretty one quick accounting question,
here. But the accounting standards for the tax impact or share-based compensation, I believe is scheduled to change this
year. Given share-based comp is a meaningful part of your income statement, curious if that has any impact on your
kind of forward – the way your income statement looks going forward?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So it's a very detailed question. It's great that you're asking it actually. So as
everyone might not be as aware as you are, Christian, but under a GAAP change, basically the change requires us to
recognize the tax impact of the difference in the value of shares that we grant, which at grant dates versus delivery
dates, and our tax expense line on the income statements.

Now, prior to the change, that would have happened in shareholders' equity. So there's two observations, here. So as
best we can estimate it today, it could be in a range of $400 million or $500 million in terms of a reduction in the tax
rates, but this is just a geographic realignment under GAAP, this has no impact to capital or the strength of our capital,
but you will see a shift in recognition. And obviously, anyone can feel free to follow-up more with, Dane, if you really
want to get into the details of the GAAP stuff.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Sure.
Operator
Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Mike, you there? Michael, you there?
Operator
Michael, check your line to see if you're on mute. Okay. One moment. Michael, are you there?
<Q - Michael Roger Carrier>: Yes, can you hear me?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Yes, we can hear you now, Michael, but we couldn't hear you before. So if you
asked a question, we didn't get it.
<Q - Michael Roger Carrier>: Okay, no problem. Thanks a lot, maybe first one just on expenses. So you guys have
been doing a very good job on controlling the expenses, and we saw the operating leverage in the quarter. Just wanted
to get a sense, depending on what potential changes happen with policy and regulation, is there some way that you
could give us some context on the amount that has been spent, whether it's on regulation compliance, technology,
maybe since 2011, 2012, that could shift around depending on the outlook. Obviously, there's a lot of core that's going
to stay in place, but just wanted to get a sense on maybe what that increase has been, despite you guys managing the
overall expense base well?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: It's difficult to quantify that for you. Obviously, it's been a huge investment in
terms of risk, technology, compliance, and we continue to invest. I think the thing that we've been able to do is, as
we've invested, and as we've complied with the rules, we've been able to use technology and training across the teams
to be as efficient as possible, which is why this year, you would have seen that, non-compensation expense was the
lowest it's been since 2007. And we were able to also execute the $900 million run rate savings. But who knows where
we'll end up in terms of the rule set, but obviously, we'll always look to comply and comply in the most efficient way
possible, over time.
<Q - Michael Roger Carrier>: Okay. And then just as a follow-up, it's been a while since we've been in an
environment where people are maybe more positive on – like the growth outlook. I just wanted to get a sense, and this
is somewhat in line with Glenn's question on FICC, but maybe broader on trading and banking.
What do you guys look at in terms of seeing that pick-up in client engagement? I know, you mentioned the IB pipeline
is up quarter over quarter, but even on trading in terms of balances, Investment Management, maybe inflows. Just
wanted to get some sense of how we can, kind of see the follow-through or the impact of better economy, in that you're
translating into stronger revenues?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Yeah, so it's a great question. Look, the thing that informs us the most is the work
that all of our people do, whether they're in banking, asset management, whether they're in equities or fixed income, all
around the globe, engage with their clients every day.

So these are relationships that build up over decades, they're invested in over decades. Our teams are sitting with CEOs,
they're sitting in boardrooms, and the best way for us to get a pulse on that globally is the feedback we get from clients
every day.
And as you know, over the past several years, there's been a general sense of concern with respect to global growth that
was reinforced by a lot of the monetary policy around the world, and so I would say, as we come into 2017, activity
levels are quite high. We've come out of a very low-volume, low-volatility environment for a number of years.
We'll have to see how this year progresses, but with the shifting policies around the globe, it's an extraordinary catalyst
for client dialog, for decision-making and for content, and that's really where – as a firm that's where we really want to
drive value, we want to drive value with content.

Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Good morning. Just given some of increased optimism that you've talked about on
this call, and the pipelines, just kind of big picture, how do you think differently about the staff? Call it, how much you
lean forward versus trying to optimize?
I feel like the last several years, you and the industry have been focused on optimizing to kind of the lower pool of
revenues, a tougher regulatory environment. And just how do you think about – it's not going to be a complete 180
going to maybe being aggressive, but how do you think, maybe about leaning forward a little bit more? Or is it too
early to think that way?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So look, this is all – and I said it earlier. This is all just about balance. So we're in a
cyclical business within a pro-cyclical industry, and so as we make decisions about investing and controlling expenses,
these things are mutually exclusive. So if you just look at the past year, obviously, we responded very quickly to the
tough first quarter, and as I mentioned, we finished with $900 million of run rate savings completed in the year. But at
the same time, we never stopped hiring, we launched Marcus, we acquired the digital lending platform. And so, we
stayed very front-footed and we feel well-positioned.
Now, to the extent to which there were more demand on the firm, by creating efficiencies through this part of the cycle,
it gives us the flexibility to invest in an improved part of the cycle. That's the best thing about having capital ratios as
strong as our capital ratios are right now, or having liquidity levels where they are, because to the extent to which
there's demand, we can respond to it. So you can be well-positioned, and you can be efficient at the same time.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay, thank you very much.

challenge for you in the CFO role? Going from CIO to CFO is somewhat unique?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Right. So well, obviously, we're all going to miss, Gary. It's fantastic that he's
willing to contribute all of his experience to our country, and it's a long tradition of senior leaders at Goldman Sachs
doing that. So again, we're all going to miss Gary, but we're all quite proud of what he's decided to do.
In terms of the transition in my role, I've obviously been CFO for a bit over four years. David Solomon and I, we've
been on management team for years, we've sat on the same floor for years, and we each have affinities based on our
experience.
David spent more time in Investment Banking. I've spent more time in Institutional Client Services. But I think, it lays
out – it plays out pretty easily actually in terms of how he and I will work across the firm. It's a big place with lots of
clients, so we're both pretty excited about it, and that transition's already underway.
In terms of the transition with, Marty, we've already been working side-by-side. Marty's been shadowing me for a
couple of weeks, and then he's working on his transition. For those of you who met Marty, I don't know, he's about 150
pounds less than I am, so following in my shadow sounds like a strange thing, but that's how we're approaching. And
look, we have a deep bench, Mike. So we've done these things across the firm for years.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: And can we hear – I mean, Marty, you ready to talk to us?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Oh, sorry, Mike. Of course.
<A - R. Martin Chavez>: Sure, Mike. I'll just add, I'm going to continue the firm's traditions in risk management and
maintaining a conservative funding profile. I'm fortunate to inherit such a talented team, and in keeping with the times
and industry, I'll apply math and software to these problems of risk management, but continuing to do what we've
always done.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: And just one last follow-up for you, Marty, so coming from CIO, is that what it's about, applying
math and software? And how else can you apply your past experience to the new role?
<A - R. Martin Chavez>: There's math and software in everything that we do, and so that's just a particular
perspective we have. But really, it's risk management, and that's what I'll keep doing as I've always done. I've been at
the firm for a long time, worked in many of our businesses, always with an emphasis on risk.

<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Hey. Good morning, Betsy.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: I wanted to ask a little bit about VAR productivity and FICC. We've had
conversations in the past where – when we are in a world, or at least what we've discussed is, in a rising rate with an
established trend, upside rate environment, in the past, you've had improving VAR productivity, and I'm wondering
how you think about that at this stage. Do you feel like you've captured what you think you would capture over time?
Step function 4Q versus 3Q or is there more to go here?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Well, I think, it's difficult for me to forecast. I would say the following. I think, if
rates continue to rise, and it's a reflection of optimism and concerns around deflation debate and concerns around an
economic decline debate and they're replaced with expectations of economic growth, and activity and confidence and
client sentiment continues to shift, I think there's meaningful upside in terms of the activity levels we could see in Fixed

Income. So we remain pretty optimistic. Now, we're positioned for a number of scenarios obviously, given all the steps
we've taken over the years, and whether it's risk or capital, obviously, we have a lot of capacity.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: And then, secondly on I&L, in the Equities line, nice uptick Q-on-Q, obviously the
market overall was up a little bit, certain sectors up significantly, and I had thought that your focus in many of the
activities you have is a bit more of an industrial versus a services angle. So I'm wondering, is there some – could you
give us some color as to – on the I&L, Equities side, how much of that was realized versus just to mark, and what you
still have left in the bag for realizations going forward?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Yeah, so one thing I'd really want to point out, because I know this question comes
up about realizing, and that's how you asked it, but everybody asks it, realized versus marked. The most important thing
is the portfolio was always mark-to-market.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Yeah.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So I think what you mean by realized is monetization activity, obviously in the past
year, monetization activity wouldn't have been as high necessarily as in prior years. We don't talk to it that way as
much. The I&L balance sheet, you didn't ask it, but the I&L balance sheet's roughly $98 billion, that's down $1 billion,
and nearly 80% of it is lending-related activity, and so, it's $21 billion of what we call equity.
But it's idiosyncratic, and what you generally see over periods of time is, the portfolio has outperformed markets
because of the quality of the investment professionals, and the asset selection. But I wouldn't say necessarily that it's
one category or another. I think, you're right to say that obviously, industrials are representative, but it's very
idiosyncratic, and in a year like this, where equity issuance is down, you wouldn't expect to see lots monetization.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Okay. And then last on fees and asset management; across the industry, been some
chatter on fee pressure, seeing some industry leaders cut fees and more of the passive-oriented products, but maybe you
could just give us a sense as to how you're thinking about that business, and managing it for the next several years?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So I think asset management for us among other things also a bright spot, as you
saw assets under supervision finished at a record, it was up 10% for the year. I think we benefit from a number of
things. I think we benefit from the fact that we have a very unique private wealth franchise. Obviously, it was a mix of
strong flows underneath that 10% rise, and this reflects a couple of things. Obviously, the performance we've delivered
to the clients, but I do think it's the nature of the capabilities that have been built over a number of years.
So I think so far if you look at us in terms of asset flows, we're bit of an outlier. We benefit from scale, to your point
about fees, because we're certainly not immune to the general shift in lower fees across the industry, whether it's a
conventional peer competitor or a competitor that's only dedicated to the asset management space. We're not immune to
that, but we benefit from having scale in our operation at being near $1.4 trillion in assets.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Great. Now I was just wondering on the fee rate side, is there a bit of uniqueness you
have in the high net worth client relationship versus institutional [indiscernible] (39:03)
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: No, I think we have strength in both client segments, but our fees are obviously
competitive with the rest of the world.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Right. Okay, I appreciate it. Thanks.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Thank you.

<A - R. Martin Chavez>: Good morning.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: So a quick question. I know it's been touched on a couple times, but it's one that's
definitely I think front of investors' minds here, so hopefully you don't mind me touching on it again. And you've
spoken a little bit about it, Harvey, with shifting policies globally leading to better dialogue, which certainly is positive.
But when we think about, especially here in the U.S., the inbound administration and the themes of the potential for
reduced regulation and taxes, it seems like it could have both a first and second derivative impact on Goldman. And so
not only the direct impact on you, but the clients and the clients feeling better and improved risk appetite. So how do
you think about that opportunity, assuming that plays out? Is there a particular way in which investors should think
about that opportunity? And is there any historical context or other periods that you think are particularly relevant or
helpful in trying to consider that?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: I guess I'd say a few things. I think when you say indirect and direct, you mean
direct, obviously, we've been a relatively high taxpayer. And so to the extent to which tax rates come down, we're a
beneficiary. But obviously, changes in tax policy can be a huge catalyst for how all of our clients think about deploying
their capital, strategic decisions. And so that's boardroom dialogue which obviously we're always front and center to.
So I think that's what you meant by direct and indirect. So I would agree with that.
I think it's very difficult to quantify, just like it was difficult to quantify in 2012, 2013, 2014, how concerns around
deflation and low economic growth would impact activity in a number of businesses. I think it's very difficult to
quantify how increased optimism. We like to say, in some respects, confidence is the best stimulus. And the extent to
which we enter a period of increased confidence with respect to economic growth, fiscal policy, you mentioned tax
policy, I think there could be a lot that happens. Now we'll have to see how all these policies evolve. But who knows,
we could be at the beginning of a long-term trend. We might not be. Again, it was difficult to predict things in 2012 and
how it would be in 2013, 2014 and 2015.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Yeah, that's fair, Harvey. And yes, that was exactly what I was pointing on, not
only direct impact on you, but the clients and the optimism. So okay, that's helpful.
You've touched also on the operating leverage, so maybe I want to hit on that a bit. It seems like uptick in comp ratio in
2016 was probably more of a revenue story, so I want to confirm that's true. And then when we think about maybe the
other side of that blade or the other blade of that knife, if we start to see revenue environment improve, how should we
think about operating leverage at Goldman given all of the work that you've done on the expense front, which you've
talked about a couple times?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: I appreciate you recognizing the work. Obviously, over the last several years,
whether it's around expenses, derisking the firm and growing the capital ratios, returning the capital, all that work has
really been about positioning the firm, while at the same time obviously maintaining all of our connectivity to clients
with really, really significant operating leverage.
Now this year, revenue is down 9%, compensation expense down 8%. Obviously, that translates into a small uptick in
the compensation ratio. But I would say at this stage, to the extent to which we see tailwinds in activity and increases in
revenue, we'll see that translating even more so now than we would have before to the bottom line in terms of operating
leverage. And so I can't quantify it for you, but if we see a big uptick in revenues, certainly you should see a decline in
the compensation ratio, which of course again is an output, but we're committed to delivering this result.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Terrific, thanks a lot.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Thank you.

<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Thanks. First question is...
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Hi, Guy.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Good morning. And, Marty, nice to meet you.
<A - R. Martin Chavez>: Thank you.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: A question on equities, really just to follow up to one of the earlier questions that was asked.
You talked about that maybe there were some things that weren't quite so perfect. I was wondering if you could
characterize that a little bit further. Were there some episodic block losses that were significant in the quarter, anything
like that as we think about what's achievable going forward?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: There were a handful of transactions that it's always going to be the case in a
market-making business when you're providing liquidity to clients that could have an impact. That was the case this
quarter. Some other things that are normal quarterly contributors and index rebalancings were more neutral in their
impact. Again, I wouldn't read a lot into it from quarter to quarter.
Remember, now we break out Equity Client Execution from the whole business. That's a different level of disclosure
than you're going to get from anybody else. So you should expect – given that that's the line where we're most
interacting with clients and capital commitments, you should expect that to be more volatile. I just don't think any of
our other competitors would ever break that out, so you don't see it.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: No, that's fair.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: But as I said, it wasn't the greatest quarter, but there's nothing in there.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay. And I noticed that when you were doing the full-year comparison, there you talked
about Asia for the full year but not for the fourth quarter, so it was either more of a domestic issue in the fourth quarter
or just more broadly global.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Remember in the first half of 2015, there was a huge uptick in activity in Asia, and
then basically that wasn't replicated. Our client connectivity remains as robust in Asia as ever, but this year just not as
active as it was last year.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it, and then a much broader question. I know you don't like to set ROE targets, but I was
wondering if in the context of what you might call, for example, unshackled interest rates in a post-QE environment,
and more broadly some of the things that we've talked about in terms of the new administration's goals and expectations
thereof, can you speak to a realistic but aspirational ROE?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Again, we don't set targets because it's just not the way we run the business. We
run the business through thoughtful and efficient deployment of capital, managing expenses and making sure we have
the best people and we're focused on our clients.
I guess – you saw some of this in the second half of the year, right? We had two plus quarters back to back of 11%-plus
ROEs, and that wasn't on a huge uptick in activity. And again, it's one data point, but it's the one I'll point to. In the first
quarter 2015, we had a 14.7% ROE. Again, that feels like a long time ago, but we're actually more efficient now with
more operating leverage now than we had then.
But we feel as front footed in terms of our franchises we ever have. So we feel well-positioned. We just haven't seen
the activity.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: And just a final follow-up on that point about the activity levels, and I know we've had all of
10 trading days as we get started here, so with all the necessary caveats, how are those activity levels starting the year?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Way too early to tell, Guy.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Fair enough. Okay, thanks so much. Thanks for taking my questions.

Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - James Mitchell>: Hey. Good morning. Maybe we can just talk about the revenue side of regulatory change? I
know it's not an easy question to answer, but I think there has been a lot of hope and talk about sort of an easing of
regulation and what that could mean on the revenue side. So I don't know if there is a way to just sort of talk about it
generally in terms of where do you see the most constraints right now and what would potentially benefit you the most,
whether it's the easing of market-making rules, whether it's some changes like we saw in the U.K. around exempting
cash from the leverage ratio? If you could help that would be great.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: I wouldn't point to any one rule. I think what we've seen, and one of the things I
think that gets lost in the global dialogue around regulation is that eight years past, the crisis – the body of work that's
been created by the regulators, whether it's Basel capital ratios, the implementation of CCAR, stress testing broadly
globally, the leverage ratios, the requirements around liquidity, all the things that were designed to address points of
systemic risk, clearing, margin requirements, all of that, data reporting, I think sometimes it gets lost in the narrative,
and you have to step back and look at the past eight years and realize that it's an incredible body of work that
regulators, the industry participants and the clients have actually created.
I think the dialogue around regulation and whether or not there should be some degree of pause and stepping back – I
think that started really at the beginning of last year, maybe a little bit before. You saw some of that in the Basel
Committee across the second half of the year. And obviously, I think market participants, regulators, and also, it seems
like a very reasonable point in time to step back and assess. We obviously have gotten some great benefits out of the
regulation, and the question is, is there a cost in economic growth? So this seems like a pretty normal part of the
process in terms of taking a step back and evaluating it. Now specific rules? I don't know. We'll see what happens. If
rules change, we'll adapt however they change. I think we've demonstrated our ability to do that.
<Q - James Mitchell>: But you can't – you don't feel there is one that's been more constraining than others in terms of
business?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: No, if you actually look at our capital ratios, they're strong across the board.
Liquidity is 25% of the balance sheet. And so there is not one thing that we would look at. I think the bigger question
for all of us is it's very difficult to measure the combined impact and the interaction of all these rules, and that's why it
makes sense to take a step back.
<Q - James Mitchell>: No, that's all fair. And maybe just a quick one on banking. I think there has been chatter that
while, I think, quote animal spirits are better, and that's good for the outlook for banking, I think there is some concern,
at least in the near to intermediate term, with policy uncertainty that might hold things back a little bit in the
shorter-term. Are you seeing that? It seems like M&A activities continue to be pretty solid, but I'm not sure what you're
seeing in terms of activity levels around uncertainty, short-term policy uncertainty?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Yeah, dialogue with – dialogue in boardrooms remains quite high for us. I think it's
fair to say that anytime you have a shift in administration which may present new policies, that can have an impact on
timing of transactions, because it can be a component. But it's really – it's a timing issue. Dialogue remains very high.
<Q - James Mitchell>: But do you see timing being pushed out in what you're seeing or -?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: I think it could be a little bit. You know, when you start having discussions around
tax policy, tax policy obviously will have an implication for how people think about strategic transactions. But again,
it's an economic input into a strategic transaction. It's not the strategy itself as discussed in the boardroom. And so – but

it could delay some transactions. Remember, the transactions coming through from the pipeline before that will be

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
<Q - Chris Kotowski>: Yes, good morning. Harvey...
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Hey, Chris.
<Q - Chris Kotowski>: Hi. On these calls, Harvey, you always talk about FICC trading activity in terms of volumes,
like commodities and currencies were up, and credit and mortgage down, and so on. But whenever I speak with fixed
income investors, they always kind of bemoan the lack of available of liquidity in the markets. They complain that it's
very hard to get anything done. And I'm wondering with, between the kind of increased activity that you talked about
and retrenchment of some of the competitors, have bid-ask spreads moved? Are they widening? Or has that not yet
been part of the equation? And do you ever expect that to be part of the equation?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Yeah, that's a good question. I think it's – I think you have to parse it a bit. If you
just – you mentioned commodities, so I'll pick up on commodities. If commodity prices are going to be quite stable,
let's just take energy, and they're stable at a level for a period of time, that is not necessarily a catalyst for – big client
segments for us, producers of commodities, consumers of commodities and institutional investors that invest in energy
– that's not necessarily a catalyst for decision-making because they may have very determined levels at which, for
example, a producer wants to hedge future oil production or a project that they want to bring online. And so when you
then see a big move in oil prices, one way or another, that's a catalyst for activity for our various client constituents.
In terms of liquidity, I think it's fair to say that feedback from clients – and it's not recent; it's happened over the last
several years – across the industry, is they feel like their ability to execute isn't what it was prior, let's say, to 2008 as a
period that was perceived to have almost limitless liquidity. I think as activity picks up and volume begets volume, you
get improvements in liquidity, but every day, we come in the door and we're offering our balance sheet to our clients in
the best possible way that we can.
<Q - Chris Kotowski>: Okay. And then I guess maybe as a follow-up to that, to the extent – I guess I would say
consensus expectations build in two or three rate hikes a year, at what point does that become the kind of catalyst that
you talked about in relation to commodities...
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Well, I can't...
<Q - Chris Kotowski>: ...for activity?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: I can't predict it for you. Again, in the fourth quarter alone, obviously – look, if you
just look at fourth quarter over fourth quarter – and I won't talk about necessarily – obviously, activity was high and it
translate into up 78% year over year for us in fixed income. But the catalysts of activity are pretty obvious, right? You
had the oil policy, interest rate shifts, movement in currencies. All those things are catalyst for activity. I think again, it
goes back to the broad question, what's the driver of that activity?
If the expectation is more pro-growth, moving away from deflation – not inflationary but not deflationary, more
inflationary and a normalized period of interest rates, those are all positive catalysts. What they'll be like quarter to
quarter are very difficult. But again, coming out of eight years of declining interest rates, I think would – none of us
really wanted to get used to that. And so I think getting into a period of normalized economic growth with normalized

concerns that we've been hearing from a lot of folks is that efforts to broaden the tax base might in fact include
restrictions on interest expense deductibility and could increase financing costs and reduced appetite for future debt.
And what I'm wondering is if interest expense deductibility is in fact eliminated, we do see reduced appetite from debt
from corporates. How does that inform your outlook, not just from the M&A side but even for DCM? And it might
even touch on corporate private equity as well.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Look, always puts and takes. Obviously, that'd be a very significant change in
policy so would have implications for the way issuers would think, investors would think, capacity. I think there is a lot
of what's in the details around that. But I think it's too early to tell in terms of what the necessary predictions would be.
<Q - Steven Chubak>: Understood. And maybe just sticking to changes in the GOP regime and the implications that
could have but focusing more on the regulatory side. There has been a lot of discussion on the prospects of possible
repeal or less strict enforcement of Volcker. And Harvey, I know you touched on some of the changes in terms of just a
broader messaging, but it just remains to be seen how that might impact your business. I know it's a little bit early, but
just want to get a sense as to if we do see an explicit repeal of Volcker, how that would change your strategy not just on
the trading side but would it in fact alter how you deploy capital within I&L as well?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Yeah, so it's a good question. Look, as we said before, we don't make any decisions
before we see a rule or a rule change. There'll be no difference here. I think most of the discussion around Volcker over
the last several years by regulators and industry participants and clients, going back to the earlier question is, what
impact has it had on market-making capabilities across the industry, which is obviously the most important part of our
business where we're providing liquidity to our clients.
I think in terms of the – sort of the micro components of Volcker, we would take a look at it, if it changed in terms of
our activities. Proprietary trading; we haven't been in that business in a long time. It was never a material driver. And
so we would look at it, and what's ever in the best interest of our clients and our shareholders, that's how we'd evaluate
it, just like we'd evaluate any rule change.
<Q - Steven Chubak>: All right. Thank you very much.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Thank you.

Your next question is from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Matthew Hart Burnell>: Good morning, Harvey. Good morning, Marty. First a specific question and then
maybe a larger-picture question. Harvey, could you give us the updated common equity Tier 1 ratios for the fully
phased-in side of things? And just curious what the driver of the reduction in RWA this quarter was. It was down about
5% quarter over quarter.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: I will just run through them, both transitional and fully phased, just to level set,
even though I know I went through them before. So under advanced, 13.1 transitional, 12.7 fully phased. Standardized,
again, 14.5. I know I said that before. Fully phased, 14. On the RWAs, in advanced, 5.50. Standardized, 4.97.
There were a number of drivers. Again, we continue to focus on being efficient with our capital and sort of risk
reduction across a number of items. Operational risk in advanced was down from 1.26 to 1.15, and that just reflects our
continued focus on, as best we can, having zero operational risk events.
Obviously that's our goal, and so what you're starting to see in operational risk is you're starting to see the benefit of our
focus flow through as older items roll off, albeit as you know that's a very slow process.
<Q - Matthew Hart Burnell>: And then for my bigger picture question, one of your competitors suggested that there
was on a year over year basis about a mid-teens decline in European revenues. I guess I'm curious first of all if you saw
that in 2016 versus 2015 in terms of the regional breakout? And with the Prime Minister May's comments earlier this
week, any update to your outlook in terms of what Brexit might or might not do to client activity more broadly across
your European client base?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Yeah, so look, I have no visibility into anyone else's franchise. The breakdown in
terms of our geographic contribution of revenues wasn't materially different year over year. Certainly, no meaningful
difference in our European franchise.
In terms of Brexit, as we go through Brexit, we just continue to evaluate it the same way. This is obviously going to be
a long process, so we're kind of contingency planners by our very nature, so we'll run through different alternatives.
I thought some of the comments with respect to trying to ensure if not disruptive, there is a long enough runway, all
those things, I thought some of those comments – but this going to be an evolving situation. But I will say the
sensitivity to financials and understanding the criticality of the industry across Europe – I thought all those things were
pretty positive, but again, we're going to see how this evolves over the next couple of years.
<Q - Matthew Hart Burnell>: Okay. Fair enough. And then just finally, if I can, you booked your first loan in Marcus
when we spoke last October. Just wondering what the growth in that portfolio has been since then?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Yeah, we've booked more loans. I'm not counting them one at a time anymore,
though. That just happened to be a weird coincidence with the last call. It's going according to plan, and by that I mean
our plan of being very deliberate, growing it slowly. Our primary focus here is on the client experience. We believe
we've built something that's differentiated for the consumer, and so we're being very attentive to that, making sure we
incorporate any feedback we get. And obviously, risk management is something we've done for a long time, so that's a
big component of this. But as we said many times, it's going to be a slow process.
<Q - Matthew Hart Burnell>: Sure, thank you very much.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: You're welcome. Take care now.

<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Hey, Eric.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Hi. How are you?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Good.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Just to follow up on a couple of questions that have been raised before but maybe taking a
little more of a broader view of the balance sheet, your RWAs are now at fairly low levels, as far back maybe as my
model might run. And in I&L, obviously the balance sheet there continues to decline, although you're growing Marcus
a bit. So overall, what should be our expectations about GAAP and RWA growth for 2017? And in particular, is there
anything that's occurring environmentally that causes you to view that outlook differently than let's say three or six
months ago?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: That's a great question. I think – I could be wrong on this, by the way, so Dane will
correct me – but I think it was 2012. We were at an investor conference, and we did our first review of some of the
capital tools we have built. And so I guess the best way I would sum it up in terms of how we thought about the risk
reduction in the capital is that it goes all the way back to 2012. Those tools of course took years to develop in and of
themselves. We were just displaying them in 2012, and it's really been about evolving the firm to understand that we
need to ensure we use our capital in the most thoughtful way to deliver to our clients.
And as I mentioned before, over that period of time, we've been able to grow market shares, deliver best-in-class for the
industry ROEs over a multiyear period of time, and at the same time, we sit here today with record low share count. So
the short answer after that big summary, because there are so many people involved across the firm, in the divisions
with the clients and in the federation, it's just been years of hard, hard work and a lot of elbow grease to get us where
we are now. The good thing about that is it gives us lots of capacity.
And it goes back – when we talk about operating leverage, sure, it's about expenses and it's about capital, but it's
positioning the firm in a way that we can respond to an uptick. And so I don't know. If you ask me the question, can we
grow risk-weighted assets? I'll tell you, it would be – it's not the scenario I've experienced as CFO but I would wish it
for Marty over the years ahead that if he has the chance to deploy capital back to our clients, not to return as much to
shareholders, grow risk-weighted assets, that's actually what the firm has done for the vast majority of the firm's
history, and those are the environments that we thrive in. And so as Marty and I pass the baton over the next couple
months, I'm hoping he gets to deploy the capital in that way with all of us across the firm. So that's my long-winded
answer, Eric.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Great, thanks. That's very helpful. Thank you very much.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Sure, thank you.

Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Devin P. Ryan>: Hey, thanks. Good morning, Harvey, Marty.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Good morning, Devin.
<A - R. Martin Chavez>: Good morning.
<Q - Devin P. Ryan>: Maybe timely with Marty in his new role here, but technology head count is now about a third
of the firm. It's been the fastest growing area in recent years, and arguably the most amount of the newer initiatives
have come in this area. So I'm going to put the cart before the horse here, but if we are moving towards more of this
business-friendly backdrop where regulation is softening a bit, can you see a scenario where that trend actually changes
and investment in high-touch personnel is where the incremental growth comes from, or is it just technology growth is
the secular trend versus there being some maybe cyclical component there as well?

<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Maybe I'll kick off and then I'll turn it over to Marty and he can talk more
specifically about technology. But I wouldn't say there has been a lack of investment in I think the way you described
it, some of the other growth areas. So we've continued to invest in all parts of the firm, asset management, the new
businesses we've talked about launching, the acquisition of an online platform, so there has been no lack of investment.
In areas of the firm for years where we've seen more of a multiyear decline, obviously they've been super careful as
they run those businesses, but I wouldn't describe it as we've invested in technology and we haven't invested anywhere
else. I know you weren't being that literal about it, but I just wanted to make sure we are clear for the call. But in terms
of technology specifically, I'll turn it over to Marty.
<A - R. Martin Chavez>: So as Harvey says, we invest both in high-touch and low-touch and really agnostic we're
evolving in the direction that our clients are taking us. So as for technology, as clients have continued to transact more
electronically, we've invested more heavily in those capabilities so that we can better serve them. We have a history of
that kind of adaptation. We work with the regulators to make sure that those automated capabilities are the best in class.
And to the extent that the markets continue to be more electronic, technology makes our people more effective and it
strengthens our clients' engagements.
<Q - Devin P. Ryan>: Okay, great, understood and I appreciate all the color and absolutely understand the investments
been across the firm. I'm just curious on that incremental technology spend, but thank you.
And then within DCM, just going back to some earlier questions, you had a really terrific year there. Obviously, if the
M&A backdrop improves from here that it could be supportive. On the other hand, higher interest rates it seems like
might constrain some issuance, so I know there are a lot of puts and takes. I'm just curious after such a good year how
do you feel about the intermediate term outlook there? Do you think that we can grow from here, or as you think about
all the moving parts that this is just a tough bar?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Look, I'd say a couple things. First, obviously as you point out, record year in debt
underwriting. The team did an amazing job really working with clients and delivering for clients, so quite proud of that.
The debt component of the backlog continues to grow. That doesn't necessarily forecast this year, but the level of client
engagement is quite high. I think there is always that temptation for all of us – I certainly do it – to think of past cycles
when interest rates went up in terms of the implications for markets and the market dynamic. This is such an
extraordinary scenario that we are coming off of basically a zero rate policy.
So I think if you look at history, the rate levels are still pretty low, even though the 10-year might have moved up 100
basis points at one point. So I think if you split your question and said well, could you end up with less refinancings? I
think that's certainly a case, but we're still in a very low rate environment by historical standards. And so to the extent
of which we see growth, companies see top line growth, there are CapEx activities and they're feeling confident they
want to finance, I think you can see a pretty good period for debt underwriting over the foreseeable future. But if you
saw big rate moves, disproportionate shocks for some unexpected reason, obviously, that could have an impact too. But
I don't think a move up in rates in and of itself should necessarily be considered a negative in an absolute sense.
<Q - Devin P. Ryan>: Great, very helpful. Thanks, guys.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Thanks.

Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brian Kleinhanzl>: Yes, thanks. Good morning. Just two quick questions, really. One in the Investment
Management with regards to the flows in the liquidity products. I mean you've seen those kind of flows pick up in the
fourth quarter the last two years. Is this just what you saw this quarter again, a seasonal effect with regards to liquidity
products?

<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: No, I think this has been a trend that's been in place. We have a very big
commitment to this business. We're a scale provider in this business, makes us very efficient in terms of an aggregator
of those kind of flows. And so – but I don't know necessarily. There is always some seasonality in these businesses, but
I wouldn't – this is a long-term commitment to this business. I wouldn't say that it's necessary seasonality in and of
itself that's driving it.
<Q - Brian Kleinhanzl>: Okay. And then just one quick one too, on the European Equities franchise. Are you seeing
any impacts yet from MiFID II? And kind of what's your thoughts on long-term impacts from MiFID II as it becomes
adopted?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Lot of focus on it. Too early to tell.
<Q - Brian Kleinhanzl>: Okay. Great. Thanks.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Thank you.

Your next question is from the line of Christopher Wheeler with Atlantic Equities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Chris Wheeler>: Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. Harvey, you've been talking a lot about capital efficiency and
obviously you've been really effective in that area. But can I just ask you a question about the way forward here,
because you've been obviously very aggressive in buying back stock and keeping the capital at very sensible levels?
But of course you've enjoyed or you could say haven't enjoyed having a stock that was trading at or below book value
or tangible book value for the last few years. You've now got a situation very happily where you're up at about 1.4
times tangible book. I'm just wondering, I know that you want to keep the dividend at a manageable basis in terms of
your payout ratio so that you don't see it swinging around volatile – in a volatile fashion. But have you started to think
about special dividends which has been a subject that's come up rather than buybacks which start to become diluted?
Thank you.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Yeah, so, look, it's a good question. Just one thing you said is I though you said
something like we enjoyed buying back below book. Just so we're clear I never found...
<Q - Chris Wheeler>: Not at all.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: I never found that enjoyable. I'm always rooting for the share price and I'm rooting
for our shareholders. So for all of our shareholders, I don't want anybody to be confused that we root for higher trading
levels. Look, capital management is a long-term process. And so if you actually did the math in terms of the fourth
quarter, buying back above book costs us about $0.24 a share. If you actually did the corporate finance analytics around
share repurchase versus dividends, share repurchase because you're reducing shares and you're returning capital at the
same time are always more accretive than a dividend.
Now, that's just the nitty-gritty math on that sort of stuff. I think the bigger issue is how we want to run the company.
And we're not thinking about changing how we run the company because of where the share price is. We try to run the
company in the best way for our clients and our shareholders and ultimately that translates into a higher share price.
But our policy with respect to the mix being more heavily weighted to share repurchase, that instituted us quite well. It
gives us exactly the kind of flexibility we've talked about in the context of this operating leverage goal, so that if we see
a big pick-up in demand, we can deploy that capital to our clients, where ultimately, that's our preferred way to deploy
the capital. But you shouldn't expect any change in the long-term policy in terms of how we think about share
repurchase relative to dividends.
<Q - Chris Wheeler>: Thank you. It's very clear.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Thank you.
