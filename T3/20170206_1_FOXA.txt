And lastly, please note that our offer for Sky plc that was announced last December is governed by the UK takeover
code and as a result, is subject to strict limitations as to what we can say with respect to that transaction.
And with that, I'm pleased to turn it over to Lachlan.
Lachlan Keith Murdoch
Thanks, Reed, and good afternoon, everyone, from Houston where last night we were privileged to witness a brilliant
Super Bowl telecast, beautifully produced and expertly delivered by Eric Shanks and his team at FOX Sports. I want to
thank the literally thousands of FOX Sports staff who brought us this amazing game.
This single game is a great example of the strength of live sport, increasingly delivered across multiple platforms, the
power of our core brands aligned with our ability to cross-promote them and the continued value broadcast television
delivers through the world's leading marketers. And yesterday, the Super Bowl powered Fox's first $0.5 billion revenue
day. And that's something that's made Mr. Nallen sitting across from me very happy.
Of course, that revenue falls in the third quarter. But for the second quarter, we're pleased to have delivered another
strong result, both from an operational and financial standpoint, as evidenced by the 15% EBITDA growth and 20%
adjusted EPS growth that we have just reported. Importantly, this growth was broad based, with earnings gains in all of
our operating segments including strong double-digit increases in both film and television.
Core to our overarching long-term strategy is our steady focus on building the value of our video brands. That means
partnering with the best creators and investing in the highest-quality storytelling, the best journalism and premium
sports rights to ensure our video experiences are vital for any consumer offering established or emerging. Testament to
the progress we have made is our ability to again buck this broader industry trend of multichannel subscriber declines.
In fact, this last quarter, we grew our cumulative domestic subscribers by 1.5% over last year's level on the back of
subscriber additions at our younger channels, including FXX, the Fox Business Network, the National Geographic
channels and FOX Sports 1.
Our momentum underscores the strength of our brands across categories and genres, be it sports, news or
entertainment, both scripted and non-scripted. The investments we have made to bolster our leadership in these areas
are paying dividends.
We've been saying this for a while, but actions and outcomes speak louder than words. Clear and demonstrable
evidence of the value we've built with the meaningful affiliate renewals we recently achieved for our RSNs and Fox
News with one of the nation's largest MSOs. We completed an agreement at the end of December which delivered on
the objectives we sought out. As part of the deal, this MSO will receive TV Everywhere rights across our entire RSN
portfolio for the first time, a huge benefit to their subscribers and our passionate viewers.
In addition, our full suite of brands was included in DIRECTV NOW's November launch, and we expect the full suite
to be included in the wave of emerging DMVPD services, including as previously announced Hulu's live and
on-demand service which launches in the next couple of months.
These agreements with both established distributors and new entrants move us forward on another strategic priority,
driving a more compelling user experience for our customers.
This is one of the key strategic pillars behind the agreement we announced in December to acquire the 61% of Sky we
do not already own. A combination of our two companies will give us leading direct-to-consumer capabilities and
technologies while enhancing our sports and entertainment scale. The Sky transaction will also deliver more balanced
revenue streams and geographic spread. It further simplifies our structure and operating model, and in terms of the
financial rationale, it is significantly accretive to our core earnings per share and our free cash flow.
As the founding shareholder of Sky, we are proud to have participated in its growth and development. Its
transformation over the past 25 years in Europe's leading entertainment business has been extraordinary. We believe

this transaction is the highest and most effective use of our capital to deliver shareholder value and returns over the
long term.
Now before I hand it over to John for a financial review, I want to conclude with some brief remarks on our cable news
business. On our last call, I noted the strength of Fox News. That strength has continued unabated. Fox News finished
2016 as the most watched cable network and achieved its highest rated year in history. Post-election, Fox News is
continuing to be beat CNN and MSNBC combined. Adding to this strength is year-over-year growth in the important
7:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m. time slots following recent programming changes. All of this underscores the underlying
strength of the Fox News brand, the enduring power of its positioning, and the continued loyalty of its viewers.
With that, I'd like to hand over to John for his financial review.
John P. Nallen
Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. Today we reported another good quarter of financial results highlighted by
double-digit gains in both EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share. Our EBITDA growth was delivered across all of
our business segments with particular strength reported at the Television and Filmed segments.
Second quarter revenues increased $307 million, or 4%, to $7.68 billion led by growth at both the Cable Network and
Television segments, partially offset by slightly lower revenues reported in the Filmed segment.
Total segment EBITDA for the second quarter was $1.99 billion, a record for any quarter, and a 15% increase from the
prior year, reflecting double-digit growth at our Television and Filmed segments and continued good growth at our
Cable segment.
This quarter's results include a $44 million negative impact from unfavorable foreign currency rates, and absent this
impact, our overall EBITDA growth rate was 18%.
From a bottom line perspective, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $857
million or $0.46 per share. Excluding the net income effect, in both years of Other, net and of equity earnings
adjustments at Sky and the Endemol Shine Group, second quarter adjusted EPS was $0.53, which is a 20% increase
over the comparable $0.44 reported a year ago.
So with that, I'll provide some additional comments on the performance of our operating segments for the second
quarter, starting with the Cable Network segment where EBITDA of $1.33 billion was up 6% on revenue growth of
7%.
Total Cable Network expense growth was 8%, which includes a 2 percentage point increase from the consolidation of
Nat Geo Partners. Domestic Cable revenues increased 10% in the aggregate, led by advertising increases of 12% and
affiliate fee growth of 7%.
Ad revenues continued to benefit from the ratings strength of Fox News as well as strong ratings and pricing growth at
FS1 driven by Major League Baseball post-season and from the consolidation of Nat Geo Partners which added 2
percentage points to the ad growth.
The affiliate fee increase primarily reflects higher average rates across all of our domestic brands and continued growth
at our expanding networks.
EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 12% over the prior year, reflecting these higher revenues, partially offset
by increased Major League Baseball costs at FS1 and NBA costs at the RSNs and higher expenses from the
consolidation of Nat Geo Partners and the launch of our new programming initiative across the Nat Geo channels
worldwide.
Second quarter reported international Cable revenues grew 2%, driven by a 5% increase in reported affiliate revenues,
which were up 12% on a local currency basis. Advertising revenues declined 6% on a reported basis, and 3% on a local

currency basis versus the prior year. This primarily reflects an approximate $30 million decline at STAR's
entertainment channels due principally to the negative impact from the demonetization policy implemented in India in
early November which meaningfully lowered overall market advertising spend. The market expects this dampening
effect and disruption from the demonetization to substantially abate within another month or so as new Indian fiscal
years commence.
Reported international EBITDA contributions decreased 13% primarily due to the lower advertising revenues at STAR
and a 9% impact from negative foreign exchange movements.
At our Television segment, second quarter EBITDA was $376 million, a 35% over last year, driven by increased
revenues. We had strong advertising growth from a very successful broadcast of the World Series which benefited from
two additional games and viewership levels not seen in two decades, and higher political advertising at the station. We
also had continued double-digit retransmission consent revenue growth. And additionally, the stations generated
incremental revenues from permitting the use of some spectrum in one of our markets.
These total revenue gains were partially offset by higher sports and entertainment programming expenses at the
network as well as higher promotion costs from the launch of new series.
At the Filmed segment, second quarter EBITDA of $389 million was $87 million higher than last year. This increase
was primarily driven by lower marketing costs in the current year due to fewer theatrical releases versus last year.
Additionally, revenues in the quarter were 4% lower than the prior year, primarily due to the difficult comparison
against last year's worldwide theatrical performance of The Martian.
It's worth noting that while we've reported very strong fiscal year-to-date earnings in this segment, the comparisons
become much more challenging in the second half of the fiscal year. In the next two quarters, for example, we will be
comping against last year's very successful releases of Deadpool in theatrical and The Martian in home entertainment.
Shifting over to capital management, during the quarter, we purchased $132 million of Fox A shares, leaving our
outstanding authorization at roughly $3.1 billion. And also in the quarter, we issued $850 million of new debt and
repaid $400 million in maturities.
And now let me turn it over to James.
James Rupert Murdoch
Thanks, John, and thanks, Lachlan. So as you've heard and seen, the first half of the fiscal year has been a good one,
and the outlook for the next few quarters and years is also encouraging.
Now, as noted, it seems an opportune time to talk a little bit about U.S. sports. It was a key driver in the quarter, and it's
emblematic of our broader strategy around big brands and making investments in the programming that matters the
most for our customers.
The MLB postseason was strong. The 7th game of the World Series was the most watched baseball game in a quarter
century while the National League Divisional Series was the highest rated week in FS1's history. Both drove strong ad
revenues in the quarter while strengthening the overall franchise.
And the NFL postseason was also strong. Average viewers per game exceeded 40 million in the playoffs. While we did
see single digit audience declines for our regular season NFL games on Fox, I want to note that our national games still
average close to 20 million viewers. And yesterday it looks like Super Bowl LI had more than 170 million total
viewers.
So the power of sports can't be overstated. In the U.S., 88 of the top 100 most viewed telecasts on television last year
were live sports. And across all of our broadcasts, FOX Sports continue to deliver what we believe is a superior
experience to viewers in terms of production, talent and technology and we're very proud of what the team is going.
We're also continuing to make great progress in entertainment. From Taboo, Legion, Fargo, Atlanta, Baskets, Archer,

and The Americans at FX, to Star, 24, The Mick, and Empire at Fox, Genius, MARS, and The Story of God at National
Geographic, Gamora, Babylon Berlin, Fortitude and The Young Pope at our affiliate Sky, and [ph] Malleeswari
(15:40), Dil Hai Hindustani and Neeli at STAR, creatively the business is firing on all cylinders and at a high volume
and velocity. This year, across the group, we'll produce almost 500 original series, over 20,000 hours of entertainment
programs.
I'd like to touch on where all this puts us and on the future and the direction of 21CF and the potential to create what we
believe is really incredible value here. We've spoken with all of you many times over the last few years about
simplifying our business, focusing on core brands and creative output that matters and taking the many steps required
to get there. In December, with the announcement of our intention to acquire the balance of Sky and wholly consolidate
that asset finally into the group, we took a major step, at least as far as intent, in a long process that started a number of
years ago. We've shed non-core assets, consolidated joint ventures, invested in our core operations, created new
capability sets within the group and simplified our management structure. All of this has been part of executing a core
realignment of the company around the future of video.
The underlying revolution, ubiquitous high speed connectivity, a continued proliferation of end-user connected
displays, and the potential for unfettered access to creative assets in the cloud for customers globally, presents an
opportunity for accelerated growth for new and existing video platforms. We believe this is only just the beginning, and
the combination of strengths required to operate a high volume content business and a vast international video platform
business is precisely the combination of strengths that we're developing. In short, if the content is indeed king, then
using it to build a platform that is an expression of those underlying trends presents one of the most promising
opportunities for our company in decades. And so far, we've made great strides to this end.
A few quick data points. The Hotstar platform in India, barely two years old continues to grow quickly. In December of
2015, we saw about 16.5 million monthly active users. In this last December that number was over 50 million. In terms
of engagement, minutes of viewing in the December quarter grew year-on-year from 3.9 billion minutes of watch time
to 17 billion minutes. Across Europe, the Sky is delivered online and over the top services to over 13 million customers
and streamed in the December quarter almost 20 billion minutes. And in the U.S., within the next few months we'll be
rolling out a major overhaul of our streaming apps which will deliver a step change for customers and future customers
in quality, in discovery, and in engagement.
The streaming business is not limited of course to our own platforms. As Lachlan mentioned earlier, our investment in
our core brands has meant that our portfolio is very desirable to existing and new entrants alike as demonstrated by our
licensing last year to DIRECTV NOW, Sling, Hulu's soon to launch streaming MVPD, and Google's upcoming service.
We expect this explosion of competition to benefit customers, to spur innovation and grow the overall marketplace for
video in the U.S. where top line subscriber trends have been previously not so great. That should reverse over the
coming years.
We're at the beginning of a great transformation of the business, and we couldn't be more excited about the
opportunities that lie ahead. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Reed, and we're happy to take whatever questions you
might have.

<Q - Benjamin Daniel Swinburne>: Thank you. Good afternoon. I want to stay on the topic of the bundle,
particularly in the U.S. market, with two questions. John or actually, Lachlan mentioned subscribers grew year on year
which is certainly encouraging. I think affiliate revenue growth decelerated from last quarter year-on-year, so if there's
any color or noise in those numbers that could help explain that, that would be helpful. And then for anyone who wants
to take it, we're all focused on these new streaming packages coming out, and at least I would argue that Sling and
DIRECTV NOW have had some technology challenges in terms of scaling. And I'm curious how focused 21st Century
Fox is on that topic as it relates to Hulu in particular where you're an owner? How confident are you that product's
going to come out of the gate and be robust from a product offering scalability perspective? And should your
shareholders be expecting that when that comes out over the next couple of months? Thank you.
<A - Lachlan Keith Murdoch>: Thanks, Ben. Look, I'll deal with the first part of the question, and James can take the
second part. The affiliation revenue growth did decline very slightly in this quarter. It's still a positive, and we would
expect as we've been saying for a while the new affiliation agreements start to take effect, we'll see that growth
accelerate again towards the second half of the year.
<A - John P. Nallen>: Yeah, and I would just add, Ben, we're only a few million dollars away from rounding this to
8% from the 7%. So there's not a lot of noise inside of that.
<Q - Benjamin Daniel Swinburne>: Got it.
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: And, Ben, thanks for your question. Look, I think the short answer is that the team at
Hulu and certainly what we're doing as well with our streaming apps – everyone's very, very focused on how do you
solve some of the challenges in streaming, particularly when you have a lot of concurrent streams?
So I think we've seen really, really good progress in terms of our ability to stream concurrent streams of live sports, of
the high volume entertainment programming, for example, at the Hotstar platform that I mentioned to you earlier, as
well as what our affiliate Sky routinely does with Sky Go and NOW TV. And Hulu's working very hard on making
sure that that experience for customers is as good as it possibly can be.
You never rule out teething problems and I think it's instructive or it's just worthwhile mentioning that some of these
problems in streaming, particularly concurrent live events when everyone's logging in at the same second, its
non-trivial. That said, we have a high degree of confidence in the Hulu platform, in the team there, their ability to
deliver really a ton of minutes of streaming across their subscriber base currently.
So we think it's going to be pretty strong. I think some of the things you've seen over the last number of months are
normal for new services, and certainly we expect those kind of kinks to be worked out. But certainly it's not an easy
technical challenge, but it's one that is surmountable. And the team at Hulu is very, very focused on it, and I think the
experience is going to be pretty good.
<A - H. Reed Nolte>: Thank you, Ben. Operator, can we have the next question, please?
Operator
Yes. And we go to Michael Morris with Guggenheim Securities.
<Q - Michael Morris>: Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Couple of questions. First on Hulu, can you talk about your
expectation that the NBCUniversal channels will be included in the streaming MVPD service? And it seems to reflect
maybe in the near-term a lack of support from one of the major Hulu partners for the product. Do you think that's the
case? And does that impact sort of what can be done with that product? And then second, just on the Sky brand – it's a
powerful brand in Europe clearly. Do you see any opportunity that that brand could actually be brought to the U.S. and
used in any way on any of your products? Thanks.
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Thanks, Mike. Look, on Hulu, the matter of Hulu's negotiations with third-party
providers and content owners is really a matter for Hulu and one that they engage in, and we don't. That said, I know
that the team there is very focused on putting together a package of programs and brands that are going to really work

for their customers. And they'll make those decisions as that commercial negotiation kind of plays itself out. But I think
the product is going to be pretty good.
And look, I think you'd never sort of – you don't want to really engage in a lot of speculation about the future of the
Sky business, et cetera. I think when you look at this business across the board, our focus on these brands and the Fox
brands broadly, on National Geographic, on the STAR brand, and on the Sky brands in their regions with different
levels of strength has been one that we intend to continue. And if there's opportunities to grow those brands, as we did
with the STAR brand, launching services to the South Asian diaspora across Europe and in particular, the UK a number
of years ago with great success, these things can live in different territories. But there are no plans at this point. Right
now, we're focused on the strength of all of these brands and growing all of these businesses as best we can within their
kind of immediate neighborhoods, to be honest.
<A - H. Reed Nolte>: Thank you, Mike. Operator, can we have the next question, please?
Operator
Yes. And we go to Anthony DiClemente with Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead.
<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. First question for James; this is
about capital allocation. So pro forma Sky, the balance sheet will be a touch above 4 times levered. Does this, do you
think, hold you back in any way, I mean either in terms of the buyback or in terms of strategic M&A? And more
specifically with the new administration and FCC regime, if the FCC regulations were relaxed to allow you to own
more TV stations, question would be: would you have the inclination to look at acquiring TV stations that could come
available?
And the second question is for John and it's about Cable Network profitably. So last summer, you announced an
incremental $200 million in investment in programming in Nat Geo and FX. You've now lapped the consolidation of
Nat Geo Partners. The question is when might you expect Cable Network segment margins to return to expansion? Or
said another way, when you look at the programming investments in Nat Geo and FX, when do those start to taper off
such that the programming expense growth moderates? Thanks a lot.
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Hey. Thanks, Anthony. Look, I think with respect to capital allocation, looking at the
balance sheet going forward, I think the key thing to remember about the Sky transaction that we kind of detailed in
December was the rapid deleveraging profile of the combined business. So yes, we sort of land at around 4 times, a
little bit above. It really de-levers rapidly. And we're going to be focused on deleveraging, right? So we're going to put
that at the top of the agenda for the number of quarters and years' post closing.
So I think it kind of delevers really quickly, and I think we have capacity to do other things, either think about
additional capital returns by way of buybacks and continuing obviously, with a growing dividend. Or potential kind of
medium-sized or bolt-on M&A where we think capabilities and expanding our business can make sense. But at this
point, we're really focused on the shape of the business as we've outlined to you. And as you've seen and as we've
shown you, I think the deleveraging profile there is pretty rapid and is pretty manageable for us.
So, no, we don't think it really curtails us. And this is the most sensible thing, as Lachlan laid out in his early
comments, we really think this is the best use of our capital at this point with the highest returns available to all
shareholders, given the accretive nature of it and the pace of deleveraging.
And with respect to potentially the FCC relaxing ownership caps on terrestrial TV stations in the U.S., no, I guess is the
most straight forward way to answer the question. I hate your comments on future speculation and hypotheticals, but I
think you can rest easy there. We really like the shape of our station business right now. And while there always may
be affiliation swaps or other little bits and pieces around the edges, no, we don't have a big appetite for adding much to
that. And then I think it was three questions. John, do you want to talk about the programming expense?

<A - John P. Nallen>: Yeah, I'll cover, Anthony, on the expense trajectory. So this year was a step up for Nat Geo and
FX, actually on a relative basis more for Nat Geo with a product like MARS and Genius and everything else. So
they've begun the ramp-up of what we call the 2.0 strategy. We'll see a bit of it continuing into next year. But today was
the – this year – I'm sorry – was the real ramp-up for Nat Geo.
FX continues its trajectory toward its full schedule. We probably won't fully get there in the current year. But given the
product and the success of what FX has done and particularly the success of its product not only on FX but in other
markets, that's an investment that the returns are just fabulous on. So...
<A - Lachlan Keith Murdoch>: I think you can already look at Taboo which premiered three or four weeks ago
which is probably the first part of that extra programming expense, and it's been a, you know, a terrific success doing
that and we're very happy.

<A - H. Reed Nolte>: Operator, next question, please?
Operator
We'll go to Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America.
<Q - Jessica Jean Reif Cohen>: Oh, thanks. I have a couple of questions. First, James, you talked a little bit about
next-generation apps. Can you talk a little bit about, you know, give us some color on how you approach advertising
within the apps?
Second, as good as the numbers were this quarter, the outlook seems better. Comcast talked a little bit about their
programming cost increases for the next four quarters. Can you give us any visibility on what the domestic affiliate fee
growth will look like? And on India, how quickly will you recover from the demonetization impact? And are there any
other drivers that we should look for in the second half?
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Okay. Thanks, Jessica. In terms of advertising in the sort of apps, I think one thing
that's really interesting is that as we revamp, and you'll see over the next kind of month and change we'll start rolling
out on a per platform basis, you know, tvOS and then Android and then – and so on as you kind of roll through the kind
of estate out there. The authenticated apps really have a potential to reach an enormous audience. The 90 million or so
MVPD households out there under our agreements have access to these apps, and what we need to do is really ease and
simplify the authentication pathways. We need to create single logins across multiple brands. We need to really make it
easy and a great experience for customers, and we think we can generate some real audience there.
Now that said, what's exciting about that is that that's a platform for us to innovate in terms of advertising. So that's
around dynamic ad insertion, it's around pricing a customer's time in a different way, it's about engagement units and
other things, really lowering the ad loads and getting a higher yield.
We're already seeing nonlinear advertising growth at a very, very good clip in the U.S. and internationally, and that's
because from a data perspective and then a monetization perspective flowing from that with innovative new ad
products and different loads, you can have a much better experience.
So we're going to approach it first of all by making sure the app platform is stable. It's not easy dealing with a number
of systems, the number of MVPDs, all the different authentication issues that are out there. But first of all, we want to
make it stable, we want to make it a great experience. We're very focused on having a very, very big – a large volume
of content available on those apps. And we're going to kind of iterate in terms of how the advertising and monetization
works.

It's already going pretty well with the existing apps, and we think we're going to be able to enhance that experience and
enhance our capabilities over the next number of months and through the rest of the year. It will be a big focus for us.
<A - Lachlan Keith Murdoch>: [indiscernible] (32:05) On the affiliate fee growth, because I sort of answered the
question a little bit before Jessica, which was just, you know, with the renewal that we've signed at the end of
December and then with some new renewals that start rolling in in March, we expect affiliate fee growth to accelerate
and really read at the end of the fiscal year. So you can read them at the fourth quarter when we see the accelerations
begin again.
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Yeah, and it was obviously a little bit slower, we talked about earlier, just because of
the anniversaries of deals which didn't have any renewals in the right time. It's just the natural kind of cycle of it.
And then with respect to the impact in India, look, I mean, the demonetization obviously was a big impact in the
quarter. We continue to feel some of that. It's ameliorated over the last month, and we expect that to kind of wash out
of the system. But you will see that impact in this current quarter that we're in, and we have to really see what the
fourth quarter looks like.
I just want to reiterate that the business is performing pretty strongly. The impact is primarily associated with the
entertainment advertising piece of this due to the nature of our clients and the nature of their business and how it's
impacted by the demonetization. Viewing share is very strong, and we're very confident that the business once it's
through this kind of speed bump over a quarter or two will be able to get back on the trajectory towards the targets that
we've have outlined for 2018, 2019, 2020, and beyond.
<Q - Jessica Jean Reif Cohen>: Thank you.
<A - H. Reed Nolte>: Thank you, Jessica. Operator, can we have the next question, please?
Operator
And we'll go to Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael B. Nathanson>: Thanks. I have two for James. James, question for you on Hulu is since this idea first
came up about a year ago, there's been a large list of new entrants to the space. You mentioned many of them, including
Google. So as an owner of Hulu, where do you now see the opportunity to take share in what's becoming a pretty
crowded marketplace?
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Well, first of all, I think it's crowded in terms of the number of sort of names that are
out there, but I think it's very, very nascent. I mean, we've seen Sling obviously, first out the gate. I guess Sony have
used Sling, DIRECTV very recent. And we expect the team at Hulu to be ready for a launch pretty soon. And we think
there's a lot to play for. We think it's a big opportunity. I think for us, I guess, and we've been sort of talking about this
for a little while, we think that that proliferation of downstream competition is really, really healthy for content creators
and for brands like ours that are robust, that are differentiated, that can really deliver content that works for customers.
So we think that that, A, from a 21CF perspective, that proliferation is going to be a positive thing for our business, and
we do believe that it can reverse some of these overall declines in subscriber trends in the total MVPD universe and
have that go forward. And then with Hulu in particular, as you saw, I think Mike Hopkins did a great job unveiling a lot
of the details of the service – of the planned service at CES earlier this year.
I think the live viewing plus current plus past seasons and movies by really bundling the SVOD services with originals
and library and past seasons in with what is the current MVPD window, I think it's a very compelling offering that
makes it simple for customers, that makes it exciting, and I think gives it a really unique, at this point, angle on the
marketplace. So we think it could be very exciting. I think it's – I would just say it's very early days. So even though
we've seen a lot of announcements and we're seeing reasonable growth in these digital MVPDs, they are just starting
from very little over zero, and it's a big marketplace and one that I think is going to benefit from a lot of this
innovation.

<A - Lachlan Keith Murdoch>: I think, James, I'd just to add to that and it's important for people to remember, Hulu
will be part of our [ph] virtual (36:10) ecosystem of these new DMVPDs, but one of the reasons Hulu's embarking on
this strategy is also to influence that ecosystem and what the core bundle looks like. So while we expect it to be very
successful in its own right, it's already been successful in terms of having some influence in terms of how these
packages of core channels are being put together.
<Q - Michael B. Nathanson>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - H. Reed Nolte>: Thank you, Michael. Operator, can we have the next question, please?
Operator
We go to Richard Greenfield with BTIG. Please go ahead.
<Q - Rich Greenfield>: Hi. A couple questions. In the U.S., you've got your Hulu product that you've talked about and
what's coming with the virtual MVPD for Hulu. But just wondering given what you're talking about in terms of the
technology that you're going to be fully consolidating with Sky with things like NOW TV, is there a path for Fox to
build a, I guess for lack of a better word, a direct Fox-to-consumer relationship rather than everything going through
Hulu? And what could that look like?
And then secondly, when you think about Hulu, it's an amazing product at $8, and I think, James, I know I've heard you
speak at conferences about how when you launched the $12 product, it's actually driven home to people the value of the
$8 product and really shown people the value of watching ads. How do you prevent the launch of a $40-ish product
from showing people how much value there is to not watching live? Essentially highlighting how great the $8 is versus
the $40, how do you protect against that?
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Thanks, Rich. So, look, I think first of all, as I mentioned earlier, we're really focused
on the streaming customer experience and the platform that we can deliver streaming content on to enable us to have
the capabilities we talked earlier about. Advertising, we talk about discovery of content, engagement generally. I gave
you some numbers in my opening comments around how some of that is working around the world in terms of those
levels of engagement. But I think the goal for us is first to, as I said, really create this product, a direct streaming
product for customers, available to many, many, many millions of households on an authenticated basis who are
already paying for the programming and we can really enhance their experience with that programming and we can
also really enhance our capability in terms of monetizing that in addition advertising lighter loads, et cetera.
But certainly it's also an option for us in the future whether or not we'd like to have an independently priced access to
that suite of apps. And that's a decision that we haven't yet made but one certainly that we feel we have the capability
and the general wherewithal and experience in terms of managing direct-to-consumer businesses and subscriber
businesses to tackle. But, right now, we're very focused with our MVPD partners and our new digital MVPD partners
to making a customer experience that is as good as it can be and those decisions around independently priced D2C
platforms in the U.S. is something that can wait.
I would note that between the Hotstar platform, both the free one and the premium tier there and then the businesses at
our affiliate Sky and at Tata Sky in India as well, many tens of millions of customers are on this vast
direct-to-consumer platform today that is generating a lot of engagement and a lot of growth and a lot of profit. So we
feel really good about that around the world as well. And whether or not there's a future for us in that, for example, the
way that TBS has taken some steps in those areas in the U.S., is a decision that we can take at a later date.
And then with respect to pricing, look, I think pricing and packaging around these things is a challenging sort of art, if
you will. There's a bit of science, but there's also a bit of art. And the question is, how do you make the differentiation
between those tiers really worthwhile for people if they want to step up into something that's a little bit more
expensive?

And you try to create steps for them both up and down, so it doesn't just become in or out of a service. And certainly
we did that and have done that for years at the Skys, and I think the team at Hulu are approaching it in a pretty smart
way. A lot of it has to do with just how they're planning the product in the future.
So I think you have to watch it carefully, and you have to create packaging around that that makes it understandable for
customers exactly what they're getting, it's simple, it's straight forward, and that they can choose the prices that they
like.
And I would say that I think that the live programming, current and live sports, et cetera, are hugely valuable. And we
see that in the uptake in penetration of the MVPD world today and in the engagement numbers in audiences that we're
delivering, either through our sports businesses, at the RSNs or at the broadcast network as we talked earlier, and with
the kind of recency and immediacy of new programming as it launches.
So I think that does have value for people, but detailed pricing and packaging going forward for Hulu is a matter for
them that they're going to I think be articulating probably pretty soon and then also probably developing and changing
it as it goes long.
<Q - Rich Greenfield>: That's incredibly helpful.
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: We have time for about one more question. Thanks, Rich.
<A - H. Reed Nolte>: Operator?
Operator
Yes. We go to Steven Cahall with Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead.
<Q - Steven Cahall>: Yeah, thank you. Just a couple for me. Maybe first just to continue the affiliate fee discussion, I
was wondering – you've given a lot of detail. Can you remind us what percentage of the base of subs you've put on new
deals in the last 18 to 24 months? And what percentage you have coming up? And maybe if you could share the same
for what you've got on retrans on the broadcast side of deals?
And then also on cash, just wondering – you haven't talked a lot about working capital lately. What should our
expectations be for working capital this year? And can you give us any indication of how much cash you might have on
the balance sheet when you get to the end of the calendar year?
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Sure. I think – I don't know if that number's sort of at the top end. It's about 20% in
terms of the sort of affiliate universe, and we actually don't have going forward a lot of lumpiness. We try to space that
out so that every year or few quarters or so we can have a step up here and there. We've got actually not a lot in the
next few quarters having done this recent deal. We've got a small one coming up, and then it picks up again in 2018.
<A - John P. Nallen>: And, Steve, from a cash perspective, we're a first half, second half company, so the first half
usually is not our biggest cash flow period. So we'll have a very strong cash flow period in the second half of the fiscal
year, including collecting all of the $500 million that Lachlan referred to earlier from the Super Bowl yesterday, while
all the payments for that programming had been made in the first half of the year. So it's quite a healthy and will be a
substantially growing position of cash before we get to the end of the year.
<Q - Steven Cahall>: And is it fair to assume you'll be very selective in any stock repurchase between now and then?
<A - John P. Nallen>: Yeah, I think it's probably fair to assume that we view the best use of our capital now to be
pointed toward the Sky acquisition, which is providing a better return than as we said before the status quo, which
would have included buybacks. So I think directionally that's the way you should look at it.
<Q - Steven Cahall>: Great. Thanks very much.
<A - John P. Nallen>: Thanks.
