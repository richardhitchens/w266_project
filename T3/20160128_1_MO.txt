Martin J. Barrington
Thanks, Sarah. Good morning, everyone. Altria had yet another year of excellent business results and outstanding
shareholder returns in 2015. We continue to deliver against our two long-term financial goals.
First, Altria grew adjusted diluted earnings per share by nearly 9%, in-line with our long-term growth objective.
Second, Altria paid nearly $4.2 billion in dividends to our shareholders, consistent with our goal of paying out
approximately 80% of adjusted diluted EPS. Also during the year, we raised our dividend per share by 8.7% aligned
with our goal to raise the dividend in line with adjusted diluted EPS growth. This was the 49 time we have raised the
dividend in the last 46 years. We also completed our $1 billion share repurchase program and announced a new $1
billion program that we expect to complete by the end of 2016.
In Altria, SABMiller's largest shareholder supported the approximately $107 billion business combination between
Anheuser-Busch InBev's and SABMiller, which will create the first truly global beer company. We strongly believe
that the deal is in the best interest of our shareholders, offering a significant premium on our very large beer
investment, and continued participation in the global beer profit pool on attractive terms. The size of the premium we
capture will ultimately depend on final closing prices, exchange rates and any proration that might occur, but as an
example, as of the date of the agreement in November, the terms of the partial share alternative, represented an
approximate 43% premium to SABMiller's share price on September 14, 2015.
For 2015, Altria delivered a total shareholder return of more than 23%, significantly outperforming both the S&P 500
and the Food, Beverage, and Tobacco Index. And, as a reminder, our total shareholder return was 29% in 2013, and
35% in 2014. So let's turn to the businesses that supported those results.
Our core tobacco companies delivered on their objectives by growing income and strengthening their market leadership
positions. The smokeable product segment had a very strong 2015, with double-digit income growth and Marlboros
fourth consecutive year of modest retail share growth, in line with its strategy.
Adjusted OCI grew nearly 11%, driven primarily by higher pricing, volume growth, and the benefit of the federal
tobacco quota buy-out expiration. Fourth quarter adjusted OCI growth was more modest, due primarily to trade
inventory movements and lapping the end of the quota buy-out payments. The segment also expanded adjusted OCI
margins in both periods with full-year margins of more than 46%.
Marlboro strengthened in 2015, gaining two-tenths of retail share in both the fourth quarter and the full year. In
November, PM USA expanded distribution of Marlboro Midnight Menthol nationally, offering adult menthol smokers
a bold, unique menthol flavor. While it's early, we expect Marlboro Midnight Menthol to build on the very positive
momentum we've seen from the Marlboro Black family, which now has grown for 20 consecutive quarters.
Higher cigar shipment volume contributed to the smokeable segment's performance in both periods. Middleton grew
Black and Mild's volume by over 5% in the quarter and nearly 4% for the year, continuing to build on the brand's
strength in the more profitable tipped segment.
In our smokeless product segment, USSTC once again delivered on its strategy to increase income by growing volume
and maintaining modest share momentum on Copenhagen and Skoal combined. Adjusted OCI grew more than 8% in
the fourth quarter and nearly 5% for the full year. For the full year, higher pricing more than offset higher promotional
spending and cost.
Copenhagen and Skoal increased their combined retail share by three-tenths for the year. We're pleased with
Copenhagen's continued strength, which grew nearly a full share point in 2015. Last year, Copenhagen was the fastest
growing smokeless brand in the category. And to build on this strength, USSTC is planning to expand Copenhagen

Mint nationally later this quarter. Copenhagen Mint will be available at a popular price, and USSTC will support its
expansion with a strong awareness and trial generating plan.
In innovative tobacco products, Nu Mark continued building a portfolio of tobacco products using its strong internal
capabilities and its partnership with Philip Morris International. In November, based on encouraging results from lead
markets, Nu Mark continued its disciplined expansion of MarkTen XL e-vapor products to additional select retail
chains. With respect to Heat-Not-Burn products, we continue to support PMI as it prepares for a 2016 product
application to the FDA for a modified risk tobacco product designation. And we look forward to discussing more about
our plans for U.S. commercialization at the appropriate time.
The wine business continued to perform well. Ste. Michelle grew OCI almost 4% in the fourth quarter, and more than
13% for the year. Ste. Michelle's premium wines continued to be recognized as leaders in the industry, garnering more
than 250 90-plus ratings in 2015, up nearly 40% from last year. So 2015 was an excellent year for our premium brands,
our company, and our shareholders.
Turning to 2016 and beyond, Altria is implementing a productivity initiative designed to maintain its operating
company's leadership and cost competitiveness. This initiative is expected to deliver approximately $300 million in
annual productivity savings by the end of 2017, and as a result of reinvesting some of those savings, strengthen our
business capability. The savings will come from reduced spending on certain SG&A infrastructure and a leaner
organization. Some of the productivity savings will be invested in important initiatives, such as brand building, harm
reduction, and regulatory capabilities. Continually challenging our cost structure and investing in the future remain
important for us, as we focus on delivering strong results for the long term.
As to guidance, in 2016, Altria expects to deliver full year adjusted diluted EPS in a range of $3.00 to $3.05,
representing growth of 7% to 9% from our 2015 adjusted diluted EPS base of $2.80. This guidance does not include
any impact from the proposed AB InBev and SABMiller business combination, as the transaction remains subject to
certain approvals, and the closing date has not yet been determined.
And now I'll turn things over to Billy for more detail on our performance.
William F. Gifford
Thanks, Marty, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with the smokeable products segment. The smokeable products
segment increased adjusted OCI margins by eight-tenths of a percentage point in the fourth quarter, to 44.7%, due
primarily to higher pricing. For the full year, adjusted OCI margins in the segment expanded 2.3 points to 46.4%, as
higher pricing and the expiration of the federal tobacco quota buy-out payments more than offset higher promotional
spending and higher cost.
PM USA's reported cigarette shipment volume in the fourth quarter declined about 2.5%, as elevated trade inventory
levels at the end of the third quarter moderated in the fourth quarter. For the full year, PM USA's reported cigarette
shipment volume increased 0.5%. When adjusted for trade inventory changes and other factors, PM USA estimates its
shipment volume increased 0.5% in both the fourth quarter and for the full year. PM USA estimates that total industry
cigarette volume was essentially unchanged in the fourth quarter, and decreased by half a percent for the full year. In
addition to retail share gains on Marlboro, L&M in the Discount gained share, allowing PM USA's total retail share to
reach 51.4% in the quarter, and 51.3% for 2013.
In the smokeless products segment, fourth quarter adjusted OCI margins expanded 1.4 percentage points to 61.4%,
driven by higher pricing, partially offset by higher promotional investments. For the year, adjusted OCI margins
expanded three-tenths of a percentage point to 63.7%, as higher pricing more than offset higher promotional
investments and higher costs. The smokeless segments reported shipments increased 4% in the fourth quarter, and 2.5%
for 2015. After adjusting for trade inventory movements and other factors, USSTC estimates that its volume grew 3%
in the fourth quarter, and 2.5% for the full year, while estimated smokeless industry volume grew 2.5% for the past six
months. For both time periods, Copenhagen volume growth was partially offset by declines for Skoal and other brands.

In wine, OCI margins narrowed by eight-tenths of a percentage point, to 24.8% in the fourth quarter, but expanded by
1.2 percentage points to 22.8% for the year. Reported shipment volumes grew 5.9% in the fourth quarter, and 6.2% for
the year.
Altria recorded reported equity earnings from our SABMiller investment of $211 million in the fourth quarter, and
$757 million for the year. Unfavorable foreign currency and special items were the primary drivers of the full year
2015 decline. In addition to the EPS guidance Marty provided for next year, we expect our full year 2016 effective tax
rate on operations to be 35.3%. Additionally, we forecast capital expenditures to be in the range of $140 million to
$180 million.
That wraps up our results. Marty and I will now take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll direct your
attention to altria.com, along with today's earnings release, for your reference, we've posted a list of quarterly metrics,
including pricing, inventory, and other housekeeping items.
Operator do we have any questions?
QUESTION-AND-ANSWER SECTION
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Investors, analysts and media representatives are now invited to participate in the
question-and-answer session. We will take questions from the investment community first. Our first question comes
from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Good morning.
<A - William F. Gifford>: Good morning, Bonnie.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: So my first question is regarding your cost savings program. I guess I was hoping you'd give
us a little more color on what some of the productivity initiatives are that you're going to be implementing. And then
what portion of the $300 million annualized savings will be reinvested, and how much if any could flow to the bottom
line? And then do you expect to realize any savings this year?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Let me make a comment about that, and then I'll ask Billy, perhaps to comment on the
detail. I think the degree of detail we're going to provide on the topic is in the release, Bonnie, as you can appreciate. I
think we've laid out there the areas that we're going to work on and certainly dimensionalize the amount of the
productivity savings that we expect to gain. But for competitive reasons, I don't want to lay out in any greater detail
where and what we're going to do with it. We do reference the fact that we have important initiatives that we're
investing in for our growth. As you know, we're investing in reduced harm products that requires regulatory capability
and we always invest in our brands. So I think that's the way to understand it, and as the year flows through, I think
you'll see more. Billy, do you want to comment about timing?
<A - William F. Gifford>: Yeah, I think the only thing I would add to that, Bonnie, is that we have incorporated those
savings that we expect in this year into our guidance of 7% to 9% that we provided earlier.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Okay, so there is some. You just spelled out that the $300 million would be reached up FY
2017, so I wanted to clarify that there is going to be some that you'll realize this year.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Okay.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Second question is on Menthol. I guess I was hoping you could give us a sense of how the
Menthol category performed in the quarter? And specifically how Marlboro Menthol performed.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Yes, the Menthol segment continues to grow moderately as you know, and we continue
to grow our share of the Menthol segment, where we're under indexed and have opportunities. So we're pretty pleased
with our Menthol performance.

<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: So overall Marlboro Menthol is taking share, or just, like you said, where it's under indexed
possibly in certain regions?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Yeah, what I've said is that the segment continues to grow modestly, and that we
continue to grow our share of it. And obviously Marlboro is a key way that we do that.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Okay. And then, Marty, if I may, just my final question is on...
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Sure.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: ...total tobacco consumption for the industry last year. Given the strong industry cigarette
volume, and then the decelerating smokers volume, do you have a sense of the underlying total tobacco consumption
when considering both of these categories, I guess for last year? And then how sustainable do you think the strong
underlying cigarette volume trends are? What are your expectations for industry cigarette volume in 2016?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Yeah, I'm familiar with the number for total tobacco volume, I think, from the last
government figures I've seen. But I haven't seen them, yet, for 2015, so I don't want to hazard a guess on that, although
obviously we know that the cigarette volume flattened because of the effects that we talked about in 2015. In terms of
cigarette volume, the long-term trend is 3% to 4%. Long-term trends tend to persist over the long term. We know that
2015 was a little bit different for a variety of factors. I think the question for 2016, Bonnie, is if you expect it to revert
back to historical levels, at what pace?
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Right.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: We continue to see a stronger adult tobacco consumer right now. So we'll have to see
what that pace is. But I think over time you would expect for it to return to long-term trend.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Okay, so if I'm hearing you correctly, 2016 may be above historical trends, but as the year
progresses, and maybe as we look out in the future, it would return to that minus three/minus four decline rate?.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Well, what I mean to say is that I think long-term trends tend to revert to the mean. The
long-term trend has been 3% to 4%. The pace at which it returns to 3% to 4% in 2016 and beyond I think is just hard to
estimate because of the anomaly of the 2015 factors.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Yeah, fair enough. Okay, thank you so much.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Okay, thanks for calling in.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Thank you, good morning.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Hi, Judy.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Just following up on Bonnie's question a little bit just in terms of, if you think about all the
positive macro drivers that helped the industry broadly in 2015, I just wanted to get your color just in terms of what do
you think and how do you think those macro drivers will play out in 2016 in the industry fundamentals compared to,
really, 2015?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Yeah, that's a good question, because I think you do have to distinguish the
year-over-year effect from what the status of the consumer is. We go into the year believing as a whole that the adult
tobacco consumer continues to feel better going into 2016 as they did in 2015. Obviously unemployment is down,
housing starts are up, the effect of gasoline prices, we see improved adult tobacco consumer confidence. Now, of
course that effect was felt in 2015, and we doubt that we're going to see the same effect as year-over-year to 2016, but I

think it's good news, I think, that we think that the adult tobacco consumer goes into 2016 with those positive feelings.
There's always changes that could happen in the macro environment. You see speculation in some quarters about
recession clouds looming. That obviously would change everything. But we go into the year feeling pretty good about
the adult tobacco consumer.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay. And then Marty just on the pricing environment, obviously that's been another positive
trend at the manufacturer level where we've seen a pretty healthy price increases in the past few quarters. If I look at the
price gap versus discount brands, it's still at one of the lowest levels in history. So, wanted to just get your perspective
on kind of more pricing upside opportunity, particularly as the adult tobacco consumers are in a relative healthy shape.
<A - William F. Gifford>: Yeah, our desire, as you know, is to continue to grow income in that segment while
maintaining modest share momentum on Marlboro. If you look at the net pricing for the year, Judy, it's almost 5%,
which is at the higher end of the historical range. I had occasion to go back and look at the four year average. It's about
4.25%. And so, that works. We are always mindful of the price gap, and there is competition in the industry. So, with
that kind of net pricing realization and attention to cost management, growing some share, and the diverse business
platform we have, we think that's kind of the Altria story, and we like the way that's been played out over the last
several years, where you've seen really consistent EPS growth at about 8%, through thick and thin. And we think that's
the model that we should stick with.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay. And just my last question's on the FET. So, obviously, we've seen a little bit of a pickup
in the second half. So, your outlook for 2016, in terms of the FET environment?
<A - William F. Gifford>: Yeah, we're always cautious at the beginning of the year. We saw more activity, actually,
last year, didn't we, than we had seen in the last previous years. We took eight, I think – if memory serves, we took
eight FET increases last year. So, there are always puts and takes with them. We know that there are going to be lots of
proposals. We have a very talented government affairs team which tries to advocate on behalf of our consumers. So,
we'll have to see as we go into the year.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Got it. Okay. Thank you.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Thanks for calling, Judy.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Good morning, Matt.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Marty, I wanted to ask a follow-up question on the productivity initiative. In the past
when you've had similar programs, usually it's been in response to a factor, like the FET increase, that necessitated
right-sizing the company to account for, I guess, a lower level of volumes. And volume trends have obviously been
very stable recently. So I guess, what precipitated the decision to implement a cost-savings program today, as opposed
to just incorporating some normal course charges into the P&L?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: It's our desire to grow our business for the long term and to reallocate our resources
against growth initiatives. I think that you always have to be mindful of costs over time. If you have opportunities to
improve in your infrastructure or to improve your organization and to invest those savings in your brands or in your
products for the future, or in the way you can go to the market, you should do that. And I think it's one of the reasons,
Matt, that Altria has been successful over decades. And while these programs are never easy to accomplish, that's how
you grow over time, and when you see Altria's growth over time, it's because we do these programs, often from
strength, and that is the case today. Our business is strong, but we believe we should invest in several of these
initiatives now. And that's the reason.

<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay. All right. Thanks, Marty.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Sure.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: And then just one additional question. Just on the smokeable segment margins. You
addressed this, to some extent. They were up here in the fourth quarter, but less so than we saw in the first nine months.
And you called out the lapping of the quota buy-out. But, just curious whether there were any other specific areas of the
business where you felt there was an opportunity to specifically reinvest here in the fourth quarter?
<A - William F. Gifford>: Yeah, Matt, I'll take that. Thanks for the question. I think when you look at margins in the
smokeable category, you really have to think about, there were two kind of primary factors. One we've talked about on
a regular basis, and that was the pension. Remember, we updated the mortality table at the end of last year, and that
gave us a bit of a drag on the expense side of that, as we went through the year. So that was still present. From an
equity standpoint, you saw us investing, we shared some of that at Investor Day, around some of the digital
innovations, some of the mobile couponing efforts that we had underway. Those would be the primary factors that I
would point out.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay. Thank you, Billy.

Your next question comes from the line of Owen Bennett of Nomura.
<Q - Owen M. Bennett>: Morning, guys.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Hi, Owen.
<Q - Owen M. Bennett>: Just one question. I just wanted to know, have you seen any real significant change in the
competitive dynamics over the last quarter? Obviously, with Reynolds putting into place and with the new contracts
now, and Imperial, obviously, now in the marketplace in a larger scale, just wondered if any of those competitive
dynamics have changed significantly? Thank you.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Owen, thanks for the question. I think the answer is nothing that we haven't
contemplated. The brands have some new owners, and owners talked about their plans about what to do with the
brands. At retail, we've fully contemplated that, but we haven't seen anything that I would call out as significant or
material.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery of CLSA.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: Good morning.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Hi, Michael.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: Just wanted to see if you could give a couple of clarifications on the cost savings. Two in
particular: one, you call out the $90 million savings on the pension. That's completely unrelated to the productivity
initiative. Is that correct?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: That's correct, Michael.

<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: And then just second, a little bit of a follow-up on Bonnie's question, I realize there's
competitive sensitivity, and so nothing obviously too detailed but just compared to the program from about three or
four years ago, I guess a little question on semantics. You referred to that as a cost-savings program, I think. Here,
[indiscernible] (26:23) the word productivity, which sounds a little more like ordinary type efforts. Is there any
difference in terms of very broadly how you think about these two initiatives or is it just a revisit of ordinarily – things
that you can do periodically to update your cost base and the words and semantics aren't meaningful? How should we
think about them just at a very high level this versus the last program.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Well, I think the way to think about it is, you constantly want to look at your resources.
You want to make sure that they're allocated to the best possible way. If you can find productivity to invest in your
growth areas while becoming more efficient in other areas, you should do that for the long-term health of the business.
That's how we think about productivity. And we do it all the time, but from time-to-time, we have opportunities to take
bigger steps and we're going to be implementing this productivity initiative over 2016 and 2017 so that we can invest in
some of these important initiatives that we've identified in the release.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then just one more, looking at the vapor business and
some of your investments there, obviously that category has slowed pretty considerably. How do you think about the
level of investment that's appropriate there, going forward?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: With discipline. I think you have to – you really do. I mean, you have to be disciplined
about it. The category is a very interesting emerging category. We know that there is consumer interest, so you want to
have products there and you want to be investing, and you want to be learning, but you always want to do that with
discipline, because we're trying to do it within the guidance that we're trying to provide about how we're growing all of
our businesses long-term. And I think we've done a better job with that with MarkTen recently, and especially with
MarkTen XL. It's a better product, Michael. It's been very well received by the consumer. We're getting good results in
our lead markets, and so we're rolling out and expanding with discipline and trying to spend appropriately, but not
overspending.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: Okay. Thank you, that's helpful.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Thanks for calling in.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel.
<Q - Christopher Growe>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Hi, Chris.
<Q - Christopher Growe>: Hi. I just had a question for you if I could on just understand the trade inventory
movements. We knew those were coming. They were a little larger than I expected, and just to get a sense of how you
exit the year and where inventory levels are. I guess, maybe, related to that, with volumes being so strong throughout
2015, inventory levels as we exit the year, I'd be surprised if they were lower. Is there any reason why those need to be
up a little bit from where they are, even versus the prior year, given the strength in volume throughout the year.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Yeah, good question. Listen, they go up and they go down for us, but they usually wash
out over the year, as you know, and I think that's what happened in 2015. When we look at wholesale inventory, we
really don't see anything remarkable in comparing year-end 2015 against year-end 2014. As a matter of fact, if you
refer, I think, Chris to the sheet that we provide, you see the numbers are about spot on. You did see some depletion
during the fourth quarter, which we predicted, I think, in the third quarter call. But honestly, I think as we go into 2016,
we just don't see anything remarkable, and as I mentioned earlier, we'll have to see how the volume plays out
throughout the year.

<Q - Christopher Growe>: Okay, and then, I just want to understand – I don't know if you've given this, yet. I didn't
hear it, but just the contribution to profitability from SAB in 2016, from that – and I know we'll assume it doesn't
change, and the ABI deal doesn't occur, we know there's a currency drag, so just trying to get a sense of: do you expect
it to be a contributor to profitability in the year?
<A - William F. Gifford>: Hey, Chris, this is Billy. Thanks for the question. When you think about SAB, it is always a
contributor to profitability, right? We have earnings that flow through to them. As far as whether it is going to be larger
or smaller than last year, we don't go to that level of detail. Know that, from a currency standpoint, we looked at how
currency impacted us in 2015. We incorporate that into our guidance for 2016. So, we feel comfortable with what we
have in. So, yeah, it will be a contributor to profitability.
<Q - Christopher Growe>: Okay. Thank you for the time.

Your next question comes from the line of Steven Marascia of Capitol Securities Management.
<Q - Steven F. Marascia>: Good morning, gentlemen. A couple of quick questions. Number one, have your retail
chains given you any kind of idea whether the expected e-cig sales growth has been going according to expectations?
Or have you had to adjust your expectation levels? And, secondly, if you could, I forgot what the schedule was, but
when you guys expect the Feds will come out with some type of new regulations of the e-cig market?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Yeah, let me take the second one first. Thanks for those. As you know, FDA has been
working on esteeming regulations. It is our understanding that they are over at OMB. And that the process is now
between OMB and FDA. And they have not said when they expect to announce. They had said that they expected it to
be in 2015, but of course we're now in 2016 and that hasn't happened. So, I'm afraid I can't give you much more color
than that. The process is little opaque. I want to make sure I understand the question you had about retail. If you're
asking about our product, MarkTen XL and our lead markets, our retailers are very excited about that product. It's been
selling very well and it's got a very good response. I couldn't quite tell if that's what you're asking about or if you're
asking something more general.
<Q - Steven F. Marascia>: More general in terms of the overall e-cig market.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Yeah, well, it's slowed a little bit. It had very meteoric, as a category, growth when it
first came out. It was up over 100% year-over-year. And then 50% the year after that. And then last year, we estimated
the category growth in dollar sales was about 25%, but a lot of that was in the first half, as it slowed in the second. So
the category growth has slowed down, but it still remains interesting to adult tobacco consumers, and interesting
enough for us to want to compete there.
<Q - Steven F. Marascia>: Okay. Thank you very much.

given the fact that there may be some gains. How do you look at that process? What do you do or do not?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Sure, thanks for the question. Look, we're always assessing both marketplace conditions
and where we stand from an overall capital position within our company. We feel very comfortable with where we're
at. But we're always assess the marketplace for opportunities to take advantage of. And, to your point, we took
advantage of some of that in the beginning of the year, with a debt tender that we did in the first quarter of 2015. So, we
assess it overall, what are the cash needs of the business, and what are the marketplace conditions, when we make those
decisions.

We will now open the call for questions from the media. Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi of RBC
Capital Markets.
<Q - Nikhil Nichani>: Hey. This is actually Nikhil Nichani on Nik Modi's behalf. Just one quick question. If the
ABI-SAB deal does close and you guys do get some incremental benefits from that deal, how are you thinking about
that, in terms of letting that drop to the bottom line or reinvesting into the business? And if you do choose to reinvest
some of those, what would be the priorities? Thank you.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Well, I can appreciate the question. But you can appreciate that I can't tell you that right
now. We don't even have a closing date for the transaction. We're not sure when it's going to close. So you just forgive
me, I don't want to get ahead of those parties' transaction by speculating about the benefit to us. As you know, we think
it's a very attractive transaction, and we think that the combined company is going to be a terrific company, and we're
really pleased to be able to participate in the company going forward. But I don't want to get into any more detail on
that at this time, if you'll allow me. Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen and Company.
<Q - Vivien Azer>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Hi, Vivien.
<Q - Vivien Azer>: So, I know you don't like to talk about Marlboro's subfamilies in a great amount of detail, but
Marty, given the significant transformation that has gone on with Marlboro, in particular with the introduction of Black,
is it at all possible, at least, to kind of dimensionalize the sizing of the different brand families as they contribute to total
Marlboro?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: No, I guess is the answer. I know you try on this, but it's just competitively sensitive
about how we do this, and I think what's more – I don't mean to be cavalier like that, I just mean that, what we really
want to look at is the overall dimensions of Marlboro. How is it doing across all of the families? How is it doing from a
total equity point of view? How is it doing in terms of the price gap it can command? And so forth and so on. And I
know you know all that, so I won't repeat it. Marlboro is doing exactly what we want it to do. And you look at
Marlboro Black, it has just added a whole new dimension, for example, to the brand. It's staying relevant to the current
cohort of adult tobacco consumers. It commands nice price premiums. So, Marlboro's great, but we're just not going to

break it out at that level. I hope you'll indulge me on that.
<Q - Vivien Azer>: Can't blame me for trying, but I absolutely appreciate that.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: No, I don't. I don't blame you.
<Q - Vivien Azer>: No problem. From a regulatory standpoint, it seems like we've seen a bit of an uptick in terms of
activity around raising the minimum purchase age for tobacco products to 21, some with success, like Hawaii, some
not, New Jersey. I was hoping you could comment, kind of high level, how you see that type of regulatory activity
evolving?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Yes, I can. Our position, to begin with is, of course there should be minimum age laws.
And we were the company that went around and lead the effort on that, to make sure that there were minimum age laws
in place everywhere and that they were vigorously enforced. And we spent an awful lot of time and energy and
resources on that, which was completely appropriate. And we support that. We support a minimum age of 18, and if
you look at the reference points, the overwhelming majority of the States use 18. The Master Settlement Agreement
from the 1990s used 18. And when we passed the FDA bill, it was 18. And further, the FDA bill contemplated a
process to study whether the age should be raised, and they gave that task to FDA. FDA is now doing that. And our
view on that is they should let FDA do that job, and send a report over to Congress, and then we can have an intelligent
debate about whether the age should be raised or not. But this sort of ad hoc approach of locality here or State there,
doesn't seem to make good public policy sense to us. So we believe in 18, and we also support the process that was in
place from the [ph] statute (37:43) to study the issue.
<Q - Vivien Azer>: Super helpful. Thank you. My last question, just any comments on Green Smoke after the tests in
2015?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: They're encouraging. We really, I think. have improved the Green Smoke platform. We
have it in a number of retail stores. As you know, it's been very well received. It continues to be the leader in the
eCommerce space. And so we're working on that brand portfolio strategy now, but we're very glad to have Green
Smoke in the portfolio. And obviously the company has helped us from a supply chain point of view immensely.
<Q - Vivien Azer>: Terrific. Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Tripp Mickle of Wall Street Journal.
<Q - Tripp Mickle>: Hey, Marty. I know you declined to provide some clarity on the productivity initiative earlier
when Bonnie asked about it, but looking at that term, leaner organizational structure, could be interpreted as layoffs?
What do you mean by that? And will there be layoffs? If so, how many jobs will be eliminated?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Yeah, let me begin by saying thanks for calling in, by saying that, we're going to speak
with our organization later this morning, and I hope you can appreciate that I want to speak to our organization about
our plans here before I do in a public venue. So you'll have to indulge me a bit on that. But yes, we intend to have a
leaner organization. What lean typically means, it means in this case, is we want to have an organization that has fewer
layers, and we have broader spans of control in our managerial ranks. And if we can work towards those ends, and we
can reinvest those savings in our growth initiatives, we should do that. It may be that we can give your more
information later in the day after I've spoken to the organization, but I don't want to get ahead of it on the call.
<Q - Tripp Mickle>: Okay. Thanks.
