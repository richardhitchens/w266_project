MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to Accenture's fourth quarter fiscal 2015 earnings
conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer
session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations, Ms. KC
McClure. Please go ahead.
KC McClure
Thank you, Greg, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today on our fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2015 earnings
announcement. As Greg just mentioned, I'm KC McClure, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations. With me
today are Pierre Nanterme, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and David Rowland, our Chief Financial
Officer. We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago.
Let me quickly outline the agenda for today's call. Pierre will begin with an overview of our results. David will take
you through the financial details included in the income statement and balance sheet along with some key operational
metrics for both the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year. Pierre will then provide a brief update on our market
positioning before David provides our business outlook for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2016. We will then take
your questions before Pierre provides a wrap-up at the end of the call.
As a reminder, when we discuss revenues during today's call, we're talking about revenues before reimbursements or
net revenues. Some of the matters we'll discuss on this call, including our business outlook, are forward looking and, as
such, are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, risk factors set forth in
today's news release and discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other

SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in this
call.
During our call today we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful
information for investors. We include reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures, where appropriate, to GAAP in
our news release or in the Investor Relations section of our website, accenture.com. As always, Accenture assumes no
obligation to update the information presented on this conference call.
Now let me turn the call over to Pierre.
Pierre Nanterme
Thank you, KC, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today.
We are extremely pleased with our very strong financial results for both the fourth quarter and full fiscal year. Our
excellent fourth quarter performance continues the momentum we have been building in our business all year. For the
full year, we delivered strong new bookings, generated record revenues, grew EPS faster than revenues and generated
strong free cash flow, all while continuing to invest in our business and delivering significant value for clients and
shareholders.
Here are a few highlights for the year. We delivered very strong new bookings of $34.4 billion. We grew revenues 11%
in local currency to a record $31 billion. Our growth was broad-based across the business, including double-digit
growth in four of our five operating groups and all three geographic regions.
We delivered earnings per share of $4.82 on an adjusted basis, a 7% increase. We expanded operating margin 20 basis
points to 14.5% on an adjusted basis. We generated free cash flow of $3.7 billion. We returned $3.8 billion in cash to
shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. And we just announced a semi-annual cash dividend of $1.10
per share, an 8% percent increase over our prior dividend.
So I feel very good about what we delivered in fiscal year 2015. Our outstanding performance clearly demonstrate that
we continue to provide highly relevant and differentiated services to our clients.
Now let me hand over to David. David, over to you.
David P. Rowland
Thank you, Pierre, and thanks to all of you for joining us on today's call.
Let me start by saying that we were very pleased with our overall results in quarter four, which culminated an
extremely strong year for Accenture. Once again, our results reflect our unique position in the marketplace, the
relevance of our growth strategy and our ability to drive our business to produce value for our clients, our people and
our shareholders.
As you listen to our prepared remarks, you'll hear continued consistency in the key business drivers and three
overriding themes: durability of revenue growth, sustainable margin expansion, and strong cash flow with disciplined
capital allocation.
Before getting into the details, I'd like to emphasize a few highlights in each of these areas. Revenue momentum
continued with very strong local currency growth of 12% even against our toughest quarterly compare of the year. A
key characteristic was our balanced growth across our operating groups, our geographic regions and our five businesses
which speaks to the durability of our growth strategy. Our rate of growth continued to outpace the market as we gained
share in most dimensions of our business.

Driving profitable growth with sustainable margin expansion continues to be our focus. In the fourth quarter, our
operating margin came in as expected and consistent with last year. For the full year, we delivered 20 basis points of
margin expansion on an adjusted basis while investing significantly to position our business for long-term market
leadership. And finally, we delivered another quarter of strong cash flow, $1.4 billion in free cash flow to be specific.
In terms of capital allocation, it's noteworthy that we closed 11 acquisitions in the quarter, giving us 18 acquisitions for
the full year with invested capital of $800 million providing us with scale and capabilities in key growth areas. So we
finished the year much like we started, with strong broad-based growth underpinned by very good profitability and cash
flows.
With those summary comments, let me now turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings. New bookings
were $8.8 billion for the quarter. Consulting bookings were $4.1 billion, reflecting a book-to-bill of 1.0. Outsourcing
bookings were $4.7 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.3. We're very pleased with the volume of bookings for the quarter,
especially considering the FX headwind which we estimate to be 13% in the quarter.
The overall demand for our services remains robust, with the strongest quarterly bookings growth coming from
Operations, Products, Europe and the growth markets. Across the board, digital-related services continued to be an
important driver of our new bookings. We also had 10 clients with bookings in excess of $100 million, bringing the
total for the year to 43, which again signifies the unique relationship that we have with many of the largest companies
in the world.
Turning to revenues, net revenues for the quarter were $7.9 billion, a 1% increase in USD and 12% in local currency,
reflecting a negative 10% foreign exchange impact consistent with the assumption we provided in June. Consulting
revenues for the quarter were $4.2 billion, up 4% in USD and 14% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues were $3.7
billion, down 1% in USD and an increase of 9% in local currency.
The overriding theme in quarter four continued to be broad-based and balanced growth across our operating groups and
geographic regions, and we're pleased with revenue performance across all of our business dimensions with the
dominant drivers continuing to be strong double-digit growth in digital-related services and Operations. But we were
also very pleased with our growth in Application Services and the combined growth for Strategy and Consulting.
Taking a closer look at our operating groups, Communications, Media & Technology lead all operating groups with
16% growth, the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Broad-based growth continued with double-digit
growth across all three industries and all in three geographic areas.
Financial Services delivered their strongest growth of the year, 14%, fueled by double-digit growth in all three
industries and in both Europe and the growth markets. H&PS continued their trend of double-digit growth, posting 13%
in the quarter. The strength of our H&PS business continues to be very strong growth in both health and public service
in North America.
Products grew by 10%, led by consumer goods and services, life sciences, and automotive, with very strong growth in
Europe and the growth markets. And finally, Resources continued to deliver very consistent growth of 6% in the
quarter, with positive growth in all three geographic regions and in all industries except energy.
Moving down the income statement, gross margin for the quarter was 31.7%, consistent with the same period last year.
Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 11.7% of net revenues, down 10 basis points. General and
administrative expense was 6.2% of net revenues, up 10 basis points. Operating margin was $1.1 billion in the fourth
quarter, reflecting a 13.9% operating margin, consistent with quarter four last year.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.1% compared with an effective tax rate of 30.1% in the fourth quarter last
year. Net income was $788 million for the fourth quarter compared with net income of $760 million for the same
quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share were $1.15 compared with EPS of $1.08 in the fourth quarter last year.
This reflects a 6% year-over-year increase.
Turning to DSOs, our days services outstanding continue to be industry-leading. They were 37 days, consistent with
last quarter. Our free cash flow for the quarter was $1.4 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of

$1.5 billion net of property and equipment additions of $148 million.
Moving to our level of cash, our cash balance at August 31 was $4.4 billion compared with $4.9 billion at August 31
last year, down roughly $500 million, as we returned $3.8 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends in
fiscal 2015.
Turning to some other key operational metrics, we continue to attract significant talent, hiring more than 100,000
people in fiscal 2015, ending the year with a global head count of over 358,000 people. We now have approximately
257,000 people in our global delivery network. In quarter four, our utilization was 90%, consistent with last quarter.
Attrition, which excludes involuntary terminations, was 14% compared to 15% in quarter three and in the same period
last year.
With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the fourth quarter we repurchased or redeemed
6.6 million shares for $664 million at an average price of $100.03 per share. For the full year we repurchased or
redeemed 27.4 million shares for approximately $2.5 billion at an average price of $89.52 per share.
This week our Board of Directors approved $5 billion of additional share repurchase authority, bringing the total to
$7.6 billion. And as Pierre mentioned, our Board of Directors declared a semiannual cash dividend of $1.10 per share.
This dividend will be paid on November 13 and represents an $0.08 per share or 8% increase over the previous
semiannual dividend we declared in March.
So before I turn it to back over to Pierre, let me just briefly summarize where we landed for the full year across the key
elements of our original business outlook provided last September. I'm pleased to say that we successfully managed our
business and delivered on every metric in our original outlook. New bookings for the full year landed at $34.4 billion,
which was just above the upper end of our guided range when adjusted for the actual FX impact. Net revenues grew
11% for the year in local currency, above the top end of the guided range that we provided at the beginning of the year.
Operating margin on an adjusted basis was 14.5%, reflecting 20 basis points of expansion, the midpoint of the guided
range. Diluted earnings per share on an adjusted basis were $4.82, which was above the upper end of our original
guided range when adjusted for the actual FX impact. Free cash flow was $3.7 billion, in the middle of our original
guided range even with a much higher FX headwind.
And finally, we returned $3.8 billion of cash to shareholders, right at our initial objective, through $1.4 billion in
dividends and $2.5 billion in share repurchases. In addition, we reduced our weighted average diluted shares
outstanding by 2%.
So again, we had an extremely strong year by any measure. We're very pleased with the progress we've made in
executing our growth strategy and especially as it relates to the accelerated rotation of our business to digital-related
services. Overall, our results demonstrate the durability of our growth, profitability and cash flows, and our ability to
manage our business to deliver value for all of our stakeholders.
With that, let me turn it back to Pierre.
Pierre Nanterme
Thank you, David.
Our excellent results for the year reflect the successful execution of our strategy across the different dimensions of our
business. We are making focused investments in high-growth areas, including more than $2.5 billion (sic) [including
$2.5 billion] in acquisitions over the last three years. These investments are all about building new capabilities to
further differentiate Accenture in the marketplace.
At the same time, we have aligned our organization around five businesses, Accenture Strategy, Accenture Consulting,
Accenture Digital, Accenture Technology, and Accenture Operations, all highly competitive in their own right and
synergistic in delivering end-to-end outcomes for our clients.

In particular, the new innovative services we have created in Accenture Digital and Accenture Operations have
contributed significantly to our growth. In Accenture Digital, we are working with our clients to help them create
competitive advantage and tap into new sources of value. In Accenture Analytics, we are using our new Accenture
Insights platform to help Thames Water in the UK embrace the Internet of Things to transform decision-making.
Our new cloud-based solution monitors and analyzes data in real-time from more than 20,000 centers. And with data
virtualization tools, managers can proactively respond to risk on the network. And we are helping one of the largest
banks in the Eurozone implement a major digital transformation. We are combining our design capabilities from Fjord,
which we acquired two years ago, with our analytics capabilities to create a new and seamless multichannel customer
experience while also driving significant operating efficiencies.
In Accenture Operations, we have strong momentum across our infrastructure, business process, security and cloud
services. In procurement, we continue to lead the market building on the capabilities we acquired with Procurian. Let
me share two examples. We are helping Glencore Queensland, a division of the global mining company, to enhance its
competitiveness. With our category management expertise and cloud-based sourcing, we expect to achieve total cost
savings of more than $300 million.
We are helping TNT, the express delivery company, to reduce cost and focus on its core business. Leveraging our
procurement and finance and accounting capabilities, we expect to drive annual cost savings of more than $100 million.
And when you look across our entire business, only Accenture has the full range of capabilities to integrate and deliver
end-to-end services in an industry context to drive transformation and mission-critical outcomes for all clients.
A great example is the work we're doing with Mondelnz, the global food and beverage company, to drive growth,
increase profitability and reduce costs. We started this program with Accenture Strategy and our zero-based budgeting
approach and are now leveraging our business process capabilities in Accenture Operations. We expect to deliver total
savings of more than $1 billion over three years.
And we continue to invest to further differentiate our capabilities taking a first mover position and investing ahead of
the curve in fast growing areas such as cloud and security. Last week, we announced acquisition of Cloud Sherpas, a
global leader in cloud advisory and technology services specializing in Salesforce, ServiceNow and Google. The
addition of 1,100 professionals from Cloud Sherpas will further strengthen our position as the leading enterprise cloud
services provider.
And last month we acquired FusionX, a leader in the emerging field of cybersecurity. FusionX's elite team of
cybersecurity experts works at the C-suite level to help clients test security and see their vulnerabilities through actual
replica attacks. This acquisition brings to Accenture the critical ability to help our clients assess and respond to
sophisticated cyber attacks.
Turning to the geographic dimension of our business, I'm delighted that in fiscal year 2015, we delivered double-digit
revenue growth in local currency in each of our three geographic regions. And we achieved this result despite the
global economic environment that remains sluggish and a geopolitical environment that is quite concerning.
In North America, we delivered 13% revenue growth for the year in the United States, where we have now delivered
double-digit growth in four of the last five years. We have gained significant market share in the U.S. and are now
positioned as the market leader.
In Europe, we grew revenues 10% in local currency for the year driven primarily by Germany, the United Kingdom,
Spain, the Netherlands, Italy and France. And in growth markets, we delivered revenue growth of 11% in local
currency for the year, driven primarily by strong double-digit growth in both Japan and Brazil with high single-digit
growth in Australia.
So, in closing, we created very strong momentum in our business in fiscal year 2015 by leveraging the investment
we've made and by accelerating our rotation to new high-growth areas. And I'm especially pleased with our
performance in digital-related services, which grew approximately 35% for the year to more than $7 billion. With the

relevant and differentiated capabilities we have built, along with the continued disciplined management of our business,
I am confident in our ability to continue to deliver sustainable profitable growth.
With that, I will turn the call over to David to provide our business outlook for fiscal year 2016. David.
David P. Rowland
Thank you, Pierre.
Let me now turn to our business outlook. Starting with the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect revenues to be in the
range of $7.7 billion to $7.95 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be a negative 8.5% compared to the first
quarter of fiscal 2015 and reflects an estimated 6% to 9% growth in local currency.
For the full fiscal year 2016, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we currently assume
the impact of FX on our results in USD will be negative 4% compared to fiscal 2015. For the full fiscal 2016, we
expect that revenues to be in the range of 5% to 8% growth in local currency over fiscal 2015. For operating margin,
we expect the fiscal year 2016 to be 14.6% to 14.8%, a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over adjusted fiscal 2015 results.
We expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 25% to 26%. For earnings per share we expect full year
diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2016 to be in the range of $5.09 to $5.24 or 69% growth over adjusted fiscal 2015
results.
Turning to cash flow, for the full fiscal 2016, we expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $4.1 billion to $4.4
billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $500 million, and free cash flow to be in the range of
$3.6 billion to $3.9 billion.
We expect to return at least $4 billion through dividends and share repurchases and also expect to reduce the weighted
average diluted shares outstanding by just under 2% as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of our
cash to shareholders.
Finally, you may have noticed that I did not provide new bookings guidance for fiscal 2016. Each year we evaluate our
guidance approach to ensure that we're providing appropriate visibility to our expected results. Starting this year, we'll
no longer provide new bookings guidance as we believe that it is not the best indicator of future revenue performance
and has created confusion in recent years. We'll continue to report actual new bookings results each quarter.
With that, let's open it so that we can take your questions. KC?
KC McClure
Thanks, David. I would ask that you each keep to one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as
possible to ask a question. Greg, would you provide instructions for those on the call, please?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please
go ahead.
<Q - Tien-tsin Huang>: Thanks, good morning, good revenue growth yet again. I just wanted to ask I guess just in
hindsight here, you guys did 11% revenue growth in fiscal 2015. I think your initial expectation was 4% to 7%. What
drove the upside versus initial expectations? Just trying to gauge what was strong versus conservatism and sort of how
that may have reflected in this year's guidance.

<A - David P. Rowland>: I think just reflecting on 2015, and Pierre I'm sure will have reflections as well, the first
thing I would start off with is the fact that, while we were confident that we were well positioned for a very attractive
market in the digital space, frankly, it's hard, and I'm sure you can appreciate this, Tien-tsin, it would have been hard to
bank on and predict 35% growth in our digital-related services business. So that clearly was part of the driver.
I think secondly, while we also felt very confident in our Operations business which is truly distinctive in the
marketplace, no doubt about that, the growth rate was higher. We knew it would be strong, but it came in even stronger
than we expected.
When I reflect on the operating groups, and you may remember – and I won't recount what I said or recap what I said
when we started the year, but I had laid out a view of how we thought the operating groups would emerge. I mean,
clearly, when you look at CMT's growth for the year, as proud as we are of that growth, frankly, it would have been
tough to predict that level of growth, double-digit growth in all industries and in all three geographic markets. That is
kind of a trifecta of stars aligning.
On the other end of the spectrum, not to go through every operating group, we were comfortable with our return to
growth in Resources, but yet there was still some risk, as we highlighted. And at the end of the day, congratulations to
our Resources team again that they reconnected with growth and sustained very solid growth.
And then I think across the patch, when we talk about consulting in our traditional type of work way, which in our new
way of looking at the business includes Strategy, Consulting and part of Application Services related to application
development within App Services, that part of our business was very strong in 2015 and exceeded our expectations.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yeah, I mean, not much to add. I think it clearly, to summarize, we overachieved in three
areas mainly. CMT, Digital business and Operations, in Accenture Operations, significantly more than we expected.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yes.
<Q - Tien-tsin Huang>: No, that's helpful to hear. I guess as my follow-up, I'll ask just on this year's guidance. Just
how much is coming from acquisitions? I know you've got Navitaire coming up as well, and can you give us any sort of
range on what digital growth might look like in 2016? Thank you.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Just working backwards, Tien-tsin, I'll give you a view on digital growth as well as our
dimensional growth. I'm going to give that to you at IA Day as we're still working through our view on that. Just to
your other question, I'll start with 2015. Our inorganic contribution signaled last quarter was in the range of 1% to
1.5%. Our actual inorganic came in roughly at the midpoint of that range. The point being that when you look at our
11% growth for the year, the organic growth was obviously substantial.
As we look forward to 2016, we are very proud of the success that we've had in the market with our acquisition activity
in the last two quarters in particular. We also have four acquisitions. Pierre mentioned Cloud Sherpas which had been
announced but not yet closed. But if you take what we've closed in the four that have been announced not yet closed,
we would estimate that our inorganic would be, let's say, approaching the range, in the range of about 2%. And of
course, that can change depending on the timing of when these four deals, Cloud Sherpas in particular, ultimately gets
closed. But we would be in that range, so it would be a click up.
<Q - Tien-tsin Huang>: That's great. See you at IA Day. Thanks.
<A - David P. Rowland>: All right. Thank you, Tien-tsin.

<Q - Ashwin Shirvaikar>: Good morning. How are you, guys? So I guess my first question is clearly we appreciate
the acquisitions that you have made over the last few years. We actually wrote about it recently. But is there a flipside
to it? Can you talk about the growth rate that you're seeing on your traditional businesses? What sort of impact are you
seeing from ERP slowdown, from the flipside of cloud, things like that? Because clearly, you have a portion of your
revenues growing really fast in digital. You're handling that transition very well, but the flipside is bringing down your
overall growth rate, right?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Let me just – Ashwin, let me just mention two things, and then Pierre will want to round
this out just in terms of the factual context. Again, I want to point out that the year we just closed, our organic growth
would have been about 9.5% roughly. So the organic part of our business, that machine was hitting on all cylinders in
2015 and was a real testament to the power of our growth strategy and this evolution of Accenture to focusing on our
five businesses that we've talked about, leveraging the very distinctive channel that we have through our operating
groups in our largest geographic markets. So just that factual point, our organic growth machine is hitting on all
cylinders.
You mentioned ERP. I'll go ahead and put this out there that the ERP business, we've always said that ERP goes
through cycles. But yet at the end of the day, it's an attractive business. Our ERP business did stabilize in 2015. It
actually grew slightly. Now as a percentage of our total revenue, it's actually gotten – it's come down a click in terms of
what it represents of Accenture's business because the non-ERP is growing significantly, but nonetheless the ERP story
is not a bad story. I'll just pass it over to Pierre.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Just to probably just only reconfirm the element of our acquisition strategy, we are doing
acquisitions for three reasons. The first one is to accelerate access to capabilities in the new and what we are calling the
new at Accenture is now the combination of digital services, cloud services, security services, or new technologies, if
you will, such as cognitive computing, automation, or artificial intelligence.
Second is to have access to very deep industry expertise, especially in consulting. That is the rationale for acquisition of
Axia, Javelin Company' consulting deep structure, iTRAK, either deep industry expertise in upstream energy, in retail.
That's the reason. That's number two.
And the number three would be to scale faster to take the leadership position in the marketplace. And by leadership, we
mean the number one. I'm thinking about Procurian. I'm thinking about Cloud Sherpas. I would put in that category
scale to lead, putting more distance between Accenture and the competition, three reasons why we are doing the
acquisition.
And then we grew organic on top of these acquisitions. Probably one of the best cases coming in my mind would be
Procurian. We made the acquisition of Procurian. We became the number one in procurement services. And since we
made this acquisition, we've been scaling faster and now we are the market leader, and the organic growth of our
procurement services is even higher than the business case we set.
<Q - Ashwin Shirvaikar>: Absolutely. No, I understand that, and actually fairly consistent with what we've written
recently. The second question is I want to ask about free cash flow growth in terms of the guidance. Looking at the
lower end is negative. The upper end is 5% at the upper end, which is a tad slower than your EPS growth. Can you go
through the puts and takes with regards to free cash flow growth going forward, how you think about it? Clearly, it's at
an impressive absolute level, but I just want to understand how you're thinking of the translation from revenues to
profits to cash.
<A - David P. Rowland>: First of all, I would encourage you and others to look at the absolute amount because the
absolute amount, as you referenced – I'll use my word – but your thought I hope is that it's outstanding. Our operating
cash flow, our free cash flow exceeds net income, which I think is a standard for any company which is indicative of
outstanding cash flow. And we're in the range – across our range, we're in the range of, let's say, a rounded 1.1 times of
free cash flow to net income. And so the absolute number is very, very strong.

As we talked about before, there are many puts and takes in our cash flow in any particular year. Changes in DSO is an
example. We have allowed for the possibility – not that this is what we're trying to drive our teams to, but we've
allowed for the possibility of a slight uptick in DSOs. You also noticed that we have allowed for further CapEx
spending, which is part of the increase. And beyond that, there are differences in timings. For example, tax cash
payments can be very different on one year – from one year to the next. So there are many swings but what I would
encourage you to focus on is the absolute cash flow which exceeds net income and is a great indicator of a strong cash
generating company.
<Q - Ashwin Shirvaikar>: Okay, thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller from Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Darrin D. Peller>: Thanks, guys. Listen, we heard some commentary around Brazil and some of the emerging
markets growing well. I guess when we think of your guidance and obviously there is a deceleration partly due to just
tougher comps but I imagine some conservatism as well. But, I guess, on top of that, I mean, how much is your
expectation for Brazil or China or maybe even Russia or some of the other emerging markets that we've seen some
slower trends in having an impact on your model? I guess, I'm not quite sure we ever heard a contribution to your
revenue from China or Brazil to be honest.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yeah, so if you look at it, indeed, we had a good year in some of these markets, overall our
growth markets, double-digit growth if you look at all the growth markets. But again, you've seen in these growth
markets, some of mature markets remains, I'm thinking about Japan and Australia. Indeed, we had a very good
performance of Brazil last year on back of some very good programs in Accenture Operations and our BPO business,
as well in launching innovative services, especially around mortgage as a service on back of a small acquisition we
made a few years ago called Vivere and our digital rotation as well which is happening in Brazil. Likewise, it's
happening in other places. That being said, we are looking at the market as you do. We understand that the global
economic conditions in Brazil are deteriorating at some pace and it has been factored in our plan.
<Q - Darrin D. Peller>: Okay. Have you ever given any disclosure on how much of a contribution Brazil or China
might be to your business?
<A - David P. Rowland>: We have given that disclosure. I guess we shared the revenue number for Brazil.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Brazil is about $1 billion.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yes.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: More than $1 billion. It's about $1 billion for Accenture. So again, it's significant.
<Q - Darrin D. Peller>: And China?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: It's not something that will be over significant. And in China, we are around $0.5 billion.
<Q - Darrin D. Peller>: Okay. That's helpful, guys. And just last follow-up question on the digital side again, growth
of 35% obviously very impressive.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Both trending to...
<A - David P. Rowland>: China, we are about in the range of $300 million in that range so about 1% of Accenture.
<Q - Darrin D. Peller>: Okay, so...
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: He is always optimistic.

<Q - Darrin D. Peller>: Okay, very helpful. Just one quick follow-up on the digital side again, the 35% growth rate,
again, very impressive. It seems like there's enough demand out there for even off a larger base that that kind of trend
to continue. I know you said to Tien-tsin before that, wait for IA Day but, I mean, it seems like it – could it be fair to
assume that you can have at least something similar or very, very strong double-digit growth once again this year?
<A - David P. Rowland>: I think that we think in terms of continued strong double-digit growth. 35% is a big number.
And for planning purposes, we consider the scale of the business but 35% is a big number and I don't know that we
would assume that for planning purposes not that we wouldn't strive for it.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: We will plan for double digit.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Certainly for double digit.

Your next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman from Bank of Montréal. Please go ahead.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Hi, thank you very much. I wanted to ask about pricing. Recently, Cognizant called out,
who's normally a fairly deliberate and conservative company, that pricing pressure has increased in a part of their
business. And while I understand that there is a perfect overlap in competitive areas between yourself and an
Indian-based player like Cognizant, I did want to hear what you're seeing in the pricing environment across the breadth
of the business particularly in the application maintenance and application development world specifically?
<A - David P. Rowland>: I would say that you may remember it was in the second – our second quarter's call I
mentioned that we were pleased with the progress that we have made in pricing relative to where we were in the
previous year. And I would say that relative to those comments our pricing has remained very stable. And so I would
characterize the environment – It's tough to paint with a broad brush because it really is different depending on which
part of our business that you look at but certainly overall the environment continues to be competitive.
If I had to give an overall characterization, I would say stable at the levels that we indicated in the second quarter. If
you peel it back, I would – you asked specifically about Application Services. It continues to be a very competitive
market but our pricing is stable. We see other parts of our business where we see some pricing power, and when I say
that I think about Accenture Strategy and Accenture Consulting.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay, fair enough. Then my follow-up question, if I could, is your global delivery network
continues to tick up, which I think is part of the reason why you're able to move your margins. Almost 72% of
employment base is in the global delivery network now. Is there a natural resistance point at some level? If we look out
over the next couple of years, can that continue to move up where you move, say, over 80% of employment bases in
the GDN? If you could just talk about any natural resistance points, particularly as you think about Digital forming the
greater percent of revenue, which I would think would be more local head count but would like to hear your
characterization. Thanks very much.
<A - David P. Rowland>: We don't think in terms of a natural resistance point. I mean, we think that we've got a lot of
flexibility for how our global delivery network can continue to evolve. But we certainly don't think in terms of any
natural resistance point. We drive it as the market evolves and, as I said, we've got flexibility still in front of us.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: When you look from a skill standpoint, you're right to mention that part of the work we're
doing in digital-related services could be onshore. However, we are probably the largest – one of the largest enterprise
apps developer in the world. All these developments are being made by our global delivery network and it's definitely
part of digital-related services. I'm thinking about a significant part of our business in analytics as well being done with
our resources especially in India and other places.

When I think about strong innovations in terms of automation, robotics, cognitive computing, and artificial intelligence,
they are coming a lot from the Philippines and from India as well. So I guess it would be a bit simplistic to see our
GDN as a kind of low-cost, low-value kind of capability. It is a right cost, very high value workforce.

Your next question comes from the line of Edward Caso from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Good morning, Ed.
<Q - Edward S. Caso>: Good morning. Congrats on the quarter. I was curious how much of a drag that the
acquisitions have become to your margin. And this rapid growth in the GDN that was just mentioned, is that providing
adequate offset?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah. Well, first of all, Ed, I would say that if you look at the performance of our portfolio
overall, we're quite pleased with the performance of our portfolio of acquisitions from revenue through profitability and
cash flow. And that's something we track very carefully. We review certainly ourselves but with our board as well each
quarter. And we believe we have some pretty high hurdles, financial hurdles, for the transactions that we do.
Having said that, as you know, it certainly wouldn't be unusual for an acquisition to be dilutive in the first year or two
possibly but we do – one of our hurdles is the pace at which a deal becomes on par and then accretive. But certainly in
the first couple years, they can be dilutive.
I'll also point out that whereas many other companies in our sector tend to adjust for certain types of acquisition-related
costs, the amortization of intangibles, things like performance retention payments at the time of closure, third-party
fees, et cetera, we've chosen not to do that. And we report our margin all-in. To date, our margin expansion
commitment has been based on a philosophy that we absorb those as part of our investments and we drive the business
forward.
And of course, that's just one part of our investment. We have investments that go well beyond that. The impressive
thing about our profit model to date is that when you look at 20 basis points of expansion, underneath that, we are
driving significant efficiency across our business to absorb the investment acquisition and otherwise. And that's an
important story to understand so I'm glad you asked that question.
<Q - Edward S. Caso>: My other question is on clarification on pricing. When you talk about stable pricing, so what
does that mean? I mean, we hear that clients are more focused on reducing total cost of ownership. So you and your
competitors may be able to sustain margin but you're giving back some volume. Help us understand better what you
mean by pricing. Thanks.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah, so to remind you and the other listeners, when we talk about price and we've always
said very clearly that we're talking about the profit or margin percentage on the work that we sell. And it's in that
context, when I say pricing is stable, it's in that context that I make that statement. So when you look at Application
Services as an example when you look at our margin on work that we are contracting, that is stable.
I mentioned the other areas where we have sources of some pricing power. I mentioned Strategy and Consulting. I also
say that in the context of the margin but I'll also add that if you were to look at in that part of our business people might
talk about things like the average daily rates were also placed with average daily rate progression in that part of our
businesses as well.
<Q - Edward S. Caso>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis from Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Good morning, Lisa.
<Q - Lisa D. Ellis>: Hi, guys. Good morning. First, I guess, I'll ask directly the question I think many are wondering
which is, what is it are you seeing in the numbers that's causing the implied kind of sharp quarter-on-quarter
deceleration and the guide for Q1?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah, so if you look at our guide for quarter one, the range is 6% to 9% in local currency
growth. When I look at quarter one or the full year maybe, Lisa, if you'll – let me just expand my comments a little bit.
I mean, when you look at our guidance, you first of all have to understand what is our assumption on market growth
and we assume that the market will continue to grow plus or minus in the 4% range.
And so when you look at our guidance for the year, certainly if you look at our guidance for quarter one, the same
would apply across that range. But certainly at the upper end of that range, it reflects taking significant market share,
continuing to take significant market share, which is our strategic objective.
The other thing that you have to consider goes back to some of the discussion that Pierre had I believe with Darrin on
the growth markets and the risk profile. But also I think when we look at the macro environment in general, relative to
where we were 90 days ago, I would say relative to where we were at this time last year, the volatility and risk in the
macro environment has clicked up a notch or two, and so that's factored in.
The other thing that we think about when we look at our guidance is that it's as important, if not more important, to
look at the absolute dollars as it is the percentage, whether it be the first quarter or the full year. And if you just look at
the full year, before you adjust for the FX headwind, just taking that out and look at the underlying growth, at the upper
end of our range, we would be adding about $2.5 billion of revenue excluding the impact of FX in fiscal 2016, which is
a pretty healthy number. So we work hard to drive to the upper end of the range, although the range reflects what we
think are the range of possibilities. And as it relates to the full year, we're early in the year. And as we did last year,
we'll adjust as we go. That was more of an answer than your question, but it gave me an opportunity to share some of
those thoughts.
<Q - Lisa D. Ellis>: Terrific, thank you, and then a little broader question. Taking a step back and just reviewing FY
2015, how has the competitive set that you guys are competing against in deals changed?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: We've not seen much change in the competitive environment. I think the competition is quite
well established in the different businesses we are operating in from the Consulting and Strategy with the usual players.
Then you have the technology with the other players. And then of course, operation is a different part of our business.
So I guess the environment is pretty stable with some winners and losers. And we are investing and driving our
business to be part of the winners. But not much to say around the competitive environment, it's still the usual suspects.
<Q - Lisa D. Ellis>: Terrific, thank you.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Thank you.

<Q - Sara Rebecca Gubins>: Do you think that your visibility is changing at all given that a greater portion of growth
is coming from digital?
<A - David P. Rowland>: I would say that to the extent that digital has a strong consulting concentration, and if you
look at let's say the average duration of a consulting contract versus an outsourcing contract, it would be true to say that
the duration is shorter for consulting than it is for outsourcing. So in that sense, it does give you a different backlog
profile going forward. We're very pleased with how our Strategy and Consulting and the development of new
technology that we report within Application Services; that has been a great story for us but it does change the
dynamic, as you're alluding to.
<Q - Sara Rebecca Gubins>: Great. And then separately, could you talk about your hiring plans for next year and the
hiring environment overall? Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Good morning. Just speaking of head count growth, I think it was up 17% year over year.
That's the highest I can remember in a long time. Can you just talk about how that translates into revenue? I would have
guessed it would have pushed a little bit higher guidance growth rate for the constant currency revenue growth for
fiscal year 2016.
<A - David P. Rowland>: First of all, we were really pleased with our recruiting in the fourth quarter. We continue to
be and even more so I would say magnet for talent in the marketplace. We had very successful recruiting efforts. As
you know, the fourth quarter is typically when we bring on our campus hires, and so that's reflected in the number. And
so we manage the supply and demand very carefully. One point is where we start the year. And then of course, we have
to manage our head count as we progress through the year. And we will see how attrition plays out as we evolve
through the first half of the year. We'll see how the revenue trajectory progresses. And then, as always, we adjust head
count appropriately.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: But what's that relationship? Shouldn't the relationship be closer to revenue growth for the
following year?
<A - David P. Rowland>: As a general, it depends. It just depends on so many different assumptions. It depends on
how we see pricing evolving. It depends on how we see our revenue yield per head evolving. It depends on what we
might expect with attrition. It depends on perhaps we hired a disproportionate number of people in quarter four and we
expect to hire less than normal in quarter one. There are so many factors that go into that. I wouldn't over-read the head
count. What I'd focus on is the guidance we gave and the context that I gave for the guidance.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Okay, just last quick follow-up. What's the mix between consulting and outsourcing on the
growth rate that we should expect between the 5% to 8% guidance? I saw consulting has obviously been a little bit
stronger than outsourcing. I just want to see if that probably continues for next year.
<A - David P. Rowland>: We actually see very balanced growth as we have looked at our business plans. We actually
see very balanced growth. And we would see, let's say, both consulting and outsourcing – in the context of a 5% to 8%
range, we would see both of those being in the same zone, so on the mid to high single digits is the potential range for
both of them.

Operator
Okay. Your final question today comes from the line of Brian Essex from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brian L. Essex>: Good morning and thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit
about – I just noticed that the acceleration in the European or EMEA constant currency growth rate was really nice this
quarter. So you've had about a year and a half now of accelerating growth in Europe. And I was just wondering if you
could touch on the environment in Europe and some of the key drivers to that acceleration so that we can get an idea of
how that might be sustainable going forward.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Sure, thank you. And by the way, Johan Deblaere, who is leading our European business is in
the room and he couldn't be more pleased with your comment on Europe. And yes, we're pleased as well, we are
because we've seen the growth. And of course, when you understand the overall economic environment in Europe, it's
much different from the one, for instance, you have in the U.S. So it's more about us than about the market, of course.
And I would call probably the same trend. It's fascinating to see that the digital rotation we've seen in Europe is as
strong, even slightly stronger than the one we could see in the U.S. It appears that our target clients, mainly the
premium brand in the G2000 [Global 2000] we are serving in Europe are really accelerating their investments in term
of digital rotation.
Second, we had some very significant transactions leveraging Accenture Operations with our business process services.
I'm thinking about the finance and accounting, the HR, the procurement as well, and it's been a significant source of
growth. And overall, the Consulting is back, probably driven as well with the digital-related services.
So for Europe, again, the clients we are serving more than the GUs are reinvesting with always an eye on
rationalization, driving good growth for Accenture operations, and the other eye on the growth and digital which is
driving more business for Accenture Digital, Accenture Strategy and Accenture Consulting, and of course, the
leadership of Johan Deblaere.
<Q - Brian L. Essex>: Great. And maybe just for a follow-up, I know the deal hasn't closed yet, but I think Cloud
Sherpas is a great pick up. We know them as a leading cloud broker and a substantial Salesforce.com partner. Maybe if
you could – to the extent that you can, talk about the rationale behind that deal and where some of the leverage across
your platform might come from, and any kind of overlap with their current brokerage business?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Sure, I mean two main reasons. First, and you've seen that in the terminology which has been
used by Paul Daugherty, our Chief Technology Officer, we're taking a class-first approach. So we are strongly
believers that in the now and even more moving forward, this class-first agenda will be quite prevalent for all clients
and we want to preempt or be ahead of the curve or to embrace, whatever you're going to call it, these new cloud-first
environment. And so to be a prominent provider in the as-a-service software and solution as a service environment.
So second, when we have defined this positioning for Accenture, the name of the game for us was how to scale more
rapidly to take a leadership position especially around the Salesforce.com solution and Cloud Sherpas was a very
relevant opportunity for us to scale rapidly the good capabilities we have.
As we speak, we are the leader in providing services for Salesforce.com. We are already the leader, and we believe that
through this acquisition, that excellent people, a significant number of these people being certified which is even more
important, we are scaling faster and taking are the leadership in this market, which we believe is going to be very
promising in the coming years.

capabilities together?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yeah, no, indeed. I mean, it's global, with a very significant and good footprint in the U.S.,
but it's global and nicely covering two or three of our most significant markets around the world. So we should take this
leading position not only in one, but certainly in few other markets around the world. Very nice fit for us.

All right. I think it's time to wrap up, KC. Excellent. So thanks to all of you again for joining us on today's call. And in
