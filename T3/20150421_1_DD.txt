pleasure to turn the call over to Ellen.
Ellen Jamison Kullman
Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone.
2015 is an important year in DuPont's ongoing transformation, and our first quarter results demonstrate our ability to
grow next-generation DuPont, even in a challenging market environment. In the next few months we will complete the
most significant step in our ongoing transformation, the separation of Chemours. We can already see the evidence of
the company we will be in the sales and operating earnings growth from our ongoing business over the past several
years. We expect to continue this growth trend as we build and leverage our leading positions in large attractive
markets where our competitive advantages meet significant opportunities.
In this quarter we delivered operating earnings of $1.34 per share. Currency markets significantly impacted the quarter,
resulting in a $0.27 headwind. $0.25 was due to currency and $0.02 from net exchange losses. I am pleased to report
that we delivered volume and margin improvement in the majority of our post-spin segments. Our intense focus on
innovation, disciplined execution and ongoing cost reduction delivered and will continue going forward.
Our performance was driven by volume and margin gains in our Performance Materials, Safety & Protection, Nutrition
and Health and Industrial Biosciences segments. Each benefited from new products and applications tailored to market
demand, even in Agriculture, which faced industry-wide challenges, we benefited from pricing gains overall on an
improved mix of products. As the Ag markets eventually improve, we expect to be well-positioned, based on our strong
pipeline of seed and crop protection products, including DP 4114 and Leptra for insect protection and Lumigen seed
treatment.
Performance Materials and Safety & Protection were standouts this quarter, delivering significant gains in volumes and
margins by staying close to their customers and delivering value-added innovations. In our Protection Technologies
business, for example, strong demand for our Kevlar, Nomex and Tyvek products yielded volume growth that more
than offset the impact from currency while improving margins. Our Performance Polymers business had solid
performance, driven by volume growth in North America and Asia Pacific, which more than offset softness in Latin
America and Europe.
Innovation coupled with disciplined attention to cost drives earnings and margins and at DuPont, cost reduction
remains a top priority. We continue to increase productivity and efficiency through our redesign initiatives. At the same
time, we introduced more than 600 new products in the first quarter, a 5% increase from the first quarter of 2014. We
also announced that we would be increasing our dividend for the second quarter by 4%, our fourth increase since the
beginning of 2012.

Nick will tell you a bit more about that after he walks through the specifics of the financial details behind these results,
and Greg will then take us through the segments. Then I'll be back to discuss our outlook for this year, the important
progress we've made on our strategic plans and how we will continue to deliver higher growth and higher value now
and in the future. Nick?
Nicholas C. Fanandakis
Thank you, Ellen.
Let's start with the details of the first quarter on slide two. Operating earnings per share were $1.34 versus $1.58 in the
prior year. As Ellen noted, operating EPS included a $0.27 headwind from a stronger U.S. dollar, $0.25 due to currency
and $0.02 from net exchange losses. Our results reflect our focus on disciplined execution, innovation and ongoing cost
reduction in a dynamic environment, including a stronger dollar and challenging Ag and TiO2 markets.
Consolidated net sales were $9.2 billion, a decline of 9% versus the prior year, with six percentage points of that
decline due to currency, as the dollar continued to strengthen against most other currencies, particularly the euro,
Brazilian real and the Japanese yen. Prior-year portfolio actions reduced sales by 2% in the quarter. While overall
volume declined 1% during the quarter, we delivered volume growth in most of our post-spin segments, led by
Performance Materials and Safety & Protection which grew volumes 8% and 6% respectively.
Performance Materials volume growth was driven by demand in the automotive sector in North America and China and
growth in industrial and consumer markets. Safety & Protection volume growth was driven by increased demand in
global industrial markets and continued strong public sector demand in Europe. Nutrition and Health and Industrial
Biosciences also grew volume by 2% and 1% respectively. Volume decline of 5% in Agriculture was due to expected
reductions in global corn planted area, lower insecticide demand in Latin America and timing of seed shipments.
Electronics & Communications, saw a 3% decline as strong growth in Consumer Electronics was more than offset by
the impact of competitive pressures on Solamet paste.
Turning now to slide three. Currency was and is expected to be a significant headwind in 2015. Operating earnings
were negatively impacted by $0.25, which is included in segment results. Exchange gains and losses was a $0.09
headwind in the quarter, $0.02 higher than the prior year. Additionally, although not reflected in operating earnings, we
recognized a $0.04 per share charge in connection with the Ukraine devaluation.
A higher base income tax rate, due to our geographical mix of earnings, negatively impacted operating EPS by $0.03 in
the quarter. Our base tax rate for the quarter was about 22%, approximately 2 points higher than the prior year. The
segment results, including the $0.25 negative impact from currency as I've described earlier, were down as strong
growth in Performance Materials and Safety & Protection were more than offset by the challenging Ag and TiO2
markets. Corporate and interest expenses provided a benefit of $0.05 in the quarter which includes the impact of our
operational redesign initiatives. In addition, a lower share count contributed a $0.02 benefit in the quarter.
Turning now to slide four, I'd like to highlight some of our geographic results. As you can see, our geographical mix of
sales shifted year-over-year to a higher percentage of our reported sales occurring in the U.S. and Canada. Excluding
the impact of currency, the geographic mix would have been very similar to prior year.
Now let's turn to our first quarter segment operating earnings analysis on slide five. As you can see, earnings growth in
Performance Materials, Electronics & Communications, and Safety & Protection was more than offset by lower results
in Ag and Performance Chemicals. The growth in Performance Materials is driven by demand for ethylene and
performance polymers, which more than offset the impact of currency. Electronics & Communications results were
driven by increased demand in Consumer Electronics and continued productivity gains, partially offset by the impact of
lower metals pricing and currency. Safety & Protection results increased as higher volumes and continued productivity
were partially offset by negative currency.
Higher costs associated with an outage at Chambers Works facility were largely offset by a benefit in connection with
the advancement of an ongoing claim. Greg will provide further detail on segment performance later in this call.

Turning now to the balance sheet and cash on slide six. We maintained our strong balance sheet position during the
quarter. Negative free cash flow of $2.7 billion reflects our typical seasonal Agriculture cash outflow in the quarter and
was slightly better than the prior year. Net debt has increased in the quarter over our ending 2014 balance, which
reflects our normal seasonal shifts. We used existing cash balances to fund our seasonal Agriculture working capital
requirements, growth investments, and dividends.
Today, we announced that our board of directors has approved a second quarter dividend of $0.49 per share, which
represents a 4% increase over the $0.47 paid last quarter. This represents our fourth dividend increase since the
beginning of 2012.
On slide seven, I'd like to highlight that we are continuing to execute on our operational redesign initiative which
delivered about $0.10 of benefit in the first quarter. For the full year, we now expect to deliver about $0.40 of savings
as a result of this program. This represents a $0.05 per share increase versus our January estimate. We remain laser
focused on productivity and continue to look for additional areas to improve and accelerate our cost reduction
programs.
The spinoff of Chemours remains on track for completion on July 1, pending final DuPont board approval. As we noted
in our January earnings news release, we intend to return all, or substantially all, of the estimated $4 billion of onetime
proceeds back to shareholders via a share repurchase within 12 to 18 months of the separation, with a portion returned
by the end of this year.
As we previously communicated, Chemours capital structure and separation is expected to support a quarterly dividend
to shareholders such that the sum of DuPont's and Chemours' aggregate third quarter dividend is equivalent to DuPont's
aggregate quarterly dividend immediately prior to the separation. Chemours expects to declare a quarterly dividend in
the amount of $100 million for the third quarter 2015. This amount is expected to be paid to shareholders as of a record
date following separation. We will provide further updates as this information becomes available.
Looking ahead for the remainder of the year, the global currency markets have continued to be volatile, with further
strengthening of the dollar against a broad basket of currencies that we operate in versus our January estimate. As a
result, we now expect an $0.80 per share headwind from currency for the full year 2015 based on last week's rate
assumptions, increased from the $0.60 per share headwind previously communicated in our fourth quarter 2014
earnings call.
We are working aggressively to mitigate the stronger currency headwinds by accelerating cost savings from the
operational redesign and other corporate and business actions. Given this additional $0.20 of currency headwind, we
now expect to be at the low end of our previously communicated range of $4.00 to $4.20 operating earnings per share
for the full year 2015. This includes the full year outlook from the Performance Chemicals segment.
We expect results to be driven by our underlying sales momentum from the ramp-up of our recent product launches
like Cyazypyr insecticides, new product application in Kevlar, and new product introductions like our next-generation
Solamet paste, and the full year benefit of accelerated cost reductions through our redesign initiatives. We are confident
in our ability to execute our plans and deliver growth even in a dynamic market environment.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Greg to review the segments.
Gregory R. Friedman
I'd now like to provide some brief segment insights focused on our first quarter results and second quarter segment
outlooks. As a reminder, the slides with complete segment commentary are posted on the Investor Center website under
Events and Presentations along with the other materials for today's call.
Starting with slide eight. In Performance Materials we delivered strong volume growth in the quarter, which helped to
offset the impact from currency and lower ethylene prices. Segment volume increased 8% on solid North America and
Asia demand in auto and increased ethylene sales. Operating earnings increased 12% as higher volumes and a stronger

mix overcame the negative impacts from currency and portfolio changes.
Operating margins increased approximately 400 basis points, primarily due to mix enrichment. For the second quarter,
we anticipate sales will be low teens percent lower, due primarily to portfolio changes, currency and lower ethylene
prices. Excluding these items, sales would be up in the low single-digit range. Operating earnings are expected to be up
in the mid-single digits percent on higher volume and continued mix enrichment.
In Electronics & Communications on slide nine, operating earnings improved 13% on the stronger product mix and
from productivity actions. Sales were 10% lower, with continued growth in Consumer Electronics, which were more
than offset by the impact of competitive pressures on sales of Solamet paste and the negative impact of lower metals
pricing and currency. We believe our competitive position in PV paste is stabilizing and expect to launch the first in our
series of new Solamet paste products in the second quarter, with additional introductions later in 2015.
We expect continued solid demand for our materials into Consumer Electronics. Second quarter sales are forecast to be
down low teens percent due to the negative impact of metals pricing, currency, and from lower Solamet paste sales.
Second quarter operating earnings are expected to be down low single digits percent, as productivity will partially
offset the impact of lower sales versus a strong prior-year quarter.
Moving to slide 10. Safety & Protection delivered solid improvements in volume, operating margins and operating
earnings. Sales were down 4% as 6% volume growth was more than offset by the negative impact of currency as well
as the Sontara divestiture. Volume growth was broad-based in global industrial markets including demand for Tyvek
protective material, Kevlar high strength materials, and Nomex thermal resistant fiber driven by sales into the
mechanical, military, medical packaging and chemical markets.
First quarter segment operating earnings of $184 million were up 5% on volume growth and productivity
improvements. Higher costs associated with lower plant utilization at the Chambers Works facility were largely offset
by a benefit in connection with the advancement of an ongoing claim. In addition the segment improved operating
margins by 170 basis points year-over-year. In the second quarter we expect sales will be down in the mid-single digit
percent range as volume growth will be more than offset by the impact of currency and portfolio changes. Operating
earnings growth will be in the mid-single digit percent range due to continued demand for our products, ongoing
innovation and continued operational productivity.
Slide 11. In Industrial Biosciences we continued to deliver solid results as volume and operating margins improved
despite the challenging environment. Sales were 5% lower as 5% higher bioactive volumes were more than offset by
the impact of currency. Volumes growth in enzymes was driven by food market demand partially offset by lower
biomaterial sales in the U.S. markets. Operating earnings of $56 million were even with prior year, overcoming
negative the impact of currency. Operating margins continued to improve with a 100 basis point increase versus the
prior year and a 540 basis point increase in total versus the first quarter of 2013. We expect higher volumes to continue
in the second quarter driven by benefits from new product offerings in bioactives and increasing penetration into
emerging markets. These stronger volumes will offset the negative impacts of currency and softer U.S. biomaterial
volumes resulting in sales and operating earnings results, about flat with the prior year.
In Nutrition & Health on slide 12, the business produced volume and operating margin improvement this quarter. Sales
were 6% lower as a 2% increase due to volume was offset by an 8% negative impact from currency. We generated
strong volume growth in probiotics, cultures, texturants and ingredient systems partially offset by lower volumes in the
specialty protein market in North America.
Volume growth was strong in EMEA despite pressures from the Russia food import ban offsetting weakness in Latin
America. Operating earnings decreased $4 million as volume gains and improved mix were more than offset by the
negative impact of currency. In the second quarter, we expect continued volume growth in most product lines, and the
specialty protein markets to remain very competitive. Sales are expected to be high single-digits percent lower, due to
continued strong currency headwinds. Operating earnings are expected to be low teens percent lower primarily due to
the negative impact of currency.

In Agriculture on slide 13, the business performed well given the overall difficult market conditions in the industry.
First quarter results were slightly better than expected in January primarily due to disciplined cost actions. 2015 is
playing out to be one of the most competitive seasons in recent years given the challenging economic environment in
the Ag sector and with seed suppliers having abundant inventories globally. Lower insect pressure in Brazil and
continued elevated distributor inventories in the Americas are presenting headwinds in crop protection markets. First
quarter Agriculture segment sales were $3.9 billion, down 10%, as 3% higher local prices were offset by 8% negative
impact from currency and 5% lower volumes.
We were able to capture 3% higher prices across the segment, driven by an improved mix of Pioneer's newest corn
hybrids and soybean varieties and pricing actions in parts of Europe and Asia, partially offsetting the impact of a
stronger U.S. dollar.
Volume declined 5% due to lower corn planted area, lower insecticide volumes in Latin America and earlier timing of
seed shipments. The largest headwinds of volume we continue to face is a further shift from corn to soybeans. We have
seen growers in Brazil reduce corn plantings in the past summer and safrinha seasons, and our North America seed
order book confirms the continued shift to soybeans away from corn.
First quarter operating earnings were significantly impacted by currency and declined 21%, as lower sales were
partially offset by productivity improvements and disciplined cost actions taken in response to the current market
environment in Agriculture.
Even in this difficult environment, we continue to perform and execute on the variables that are within our control,
including bringing new products to market that meet customer demand. We are seeing a positive impact from mix on
price as growers demand our newest corn and soybean genetics, and we continue to build our robust pipeline with
growth prospects in near term from new corn and soybeans genetics and technologies like event DP4114 and Leptra for
insect control. For the first half of 2015, which reflects the majority of the northern hemisphere season, we now expect
Agriculture segment sales to be high single-digits percent lower with operating earnings low to mid-teens percent
below 2014 as local pricing gains and cost reductions will be offset by currency and lower corn seed and insecticide
volumes.
On slide 14, in Performance Chemicals, sales were down 14% due to lower volumes and prices combined with the
negative impacts of currency and portfolio changes. Challenging industry fundamentals continued in the first quarter as
TiO2 volumes were down 12% and price down 7%. On a sequential basis, price was down 5%. Price pressures in the
quarter were driven in part by lower than optimal industry utilization rates and stronger regional competition.
In Chemical and Fluoroproducts, volumes were even with the prior year, as higher demand for fluoropolymers was
offset by lower sales of fluorochemicals, principally due to the reduction in R22 production allocations. Demand for
our next-generation refrigerant, Opteon 1234yf, was up 30% on continued adoption by automotive OEMs. Operating
earnings were down 37%, driven primarily by lower TiO2 prices and volumes, the negative impacts of currency and the
impact of portfolio changes. For the second quarter, we anticipate sales and operating earnings will be flat versus the
prior year with currency anticipated to remain a significant headwind year-over-year. Segment volumes are expected to
improve sequentially versus the first quarter, due to increased seasonal demand for refrigerants and TiO2. Demand for
fluoropolymers and chemicals is also expected to improve.
Now I will turn the call back to Ellen.
Ellen Jamison Kullman
Thanks, Greg.
2015 is a pivotal year for DuPont with the upcoming separation of Chemours as the most significant and visible step in
our ongoing transformation to a higher growth, higher value company. The rationale for our strategy is reflected in the
19% compound annual growth rate of adjusted operating earnings from 2008 through 2014 from our post-spin business
that comprise the next-generation DuPont. This new portfolio will continue to build momentum as we leverage our

leading positions in three strategic focus areas where we have robust opportunities and strong, well-established
competitive advantages where our science and engineering capabilities can deliver the greatest value for our
shareholders.
The next-generation DuPont will continue to drive the productivity of our exceptional science and innovation platform
to deliver value-added products and solutions. We will take advantage of our global scale and market insights to
continue to develop the right products for the right markets and deliver them efficiently. Cost discipline and
productivity will continue to be a top priority. And with this important transition through our operational redesign,
we're building a more agile organization that is truly purpose-built and scaled for the next-generation DuPont.
We are investing in modernizing and upgrading a number of our systems to enhance speed to market, transaction times,
speed and quality of decision making to drive greater performance on a smaller cost base. The discipline and effort we
are applying now is preparing the organization for the next step change in growth and value at DuPont.
By the end of 2015, we expect to have annual run rate savings of approximately $1 billion and at least $1.3 billion in
total expected savings by the end of 2017. As we advance this program of change, we will deliver more opportunities
that improve productivity. The combined force of our science and market insight, applications expertise and global
scale, is evident in each of our businesses and forms the foundation of our continued success. While agricultural
markets may continue to face challenges in the near term, we remain confident in the long-term fundamentals for grain
and oil seed demand, in our growth strategy and the continued benefits of our successful research investments and new
product launches.
These broad strengths enabled us to grow sales at a 10% rate from 2008 to 2014, outperforming each of our leading
competitors. We believe the best validation of the strengths of our innovation happens in the market. Our success is
reflected by the fact that we increased North American corn share by six points and soybeans by nine points from 2008
to 2014, and farmers planted Optimum AQUAmax seeds on over 10% of all U.S. corn acres in 2014. As we look
ahead, an exciting pipeline of new products like DP4114 and Leptra gives us confidence in the future and our
opportunities for growth.
With 4114, we saw strong efficacy and yield performance in the research trials last summer and are aggressively
integrating this trait into the highest performing Pioneer's genetics as we prepare for an accelerated product
introduction and volume ramp-up. This year corn hybrids containing 4114, will be tested in our IMPACT trials, which
are the final stage of product testing before commercialization. In 2016, we expect to include 4114 in expanded
on-farm grower trials under strict stewardship while we await final regulatory approvals.
In Brazil we look forward to customer demonstrations of Leptra hybrids in the summer of 2015, and a commercial
launch for the 2015-2016 safrinha season as we await final regulatory approvals. We expect Leptra hybrids will provide
enhanced value proposition for growers in Brazil to help them manage lepidopteran pests, including fall armyworm and
maximize the yield potential of Pioneer genetics. We believe that Leptra will help us strengthen our position in the
Brazil market as we ramp up volumes in 2016.
In Crop Protection our robust pipeline continues to deliver, and we've increased the combined target for our novel
insect control products, Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr, to approach $2 billion in peak annual sales. We are also expanding
our Lumigen seed treatment offerings, such as Dermacor, Lumivia and Lumiderm while preparing to launch Zorvec for
highly effective disease control and Pyraxalt for novel insect control in rice.
As we approach the four-year anniversary of our Danisco acquisition, I want to provide you with a progress report.
We're on track with our initial plan and we're seeing the tangible benefits of our strategy. Cost synergies have exceeded
our original targets and were achieved earlier than planned. We're making solid progress in the market and with
productivity, as demonstrated by the volume and operating margin improvements this quarter in both Nutrition &
Health and Industrial Biosciences despite the challenging environment.
Nutrition & Health has now reported seven consecutive quarters of year-over-year operating margin improvement.
Longer term, this acquisition has provided DuPont with world-leading industrial biotech capabilities to create
transformational new bio-based businesses and unlock future growth opportunities.

In Nutrition & Health we're combining strong customer relationships with our science and application know-how to
create new value. We have seen strong growth in key areas such as probiotics and cultures, and we're investing in
research and development and global capacity to take advantage of market trends like increasing interest in wellness in
the form of our HOWARU probiotics. We're also introducing local solutions through collaborations with customers
across the globe, such as our YO-MIX starter cultures, which meets the needs in a developing world for a nutritious
yogurt product and can maintain long life without refrigeration. In 2014 we delivered strong growth with operating
earnings up 27%, expanding margins over 200 basis points.
Meanwhile, we are currently at the front end of the growth curve in Industrial Biosciences. We have a great business
that delivered 25% operating earnings growth and 300 basis points of margin improvement last year. And our core
markets, which include animal nutrition and food enzymes, home and personal care, and grain processing are very
strong. Even as we continue to invest in our core areas and grow our margins, ongoing advancements in science and
technology, and demand for renewables and sustainability, are rapidly expanding the markets for bio-based industrials.
With our advanced science and technology capability, we're uniquely positioned to innovate in this fast growing area.
We're focused on creating new categories of renewably sourced bio-based products such as cellulosic ethanol, Ag
biologicals and industrial enzymes. One notable example is Tide Coldwater Clean detergent, which is the first branded
product to use cellulosic ethanol as an ingredient in a scalable commercial way.
In Advanced Materials, we're building on our historic strength in application-based innovation and delivering on clear
routes to growth. During the quarter, our core capabilities in chemistry, polymers, engineering, and now biosciences
enabled us to expand operating margins and increase volumes as we delivered highly tailored, value-added solutions
for customers. Strong demand continued from the automotive and aerospace industries for lightweight, fuel efficient
materials like new versions of Kevlar, Nomex, Zytel, and Vamac.
We continued to penetrate alternative energy and clean technology markets. Also, we're meeting the needs for
miniaturization of electronics and the increasing demand for protective materials in industrial, construction, and
military and first responders. We're just getting started in other areas of opportunity and are confident that leveraging
our industrial biotechnology and production agriculture expertise will allow us to capture developing opportunities for
sustainably sourced, renewable, and differentiated polymers. We also expect continued growth through additional
innovations such as Solamet paste and Kevlar film to increase the efficiency and lifetime of photovoltaic cells.
For the past six years, DuPont's board and management have been active champions of constructive change. Our efforts
have delivered results, clearly visible in our 19% compound annual growth rate in adjusted operating earnings since
year-end 2008 through 2014, total shareholder return of 266%, outperforming the S&P and our peers, and a total return
of $14 billion in capital to shareholders. Our disciplined capital allocation strategy reflects our commitment to return
capital to our shareholders and invest in growth opportunities.
We are confident in the future as we look ahead to a year of continued performance and transformation. We remain
focused on delivering higher growth and higher value by investing in and leveraging our innovation platform,
increasing penetration in developing markets and delivering localized solutions, continually driving lower costs, and
improving operational efficiency, and actively managing our portfolio, all while providing differentiated value-added
solutions that customers expect.
In conclusion, our portfolio is well positioned to exceed the pace of longer-term macro trends driving growth. The
world needs a safe, secure supply of food for a growing population and rising middle class. Our capabilities directly
address the need for increased productivity in agriculture and enable us to develop new products to address increasing
demand for wellness and more nutritious foods, and our science and application expertise continue to deliver advanced
materials that power, fuel and transport the world sustainably and energy efficiently. Our leading science and powerful
innovation platform makes us the partner of choice for companies supplying these markets.
We continue to move forward with discipline, focus and purpose to deliver value now and position DuPont for future
success. As we see the momentum of the next generation DuPont, we are energized by the progress we have made but
are even more excited by the opportunities the future holds.

Gregory R. Friedman
Thanks, Ellen. We'll now open the line for questions. John?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Frank Mitsch from Well Fargo.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Hey good morning. It looks like Mr. Vergnano has his work cut out for him. I'm curious as to,
given the declines in Performance Chemicals, the confidence that you have in being able to get that $4 billion midnight
dividend. What sort of valuation metrics went into that figure? And yeah, so if you could help us with that, that would
be great.
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Frank, thanks for the question. As you know, Performance Chemicals is at a cyclical
low. We see that there are, although headwind that were faced in the first quarter by a challenging TiO2 market,
capacity utilization in the low 80s, inventory levels at customers largely unchanged, that the fundamentals are
stabilizing. And so as we look forward, we see not only improvements from seasonal volumes in TiO2 and refrigerants,
because they're coming into their season, we have some new products, and that's going to offer us a stronger pricing
environment in both fluorochemicals and specifically refrigerants and fluoropolymers. And we do anticipate better
results in chemicals and fluoro versus the prior year going forward.
Productivity continues to help and will continue to help. But so they are at a cyclical bottom. As we have valued
Chemours, we took look at not only at the cyclical bottom but at the range that's been experienced over the last few
years. So, Nick, you want to give some specifics?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Yeah. Frank, so as we looked at the capital structure of Chemours, we dialed in all of
the things that Ellen just talked about. We dialed in the plan for the expectation of what the EBITDA is going be for the
year. We worked with the rating agencies to have some preliminary evaluations done of the business. Of course,
everything is predicated on that final point in time, but we're so close right now that I feel very good about the midnight
dividend, the debt level that we're going be able to place on the entity along with the dividend structure that we've been
proposing.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: All right. Thank you so much.
Operator
Our next question is from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Robert Andrew Koort>: Thanks very much. You guys gave good help around the sales line by division of what
FX has done to the results. Can you give us a sense on an earnings level and outside of P chem is there any meaningful
transactional risk from currencies?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yeah, so certainly currency – and I put portfolio in the same kind of bucket as we had
significant portfolio changes within several of the segments. But if you look at things like N&H, if you took out
portfolio and currency their earnings, operating earnings would have been up 12%. If you take a look at S&P, their
operating earnings would have been up 17%. If you look at Performance Materials, up 29%. The headwinds, exportfolio
and currency were Agriculture and were Performance Chemicals where they would not have gotten into
positive figures.

It's interesting, Bob, when you look back a few years ago, you take out currency and portfolio, with the headwinds
we've seen in Agriculture and the headwinds that we've seen in the chemical cycle, ex-currency we outearned this time
last year. And I think that's a very powerful statement to the strength of the portfolio and the strength of the new
DuPont that we're creating going forward.
<Q - Robert Andrew Koort>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question is from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Thank you. Ellen, in your comments you referenced seed share gains in both corn and
soybeans in the last few years. In 2015, given the challenging environment, do you think you can grow share or at least
maintain share in both corn and soybeans?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Thanks. It's a little too early to comment on North America share. I can tell you what
we've been very pleased at is the mix we're seeing, we saw in the first quarter and you can see that with what price has
done in Agriculture. It's a stronger mix. I don't know Jim what would you add to that?
<A - James C. Borel>: I think it is a little too early to try to predict share. We are very confident about the
competitiveness in corn and soybeans products and as well as the services that we're bringing to growers. In corn, we're
continuing to strengthen our triple stack portfolio and expect to make progress in 2015. So a little too early to predict
share, but overall, we feel pretty good about our competitors.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Ellen, just in Performance Materials volume growth was 8% in the quarter. But ex- the
ethylene sales, what was the volume growth? What should be underlying volume growth in that segment this year do
you think?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Obviously ethylene was a benefit in the quarter. I think if you take that out, I think
their volumes would have been up 3% to 4% in the balance of those businesses benefiting from stronger automotive in
the United States and in Asia. Certainly Europe and Latin America weren't any help in the automotive market. But I
think the important part there is we're really seeing the benefits from the application development, the innovation
centers that we put in a few years ago and the real benefits we're seeing at the customer in the polymers and not only
the performance polymers but also in the packaging and industrial polymers areas.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Thank you.
Operator
Our next question is from John McNulty from Credit Suisse.
<Q - John P. McNulty>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe a follow-up on the Chemours
platform. Nick, I think you had said you got comfortable with the ability to dividend the $4 billion out because you
reviewed where you're thinking about where the EBITDA goes. Can you give us an update as to what your EBITDA
forecast is for that platform as you're looking at 2015?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Yeah, that hasn't gone public yet. We've worked with the rating agencies around that
plan but we've not gone public with the numbers on that and that won't be public until they go for the debt offering.
<Q - John P. McNulty>: Okay. Maybe then just as a follow-up on a different angle. Speaking to the Ag business when
we look at the, obviously you had some headwinds there, but when you look at the decremental margins they were
pretty significant. Maybe you can walk us through some of the issues there, especially considering that you were
getting some pricing that was noted in the earlier remarks?

<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Well, as you know, currency is a huge headwind for us in Agriculture. Jim, why don't
you take us through that?
<A - James C. Borel>: Yes. I think certainly currency and the other thing is volume based on corn acre, planted acre
declines that are expected, and we also saw insecticide volumes down based on the lower pressure of Helicoverpa in
Brazil versus a year ago, so mix had a negative impact, a slightly negative impact on margin in addition to the currency
and volume thing.
Operator
Our next question is from Kevin McCarthy from Bank of America.
<Q - Kevin W. McCarthy>: Yes. Good morning. I guess two part question on the Chemours spin. First on the
dividend, you took it up to $0.49 with the $100 million to be paid out by Chemours. Is there any opportunity to
maintain that $0.49 or should we expect it to revert to something like $0.46 or $0.47 equilibrating for that $100
million?
And then second on the repurchase, Nick, can you do an ASR to bring forward shrinkage of the share count or should
we expect execution pretty ratably over the 12 to 18 months? Thank you.
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yeah, I think that we've been clear relative to the dividend that the combined dividend
of Chemours and DuPont would equal the dividend that DuPont had just prior to the spin. The Chemours dividend is
their third quarter dividend, and I think that you can do the math going forward is what that would mean. Nick?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Yeah. And so as far as the returning of the midnight dividend back to the shareholders
through share buyback, what we've stated is over the 12 to 18 months, Kevin, we're going to look to see exactly what
tool and mechanism we use to secure that – complete that share buyback. There's potential for ASR, there's also
potential for open market, but it will be over that period of the 12 to 18 months' timeframe.
Operator
Our next question is from Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial.
<Q - Don D. Carson>: Thank you. A question on Ag. You've given us first half outlook, down low to mid-teens
operating earnings. What's your outlook for the second half, given how important Brazil is? And then you also talked
about 2015 being one of the most competitive seasons in recent years. So what's your view on the normalized growth
and end margin potential of Ag as we get into 2016 and beyond?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Jim?
<A - James C. Borel>: First of all, Don, I think the longer-term picture as you go forward in Ag, we still feel very
confident. Number one, the fundamentals under the markets remain strong, growing population and limited resources,
et cetera that beg for more science that we can deliver. And also our pipeline in both seed and chemistry continues to be
very strong. So we remain confident about our long-term trajectory. In terms of second half, obviously Brazil is going
to – the real, hard to predict exactly, but we're assuming that that's going continue to be a negative hurt. Probably too
early to call the Latin America planting expectations, but obviously we'll be watching that as we come out of – as the
U.S. gets planted and the market starts to adjust to expectations there.
<Q - Don D. Carson>: And just a follow-up; so what's your current top line and margins for a trend outlook for next
few years in Ag? Can you be more specific?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Sorry, you're really hard to hear, Don. Let me see if I got it. So you're looking for the
trend outline on both top line and bottom line for Ag for the next two years?

<Q - Don D. Carson>: Correct.
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Was that the question?
<Q - Don D. Carson>: Yes.
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Well that's a – Jim, how would you answer that?
<A - James C. Borel>: Well, I think that the answer's going depend on how the environment over the next 12 to 18
months plays out. So as I mentioned earlier, in the bigger picture we're still very confident about our trajectory. And
then the question is going be what happens with currency and planted acres in some of these crops over the next 12 to
18 months.
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yeah, stocks used, and so we are looking to see that that should be an improving
picture. I think as each quarter goes on we understand exactly where those numbers are coming out both here and in
Latin America, it's going to have the big impact on the recovery.
<A - James C. Borel>: We've got a number of new products that will be continuing to move forward in the
marketplace, and we continue to make sure we're disciplined around our costs as well during a kind of turbulent time.
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yeah, I think that's what is I think what differentiator is the pipeline. I mean we take a
look at the pipeline both in terms of the Crop Protection chemicals, we talked about insecticides then, fungicides in
terms of DP4114 and Leptra in terms of T Series soybeans penetration. And so we've got a very strong portfolio of seed
treatments, et cetera coming in. And I think that regardless of the environment, I think we've got a strengthening picture
for our Agricultural segment.
Operator
And our next question is from P.J. Juvekar from Citi.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Yes. Hi. Good morning. Ellen, one of the ways to combat FX is to get local pricing. Can you talk
about segments where you believe you have the ability to get pricing going forward?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yeah, P.J. So that's very much dependent on the sector and on the competitive nature
where if you're selling in Europe and you have European competitors, it's a little harder to get price than it is if you're
selling in Europe against U.S. or Asian-based competitors. So I mean I think the interesting thing is that based on the
fourth quarter, our teams have gone out and reinvigorated the pricing analysis down based on the currency change and
each individual product line, each individual president is driving the appropriate actions for their sector based on that,
where we make versus where the competitors make, and you can do the math balance to see where that comes out.
So there are opportunities and there are headwinds in that. And I think the most important thing is that our people are
on top of it and really driving that. But at the end of the day, our major focus is still on value in use, it's still on the
innovation as a differentiator, and we continue to use that. I mean I think you see that in Ag with the positive pricing in
a very difficult Ag environment where the pipeline and the new products are giving us benefit even when the acres are
down. So this is a detail orientation out in the field to really drive the best results.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: And just a quick follow-up on your biomaterials, bio fuels platform, you commented on that. How
does that platform compete at today's oil price? Thank you.
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Well, bioactives really aren't impacted by the price of oil, and that's where a
tremendous amount of growth and opportunity are coming from. We see it in the animal nutrition area. We see it in the
human nutrition area. We see it even in ethanol where increases in gasoline are really continuing to drive opportunities
there. So bioactives remain strong.
Now in the biomaterials, and specifically Sorona, margins are pressured by oil because lower feed stock costs for
competing carpet fibers. And so you're seeing that in their results and that there are headwinds associated with that.

And cellulosic ethanol, well that's just coming up, the plant's coming up this quarter and we're continuing to drive that.
So all in all, the bioactives areas, which is really where a tremendous amount of opportunity is, there is no headwind
from an oil standpoint.
Operator
Our next question is from Mike Ritzenthaler from Piper Jaffray.
<Q - Michael Ritzenthaler>: Yes. Good morning. Within Agriculture, obviously encouraging to see higher price in
such a competitive environment, but I'm curious if you can elaborate on how much further cost action is needed to sort
of buoy the operating income in that segment and kind of the nature of those cost actions and whether growers down
shifting on traits in North America and grower profits being more constrained globally influences how you would view
R&D investments over next couple years? And then if there's a way to quantify volume and price ex-Crop Protection?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yeah, I mean so look, we are a value in use seller. It is the genetics; it is the capability
of our seeds that creates the opportunity for us there. And farmers make the choice of the seed first. But, Jim, why don't
you elaborate on that?
<A - James C. Borel>: Well, a number of different aspects there. So first of all, farmers are obviously scrutinizing
pretty closely all of their input purchases. But that said, as Ellen said, as we deliver more value to the farmer, whatever
the commodity price, that's reflected in – we can capture part of that value. So we're continuing to move forward there.
You asked about cost. If I go back to the Fresh Start work that we worked across corporately, obviously the Ag
businesses were a part of that. So we've really been working on streamlining the operating model.
Productivity is a way of life so we're constantly looking for ways to improve productivity, to speed up operations and
focus our costs. You asked a little bit how that might impact R&D investments. I think the way I would describe that is
we are fully funding the strategic research projects that are going to drive the pipeline and the future value. Continue as
you normally would around making sure that we're really focused on the most important opportunities. So R&D
investment will continue strongly, particularly in the most important projects.
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yeah. As far as the seed Pioneer split goes...
<A - James C. Borel>: Seed Crop Protection.
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yes, I'm sorry, Seed Crop Protection. Crop Protection's sales weren't as impacted as
Pioneer's were. They did a little better from that standpoint, so plus or minus around that decline is Pioneer is a little
above and Crop's a little below. But a lot of that's going to play out. The season's not over yet. There's still a lot of
opportunity coming through North America in the second quarter and getting prepared for the summer safrinha season
in Brazil. So a lot of time left in this season for this year. And we're really excited about the products and the progress
that we're making.
<A - Gregory R. Friedman>: We have time for one last question.
Operator
Our last question is from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Vincent Stephen Andrews>: Thanks. You kind of just addressed some of this. But I wanted to reconcile with the
crop chem inventory levels being elevated in the Americas. You still sound very enthusiastic about Rynaxypyr and
Cyazypyr. So is it that those products will continue to grow sales this year but you might have some headwinds in the
balance of the portfolio?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: I think that's going to really depend on the pest pressure and as we come through the
season. So, Jim, some more color there?

<A - James C. Borel>: Yeah. First of all you're right. It will depend on pest pressure. We're positioned very well, and
we're continuing to expand Cyazypyr countries around the world as that moves through launch. We're starting to move
Pyraxalt and Zorvec as a fungicide forward, so Crop Protection and seed treatment in a number of countries. So Crop
Protection's pipeline continues to be a really important part of their growth and a way of continuing to strengthen
margins over time.
<Q - Vincent Stephen Andrews>: Jim, do you just have a quick sense whether you referenced corn acres in the order
book suggest farmers are switching to soy. Do you think it's more or less of a switch than what sort of is implied by
USDA forecast?
<A - James C. Borel>: At this time in the season it's almost impossible to say. Farmers are really just getting in the
field early stages. It's going to depend on what happens with the weather over next couple weeks and what goes into the
ground and what the final acres will be. So we don't have any better information than what you've heard.
