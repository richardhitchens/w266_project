MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome the General Motors Company's Second Quarter 2015
Earnings Conference Call. During the opening remarks, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the opening
remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is
being recorded, Thursday, July 23, 2015.
I'd now like to turn the conference call over to Randy Arickx, Executive Director of Corporate Communications and
Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Randy C. Arickx
Thanks, operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us as we review GM's financial results for the second

Mary T. Barra
Thanks, Randy, and welcome, everyone to the call, and glad you can join us today. I am really pleased to be able to talk
about our second quarter, because if we look at it, we have delivered strong earnings growth in the second quarter and
we posted a net income of $1.1 billion and an EBIT adjusted of $2.9 billion. And if you look across our regions from
North America, it was strong year-over-year performance in the quarter, it was anchored by a record $2.8 billion EBIT
adjusted and a 10.5% EBIT adjusted margin.
In Europe, we demonstrated a near breakeven quarter, which gives us confidence as we move forward. And in China,
we continued with strong performance despite, as we all know, a much more challenging market.
For the calendar year, we are on plan to increase our earnings and margins and consistent with that, we expect our
EBIT adjusted for the second half to be higher than the $5 billion EBIT adjusted we've posted through June.
So with this foundation, we are confident in our ability to achieve our 2016 target. So to just quickly look at the quarter,
our revenue was $38.2 billion, our EBIT adjusted was $2.9 billion and this is the second highest quarterly result on
record. Our earnings per share adjusted was $1.29, up 122% over last year and our adjusted automotive free cash flow
was $3.3 billion, very strong, up from $1.9 billion a year ago.
And we've also committed that each quarterly broadcast or earnings broadcast, we will talk about our return on invested
capital. Our trailing fourth-quarter average is 23.4%, and I think it demonstrates our disciplined capital allocation is
paying off as we look across the globe and how we invest.
With our strong performance in the cash we've generated, it has enabled us to return more than $3 billion to our owners
so far this year through the share buybacks that we announced early this year, as well as dividends. And I'm also
pleased that Fitch reaffirmed our performance by raising GM and GM Financials to investment grade.
So before we get into the Q&A, I want to, coupled with the strong financial performance and just give you a couple of
examples of things that we're working on and continuing to do to achieve the strategic priorities that we laid out last
year. First, as we look at technology and innovation, we do have a lot going on.
One example that I don't think a lot of people know about is we have just completed a ride-sharing project at Google's
headquarters, where we had 50 Chevrolet Spark EV. We learned a tremendous amount of ride sharing from a whole
ecosystem perspective, and a lot of those learnings are going into the CarUnity, car-sharing app that is being launched
with Opel in Europe, which allows consumers to rent their vehicles to others. This is one example what the urban
mobility space, as people call it.
From a connectivity space, we continue to grow OnStar and 4G LTE and we have over 1 million vehicles on the road
today with 4G LTE. We'll also see OnStar enter Europe with the launch of – when we launched the Opel Corsa. And
with OnStar, we'll enter Brazil as we launched the Chevrolet Cruze.
I think another important area in this space is with our GM smartphone integration technology. It allows your
smartphone whether it'd be Apple or Android to project certain things that you're very used to using on your phone onto
the car, not everything, but some key areas. This is really listening to customers and putting them at the center and
you're going to see us expand this to global markets very quickly.
So, I think you can expect to continue to see General Motors be very aggressive when we look at the technology and
innovation we're bringing in to the vehicle and for the whole ownership experience.
Let's move to another one of our strategic priorities or actually to, earning customers for life and building strong brand.
Let me just give you a couple highlights here. From a quality perspective, North America, we won four J.D. Power
Initial Quality segment awards for the Chevrolet Malibu, Equinox, Silverado Light-Duty Truck and the Spark, and
Chevrolet had 10 models in the top three of their segment. Just this week, they also announced the J.D. Power APEAL
Study.

Again, we had strong performance with four segment award winners and demonstrating continued improvement. From
the sales momentum perspective, with Chevrolet and GMC full-sized pickup, that momentum was continuing. Share
was up to 38.5% for the quarter, and that's a 2.9% year-over-year improvement. We also revealed additional products
with the 2016 Chevrolet Cruze, the Camaro and the Camaro Convertible, and they also received very positive reviews
with those vehicles.
In China, we achieved a record first half retail sales of 1.7 million vehicles, and we gained market share. And I think
it's very important, and I know we'll have the opportunity to talk more about China as we go through the call here, but
very important, an 83% increase in SUV sales and record sales for Buick, Cadillac and our Baojun brand. And just an
interesting fact with the Baojun brand, and this actually is a launch that is in July of the third quarter. But the Baojun
560 which is an SUV within the first 24 hours of launch, we had 15,000 orders. So, again, we'll talk more about China
but some important progress was made in the second quarter.
At GM Financial, our North America retail penetration grew to almost 30%, up from 10% a year ago. And it's
important to note that second quarter marked the first full quarter in which we've positioned GMF as our exclusive
lease provider. So, I think it demonstrates we're well underway with the GMF strategy that we've outlined.
As we look at driving core efficiencies, you'll see through the deck and also in the comments that Chuck and I will
make as we go through the Q&A, there's been a lot of work done just to continually have discipline and driving
efficiencies into every aspect of our business. But another way to drive core efficiencies is partnering, a very good
example of that is a recent agreement with Isuzu in the U.S. to produce the low cab forward trucks for Chevrolet, and
this will begin next year. And this is really important because it gives us a broader suite which is very important for the
commercial customers that they want one-stop shopping. So have this not only as an opportunity to have this truck, but
also we believe will help us sell more full-sized pickups.
So before I turn the call over to Chuck, I'd like to spend a minute or two talking about our 2016 targets. We believe the
results in the first half of the year demonstrates that we are on track to achieve the 2016 commitments we've made. If
you look at North America, a potential for achieving a 10% EBIT adjusted margin in 2016 is evidenced not only by
what we did in Q2, but with eight straight quarters now of year-over-year margin expansion. And on top of that, we got
some important launches.
We also project that there'll be continued high demand for trucks and SUVs, and our three-truck strategy is reaping
strong benefits. And that's even before the refreshed Silverado and the Sierra pickups with the new powertrain
enhancements hit the dealerships later this year.
And as we look at 2016, our launch schedule again is aggressive. We'll have replacements for the high volume
Chevrolet Cruze and the Chevrolet Malibu. And remember as we talked about, those have an estimated variable profit
improvement of about $1,500 per unit.
When we talk about Europe and achieving our goal next year to have breakeven performance, again, we're getting
closer to that goal. With the Astra launch later this year, we will have full availability of both our high volume Corsa
and Astra in 2016. And to look at that, those two models represent about 50% of our volume in Europe. And again, we
expect that these estimated variable profit improvement will be about $900 for the Corsa, and about over $1,200 for the
Astra.
So Chuck is going to talk about China a bit more, but I want to make a couple of points. First, we expect a more
volatile market in China as growth moderates. It hasn't changed our long-term view of China. We continue to believe
that the market will grow. There's estimates about 35 million units over the next 10- to 15-year period.
We are well positioned right now in that market and we want to continue to be well positioned to capitalize on that
growth. We have a very strong partner with SAIC. We are seeing the benefits of what we're doing with Cadillac and the
growth – and the season – additional growth. We have substantial growth opportunities with the Cadillac brand. And
you'll see across all of our brands, we're going to continue to have a very aggressive product cadence.

Having said that though, I think as we look at a market as it rapidly matures, we need to look at other ways to continue
to drive performance. And in China, we're also doing that with the captive finance capability that we're growing, our
increased after sales and OnStar.
So again, we're going to look at multiple ways to continue to drive the momentum in China, recognizing that there has
been a change.
So, in summary, a very strong quarter with an EPS adjusted of $1.29. We're confident as we execute through this year
and into next year. And I look forward to your questions. But right now, I'm going to turn it over to Chuck.
Charles K. Stevens
Thanks, Mary. I just wanted to take a couple of minutes this morning to provide some perspective on the quarter and
the first half results. In addition to a great second quarter, we also had a very strong first half for the company. Our
profitability, EBIT adjusted results for the first half, grew to $5 billion, up $600 million year-over-year when adjusting
for the impact of recalls last year. And importantly, EBIT adjusted margins for the first half were at 6.7%, up 110 basis
points year-over-year. Again, adjusting for the impact of recalls; great results and results that are very much on plan.
The results were broad based with all but one of our automotive regions posting year-over-year profit improvement
during the first half of the year.
And although we're very pleased with the strong performance year to date, we continue and will continue to take
actions that further position the company for long-term success. For example, the second quarter included a $300
million asset impairment charge for GM Thailand. This charge was largely related to ongoing strategic actions to
reconfigure and restructure our business, including focusing on core truck and SUV business in Thailand. We believe
that these actions will position the country for long-term, sustained profitability and drive return on invested capital to
the target levels that we want to achieve.
The restructuring action in North America announced during the quarter is another example of us reconfiguring the
business to improve our long-term profitability. I would like to spend a few minutes on China; by far, that's the biggest
concern being raised by our investors and the biggest concerns are around obviously, the moderating growth in China
and its potential impact on GM. So, let me provide some commentary on that topic.
At the beginning of the year, we had already planned for some industry moderation and increased price competition.
Our initial assumptions as we entered 2015 were 6% to 8% industry growth overall and 3% price deterioration on a
year-over-year basis. It has been clear to us for some time that the moderation is stronger and the pricing environment
more challenging than we anticipated.
However, I think it's important that despite these developments, we generated very strong performance in the second
quarter and the first half of the year. $1 billion in equity income in the first half of the year with 10.1% net margins,
which represents margin expansion on a year-over-year basis in a much more difficult environment in China.
We're able to generate these results specifically because we've been very proactively managing the market risks with
several actions, such as further optimizing mix by increasing productions of our SUVs. Mary mentioned year-to-date
SUV sales are up 83% versus 2014. The teams in China have been aggressively reducing costs by rolling out
cost-down, efficiency-up initiatives. And we've been working closely with our dealer body to manage inventory levels.
Clearly, on the back of these proactive measures, based on the results that you saw in the second quarter and the first
half, we're able to offset market and price pressures to continue to deliver strong earnings. I think it's important also to
point out that SGMW's Baojun portfolio continues to expand, and that provides General Motors with a unique
opportunity in the China market to compete strongly with domestic OEM portfolios. And particularly in the Tier 2, Tire
3 and Tier 4 cities, and particularly in the fast-growing SUV and MPV segments.
Looking forward, we are expecting continued moderation of industry growth, and we expect the macroeconomic
volatility to continue. And frankly, based on the current environment, we now expect the industry in China to grow for

the full year in low-single-digit range versus 2014.
And despite somewhat anemic growth in the first half of the year from an industry perspective, around 1%, our low to
mid-single-digit growth forecast is underpinned by several factors: first, the launch cadence by several OEMs including
General Motors that will introduce new models in the second half of the year which should spur demand.
Next, seasonality. Typically, the second half in China is the stronger half driven by national holidays in the fourth
quarter of the year. And then finally, the potential recovery from the current reaction to the volatilities in the stock
market. Clearly, June and thus far in July there's been pretty significant headwinds on a year-over-year basis. We don't
anticipate that that's going to continue through the year, but that's something we're going to have to monitor.
Despite our revised industry outlook, we expect to sustain our first half performance throughout the rest of the year,
specifically, increased market share and similar equity income levels. There are a number of drivers that give us
confidence in our outlook, which includes our new launches like the Buick Verano and the Baojun 560 SUV that Mary
mentioned, continued success of the Envision which is exceeding our expectations and continues to grow on a
year-over-year basis, and further growth in Cadillac.
Second, improved mix, again driven by recently launched products like the Buick Envision, the Baojun 730 and the
Baojun 560. Again, as we mentioned, SUV sales are up over 80% year-over-year and the Baojun brand sales are up
370% on a year-over-year basis. And third, further cost actions and efficiency improvement. I think the team
demonstrated in the first half of the year the ability to be agile and address headwinds and actively – proactively
mitigate those again based on our results.
I think it's also important to remember that our first half results, and we talked about this in the first quarter, were
negatively impacted by plant downtime and launch costs ahead of new product introductions. We also recognized one
of the areas causing elevated concerns in China related to pricing. And let me provide some context in how we think
about that as it relates to GM.
As I mentioned before in the past, we had experienced carryover price reductions of about 3% on a year-over-year basis
and generally we were able to largely offset that through material cost performance. For 2015, given the increased
pricing pressures, we're expecting price reductions in the 5% to 6% range give or take and obviously this is something
we'll monitor closely.
As a general rule of thumb, a 1% carryover price reduction at SGM is worth about $100 million of equity income for
GM, absent any mitigating actions, and I think that's important, absent any mitigating actions. Similar to the Q1 and
Q2, we will continue to look for opportunities and we plan to find opportunities to offset those price headwinds
including improved mix and cost efficiency.
As I mentioned, you'd expect the team is working hard on the cost side to ensure we protect our profitability. We're
highly focused on that. So bottom line, we recognize the market has become more challenging but we're confident in
our plan and we're taking the necessary actions to help mitigate these headwinds.
Finally with regard to our total company outlook for the balance of the year, we are very much on plan for improved
full-year profit and margin growth versus 2014, very much on plan in the first half. This will translate into EBIT
adjusted north of $10 billion on a total company basis and our expectations are, the second half is going to be greater
than the first half. And there will be assuredly puts and takes versus our original expectations as we move through the
year.
There have been already puts and takes versus our original expectation if you look at South America and some other
developments. But overall, we expect a very strong outcome for the company for the full year.
So that concludes our opening comments. We'll now move to question-and-answer portion of the call. Thanks.

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Rod A. Lache>: Good morning, everybody.
<A - Mary T. Barra>: Good morning, Rod.
<Q - Rod A. Lache>: Thanks for that – all those insights, especially on China. I was hoping you might just clarify a
few things for us. One is, Chuck, that 1% is about $100 million. Last year, that was a $44 billion revenue business
unconsolidated, so I would think that 1% is over $400 million and you might get half of that. So what are we missing
there? I would imagine that your fixed costs is up a little bit, just given the increasing capacity. And can you maybe
comment on maybe what the sensitivity is for every 1% move in volume for you, just given how your mix has shifted
today?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yeah. Let me talk about the price first. The price and the price impact is largely isolated to
SGM. Given SGMW's position in the market, their strength in the commercial vehicle segment, we're not seeing the
same kind of headwind. So, it's really around SGM. So, I think that carves off the pieces of the $44 billion.
<Q - Rod A. Lache>: Right.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Secondly, that carryover price. So, similar to all other markets, as we launch new products,
they're not faced with the same year-over-year price impact. So that would be the other driver of that, Rod. Why that's
$100 million versus just taking 1% of $44 billion. I hope that answers your question.
Clearly, on the fixed cost side, yes, as we mentioned in the first quarter and even in the first half there's some
incremental cost around manufacturing associated with the launch, incremental DNA. But there's still opportunities to
drive improvement in fixed costs in indirect, in SG&A, in driving overall efficiency and that's what the team is very
focused on in China. And again, from an overall industry perspective, it really depends on ultimately, how that plays
out. Our view right now is that in that low-single-digit growth in industry, we will see a reasonable improvement in
passenger vehicles and more headwinds in commercial vehicles in the context of that overall, so there's – that has a bit
of an impact on muting the impact on our overall results.
My perspective, Rod when looking on a year-over-year basis, the biggest risk to us or the biggest risk from a China
perspective is really pricing more than industry when we look at the overall picture.
<Q - Rod A. Lache>: What's the sensitivity for a 1% move in volume and can you give us maybe a little bit of insight
into – you mentioned two sources of growth, one is the Tier 2 through 4 regions and some of it is coming from the new
product. What's the exposure today to Tier 2 through 4 and what kind of volumes would you expect from some of these
new products?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Well, if you look at our overall volume in China, roughly half of it is SGM and half is
Wuling broad strokes. And within Wuling is Baojun, so the vast majority of Wuling sales are in Tier 2, 3 and 4 cities
and Baojun brand is up 370% year-over-year. So that kind of gives you the idea of the opportunity that we have in
those cities and the expected improvement there.
The pressure in the Tier 1 city is really where the foreign OEMs dominate and that's where the price pressure is and
that's where some of the volume pressures as well.
<Q - Rod A. Lache>: So what's the sensitivity for a 1% move? Is there a rule of thumb that we could use?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: I would think, if you – if it translated into a full $1 of revenue, it's going to be kind of
similar to the price sensitivity. I mean, it's hard to look at that without factoring in mix and where – I can't come up
with a general rule of thumb, Rod, on that because there's different drivers. It depends again where that 1% would fall.
<Q - Rod A. Lache>: Okay. One last thing, if I may. I know I'm taking too much time here. But in North America,
you're doing some pretty impressive margins, especially just in light of the fleet pricing and restructuring costs and

recall that you had.
There are a number of things that you've said before that are in your control, like product and material costs declines,
and some of that seems to be coming through. What should we be thinking, if you can just refresh our memory in terms
of the cost reduction expectation, net cost reduction for this year and next in North America?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Well, I've talked about material costs and carryover thus far. And overall, GPSC from a
corporate perspective, we generated about $1.1 billion of year-over-year improvement. Roughly $600 million to $700
million of that was in North America. Our expectations would be, we would see that continue into the second half of
the year.
Overall fixed costs, again, from a company perspective year-over-year, looks to be relatively flat to slightly up. We
continue to drive a lot of the efficiency with operations excellence. So overall cost, again, excluding the material costs
on new major kind of product programs will be down from a material cost perspective, relatively flat, fixed, and I think
that is also consistent for North America.
<Q - Rod A. Lache>: Same cadence into next year?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: We'll talk about next year when we come out and talk to you in January.
<Q - Rod A. Lache>: Okay. Thanks, guys.

Operator
Your next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Hi, John.
<A - Mary T. Barra>: Good morning.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: Just a first question on slide 14 on North America. I mean, I think you guys had alluded to
about $300 million hit in auctions for some recall actions, similar in what we saw in the first quarter where it's a little
bit larger. If we were to back that out, that would probably add about 1.1% to the 10.5% that you guys printed. Is that
about right, Chuck? Is that kind of where you shake out?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Well, the math is correct, John. And when you look at just that driver of the business, so
the results in North America, 10.5% margin because I think largely speak for themselves. And clearly one of the
headwinds that we had to offset in the quarter was that auction issue and the loss at auction issue on fleet. But as we
move through the rest of the year, there will be puts and takes as well. But clearly the core operating performance in
North America was very strong in the second quarter.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: Yeah. And I'm just trying to understand, I mean, if we were to back out those recall actions as
well as the restructuring, you probably would have been doing more like a 12.4% margin in North America. And
obviously, there will be puts and takes as we go through the rest of the year and going to 2016. But I mean, the ongoing
underlying performance is even stronger. Although 10.5% is impressive, it looks like the underlying performance is
even stronger than what is generally perceived. And I'm just trying to make sure we understand that right but I think
that's kind of about where the math shakes out.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: I certainly wouldn't dispute your math. My message would be first half of the year, North
America generated 9.7% EBIT margins, which to me demonstrates that we are very much on the path to a sustained
10% margin objective in 2016. So, we're very pleased with the results so far.

<Q - John J. Murphy>: Okay. And then just a second question if we think about South America, a 23% drop in
volume, yet there was almost no change in EBIT. Just curious, for that EBIT line to turn in the right direction, what
would it take? Because I mean you're holding the line on the 23% drop in volume. Could we be seeing some small
contribution coming from South America on a very small volume recovery?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: This goes back and we've talked about this before. This goes back to the actions we started
to execute in 2012 and have been consistently executing, and that is to continue to drive efficiency in the business
model in South America. And the team in South America did an outstanding job earlier this year when we saw the
industry performance and the growth and some of the headwinds in Brazil specifically, but now kind of spreading
through the rest of the region. It's a very, very proactive action. We talked about that a bit with the Q1 release.
We've cut our workforce, hourly and salaried by 20%. We're going to see the benefit of that in the second half of the
year and going into 2016. Frankly, I would expect the South America to see second half results kind of similar to last
year, which is relatively close to breakeven, even under the current economic situation. Hard to predict what's going to
happen, but under the current economic situation, I think you're going to see kind of the same cadence as last year. And
my takeaway is we are highly leveraged to any recovery in South America.
And I think the actions we've been taking over the last few years will put us in position to quickly get into a positive
profit position there.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: And similarly on Europe, it was a good performance, but there's a product launch in the
second half of the year and maybe some more restructuring that might go on. I mean, how should we think about the
remainder of this year because it looks like you're getting a breakeven already and just curious if you could hold the
line on that in the second half, or are there other events that might change the picture there?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yeah. Again, second quarter results is another proof point that the underlying business has
the capability, and we're very much on track to our 2016 commitment. Typically, if you look at Europe seasonally, Q3
is generally weaker than the second quarter just because there is broad-based shutdowns across the whole industry and
all the countries. So, seasonality would suggest some headwinds in the second half versus the performance in the
second quarter.
And as we talk about big launch with the Astra, so there will be some launch-related costs both manufacturing and
potentially marketing as we tail out of the year. But for me, it was very promising and very optimistic based on the
results in the second quarter that we are developing and executing to our 2016 commitment. The results are starting to
be a proof point around that.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: Great. And then, just lastly on the buyback program, I just wanted to make sure you guys
have a 10b5-1 program in place so you can buy through the blackout period. And also, is that runoff sort of a grid or is
there a real program in place so when the stock drops, there are significantly more buybacks? I'm just trying to
understand how that program is being run and if there's any blackout period or you can just run straight through the
quarter.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yeah. We have a 10b5-1 program. It will run through the next window, which will open
somewhere around July 28. We do have somewhat of a built-in flexibility where we can increase the amount of shares
that we're buying within that program depending on the performance to the stock.
Overall, on stock buyback, consistent with the commitments that we made when we rolled off the capital allocation
framework, we've been aggressive. We've been aggressive within the overall objective to drive our target cash down to
$20 billion. Bought back $2.1 billion thus far of a $5 billion program. And we're going to as aggressively and prudently
as possible continue to act because clearly, our stock is undervalued.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: Really good quarter. Thank you very much.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Thanks, John.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Brian, your line is open.
<Q - Brian Arthur Johnson>: Sorry. It takes [ph] to get it (32:16) off mute. In China, can you give us a sense – you
commented on retail versus wholesale in the quarter in the comments. So, just how that breaks up from brand and any
visibility you can give us into dealer inventory?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yeah. What clarity are you looking for on retail versus wholesale by brand, Brian? I
mean...
<Q - Brian Arthur Johnson>: Well...
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Second quarter, which brands...
<Q - Brian Arthur Johnson>: Yeah, in second quarter, which brands did wholesales run ahead of retail? Where did it
lag? And just, how you're thinking about that balance between the two?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yeah. If I look at quarter-over-quarter broad strokes in the second quarter, retail was down
slightly 1.4%; wholesale was up slightly 1.4%, so reasonably balanced. Where we're seeing good performance on a
year-over-year basis in the second quarter on retail, importantly, Cadillac and Baojun and in SUVs, which are up north
of 80%, and that same dynamic holds on wholesales.
But from a dealer inventory perspective, clearly, at the end of the second quarter as sales kind of trailed off, our
inventory picked up. We're not way out of range of our target, but picked up about 20,000 units. And you know, we
will work as we go through the second half of the year to make sure we align supply and demand. We want to make
sure that we proactively manage that with our dealers, and we've been doing that in the first half of the year. So, a little
bit out of balance at the end of the second quarter but not significantly.
<Q - Brian Arthur Johnson>: Okay. Second question on China is you've talked about the new GM kind of operating
model, some of the discipline we're seeing coming through in North America and Europe. How is that different in
China given the JV structure, and then how do you, in terms of the cost reductions you need in the way – in the light of
the deteriorating pricing situation, just how quickly can you get your JV partner on board with some of those moves
and how does it actually work?
<A - Mary T. Barra>: I think it works very well. The partners work day-to-day. I mean, even the senior leadership,
the team is very close to our SAIC partners. And so, we very proactively, as we started to see things change, together
worked to look for efficiencies, look to seize opportunities in the SUV market. Again with the portfolio that we have,
and we just launched the 560, which is a very important product for Baojun, an SUV. So, from the portfolio to
managing mix to looking for opportunities, we work on an integrated basis day-to-day with a very strong relationship.
So, there's no extra hurdle there to go after that.
<Q - Brian Arthur Johnson>: And are they able to move quickly should you need to adjust that [ph] level (35:03)?
<A - Mary T. Barra>: I'm sorry, I didn't hear the question.
<Q - Brian Arthur Johnson>: Would they be able to move quickly to adjust staffing levels or it's [indiscernible]
(35:11) barriers there?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: SAIC is a great partner and very, very commercially-minded. And we've demonstrated that
and we have regular meetings. They were just in Detroit early in June for the SGM board meeting and we were there in
April. So we are totally aligned on where this business needs to go.

<A - Mary T. Barra>: Yeah. And what I would also say is, in addition to having a great relationship with a partner
where we aggressively look at the challenges in the marketplace and how to manage the business appropriately. Our
head of China, Matt Tsien, was in town last week and Chuck, myself, Dan and others, we spend an incredible amount
of time making sure we have a good read of what's happening, what to expect and the actions we need to take, again, to
stay in front of it.
<Q - Brian Arthur Johnson>: Okay. And then final question, North America, just a little bit of rental car accounting.
Wholesales were ahead of production. Was that due to the return of the rental cars? Did that actually contribute to
EBIT net of the price impact or was that kind of a wash?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Well, you're right on the first part. Wholesale is being greater than production. Largely, it
was driven by auction disposals of rental vehicles. Generally, if you look at the overall EBIT impact, the rental vehicles
don't contribute a lot to the bottom line.
So that extra wholesale was not real accretive to earnings in the quarter. In fact, obviously, the auction loss had a bit of
a headwind impact for us.
<Q - Brian Arthur Johnson>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yep.

Your next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi.
<Q - Itay Michaeli>: Great. Thank you. Good morning and congratulations.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Thanks, Itay.
<A - Mary T. Barra>: Thank you.
<Q - Itay Michaeli>: So just a question on China again. Chuck, with the outlook I think for kind of flattish equity
income the second half of the year, where does that come to in terms of the China margin for 2015? And then any
updated thoughts around the prior kind of 9% to 10% mid-decade and beyond targets that I think you talked about for
China at the Investor Day?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yes. So, our outlook for the year – yeah, you're right with the math once again that it's
going to be a sustained performance in the second half of the year would put our equity income in the range, give or
take, of $2 billion. We have not moved off of our margin objectives in China of 9% to 10% net margins first half of the
year; we generated 10%, so we're not moving off that. And we have not moved off our longer-term guidance,
mid-guidance on continuing 9% to 10% margins. Clearly, we will continue to closely monitor the market in China.
We'll closely monitor the developments through the rest of this year, and potential implications over the next couple of
years. But we haven't changed our view either on this year or going forward yet.
<Q - Itay Michaeli>: That's very helpful. And then just moving along to Russia, any update on how that wind down is
going, maybe how we should think about roughly modeling that into 2016?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: The execution is going very well, very much according to plan. And as I talked about in Q1
when we announced this, I would expect the impact of Russia and European results to diminish as we go through the
year. And frankly, looking at Q3, Q4, it's going to be relatively immaterial based on our current views. So we will have
wound through those implications as we finish the sell down and the regular commercial operations that are still
impacting EBIT adjusted.
<Q - Itay Michaeli>: Terrific. And then just last question, on CapEx and cash flow, it does seem like CapEx is
running, I think, below the original guidance for the year. I know you've got some product launches in the second half
of the year, but love an update there. And also, you're still looking for free cash flow to be kind of flattish this year

versus last year? I'm not sure if there's an update there as well.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Sure. Capital spend first half of the year, $3.4 billion, which is relatively consistent with
last year first half.
We've got pretty significant launches as you think about the rest of the year after Cruze, Malibu. And we certainly
expect capital spending into the cash associated with that increase in the second half of the year. We're not moving off
of our $9 billion guidance for the year yet, Itay. We'll continue to monitor that as we go through the year.
As I've talked about free cash flow before, I said, flat to slightly up. Based on the performance we've seen so far, I
wouldn't necessarily change that perspective. But I might underline or emphasize slightly up on a year-over-year basis
our performances on cash flow is a bit ahead of plan. So we're optimistic that we'll be able to do better than we
anticipated but we're not changing that, the overall guidance yet.
<Q - Itay Michaeli>: Great. Thanks so much for all the detail today and congrats again.

Your next question will come from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.
<Q - Ryan J. Brinkman>: Hi. Good morning. Congrats on the quarter.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Thanks, Ryan.
<A - Mary T. Barra>: Thanks, Ryan.
<Q - Ryan J. Brinkman>: Maybe just to hone back in on China again but kind of dovetailing on that earlier South
America discussion. So you've proven very skilled at taking out cost in South America when volume declines. And the
team there is clearly very used to that. But in a downside scenario in China, what do you think decremental margins
look like? I don't know that there's really a precedent that we can point the investors to. So I'm curious whether you're
engaged in a type of downturn planning in China like I know that you do in North America. Any color would be
helpful, whether regard to flexibility of labor, ability to [ph] re-time (40:59) capacity expansion and stuff of that sort in
the off-chance that we do see not just a slowing but in fact, a real potential downturn.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: First, as Mary mentioned earlier, Ryan, we continue to expect China to grow. We haven't
changed our long-term view of China to be somewhere in the range of $35 million and we are not the only ones that do
that. Yes, clearly, we look at downturn scenarios. We look at potential implications if growth isn't as aggressive as we
thought it was and in a rapidly-maturing market, there is going to be increased volatility.
We are not anticipating a year-over-year sales decline yet. But clearly, that is something that we model and we look at
the opportunities to offset that. And what that would be, I'm not ready to share that at this point in time but we do that
across the whole company, across all the regions.
I would say that we have not moved off our guidance for the year and we have not moved off our 9% to 10% guidance
for 2015 and beyond at this point in time. And as I mentioned earlier, we'll continue to monitor the situation there and
if something changes, then we will communicate it appropriately.
<Q - Ryan J. Brinkman>: Okay. Great. Thanks. And then how do you think GM is positioned in China, relative to
some of the changes taking place in the market? You talked about the trend toward SUVs and CUVs. What about the
trend toward a greater portion of the sales taking place in those Tier 3, 4, 5 cities or interior of the country away from
sort of Shanghai, where you're really, really strong? Perhaps you can share, are you building out your dealer network
any differently? Did you already anticipate these changes? What are you doing to remain as successful in China as you

have been, but in a different environment?
<A - Mary T. Barra>: Well, I think if you look at even a couple of years back, I think the SGMW team was very good
at looking to see the shifts that were coming from – with the creation of the Baojun brand and then not only passenger
vehicles from the commercial vehicles that they are so good at building to the SUVs. And with the MPV that we rolled
out and now the SUV that's coming out. So, I think it was anticipating where the market was going in, and that's
something also with the partner and the senior leadership, we look and try to look over the horizon to see where the
market is going to be, where the opportunity is.
And then, that is a very capable team from an execution perspective. They have a very good, strong brand reputation
across the country. And if you look at this Baojun 560 SUV, it has, I'd say, some pretty substantial technology in it
when you look at connectivity, when you look at crash, when you look at the material strategy with high-strength steel,
so I think we are very well positioned and I think somewhat uniquely positioned in that we have such a very important
partnership with a very strong domestic maker in the China market.
<Q - Ryan J. Brinkman>: Okay. And then just last question, I know you're often limited in what you can say relative
to labor negotiations, right? But I would just observe that it seems like you announced in 2Q a tremendous amount of
investment in jobs and factories in the United States. Couldn't help but noticed that these were ahead of rather than in
conjunction with the labor negotiations and sort of stood in contrast to Ford which actually, during a period of time, I
heard you're making these announcements, talked about moving small car production to Mexico.
So, maybe you could just comment as to whether this is a reflection of your strong relationship with UAW that you
don't need the time in these negotiations in conjunction – these announcements in conjunction with the negotiations and
that you do expect a good outcome with the partners that maintains or even enhances your competitiveness?
<A - Mary T. Barra>: So, again, I'm not going to comment on the specifics. But I think when you look at it, we are
working with the UAW, having conversations on a daily, weekly basis. And so, we're going to look at where we have
capacity announced and expansion, new product investments to make. And we look at doing that at the right time. And
it's a continual cycle – I'd say one of the takeaways is that the continual discussion. But I – and I think we have
improved the relationship and both parties work hard to do that.
That's not to say that there's not issues that we've got to solve and we're actively working and doing that and using our
creative and constructive problem solving to look at the issues and find the right solution that's going to be good for the
company and help us improve our competitiveness as well as the – something that is good for the workforce, because
the UAW as you step back aside from the negotiations, we work jointly together on safety and I think our safety
leadership represents that. The quality of work we're doing and we're taking that to the next level.
When you look at the scheming that we've done in our plants to be able to get more midsized trucks and every single
full-sized truck and SUV out, again, that's doing that in partnership. So that's the fundamentals of the relationship. We'll
work through the issues and again, we're constantly talking so it's not – it may have been in the past as saving things up
for the negotiation, but I don't want to underemphasize that we do have some important work to do and we're on it.
<Q - Ryan J. Brinkman>: Okay. No, that's great to hear. Thanks and congrats again on a great quarter.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Thanks.

Your next question will come from the line of Patrick Archambault with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Patrick K. Archambault>: Oh, yeah. Thank you. Good morning and congrats on the results. A couple of China
questions and then one kind of broader product question. Just, I think it was hit on a little bit in Ryan's question, but the
mix impact like how do we think about it, net-net, some of the trends that are going on? It's obvious that you're having

a lot of success and the Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities where Wuling and Baojun are doing very, very well, right? But on the
flipside, right, you have the more traditional SGM products that are more coastal that one would think are higher
margin. They're certainly higher revenue that are flattish and down certain months and then I guess overlaying that, you
have this SUV trends.
So I'm just trying to think, as we, forgetting about cost saves for a second, just as we think about the variable
implications of those trends. Where does that push margins as we go forward?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Well, I think and let's bifurcate just a bit between SGM and SGMW and we talked about
before when we talk about 2015 and what we expected to do. Pricing headwinds and clearly they are more challenging
than we thought, would be offset by mix, mix driven by SUVs and Cadillac growth. We're seeing both of that in the
SGM channel.
So the growth in SUVs up 80% and Cadillac is up year-over-year and we always look at that not only for 2015 but
beyond as the way to continue to maintain the margins in China.
SGMW, I think you have two implications. You have the passenger car growth in the Baojun brand. That's really going
to help us in Tier 2, 3 and 4 cities and you have SUVs. And the SUV market is split between kind of premium SUVs
like Buick Envision, the Trax as an example, Encore and other products and sold in the Tier 1 cities and the lower cross
SUVs, which are a big growth dynamic in Tier 2 and 3 and 4. So SUVs apply to both Tier 1 and Tier 2, 3 and 4 cities.
Cadillac applies to Tier 1. That mix is what's going to help us maintain those 9% to 10% margins assuming conditions
normalizes, we expect they will and get back on a growth trajectory in China.
<Q - Patrick K. Archambault>: Okay, So it sounds like despite the fact that some of the local oriented stuff is doing
way more than you would have thought. It's still within the realm of being able to stick with that mix statement. One
other question on – just the impact of credit in China. So, I take it that's captured in GMF rather than in your China
operating segment. Have you guys kind of disclosed an order of magnitude there because I can imagine that that's
probably starting to get important?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: On the finance company equity income?
<Q - Patrick K. Archambault>: Correct. Yeah.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yeah. That will be in GM Financials result and it will be in GM Financials results that they
published later today and broad strokes, it's about $25 million a benefit in the second quarter on our equity share in
GMF.
<Q - Patrick K. Archambault>: Got it. Got it and helpful. And then, Mary, maybe more of a product question.
There's no question there from a technology perspective. There's a tremendous amount happening, everything down to
the 4G LTE stuff that's being rolled out aggressively to the Super Cruise for next year. But there's been a lot written in
the last week actually just about some of the security concerns. And so, I was just wondering how you were thinking, I
mean, you guys probably have the most aggressive rollout of connected cars of almost anybody. And I was wondering
just how – what kind of security protocols you're able to put in place to sort of make people comfortable that those risks
are manageable?
<A - Mary T. Barra>: Yeah. Good question then. It's something we've been working on for a couple of years now and
very actively in the way that we look at the whole system and the level – really when you look cybersecurity, you got to
look at levels of security because you look at vehicles on the road today, they're on the road for 11 years. And so as we
move into a world that has more connectivity, you've got to make sure not only do you have many layers of protection
in the design of the vehicle, but then also what's very important is our over-the-year capability as well that if something
happens, you're able to quickly go in and prevent and correct if that's necessary.
So we have – we named last year [ph] mark champion (51:49), naming a Chief Product Security Officer, Jeff
Massimilla, who's on our team who lives and breathes this every day. We partnered with external experts. We regularly
do testing. But this is an area you have to stay diligent on and keep looking because it's across all of industry. So we
take it very seriously. We work hard at it every day, and it's a key focus.

And your next question will come from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with CLSA.
<Q - Emmanuel Rosner>: Hi. Good morning, everybody.
<A - Mary T. Barra>: Good morning.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Good morning.
<Q - Emmanuel Rosner>: I wanted to ask you first about the pricing environment in the U.S. So obviously in your
North American earnings walk, it seems like focusing on the retail side, pricing was sort of like slightly north of flat,
which is I see a pretty good performance. At the same time, when I look at your slide number 12, and you bring back
the ATP and incentive information from J.D. Power, it seems like your incentives are sort of like just been steadily but
fast increasing throughout the quarter, from like 10% of ATP in the first month, 11%, and then 12% finally in June.
And then from what we heard so far in July, there's been also increased incentives, in particular, on the trucks. Would
you be able to comment on – are you seeing sort of a deterioration of the U.S. pricing or a need to add incentive in
specific segments?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: I'll give a broad perspective. Overall, in the U.S. industry this year, our expectations are, on
a retail basis, a relatively benign pricing environment. We talked about that when we talked about carryover pricing
back at the beginning of the year, and that's playing out. And I would expect to see pricing improve as we move
through the rest of the year and start to launch some of the new products.
In Q3, Q4 or early Q4, the carryover pricing dynamic will continue as it has been in the first part of the year. From an
incentive spending perspective, that will – as a percent of transaction price, that'll toggle back and forth depending on
specific go-to-market strategies at any point. My expectation, Emmanuel for the rest of the year would be that we will
be at kind of the run rate we've been for the entire year, somewhere in the range of 10.5% to 11% for the balance of the
year. Overall industry has been disciplined, we've been disciplined and we're going to continue to be disciplined. But
there can be some volatility within any individual month for sure.
<Q - Emmanuel Rosner>: Okay. That's great to hear. And then my second question is on China, actually. So when I
think about China, I totally agree with you with – there's some volatility now and obviously, still a very exciting market
for the long term. The part that sort of like worries me in the midterm, is more the amount of capacity that's coming in
into China. And so, when I last met your China team, it sounded like you wanted to increase your capacity from 4
million units, to 5 million units over the next few years. Is that still the goal, and to the extent that you would see a
pronounced slowdown do you still have room to pullback on some of these capacity additions?
<A - Mary T. Barra>: Yeah, absolutely. Actually, adding capacity in China is something that we can do quite quickly.
So, we'll continue to monitor the situation and look at as we have our plans to add capacity to do it prudently with a
daily read on where the market is and then looking over the horizon from a trend of where it's going. So we will be
monitoring that closely and we'll only do when we think it's prudent to do.
<Q - Emmanuel Rosner>: Is there a rule of thumb that you could point to, like how many months or years in advance
the plans that are in place will have to happen, let's say, in the next six months, a year? And then how far out can you
actually sort of pullback some of these plans?
<A - Mary T. Barra>: Well, I mean, I think there's a lot of different ways to add capacity. You can add capacity by
increasing line rate which is more equipment changes, or smaller expansions all the way to all-new plan and each of
those have different timelines. But I would also say China is one of the quickest across all of those aspects of being
able to add capacity. So, again, those are all the levers we have and just a for instance example, if you see you still need

capacity but it might be slightly less than what you thought, you can pick an option of expanding an existing plan or
increasing line rate et cetera.
So, we'll be looking at all of that. That's something we've a lot of experience from around the globe that we bring to the
table as we work with our partner. So, again, it'll be very dynamic and based on not only the day, the month, but what
we see and what we predict the trend will be as we go forward.
<Q - Emmanuel Rosner>: Great. Thanks for the color.

And your next question will come from the line of Matt Stover with Susquehanna Investment Group.
<Q - Matthew Stover>: Thanks very much. Most of my questions have been hit. But a housekeeping item on the cash
flow, could you give us a sense of any cash used for funding restructuring actions? And then any cash that would've
been impacted by recall-related outflows?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yeah. We indicated at the beginning of the year that we expected roughly $1.2 billion of
restructuring-related cash, and about $1.5 billion of recall-related cash to impact the results this year. Still generally in
line with that first half. It was about half, and the second half will be about half. And so very much according to plan on
both restructuring and recall-related cash.
<Q - Matthew Stover>: Okay. So I'm just trying pencil in backing out what happened in the first quarter. If I assume
that half of both of those items occurred in the first half that would be about right, Chuck?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yes, that would be broad strokes about right.
<Q - Matthew Stover>: Okay. And then the second thing was on the ramp up of the new product in North America.
Do you expect for that to have a bigger impact on the incremental cost at the beginning of 2016, or should that begin at
the end of 2016? Or sorry, end of 2015 rather?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Well, I think there's two aspects of that. There's pre-production startup and launch from the
manufacturing perspective, and I think that'll primarily hit in 2016. And then there's launch-related costs, which would
be advertising. On any major program, when you look at both of those, they're roughly about the same. The launch,
manufacturing costs and the marketing launch costs are roughly the same. So again, thinking about the launch cadence,
the Cruze, Malibu and everything else, I would think there's going to be some manufacturing primarily in the fourth
quarter and marketing primarily in kind of the first quarter and second quarter next year, broad strokes.
<Q - Matthew Stover>: Okay. Great. Thanks very much.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yes.

And our final question will come from the line of Dan Galves with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Daniel V. Galves>: Thanks, guys. Great execution in a variety of areas; congratulations.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Thanks.
<A - Mary T. Barra>: Thanks.
<Q - Daniel V. Galves>: Yeah. I had a couple of questions on North America for the back half. Is there any way you
can help us with wholesale shipments. Typically, it looks about kind of even first half versus second half but maybe
with the increased rental disposals in the first half, it would be a little lower in the second half. Any color you can give
us there.

<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Good questions. I mean typically second half of the year generally in line. I would suggest
that as we cycle through the third quarter there we're going to work our way through these auction losses; then you
have the fourth quarter with the Thanksgiving and Christmas Holiday. So for planning perspective, I would think
relatively flat to slightly down in the second half of the year versus the first half on wholesales, again, just given the
seasonality in the fourth quarter.
<Q - Daniel V. Galves>: Okay. Great. And then just going back to January, like one thing on North America, you said
was that it looks to me that you were expecting fixed cost increases related to launches to offset the, to more than offset
the reductions in material costs. I mean it looks like through the first half, you're way ahead on that metric with material
costs down a lot. Fixed costs basically flat.
Should we be expecting that still like some really significant fixed cost increases in the back half or has there been a
change in the view?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: I think the fixed costs in the second half of the year will be up versus the first half
associated with the launch-related costs. The team in North America has done a dynamic, great job in scheming the
business and driving the efficiency in the first half but again, I would expect to see launch related costs, fixed costs be
up in the second half and similar level of material performance in the second half of the year as well that we saw on the
first half.
<Q - Daniel V. Galves>: Okay. Great. And just one more on Europe. Are there any kind of big pieces you can give us
in terms of the sequential improvement from Q1 to Q2? I know volume was up a bit and were the Russia losses
moderating quite a bit in Q2 versus Q1.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yeah. Russia loss has moderated for sure in Q2 versus Q1, and pricing likely got better in
Q2 versus Q1, it did get better as the Corsa and Vivaro ramped up. Those would be the two biggest drivers Q2 versus
Q1.
<Q - Daniel V. Galves>: Okay. So, that was more GM specific than industry-wide on the pricing improvement.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yeah.
<Q - Daniel V. Galves>: Okay. Thanks very much.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Thank you.
<A - Mary T. Barra>: Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Mary Barra for closing remarks.
Mary T. Barra
Great. Thank you very much. Well, I appreciate everybody's participation on the call. Hopefully, you saw we recognize
that China's big concern, obviously the market has changed, more volatile. There's – it's moderating. We try to really be
specific and share with you how we think about China and have that be the foundation for what we think and we're
going to keep the pressure on ourselves to deliver in the second half of the year. But rest assured, we are actively
monitoring it daily and also be working very hard to proactively position ourselves to continue to drive the performance
that we have.
I'd also like to say as you look across all the regions and I won't repeat all of them, but there are a lot of challenges and
opportunities in each of the regions, and hopefully you see the GM leadership team is really driving seizing
opportunities and mitigating challenges in a very proactive fashion. We think our overall results demonstrate the very

strong earnings potential off this company.
And we believe when you look at what we've been able to accomplish in the first half of this year, it lays the foundation
for the commitments that we've made for 2016 that we are very focused on executing and providing the proof point that
we're doing what we say we're going to do. As we move forward, we're going to continue to execute with discipline,
with all aspects of our plan, including our capital allocation framework, and we are confident that we will continue to
drive profitable growth, strong returns on invested capital, which we demonstrated this quarter all to drive shareholder
value. And that is our focus day in and day out.
So, thanks again, everybody. I really appreciate your time.
