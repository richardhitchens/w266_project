MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Campbell Soup First Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. At this time, all
participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will
follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I will now turn the call over to your host, Ken Gosnell, Vice President, Finance Strategy, Investor Relations at
Campbell Soup. Please go ahead.
Kenneth Gosnell
Thank you, Stephanie. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the first quarter earnings call for Campbell Soup's fiscal
2016. With me here in New Jersey are Denise Morrison, President and CEO; Anthony DiSilvestro, CFO; and Blake
MacMinn, Senior Manager of Investor Relations. As usual, we've created slides to accompany our earnings
presentations. You will find the slides posted on our website this morning at investor.campbellsoupcompany.com. The
call is open to the media who'll participate in a listen-only mode.
Today, we will make forward-looking statements which reflect our current expectations. These statements rely on
assumptions and estimates which could be inaccurate and are subject to risk. Please refer to slide two or our SEC
filings for a list of factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in
forward-looking statements.
As we said in this morning's news release, in fiscal 2016, the company incurred mark-to-market losses associated with
interim remeasurement of certain U.S. pension plans. The impact on EPS was $0.26 per share. The company also
incurred restructuring charges, implementation cost and other related costs associated with the new organizational

structure and cost savings initiatives. The impact on EPS was $0.07 per share. Our comparisons of fiscal 2016 with
fiscal 2015 will exclude these items for comparability. Because we use non-GAAP measures, we have provided a
reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is included in our appendix.
With that, let me turn the call over to Denise.
Denise M. Morrison
Thank you, Ken. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Today I'll share my
perspective on the overall operating environment, the changes we've implemented at Campbell, and our first quarter
business performance.
The seismic shifts that we've outlined in previous meetings continue to impact the food industry, which remains under
pressure from new, global economic realities, major demographic shifts, changing consumer preferences for food with
an emphasis on health and well-being, and the continued growth of digital marketing and e-commerce channels.
Looking at the operating environment, conditions remain challenging. In the United States, the economic situation is
mixed. Unemployment continues to improve, but consumers remain very cautious. We're continuing to see Americans
save more and spend less amid the uncertain economic climate. Outside the U.S., we're seeing macro-economic
challenges in other markets where we have significant operations, including Canada, China and Indonesia.
Generating growth in this environment has been and remains difficult. As a result, the industry continues to respond
with consolidation, spin-offs, aggressive cost cutting programs, and other measures to improve operational efficiency.
Meanwhile, food retailers continue to respond by reconfiguring existing stores with a focus on the perimeter by
launching new, smaller formats and by investing heavily in e-commerce capabilities.
Several years ago, we recognized the early signs of many of the trends that the industry is currently facing and we
started taking steps designed to best enable Campbell to navigate the changing landscape. While we've made progress
through fiscal 2015, our actions haven't been sufficient. That's why last year we put a bolder plan in place to reshape
Campbell. We began fiscal 2016 after successfully implementing significant changes to align our enterprise structure
with our strategy. We formed three new divisions with clearer portfolio roles. We began implementing a three-year,
$250 million cost savings initiative that is delivering earlier than expected benefits.
We created a new integrated global services organization to provide services to our divisions more efficiently and
effectively. We initiated the first phase of zero-based budgeting to instill greater cost discipline and create an ownership
mindset among employees. We added another growth engine in Garden Fresh Gourmet to bolster our Campbell Fresh
division and extend our presence and scale beyond produce into the deli section of the store perimeter. As a result of
these actions, we entered fiscal 2016 better positioned to execute against our strategic imperative. With that as context,
let me turn to our first quarter results.
I'm pleased with our overall performance to start the year. Organic sales in the quarter were comparable to a year ago
and consistent with our expectations, given that we're cycling an increase of 5%. I'm particularly pleased with our third
consecutive quarter of adjusted gross margin expansion and the improvements we've made in our supply chain.
Importantly, we delivered strong, adjusted EBIT and EPS performance.
As you saw this morning, we revised our annual guidance. Given our improved margin outlook for the year, we raised
guidance for adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS, while we lowered sales guidance to reflect increased currency
headwinds. Our new reportable segments align with our three new divisions. Anthony will discuss our revised guidance
and provide a detailed review of our segment results in a moment, but I wanted to offer my perspective on several
notable items within each of our three new divisions
Let's start with our largest division, America's Simple Meals and Beverages. As a reminder, we're managing this
division for moderate growth consistent with the categories in which we operate and for margin expansion. As we've
discussed with you before, we're focused on increasing price realization, optimizing promotional spending, and
improving our supply chain performance. While we have more work to do in its early days, I'm encouraged by the

progress the Americas team made on all three fronts.
As a result of our pricing and lower promotion activity, soup volumes declined as expected, consumption was soft in
the quarter, but this is not surprising due to the fact that our promotional activity and new advertising campaigns started
later in the quarter versus prior year. In early October, we began airing our new Made for Real, Real Life advertising.
Built around the strategic insights we've shared with you about the changing mosaic of the American family, this
campaign represents a major departure for Campbell and depicts how our real food fits into real people's lives in an
authentic and relatable way. Digital media is playing a larger role in this campaign than in previous efforts. Looking
ahead, we expect improved sales performance in the second quarter as our marketing spending increases and the
campaign gains momentum.
As we talked about in July, we're focused on fewer, bigger innovations in the Americas division. While our new
Swanson bottled broth is off to a slower start than anticipated, both Campbell's Fresh-Brewed Soup in K-Cups and
Campbell's Organic Soups are meeting expectations. The highlight in this division was the significant gross margin
expansion. A major improvement this quarter was our supply chain performance, as evidenced by better customer
service levels. We're cycling significant supply chain challenges, especially in transportation and warehousing. We're
also benefiting from the mild inflationary environment this quarter. That said, the supply chain team has driven results
ahead of expectations. Overall, the new Americas Simple Meals and Beverage division is off to a promising start in
delivering against its portfolio role.
Our Global Biscuits and Snacks division unifies our Pepperidge Farm, Arnott's and Kelsen businesses, and its portfolio
role is to expand in developed and developing markets while improving margins. This division, too, is off to a
promising start in fulfilling its portfolio role with organic sales growth, improved gross margins and strong earnings.
I'm especially encouraged by our sales performance in our core markets, the U.S. and Australia. In U.S. biscuits and
bakery, our Pepperidge Farm brands performed very well, driven by strong growth in crackers and fresh bakery, partly
offset by declines in cookies. Our Goldfish business had a particularly strong quarter with double-digit sales growth.
Turning to developing markets, we drove organic sales growth in Malaysia, but we're continuing to keep a close eye on
Indonesia where the challenging economic conditions we outlined in September continue to impact our business. As we
stated at that time, we believe it's important for Campbell to become more geographically diverse, despite short-term
economic pressure in developing markets.
Our third division is Campbell Fresh, which includes Bolthouse Farms, Garden Fresh Gourmet and our refrigerated
soup business. Here, we're focused on accelerating sales growth and expanding into new packaged fresh CPG
categories. Reported segment sales increased 8% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of Garden Fresh Gourmet
acquisition, sales declined 3%. Let's take a closer look at what drove the decline.
In Bolthouse Farms, we delivered mid-single-digit sales growth in the CPG business behind premium beverages and
refrigerated salad dressings as we cycled double-digit growth in the prior year. However, these gains were more than
offset by declines in our Farms business, which includes our fresh retail carrots business, where we're the market
leader, and our ingredients business. Sales were down in carrots, although we grew share. As a reminder, carrots are an
important business in that they provide both scale in produce and an effective refrigerated logistics system for our CPG
business.
The main culprit of the sales decline was the ingredients business. As we discussed at our Investor Day in July, the
carrot concentrate business began softening last year due to weak demand in Japan. That softness accelerated in the
first quarter. We expect the rate of decline in ingredients to moderate, especially in the back half of the year.
While this is not the growth profile we expect from this division, we remain enthusiastic about C-Fresh and especially
the CPG business. We have compelling brands, delicious products, a steady stream of on-trend innovation, investments
to expand juice and salad dressing capacity, and a strong team leading the business. We expect sales in our packaged
fresh CPG business to accelerate as the year progresses, driven by the continued expansion of 1915, our cold-pressed
ultra-premium juice line, and the strong spring innovation suite for super-premium beverages and salad dressings.

Now a word on Garden Fresh Gourmet, the integration into C-Fresh is on track, and there have been no major
surprises. As we outlined in July at our Investor Day meeting, we're focused on driving distribution and increasing
market penetration beyond its Midwest stronghold.
Before wrapping up, I want to spend a moment on our cost savings initiative. We remain focused on transforming our
cost structure and creating an ownership mindset, where employees treat every dollar as if it were their own. Our
streamlined organization, our ZBB [Zero-Based Budgeting] efforts, and our integrated global services organization are
all having a positive impact on both our cost and our culture.
I'm very pleased with our progress in all these areas, particularly in IGS [Integrated Global Services]. This group is key
to driving cost savings and building new capabilities. But IGS is about more than efficiency and effectiveness. Beyond
the cost savings and capability building underway, IGS is helping to spur significant cultural change by fundamentally
altering the way work is performed at Campbell.
Looking at our three new divisions and IGS, it's still early days, and we have more work ahead of us to fully unlock the
potential of our redesigned enterprise structure, but we're off to a solid start. Today, we're better positioned to execute
against the four strategic imperatives we outlined in July.
First, we're leveraging our purpose, real food that matters for life's moments, as a filter for strategic decisions. For
example, we've made recipe changes to several of our core North America products, and we continue to engage
consumers in open dialogue about the ingredients we use and the rationale behind our decisions as we strive to set the
standard for transparency in the food industry.
Second, we're shifting more of our marketing budget to digital channels and remain committed to growing our
e-commerce capabilities. Third, we're advancing health and well-being imperative across our company. Our new 1915
ultra-premium juices are meeting our expectations and we've had other recent successes, including Campbell Organic
Soups and the distribution of carrot snacks into the New York City school lunch program. And finally, we remain
focused on expanding in developing markets, particularly in Southeast Asia, with an emphasis on Malaysia and
Indonesia. In China, we've added resources to expand Kelsen in anticipation of a positive Chinese New Year.
In summary, these are unprecedented times of change marked by challenging economic conditions. In the food world,
consolidation and intensified competition are disrupting and altering the landscape. At Campbell, we remain clear-eyed
about our challenges, focused on the consumer, responsive to our customers, and dedicated to delivering against our
purpose. I'm confident the actions we're taking will set Campbell apart from other food companies and strengthen our
growth trajectory over time.
I look forward to answering your questions, but now let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Anthony
DiSilvestro.
Anthony P. DiSilvestro
Thanks, Denise, and good morning.
Before reviewing our results and updated guidance, I wanted to give you my perspective on the quarter and outlook for
the balance of the year. As Denise mentioned, organic sales were in line with our expectations after lapping a solid
year-ago quarter. We made good progress on gross margin, which increased 260 basis points on an adjusted basis,
benefiting from net price realization and supply chain performance while cost inflation moderated. I'm very pleased
with the progress we're making against our cost reduction initiatives, delivering $30 million of savings in the first
quarter, ahead of our expectations, and as I'll share later, allowing us to raise our 2016 savings target.
Our improved outlook for cost inflation and additional cost savings will enable us to both fund investments in
longer-term innovation and raise our full-year guidance for adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS. And since we last updated
you, we are experiencing an additional one point of headwind from currency translation across the P&L as the U.S.
dollar continues to strengthen.

Lastly, as we indicated on our fourth quarter call, we have changed our reporting segments to align with our three new
divisions and changed our method of accounting for pension and post-retirement benefits, both of which I will cover in
my comments. I'll begin with the benefit accounting change and then discuss our results and updated guidance.
To provide greater transparency into our financial results, we are changing our method of accounting for pension and
post-retirement benefits. Previously, actuarial gains and losses were deferred and amortized into earnings over several
years. In our case, we have been amortizing significant actuarial losses which arose over time, primarily from declining
interest rates.
Under the new mark-to-market method, which has been applied to all prior periods, actuarial gains and losses will be
recognized immediately into earnings rather than amortized. We will identify the mark-to-market adjustment as an item
impacting comparability and excluded from our adjusted results. Mark-to-market adjustments are recognized on
remeasurement dates typically year end.
What's shown on this chart is the impact on our fiscal 2015 full year and first quarter adjusted results from removing
the actuarial loss amortization. Recasting our full year 2015 results increases adjusted gross margin by 70 basis points,
adjusted EBIT by $97 million and adjusted EPS by $0.19. For the first quarter of 2015, the impact is an increase of 60
basis points on gross margin, $21 million of EBIT, or $0.04 per share. It is important to note that the benefit accounting
change has no impact on cash flow.
In the presentation of our first quarter 2016 results and guidance, all comparisons to 2015 are against this recasted 2015
adjusted base.
Unrelated to the change in benefit accounting method I just described, we are required to remeasure certain U.S.
pension plans quarterly during 2016, as a result of a program in which we offered and paid lump sums to plan
participants no longer with the company. This remeasurement led to a mark-to-market loss of $0.26 per share in the
first quarter.
For the first quarter, net sales on an as-reported basis declined 2% to $2.2 billion, primarily due to the negative impact
of currency translation. Excluding currency and the impact of the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition, organic net sales
were comparable to the prior year, as net price realization from both higher list prices and lower promotional spending
was offset by lower volumes.
Reflecting a 440 basis point increase in margin, adjusted EBIT increased 23% to $479 million, benefiting from a higher
gross margin percentage, savings from our cost reduction initiative, and lower advertising reflecting a shift in spending
to later in the year. These positive drivers were partly offset by currency translation, which had a 4 point negative
impact on EBIT, the equivalent of $0.03 per share. Adjusted EPS increased 22% to $0.95. Just to be clear, EPS growth
on an adjusted basis is not impacted by the accounting change, but reflects improved operating performance of the
business.
Breaking down our sales performance for the quarter, reported net sales declined 2%, with organic sales comparable to
the prior year. Within organic sales, volume and mix subtracted two points, which was primarily driven by U.S. soup
within Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, and the carrot ingredients business within Campbell Fresh. Higher
selling prices in Americas Simple Meals and Beverages contributed one point, reflecting our pricing actions on
Condensed Soup, Prego Pasta Sauce, and Foodservice in the U.S. and across the Canadian portfolio. Lower
promotional spending in Global Biscuits and Snacks also added one point to sales growth. Currency translation had an
adverse impact of three points on the top line.
Our two primary foreign currencies, the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, both declined against the U.S. dollar. To
complete the bridge, our most recent acquisition, Garden Fresh Gourmet, contributed one point to net sales in the
quarter.
Our adjusted gross margin percentage increased by 260 basis points, to 37.9%, exceeding our expectations of lower
than anticipated cost inflation and improved supply chain performance. Within inflation and other, which negatively
impacted margin by 20 basis points, cost inflation of approximately 1% was mostly offset by improved supply chain

performance, primarily in the areas of transportation and warehousing. Mix was slightly negative, reflecting a small,
negative impact from the acquisition.
In aggregate, our price realization actions contributed 1.3 points of margin expansion, with 40 basis points from
reduced promotional spending, principally trade reductions in Pepperidge Farm and U.S. soup, and 90 basis points from
higher selling prices. Lastly, we're off to a strong start on our supply chain productivity programs, which contributed
160 basis points of margin improvement in the quarter.
Excluding items impacting comparability, marketing and selling expenses declined 15% in the quarter, primarily due to
lower advertising spending, savings from our cost reduction initiatives, and the impact of currency translation. The
decline in advertising reflects a shift in the timing of our spending, principally in U.S. soup, to later in the year.
Adjusted administrative expenses decreased 8%, primarily due to savings from our cost reduction program and the
impact of currency translation.
For additional perspective on our performance, this chart breaks down our EPS change between our operating
performance and below the line items. As you can see, in aggregate, adjusted EPS increased $0.17 compared with the
prior year, increasing from $0.78 to $0.95 per share. On a currency-neutral basis, growth in adjusted EBIT, mostly from
the gross margin expansion, contributed $0.23 to EPS growth. The impact on share repurchases under our strategic
repurchase program reduced our share count and added $0.01.
Going the other way, net interest expense increased $3 million, about $0.01 per share, as we extended the maturity on
the debt portfolio. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 34.1%, up 2.2 points versus the prior year, primarily due to
our geographic mix and higher U.S. state taxes in 2016, which negatively impacted EPS by $0.03. Currency had a
$0.03 negative impact on EPS in the quarter, completing the bridge to $0.95 per share.
Beginning in 2016, we are aligning our reporting segments with our new division structure. We are now reporting our
results in three segments. Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, Global Biscuits and Snacks and Campbell Fresh. In
connection with our change in benefit accounting, we have modified our method of allocating pension and
post-retirement benefit costs to the segments. In 2016, only the service cost representing the value of the retirement
benefit earned in the period is allocated to segments. The other elements of expense, including interest costs on the
liability, expected return on assets, and actuarial gains and losses are reflected in unallocated corporate expense. As
previously mentioned, we will identify the mark-to-market adjustments as an item impacting comparability and exclude
them from our adjusted results.
We have adjusted our historical results to reflect these changes with fiscal 2015 sales, operating earnings and margin by
segment shown on this chart. Immediately following the filing of our first quarter 10-Q, we will also provide recasted
historical annual and quarterly results, including quarterly results for our segments reflecting the benefit accounting
changes.
Now turning to our segment results. In Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, organic sales decreased 1%, to $1.3
billion. U.S. soup sales decreased 3%, reflecting declines in ready-to-serve soups and broth, partly offset by gains in
condensed soup. Impacted by our list price actions and changes to our promotional programs, soup volumes, as
expected, were negatively impacted. Sales of U.S. beverages declined slightly, primarily due to declines in V8
V-Fusion beverages, partly offset by gains in V8 Splash.
Sales of other U.S. Simple Meals increased, driven by Prego Pasta Sauces, Campbell's Dinner Sauces, and our new
Prego and Pace Ready Meals. Excluding the negative impact of currency translation, sales in Canada increased driven
by gains in soup. Operating earnings increased 19%, reflecting a higher gross margin percentage, which benefited from
net price realization and improved supply chain performance, particularly in the areas of transportation and
warehousing, and also from lower marketing and selling expenses. Our advertising expenditures were down in the
quarter as we've shifted the timing of our activity to later in the fiscal year.
Within U.S. soup, the 3% sales decline was driven by a 10% decline in ready-to-serve soup and a 9% decline in
Swanson broth, offset by a 2% gain on condensed. Sales of our Fresh-Brewed Soups for Keurig, which are not part of
the wet soup category, contributed 50 basis points of growth to total U.S. soup in the quarter. We began and ended the

quarter with retailer inventories in aggregate comparable to year-ago levels.
With the formation of the Americas Simple Meals and Beverages segment and our efforts to diversify the portfolio
beyond soup, we do not believe subcategory sales performance in soup is as meaningful a disclosure. We will continue
to provide this information for the balance of the year before discontinuing in fiscal 2017.
Here's a look at U.S. wet soup category performance and our share results as measured by IRI. For the 52-week period
ending November 1, 2015, the category as a whole declined 1.3%. Our sales in measured channels declined 1.7% with
weakness in ready-to-serve and condensed soups partly offset by strength in broth. Campbell had a 59% market share, a
decline of 20 basis points. Private label grew share by 20 basis points finishing at 13%. All other branded players
collectively had a share of 28%, unchanged versus the prior year.
In Global Biscuits and Snacks, organic sales increased 2%, with growth in Pepperidge Farm in the Asia Pacific region.
Sales gains in Pepperidge Farm were driven by Goldfish crackers, fresh bakery and frozen products, partly offset by a
decline in cookies. In the Asia Pacific region, excluding the impact of currency translation, growth in Australia biscuits
from savory and sweet varieties were offset by declines in Indonesia biscuits, as that market is facing some economic
challenges. Operating earnings increased 16%, primarily driven by higher gross margin percentage, volume gains and
lower selling expenses, partly offset by the negative impact of currency translation.
In the Campbell Fresh segment, consistent with our expectations, organic sales decreased 3% due to anticipated
declines in carrot ingredient export sales and category declines in retail carrots, partly offset by mid single-digit sales
growth in Bolthouse Farms beverages and salad dressings. Not included in organic results is our recent acquisition,
Garden Fresh Gourmet, which contributed 11 points of sales growth to the segment. Including the acquisition, the
integration of which is going well, reported segment sales increased by 8%.
Operating earnings doubled to $18 million, driven by a higher gross margin percentage and the impact of acquiring
Garden Fresh Gourmet. The improvement in gross margin reflects lower carrot costs and a favorable mix impact of the
growth in the higher margin beverages and salad dressing business relative to the balance of the segment.
We had strong cash flow performance in the first quarter. Cash from operations increased by $30 million to $218
million, driven by higher cash earnings. Capital expenditures increased $9 million to $71 million. We paid dividends
totaling $100 million, reflecting our current quarterly dividend rate of $0.312 per share. In aggregate, we repurchased
$32 million of shares in the first quarter, $25 million of which were under our strategic share repurchase program. The
balance of the repurchases were made to offset dilution from equity-based compensation. Net debt was equal to the
prior year at $3.8 billion, as positive net cash flow generated by the business offset the impact of the $232 million
acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet.
Now I'll reveal our revised 2016 guidance. We are now forecasting lower than anticipated cost inflation and cost
savings in excess of our previous target. Compared to our previous cost inflation outlook of 2% to 3%, we now expect
inflation and cost of products sold to be approximately 2%, and for our gross margin to increase by approximately one
percentage point. Compared to our previous incremental cost savings goal of $60 million, we now expect to deliver
savings in the range of $80 million to $100 million in fiscal 2016. Our cumulative cost savings target of $250 million
through fiscal 2018 remains unchanged.
Going in the other direction, we are experiencing some headwinds on the tax line and now expect an adjusted tax rate
of approximately 32%. And as I mentioned earlier, we also expect the negative impact of currency translation to
increase to three points as the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen.
This revised earnings guidance reflects additional investments in innovation as well as our current expectations for the
performance of our business for the remainder of 2016. Relative to our previous growth rates, we are increasing
adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS growth by two to three points on a currency-neutral basis with an offset to sales,
EBIT, and EPS of one point due to the increased negative impact of currency translation.
From the recast 2015 base and including a three point negative impact from currency, we now expect sales to change
from minus 1% to zero, adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS to both increase 4% to 7%. The guidance also includes the

impact of the Garden Fresh acquisition, which adds one point to both sales and adjusted EBIT.
Given that there have been significant changes to our guidance, including the impacts of the change in benefit
accounting, we thought it would be helpful in this instance to bridge our EPS guidance in September to the revised
guidance we issued today.
Starting with the original guidance of $2.53 to $2.58, we've added $0.19 for the benefit accounting change, and
deducted the incremental currency translation headwind, which is worth $0.03 per share. With the upside from lower
than anticipated inflation and incremental cost savings, we have taken the opportunity to fund additional investments in
longer-term innovation. The improved operating performance net of the additional investments is adding $0.06 to $0.09
to the guidance. Relative to our first quarter EPS growth, keep in mind that about half the Q1 EPS growth comes from
marketing timing, which we anticipate will be spent back in the year-to-go period.
That concludes my remarks, and now I'll turn it back to Ken for the Q&A.

Thanks, Anthony. We will now start our Q&A session. Since we're on limited time, out of fairness to other callers,

Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank. Your line is
open.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Hi. Good morning, everybody.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Eric.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Hi, Eric.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Happy holidays to all of you.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Thank you, you too.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: I guess with the respect for the one question, I guess, Denise and Anthony, what struck me
this quarter most was how high the margins are in this are in the Simple Meals area with the cost savings program
versus how low the margins are in the Campbell Fresh division, with obviously most of the growth expected to come in
the latter. Is that low – the single-digit margin what we should assume is reasonable long term for the Fresh division?
And on a long-term basis, is it going to be how you balance the two to get to the consolidated goals? I'll pass it on.
Thanks.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: I think the one thing to point out within Campbell Fresh is that you need to parse apart
the components of that business. So half the business is the CPG side, which is the beverages and salad dressing. The
other half is the Farms business, which includes the carrot business and the ingredient export business.
The margin structure within Campbell Fresh is very diverse. So the CPG businesses carry a much higher margin than
the carrots and natural ingredients business. And in fact, that's where all the growth is. So even within the quarter, we
see gross margin expansion within Campbell Fresh because of the higher growth on the higher margin beverages and
salad dressings. So if you think about the algorithm, you need to think about not just the Campbell Fresh margin but the
faster growing CPG margin within that.

The other thing that happens to Campbell Fresh because of the Bolthouse acquisition, it carries a pretty high load of
depreciation and amortization. The EBITDA margin is about two times the operating margin you see on the chart, so
that's another thing to keep in mind. But we think the algorithm works.

Our next question comes from Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. Denise, you've talked a lot in recent quarters
about the benchmark historically of 24% – 25% of sales in advertising, consumer, and trade. And it seems – I know
some of this is phasing just through the year, but it does seem like you're pulling back and rationalizing where you see
unproductive spending across the board on all of these areas of the P&L. So I guess are we any closer at this point to
where you might see an opportunity to shift that benchmark down slightly, or is that still the right way to think about
the degree of marketing reinvestment you need in the business to drive the top line goals?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: We still believe that ACT at about 24% of sales is a competitive rate. This quarter we
actually spent ACT at 23% of sales. There's a number of things going on there. First of all, in the U.S. soup business,
we shifted our advertising back to later in the year and started the new campaign in October versus prior years. So
you're seeing the results of that.
In addition, we're shifting our spend overall to about 40% of our spend in digital, and that is creating a different
dynamic between working and non-working media. And with our cost savings efforts, we're trying to be as responsible
and efficient as possible in the area of non-working media. And when you shift to digital, you're spending a lot of time
and expense on content, but TV is just a different dynamic.
And then within trade, we have been increasing trade on a couple businesses, in Biscuits and Campbell Fresh, and we
actually took pricing in our soup business. So, we'll be working our merchandising and promotion programs with more
acceleration in the second quarter and the third quarter.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay. Thanks, Denise. I guess I'll stop there.

Our next question comes from David Driscoll with Citigroup. Your line is open.
<Q - David Cristopher Driscoll>: Thank you and good morning, everybody.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, David.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Good morning, David.
<Q - David Cristopher Driscoll>: I'd say I'd like to wish happy holidays to you all as well. I wanted to just ask kind of
one question on soup, and apologies, Ken, just a couple of minor points here. Just overall, the ready-to-serve
performance, certainly quite weak. I know you hate talking about weather, but does it matter at all about kind of the
temperatures that we saw in the quarter? Would that give us any explanation here?
And then the second part of this question on soup is, is the performance here kind of indicative of maybe – maybe not
this negative on some pieces of it, but just that you're going to really manage this soup business for cash, and this is
really almost the philosophies of zero-based budgeting kind of coming through where we're going to get some really
nice answers on the profit line but maybe the sales line is just fundamentally going to see some weakness as you
rationalize unprofitable promotions, et cetera? So those two pieces, if you will.

<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Okay, I'll take that one. First of all, the soup business declined 2% after wrapping 6%
increases in the year-ago comps. And what we believe drove that – and that was as expected, by the way – was the
pricing increases that we took, which predominantly affected the RTS business; the fact that promotions have been
shifted to later in the year; and the fact that advertising started later in October.
The consumption was down in line with our expectations. I would say to you that RTS is a bit worse, condensed a bit
better and broth was pretty flat. But the category was down 4%. Although I'm not a weather person, I do think that that
was a factor, but I believe that all these other dynamics going on were equal factors to that one.
And then, of course, our Fresh-Brewed Soup is not captured in our consumption, that's in dry soup. Inventories were
comparable. We saw a little bit of a difference in broth because we carried some extra inventory into the year as we
transitioned to a new screw cap on the aseptic broth. We still expect soup to grow modestly, and that is basically how
we're looking at it.
<Q - David Cristopher Driscoll>: Okay, thanks for the comments.

Our next question comes from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Hi, thank you.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Hey, Rob.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Rob.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Hi. Obviously, the gross margin performance was a lot higher than what anyone had expected.
The guidances for 100 basis points for the year, though, I think you're up 300 basis points versus year ago already, so
why not higher, Anthony? Is it a function of the promo spending that's going to start increasing in second quarter, or is
it a function of, by fourth quarter, I think you start lapping some of the supply chain improvements, why not higher?
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: I guess there's a couple of comments, and I'm sure you guys will do the math. But
following a 260 basis point improvement in the first quarter, driven by primarily net price realization and our
productivity gains, getting to a full point on the year would imply, for the last three quarters, about 40 basis points of
expansion. And there's a couple of points I would make.
I said in my comments that cost inflation was 1% in the quarter. We expect that to be closer to 2% by the time we finish
the year. And that includes this negative currency impact on the input cost of some of our international businesses,
primarily the Canadian business and the Australian business, so that headwind is out there. You made a comment about
some of the marketing timing, the favorability in the first quarter. That will come back in the last three quarters.
The second quarter comp is not too difficult, but it will start to lap some of the gross margin gains we had last year in
the back half. So, all those things taken together would dampen that growth in the year-to-go period.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Okay, thank you very much.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Yes.

<Q - Jason M. English>: Thank you for squeezing me in. I wanted to come back to some of the trade budget
optimization questions and some of the comments you made. As we look at the data, TBO seems to be a very big
opportunity for you in soup and some of your other Simple Meals categories, yet it's been a source of leakage for you
for a number of years. I heard a reference to maybe a little bit less trade this quarter on soup, but I also thought I heard
reference to actually increasing those Fresh funds to mitigate some of the price increases you had going forward.
So, A, is that right, that you are going to ramp more trade to deal back some of the price increases? B, do you concur
with the broader observation that there seems to be a big opportunity to pull some of these inefficient dollars out? And
then, C, what's the obstacle? What's the hang-up for getting this going in the right direction for you?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: I believe that we have an opportunity as a company to get a better return on our trade
dollars invested. And I'd like to think of it that way. We, as part of our restructure within our Integrated Global
Services, are building our revenue management capabilities, not only in the Americas business, but across all three.
And we have different dynamics – competitive dynamics that we're dealing with.
I think the second goal is we are getting better net price realization. That has come from not only list price increases,
but also working with promoted pricing. These are still early days and we want to make sure that the consumer
responds to them well, they've been accepted by customers. And we're trying to find win-win solutions for ourselves
and our customers with our trade programs. So, that's basically where we are right now, and we will definitely keep a
close eye on it.
<Q - Jason M. English>: Thank you. Good luck.

Your next question comes from Jonathan Feeney with Athlos Research. Your line is open.
<Q - Jonathan P. Feeney>: Hey, Denise. Thanks very much for the question. I wanted to ask a little bit bigger picture
question in light of -your comments today, obviously, some strong gross margin here, and I think a lot of the questions
were sort of grasping at how much revenue management versus growth is your focus as a company?
And, specifically, your comment today that you want to set Campbell apart, I think you said, from other food
companies, and strengthen your growth trajectory, I think you said. What metrics do you want to set Campbell apart
on? I mean what should we be judging you on over the next – on what metric did you mean that Campbell would be set
apart? Is it gross margin improvement? Is it operating income, segment income? What would you say to that?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: I mean, we've been on a mission to generate better profitable sales growth and also, at the
same time, unlock the potential of our purpose and set a new standard for transparency in the industry, which we
believe will help us in achieving that trajectory of profitable net sales growth. That hasn't really changed, but it has
been refined in the fact that we now have assigned the portfolio roles to the divisions, and we believe that in composite,
it better diversifies our portfolio to gain that.
I think we've guided with our long-term targets as to what we believe we can achieve in the next several years, and
we're still working our way into those. We believe that organic growth will be an important part of this. But also, we
continue to look and be very disciplined about making strategic acquisitions.
<Q - Jonathan P. Feeney>: So, I guess – so it's pretty much just a long-term guidance you're talking about, that sort of
commentary just maybe setting Campbell apart from the other food companies doesn't relate directly to the sort of
financial metrics, maybe the transparency you're providing or other things?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: I'm not sure that...
<Q - Jonathan P. Feeney>: I guess what I'm saying, Denise, is, the long-term guidance you have is pretty similar to
what a lot of other companies have. And I hear you have some – I see you have some strong results today, and I think
you've been very – some interesting things going on in the portfolio, and I guess I'm trying to see if there's something

new afoot here, or just maybe a new level of steps behind what you've talked about for some time.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: No, I think our strategy's been pretty consistent. I mean we're establishing a real
beachhead in fresh food, bringing Campbell's suite of capabilities to that faster growing part of the food business. We
are being really transparent about our products with our new website, whatsinmyfood.com. We are talking to
consumers about what's in our food, and the ingredients we use, and how it's made. And these are just steps that really
distinguish us and are very true to activating our purpose with the consumer.

Our next question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel. Your line is open.
<Q - Christopher Growe>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Hi, Chris.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Chris.
<Q - Christopher Growe>: Hi and happy holidays as well to you. I just had a quick question for you here. I want to
understand in the soup business, so inventory levels were in line with the prior year, if I heard you correctly there,
Anthony. Does that mean that they are up a little bit from where they were at the end of Q4? I'm just trying to get a
sense of where they stand today and how to expect that to move going forward.
And then when I look within the performances of condensed, ready-to-serve, and broth, condensed is the one that
seems to stand out a bit versus what the measured channel data indicated. So is that the one where – was there a little
inventory increase in condensed in the quarter is also part of the question.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: So, to the first part of the question, we always build retail inventories in the first
quarter, so we always come into the quarter relatively low. We're getting into the season and we always build. The
question then becomes did you build more than you did the year-ago period? The answer to that in aggregate is no. The
retailer inventories on a case basis, we came into the quarter and ended the quarter about the same.
And then if you look underneath that by subcategory, I would say that condensed and RTS got a little bit of benefit, and
broth saw a little bit of a negative in terms of impact of shifts within the portfolio. But I think where we ended the
quarter is a normal place for us relative to the seasonal build we typically see in the business.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Just another build on what Anthony said, our sales on broth in the quarter were down 9%,
and we were cycling comps of plus 17% a year ago, and our consumption in the quarter was flat. So that also was a
factor to evaluate the performance.
<Q - Christopher Growe>: So in the context of your promotional spending plans, usually if promotional spending is
working down, as I think it did this quarter a bit, you tend to see inventories come out of the system. Is that what you'd
expect for the year then, or can you go that far to speak to that?
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: By the time we cycled the full year and we get to the end of the fourth quarter, it's
typically our low point in the cycle. So all of this stuff that happens as we build into the season, come out of the season,
generally works its way out by the time we get to the end of the fourth quarter.
<Q - Christopher Growe>: Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Your line is open.
<Q - Alexia J. Howard>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Good morning.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Alexia.
<Q - Alexia J. Howard>: Hi. So can I ask about some other parts of the business, specifically V8, cookies, and then
SpaghettiOs, which I know is fairly small. But in each of those it's a similar pattern to what we're seeing in soup. You
seem to be trading off market share in exchange for better EBIT and better price realization. Should we expect those
trends to continue, or are you scrambling to try to turn it around? I'm just trying to get an idea of the strategy there.
And then just some comments on SpaghettiOs, it looks as though even before the recall the sales were really coming
down quite heavily. Is that something you're pulling away from? Thank you.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Let me tackle beverages first. The category continues to remain challenged, although we
have seen some signs of improvement. Our consumption and share were down slightly in quarter one.
We have a couple puts and a couple takes. V8 Splash and V8 [VFusion] + Energy continue to perform well, and we're
very encouraged by our V8 Veggie Blends launch. And we've had a bit of decline on our V8 red juice, and I think that's
due to consumers trying some different types of vegetable juice now in the Veggie Blend line. And our V8 V-Fusion
business continues to be a challenge. We've had a couple quarters of good growth in immediate consumption. And we
had some trade timing issues in the quarter, so that was down about 1%, but our equivalent volume in that channel was
up 8%. So we continue to be encouraged about the new network we've set up there. We know that's an opportunity for
us.
And finally, we launched our Veggies for All campaign, and we really like what that's doing for the brand in terms of
the equity. So we're still very committed to the V8 program. We think it's a timely, on-trend brand for the health
conscious consumer that offers a lower calorie option and less sugar option in this world of juice.
Cookies, we saw – no pun intended – we saw a softness on our cookies, predominantly in the Classic line. However,
we did have a really, really good quarter on Goldfish crackers, up 10%. So we still have some more work to do on
cookies. And SpaghettiOs...
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: I can do that.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Go ahead.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: The premise of the question I would disagree with a little bit. The price realization on
soup is relatively unique to soup. We haven't done a lot of price realization on V8, cookies, or SpaghettiOs.
SpaghettiOs sales are relatively flat in the quarter. V8 is down, it's primarily a V8 V-Fusion issue, and as Denise
mentioned, chunk cookies are a particular issue within the Pepperidge Farm portfolio that we're addressing, but we
haven't made a strategic decision in those businesses to go for price realization and better EBIT in exchange for market
share.
<Q - Alexia J. Howard>: Okay, thank you very much. I'll pass it on.

<A - Denise M. Morrison>: You too.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Happy Thanksgiving.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: Just to follow up there on your crackers business, and particularly you mentioned Goldfish
being strong. That's been a tough category for a lot of companies, the healthy snacking area. What's perhaps going right
there for you, and how confident are you that you can keep that going? And then, on cookies, that's become tougher for
a variety of players there, and it seems like sweet snacks in general has been tough. What is the plan for that segment?
Thanks.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: We definitely have been very focused on keeping our Goldfish programming strong. I
think that business is hitting on all cylinders with good advertising, a good promotional program, and the right
proposition for millennial parents and their children. So, we continue to be pretty excited about our Goldfish business.
And I think that mothers still feel like that is a very positive snacking for their children.
I think we have more work to do on cookies, and we're working on that as we speak. We do have new leadership right
now in the Pepperidge Farm business, and that team is really coming together and focusing on the next wave of
innovation of ideas. And I'm not sure there's anything more to add to that.

Our next question comes from Priya Ohri-Gupta, with Barclays. Your line is open.
<Q - Priya Joy Ohri-Gupta>: Thank you for taking the question. I was hoping you would talk a little bit about your
view on the current rate environment. Specifically, you had $1.5 billion in short-term borrowings. Do you expect to
continue rolling this into the market or refinance it?
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: So as I mentioned, we did term out some of the debt portfolio in the recent past, taking
advantage of relatively low fixed rates. We have a sizable backstop credit facility against a commercial paper program,
and we're fairly comparable with the level of CP we have in the marketplace today. I mean, clearly, with what's
happening in the credit markets, we continue to look at that and evaluate alternatives, whether to term out some of that
CP, or whether to use the derivative market to convert some of the that floating exposure to fixed, but that's kind of an
ongoing thing that we continue to assess here.
<Q - Priya Joy Ohri-Gupta>: Thank you very much.
