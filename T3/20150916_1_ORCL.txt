light of new information or future events.
Before taking questions, we'll begin with some prepared remarks. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Safra. Safra?
Safra Ada Catz
Sorry about that. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks, Ken. I am actually offsite today, so hopefully this phone will work
out. If you don't hear me, I may have to reconnect, but I do have obviously Ken Bond on the call. And Corey West, our
Chief Accounting Officer, is also I think in the room with Larry and Mark. I'm going to focus today on our non-GAAP
results for Q1. I'll then review guidance for Q2, and I will actually give some guidance for the entire fiscal year. And
then I'll turn the call over to Mark and Larry for their comments.
As you know, we didn't provide U.S. dollar guidance for Q1 given the high volatility in exchange rates we were seeing
at the time. As it happened, Q1 currency headwinds were actually 2% worse than we expected. The currency impact for
both total revenue and hardware revenue ended up being 9%. And for software and cloud revenue, it was 8%. Now we
do get benefit on the expense side. But because many of our expenses are in the United States, we get a very small
benefit. And of course, our expenses are significantly lower than our revenues. And so our operating income was
actually impacted by 12 points.
Earnings per share was $0.06 lower because of currency, $0.01 worse than we anticipated. With currency still volatile,
we will continue to use constant dollar growth rates on our quarterly calls, so we can have some measure of consistency
and also share with you how we look at the business. We've also changed the presentation of our income statement to
better reflect how we look at the company now that cloud has become a significant contributor to revenue.
Our software business is really two parts of one business, the on-premise software business, which is steady and
growing modestly, and the cloud business that is in a high-growth phase. We felt it made sense to show the components
grouped together in our income statement to make it easier to see the progress we are making in the cloud.
The largest part is on-premise software revenue, which is made up of new software licenses plus software license
updates and product support. On-premise software revenue was up 4% for the quarter to $5.8 billion. The largest
component is software license updates and product support, which was up 8% for the quarter to $4.7 billion, with attach
and renewal rates running at their usual high levels. We expect the on-premise software business to remain steady.
Over the full year, I expect we will see modest growth, comprised of continued growth in software support revenue that
offsets any declines in new software licenses.
Moving on to cloud, we start with SaaS and PaaS and then add Infrastructure-as-a-Service [IaaS] to our total cloud
revenue, which were up 34%. Within the cloud business, we continue to see excellent momentum in SaaS and PaaS,
with bookings growth of 165% this quarter on top of the 54% growth from Q1 of last year. SaaS and PaaS revenue was
$452 million, up 38% from last year. The triple-digit bookings growth that we have been experiencing will translate
into significant acceleration in SaaS and PaaS revenue in the second half of the year.
You can also see the coming revenue acceleration of our cloud business in the SaaS and PaaS billings and deferred
revenue. SaaS and PaaS billings grew 70% in U.S. dollars this quarter on top of the 100% growth last quarter. Also, the
gross deferred revenue balance is now nearly $1 billion and was up more than 100%. We've put the billings numbers up
on the website for you to see in detail.
Our significant success in cloud bookings will not only help accelerate our revenue growth, but it will also benefit our
margins and earnings over time. Cloud revenue, as you know, is recognized ratably, while new license is recognized all
up front. This timing difference has the effect of lowering near-term operating margins and earnings per share, but over
time will increase both.
As our SaaS and PaaS bookings have continued to accelerate, capital expenditures for the quarter were higher
compared to last year. The bulk of them are largely complete, and you can see this in the $150 million sequential
decline in CapEx this quarter. I expect CapEx for this year will be materially lower than last year, as we utilize the

investments that we have already made. We are well aware of the near-term impact to gross margins that this buildout
cost has had on the cloud business, and I think that Q4 of last year marks the bottom for SaaS and PaaS gross margins.
Q1 cloud gross margins were up slightly on a sequential basis, and I think we'll see another modest improvement in Q2.
But as our cloud business scales up, we expect SaaS and PaaS gross margins will be around 60% by Q4 and then 80%
over the next two years.
The balance of our cloud revenue comes from cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service, which was up 23% to $160 million.
The gross margin in this business was up sequentially to a record 45%. While SaaS and PaaS revenue will see much
higher growth rates along with significantly higher gross margins, we expect Infrastructure-as-a-Service revenue will
grow at a single-digit rate and maintain a steady margin profile over time.
As I mentioned, there are two parts to our software business that can be looked at separately but should really be
considered together; the on-premise software business, which will grow modestly and serve as a tremendous base of
loyal customers using our leading products. The SaaS and PaaS revenues will grow rapidly and will quickly become a
significant contributor to revenues and profit as we help those same customers transform their businesses over time. In
total, we will see growth in the total software business begin to increase this year, as cloud revenue grows as a
percentage of the total software business.
Finally, total hardware revenues grew 6%, which included hardware products revenue of $570 million and hardware
support revenue of $559 million. Total revenue for the quarter was up 7% from last year to $8.5 billion.
Non-GAAP operating income was $3.5 billion, and the operating margin was 41%. Sales and cloud investments along
with the integration of Micros each impacted operating margins negatively by about 1%.
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 25%, which was 3.5 points higher than last year. The GAAP tax rate was
24.4%, which was five points higher than last year.
Non-GAAP EPS was $0.53 in U.S. dollars, and GAAP EPS was $0.40 in U.S. dollars. As I said earlier, both were
$0.06 lower due to currency.
Free cash flow over the last four quarters was $11.8 billion. We now have nearly $56 billion in cash and marketable
securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately $14 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $9.1
billion, up 10% in constant currency.
This quarter we repurchased more than 75 million shares for a total of $3 billion, up from our fiscal year 2015 run rate
of $2 billion a quarter. And given current market conditions, we expect to buy even more in Q2. The Board of Directors
also declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased more than 220 million shares
for a total of $9.1 billion and paid out dividends of $2.4 billion, for a total that is nearly 100% of free cash flow.
Now to the guidance; as I mentioned, I'm going to give you guidance for Q2 and then for the whole year. We feel very
good about the progress of our cloud transition. And clearly, customers are migrating to the Oracle Cloud. Over time,
we expect the cloud will result in more revenue and profit for Oracle as we take share from legacy on-premise
competitors, other cloud competitors who are limited to point solutions, and the labor suppliers who can't possibly offer
what we have already built. Of course, I am seeing many of the same financial news reports that all of you are about the
whole world, and so I think it is still best to be prudent here.
Additionally, we expect to see continued volatility in exchange rates and significant currency headwinds. I'm going to
give you constant currency guidance. But if exchange rates remain the same as they are right now, we expect to see a
currency headwind of about 6% on revenue and $0.05 on earnings per share. But again, it could be significantly worse.
Maybe, if we're lucky, it could be a little bit better. All of my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant
currency, so here goes.
SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow 36% to 40%. Cloud IaaS revenue is expected to grow 5% to 9%. Total
cloud and on-premise software is expected to grow from zero to 2%. Total revenue is expected to range from a negative
2% to a positive 1%.

Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.63 and $0.66. Now this assumes a
non-GAAP tax rate of 25.5%. Of course, if this quarter is any example, it may end up being different.
Looking further out, we expect to see a material acceleration in SaaS and PaaS revenue. As a result, I'm providing full
fiscal year guidance for some key items. As before, my guidance on the full year is in constant currency. SaaS and PaaS
revenue is expected to grow around 50%. On-premise software is expected to grow approximately 1%. Total cloud and
on-premise software is expected to grow between 3% and 4%. Finally, SaaS and PaaS gross margins are expected to
materially improve in the second half and exit the year at around 60%.
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry and Mark for their comments.
Lawrence J. Ellison
Thank you, Safra. This is Larry. Over the last three years, we've been in the startup phase of our cloud business. We've
developed services at all four layers of the cloud, a complete set of enterprise SaaS applications, plus our database and
middleware platform services, plus compute and storage infrastructure services, and an expanding set of data services.
We have deployed those cloud services in 19 data centers in 14 countries around the world.
During this startup phase of our cloud business, we have increased our data center service delivery capacity from 0.5
megawatt to 45 megawatts. That's a 90x, not 90%, a 90 times increase in our data center capacity in three years. We've
installed over 40,000 physical devices, 100,000 virtual machines, and over eight petabytes of storage. We now have in
place the physical infrastructure to dramatically expand our cloud customer base. We are entering the rapid growth
scale-out phase of our cloud business. We're adding thousands of new SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, and data customers to our
existing data centers. With all that customer growth on top of our existing infrastructure, we expect that our cloud
margins will double from 40% to 80% over the next two years.
Mark, it's your turn to tell everybody about all those great customer adds we had during Q1.
Mark V. Hurd
Thanks. By the process of elimination, this is Mark actually speaking. So I thought I'd do two things, right, to Larry's
point, tell you about some wins but also give you some facts about the quarter.
Revenue grew 38% year on year, 8% quarter on quarter. Billings grew 70%, again growing much faster than Salesforce
and Workday. Bookings were $191 million USD, 165% growth.
Like I always do, I want to tell you the number of customers we added. We added 612 new SaaS customers in the
quarter, brand-new logos. 616 expanded their SaaS business with us in the quarter. In HCM, it was 166 new customers,
more than double what Workday had. In CX [Customer Experience], 280 customers. In ERP/EPM it was 200
customers, double last year. That is also more than Workday's lifetime sales. We now have 1,350 customers in our
installed base. More than 300 are already live, including 100 that went live in just Q1. What's taken Workday eight
quarters to do we did in one quarter. We never see SAP.
PaaS, we added 800 new PaaS customers in the quarter, 2,500 in just two quarters, bookings over $65 million. Now I
think we have a shot in Q2 to book more PaaS than we actually did in Q4. I think we have a shot. That's how fast we
see our pipeline growing in PaaS.
I'm going to wrap up and then I'm going to read you some news, but I just want to connect a few dots between what
Safra and Larry described on the Oracle SaaS/PaaS cloud. We're currently at a $1.8 billion run rate in revenue. If you
include IaaS, it's $2.4 billion. We will book between $1.5 billion and $2 billion in SaaS/PaaS ARR in the fiscal year.
Gross deferred revenue has grown from $475 million to nearly $1 billion in the year. Billings are growing 70%. Gross
margins are headed to 80%. SaaS/PaaS will be a very large and very profitable business for Oracle.

Now in addition, I just want to give you some brands that we got in the quarter, just so you have a feeling for who all
these people are that are buying solutions from us. So first, let me hit HCM; a few wins. CMYK, they're an Australia
Fusion HCM. We replaced Workday at CMYK in the quarter. Cypress Semiconductor, GDF SUEZ, Limited Brands,
Nationwide Insurance, Restoration Hardware, Rutgers University. We expanded our HCM clouds at Omnicare, the
Navy, Westpac Bank.
In ERP/EPM, athenahealth, Chicago Sun Times. These are all new customers, by the way; FOX Home Entertainment,
U.S. Department of Energy, Lending Club Corp., [indiscernible] (20:18), LG Electronics, Rutgers University. By the
way, you'll hear a few names twice, which is because they bought multiple pillars at the same time. In sales service
cloud, FOX Home Entertainment, Royal Mail, Sallie Mae, Sirius XM, Toshiba Medical, Wesfarmers; expansions at
Cigna, Motorola, Nikon, Polycom, Virgin Atlantic, Westpac.
In our marketing cloud, Aer Lingus, General Mills, Jeanswest, Telstra, Verizon; expansions at Booz Allen Hamilton,
Forever 21, National Instruments, NetApp, Pier 1 Imports, Public Broadcasting System, Taylor Made Golf Company,
Time, Inc. I'm going to stop, but I wanted to give you a flavor for not just the number of customers, but the quality of
brands that are buying from us at the same time.
Ken, with that, let's take whatever questions anybody's got.
Kenneth Bond
Great, thank you very much, Mark. Operator, if you could, please instruct the audience for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Philip A. Winslow>: Thanks, guys, and congrats another great quarter on that cloud with that 70% billings
growth. And also, thank you for the commentary on gross margin there going forward. That was really helpful. I just
wanted to double-click on the cloud for a little bit, SaaS and PaaS. Mark, you gave us some commentary on the PaaS
side for Q2, and obviously it sounds like that's ramping. But if you focus in on the SaaS side, what trends are you
seeing there, HCM versus financials and maybe trends on adoption you can see there in go-live? Any color would be
great.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Listen, I hate to compare our pillars because individually they're all doing quite well, so I don't
want to compare them against each other. But it's clear to me the ramp in ERP is its strength. When you look at the
number of customers we've been able to bring onboard, remember, this is really our fifth quarter really in the business
in the cloud. When you think of 1,350 customers that are now under contract, I think Oracle – and Larry can do this
better than I can. But in roughly 23 – 24 years, we're already at, I don't know, 10% of the on-prem base that's now in
the cloud in terms of just sheer number of companies. And our pipeline is just full.
So ERP, we're highly differentiated. And we're way ahead of whoever it is you think is number two, and it's extreme. I
think it's a combination, Phil, of what we talked about before. Our products have done nothing but get better and better
and better. We're on now Release 10. Release 11 is now coming out, so our products have gotten better. Our people
have – we've got more people. They're better trained, and we just have now a lot of go-lives and a lot of references.
And that's true across each one of our pillars, Phil.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: I'd like to add a couple of things. One is that the products that we have are being translated
into more and more languages and updated for statutory compliance in more and more countries, so there are more
markets we can sell them into. And we're adding supply chain and manufacturing with this release in ERP. So we have
– there's really nobody with as comprehensive a suite of enterprise software products. And now we're able to sell it

internationally, so we think we have a huge advantage.
I don't know who you'd consider the competitor in ERP. Again, every quarter – if Workday is the competitor, every
quarter we sell – Q1 is our smallest quarter, and we sold more deals in Q1 than Workday has sold ERP deals – than
Workday has sold since their company began. We do that every single quarter. So our relative strength, I think as Mark
said, I think all of our pillars are doing well. But on a relative basis, whoever is number two in ERP, they're a long, long
way behind. And by the way, ERP is the largest segment of applications in the cloud. That will be just like people –
SAP was the leading on-premise application software vendor in the last generation of applications because they were
number one in ERP. The leading vendor, application vendor in the cloud this generation will also be whoever wins the
ERP war.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Phil, we've fallen into the trap that I didn't want to fall into is comparing pillars. And you can
tell how excited we are about ERP. But quite frankly, if you were in our marketing cloud business, you would be really
excited. When you start running off the names that I run off in marketing cloud, we are highly differentiated and we're
winning. We've done well in B2C, we've done well in B2B. If you add what's now occurred in service, we're starting to
see again significant service growth in our service cloud. And our sales cloud, while again small and very different than
ERP, up against big competitor, our service cloud is showing very strong growth.
And so if you look in each of our pillars, we've added on some really cool stuff here. Just while I'm on a roll here,
we've added on a very cool Data-as-a-Service business. So our Data-as-a-Service business, which had come to us with
our BlueKai acquisition and our Datalogix acquisition, is now another component of our marketing cloud, and that had
tremendous performance in Q1.
So, Phil, it's really a story across all of our pillars. ERP is of course exciting because, to Larry's point, it's the biggest
pillar in terms of total available market, and one that has a lot of pull. It pulls a lot of HCM. When we win in ERP, our
connect rate of HCM to ERP is pretty high and growing. But the success is broad-based, and that's the enthusiasm you
hear keep coming from us as we talk about what we see happening across our SaaS business.
<A - Kenneth Bond>: Next question, please.
Operator
Your next question will come from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James.
<Q - Michael Turits>: Hey, guys. I wanted to switch over from apps to Database. I want to ask you broadly. I know
that Database 12c is being adopted faster than Database 11. Can you give us an update on the adoption of multi-tenancy
and in memory options? And from a cloud perspective, how much traction are you getting with the SaaS providers?
And maybe we could add, say for Database-as-a-Service, how does that work as part of the broader
Platform-as-a-Service offering?
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Okay, so we have never had any of our options for the Database have an uptake as fast as
we're seeing with multi-tenancy and in memory. We've never experienced people that want to get these two particular
features turned on, and this is in our on-premise customer base. As you know, most major SaaS companies run Oracle.
SAP runs Ariba on Oracle. SAP runs SuccessFactors on Oracle. SAP runs Concur on Oracle. NetSuite runs on Oracle.
Salesforce runs on Oracle. And all of them are able to deliver more efficiency in terms of data processing by turning on
the memory feature. All of them are able – by more efficiency, it means they use less hardware and they deliver better
performance. So they lower their internal cost and deliver better performance. All of them are much more efficient in
the usage of hardware resource by turning on multi-tenancy.
Now these guys have multi-tenancy built into their applications. That doesn't mean they don't layer things. So they have
multi-tenancy at the application level, multi-tenancy at the database level, and then multi-tenancy at the operating
system level, which is called VM. All of those things conspire together to more efficiently utilize your hardware and
provide better recovery of your security systems. So we see the demand from traditional on-prem customers and the
new generation of cloud customers for these two new options, unlike anything that's happened before.

<A - Kenneth Bond>: Next question.
<Q - Michael Turits>: I didn't...
<A - Kenneth Bond>: Go ahead, Michael. Go ahead, Michael.
<Q - Michael Turits>: Just to finish, I was curious as to two things. One is, how is Database-as-a-Service fitting in
with your broader Platform-as-a-Service offering, and is there any slowing of Database in expectation of Release 2 for
Database 12c?
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: I don't think there's – as you know, if you buy the Database now and you maintain
support, you get all the subsequent versions. So no, I don't think there is any slowing. However, we are encouraging
people to run all their dev tests, all their development tests in our cloud as opposed to on-prem, which does imply a
shift from Database on-prem to our Database service. That's what we want them to do. We think that lowers their cost
and raises our revenue and profits. We think it works very well for us.
So you really have to look at those two businesses added together, and I think that's what Safra was saying in her
presentation. You can't look at Database on-premise separately from PaaS as Database-as-a-Service. It's really the sum
of those that have to grow. That some of those have to grow at the top line level and that some of those have to grow in
terms of profitability, and we see that happening right now. We think PaaS – yes, some people will elect to buy
Database-as-a-Service as opposed to running dev tests on-prem, but we think that's a good thing. We think they get a
more efficient service. They spend less, we get more.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: I think one thing, Michael, that I'd add to it is that from a customer's point of view, these
decisions aren't necessarily binary, meaning that I'm going to run Database-as-a-Service as opposed to Database
on-premise. What the major differentiation for Oracle that nobody else can do is that we can actually do this
on-premise for you and do it for you in the cloud, and we can do it at the exact same time. We can deliver to you a
capability in the cloud and we can deliver the exact same capability to you on-premise and move those workloads back
and forth, whether that's Database-as-a-Service, some dev tests and then move the dev tests in our cloud into your data
center to run your production applications.
It's important to understand. This is a huge differentiator that only this company can deliver. We're not just cloud. We
have a fantastic hypergrowth cloud with an on-prem capability that nobody else brings the two together like Oracle.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: For example, we have Exadata-as-a-Service that we're rolling out at Oracle OpenWorld.
So we have Exadata-as-a-Service in our cloud, and we obviously sell Exadata machines to run on-premise the most
modern way, the most efficient, cost-effective way to run our database. So you can run part of your database workload
on-prem on that Exadata platform, part of that database workload in our cloud on that Exadata platform. And our
management tool, when you're running your data center assets and our cloud assets, the person who's running that
thinks that's one pool of assets. It's one set of management tools that allow you to run your Exadata and the Exadata
that's in the cloud together, move data back and forth, move workload back and forth.
This co-existence of cloud and on-premise computing is going to be a decades-long process, if not forever. But during
this long period of co-existence, we think it's very important to have absolute compatibility between on-prem and in the
cloud. And Mark points out our biggest differentiator in this business. We have great on-premise technology with some
of our fancy appliances like Exadata big data appliance, Exalogic, I can go on and on. And we offer that same advanced
technology in the cloud and we lace it together and make it look like one set of assets.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: At the risk of over-answering your question, I'm going to stop here. By the time we get to
OpenWorld and Larry presents on Sunday night, we will have now fundamentally all of our software assets redone for
the modern cloud. So the ability to do what Larry said is not something that's five years away, four years away, three
years away. We can start delivering Exadata-as-a-Service and these opportunities that Larry described now.
<Q - Michael Turits>: Okay. Thanks, Larry. Thanks, Mark.

<A - Kenneth Bond>: Operator, next question, please.
Operator
Your next question will come from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Heather Anne Bellini>: Thank you so much. This is a question for Mark. I was just wondering if you could share
with us. If you had to characterize what inning we're in of the SaaS transition, if you could help us think about that.
And also, when do you think we start to see – I know you mentioned some commentary about momentum in PaaS. But
when do we see that become a material part of that SaaS/PaaS revenue line?
And then I guess the follow-up to that would just be, you touched I think on Phil's question about the SaaS competitive
dynamics. But can you walk us through how you're thinking about the competitive environment for PaaS as well?
Thank you.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Okay. So that was one of those let me give you a question in six parts type things.
<Q - Heather Anne Bellini>: Exactly.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Heather, I'll try. So in the baseball analogy, I don't know, top of the first? We're in the very
beginning stages. It depends a little which pillar we're talking about.
<Q - Heather Anne Bellini>: For SaaS first and then for PaaS.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Start with SaaS, and I am talking about SaaS and I'm talking across each pillar.
<Q - Heather Anne Bellini>: Okay.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: The ERP opportunity has just started. Now it happens that we're ramping incredibly fast. I think
if I would have said five quarters ago in SaaS and said hey, I think we'll have 1,350 customers signed up to run in our
cloud in about four or five quarters, everybody would say, you should go seek some help because it won't happen that
fast. It has.
That said, we are only now getting to the point, Heather, where we actually have all the references required, we've got
our sales force scaled. I think we are in – and by the way, to Larry's point, I thought Larry made a great point. We are
releasing a lot of new products. It may not come across that way. But with the next release, we now release products
that are localized for many, many more countries, markets that frankly we just weren't in give it six months ago. In
addition to the fact that in ERP, we're releasing supply chain manufacturing now so we can now go after manufacturers
as well.
I made a comment about what we've added now in marketing in terms of our data cloud that we've now supplemented
our marketing cloud with. We have new releases coming in service cloud. So there's just a whole suite of products here.
I would tell you top of the first. This is a multiyear long, long game. We just happen to be extremely well positioned as
the only one who has a suite of products and the only one that has best-of-breed products that are in a suite that can
then combine it, to your point, with a PaaS capability that allows you to extend those applications without destroying
the upgradability of the application suite that you bought. So it's a great matchup.
Our pipeline, a year ago at SAM, I made a statement about the size of our pipeline. Probably nobody remembers it
because it seems like a long time ago. Think about since then, our pipeline in SaaS, this is our annualized pipeline, has
more than doubled, more than doubled off of a really big number, so now you've got a pipeline scaled. And the great
thing is – I know nobody thought of it at the time. You've seen it now come through the pipeline and turn into
bookings. And my expectations are very favorable, as I've indicated, about what SaaS bookings are going to look like
for the rest of the year.

Your next question will come from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital.
<Q - Ross MacMillan>: Thanks a lot. Safra, I'd like to drill into your comments on cloud gross margins and the
expansion that you're expecting as we exit this year and look further out. It's pretty significant. And I guess the question
is, is that really just driven by revenue scale? And is there a certain level of revenue scale in PaaS and SaaS that you
need to achieve the target 80% in two years? Thanks.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Okay, it's actually going to hit in many ways in both revenue and expenses because, as Larry
explained, we have invested immense resources in building up our infrastructure. And as I mentioned on the call, our
capital expenditure numbers have been very, very large compared to what we are used to historically. And so we've put
out those expenditures and we've started to amortize them. However, in the second half of this year, our capital
expenditure numbers are going to be significantly lower, even significantly lower than even this quarter. You'll see I
believe at least another $100 million decline and then a continuing reduction. And the reason that matters is because
what you'll simultaneously be seeing is a massive amount of revenue which can finally be recognized. That is going to
start in true earnest in the second half of the year, in Q3 and Q4, while simultaneously we will not be adding capacity.
In fact, we'll be spending less than we historically have spent on capital expenditures. We'll be back to numbers that
you would have looked at and seen in fiscal year 2014.
So as expenses – and in addition, you understand, it's not only capital expenditures. It's all sources, staffing and labor
and tools, et cetera, that have all been put in place. And we will not have to add them while the revenue is going to start
flowing both out of the balance sheet, which is extremely apparent, and you will be able to look at it in detail in the
10-Q filing that we should do either at the end of this week or the beginning of next, and in our new sales. So that's
what it is, revenue up, expenses stabilizing and actually going down.
<A - Kenneth Bond>: Thank you, Safra, next question?
<Q - Ross MacMillan>: Thanks, Safra.
Operator
Your next question will come from line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America.
<Q - Kasthuri Gopalan Rangan>: Hey, thanks for taking my question. My question is for Safra. Safra, how do you
view the investment trade-off between the license business and the cloud business? Because I think it's pretty apparent
to us that one business has higher growth but lower margin. And to parse your comments, it looks like CapEx is going
to come down for the cloud business. So are we at the point where the license business has troughed and is not going to
decline any more, and that the profit profile of the cloud business will start to add on? And that this year in some sense
is the trough in your operating profits, a lot of the other software companies have been attempting to make this model
transition have been resetting their numbers to the license business by their own volition is coming down, troughing,
and then the cloud business starts to pick up. So how should we look at Oracle in the context of the shift that's
happening here? Thank you very much.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Sure. First of all, the way we look at the on-premise business, and I'm not sure I'm entirely
understanding your question. But there are the new licenses and of course our massive installed base of license
subscriptions. We look at that as the on-premise business. And that business is steady, growing slightly, very profitable
of course because we are at scale. We still make a lot of investments in that area. However, you should be thinking
about the cloud business as another way for us to offer that same software to our customers in a different way, where
we are actually hosting the software and doing a lot more of the labor. And because we'll have economies of scale they
could not possibly have as individual customers, so really it's all one business. However, more and more when we
provide it as a cloud provider, we are providing the hardware, the software, the labor all in a package. And that gives us
a significantly larger amount of their wallet share.

Simultaneously, the customer is actually spending less overall because we can supply this package in a very
economical way. But also, since all of it is our own differentiated intellectual property, we can do it at much higher
margins. And the more scale we get, the more profitable we will be. We have been in a startup mode in this whole area.
We've done it basically within our profit envelope. However, this extremely quick transition, which you are truly
seeing the pivot in this fiscal year, which is the reason we're breaking it out for you and really breaking our own rules
of guidance where we're actually giving you a full-year guidance so you can see how we're coming out of it.
<Q - Kasthuri Gopalan Rangan>: So, Safra, to conclude this and take this to the financial implications, could this
year be the trough in operating profits, and then as a result of the nice investments, we start to see the operating income
of the company start to grow next year?
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: I believe it is, yes, absolutely.
<Q - Kasthuri Gopalan Rangan>: That's great. Thank you.

Our next question will come from the line of Brent Thill with UBS.
<Q - Brent John Thill>: Thanks. For Mark and Safra, I think your investors understand this transition to cloud is
going to take time. But the ramp is definitely taking longer than some of the financial forecasts you've given in the last
several quarters, and now you're calling for a weaker first half but a better second half. I guess just what's underpinning
your confidence that this ramp is going to happen in the back half?
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Frankly, it's not possible that it does not happen. There is a lot of revenue on the balance sheet
that will be recognized in the second half. It cannot not be. It is appropriate to do that. To the extent that in some cases
customers have been through their promotion period, and also we just have booked so many contracts that are ramping
up and billing and starting to bill, there really is – it's not avoidable. It is inevitable that Q2, that half two, second half is
going to be very significant.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Brent, I'd just add to it. First, we have the contracts. Second, when you look at the balance sheet
and see the $1 billion of deferred, you can just do the math. So we have contracts. And so it's just not – to Safra's point,
it's not a guessing game.
<Q - Brent John Thill>: Okay, that's very helpful. Just to follow up on the license guide, Safra, for the full year, you
mentioned that will stabilize versus what you saw last year in terms of the decline. What's giving you the confidence
there that that will stabilize versus what you saw last year?
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: I have my forecast. I have my closure rates that I'm expecting. Remember, it's not new license
only. It is our software installed base with extremely high renewal rates that continues. When we sell new licenses in
addition to our base, then we get additional growth. Again, the only question is what level of decline we have in new
license. We're being conservative. There's always risk that it won't be. But again, new license has gotten to be a smaller
percentage of that whole on-premise business, and we're doing the same type of estimating that we do. We do our best
with all the data we have.
<Q - Brent John Thill>: Great, thanks for the color.

<Q - Raimo Lenschow>: Hey, thanks for taking my question. Safra, I wanted to stay on that point a little bit. So if you
look at the license number that we see at the moment, it was like last quarter was minus 10%. This quarter was minus
9%. And obviously, with the cloud transition going on which impacts you negatively, can you talk a little bit about
other factors that might impact this? And we all heard about the issues around China, et cetera. So maybe talk a little bit
about what you see in the different regions that might impact that growth number as well. Thank you.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Sure. Look, there is no question that internationally there is quite a lot of chaos, to say the
least, and the currency impact of countries that we have been doing very well is not helping. Even though my Latin
America team is executing out of the park in constant currency, the devaluation of the different currencies in LAD, for
example, are very negatively affecting my U.S. dollar results. Obviously, there is quite a lot going on in Europe in
different parts, and both that and currency. I feel that Asia-Pacific for us is actually stabilizing. China is not a big
country for us historically, so that's less of an issue for us directly. But the countries and businesses that are impacted
by the China trade, like Australia, Canada, Brazil, those can be at risk.
So I'm not an economist. These things are impacted by especially transactional business, like new hardware sales or
new license sales are impacted by these regional issues. But in general, on-premise software, which is dominated by
software updates and product support, customers renew because that is software that is very important to them and is
doing the most important work in their companies, governments, or non-profits. And so that is obviously very, very
steady for us and continues to do well. But the transactional business is at the same potential risk. However, the cloud
momentum is so strong that overall we expect very significant growth, and that is from contracts already in hand in
most cases.
<Q - Raimo Lenschow>: Perfect, thank you.
Operator
And our final question today will come from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies.
<Q - John Stephen DiFucci>: Thank you. Safra, I'd like to better understand something I thought I understood, but it's
how exactly your bookings of SaaS and PaaS convert to revenue. For instance, bookings of PaaS and SaaS bookings
last quarter were somewhere around $425 million. And if you assume this was signed towards the end of the quarter,
I'd expect cloud revenue SaaS and PaaS to grow sequentially by about a quarter of this number or by about $100
million. But it only grew by a little more than $30 million, and I'm just curious. Is PaaS, because it sounded like PaaS
was a real big quarter last quarter, is the revenue recognition like SaaS, where it's recognized immediately in the same
amount over the three years of the contract, or is it recognized a little differently where it's recognized as a customer
consumes the technology? What am I missing here?
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: You're actually not missing anything. You're exactly asking the right question. And
unfortunately, the answer is it depends because depending on what kind of agreement the customer signed, they may
have signed a metered agreement, which means it will be recognized as they use it. However, it will expire after a
certain time period if they don't use it, and that is what we call metered. On the other hand, to the extent that they have
a subscription, then let's say one month's worth is recognized and then another month whether they use it or not. So
SaaS is almost always a subscription. PaaS can be either metered or a subscription. And so it is recognized differently,
and that's it.
<Q - John Stephen DiFucci>: That actually makes a ton of sense. It's really helpful, but just one quick question
follow-up to that. If it's a metered PaaS deal and it expires, at that time given the contract terms, the customers, do you
recognize anything remaining on that contract at the time of expiration?
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: If it's expired, let's say they bought $100,000 metered, you could almost consider it a gift card.
If they use it all on the first day, I'd book it all right then. If they don't use it at all, I book it when it expires.
<Q - John Stephen DiFucci>: Perfect, that's really helpful. Thanks, Safra.

<A - Mark V. Hurd>: John, I'd just add on SaaS, just to make sure you understand what's happening as we get to Q3
because Safra talked about Q3 and Q4. So when we entered the SaaS market, we had a series of promotions, meaning
that you would get some time to install. Our strategy was to give you an incentive when you bought that you had time
to then implement, and that promotion had a certain amount of time associated with it. Obviously, that was part of
building up our reference base.
Secondly, as we built up our reference base, we actually shortened the promotions, so it actually went down by half the
period of time. The two sets of promotions over the last couple of years, just by coincidence, coterminously end at the
end of Q2. So the percent of the bookings that were on those types of promotions both end at the end of Q2 of this
fiscal year. So that's one of the reasons in SaaS why you will see a jump in revenue that also will not be explained by
bookings. So again, while you say I couldn't explain Q2 to bookings, you won't be able to explain exactly the alignment
of the increase in revenue based on the bookings either because underneath it is this promotion.
So there are multiple dimensions here. There's this promotion dimension. There's the dimension that Safra described,
which is about a percent of our PaaS is metered and a percent of our PaaS is subscription. So there's a couple of
different ways you can consume the PaaS. In addition to it, it takes a certain amount of time for us in some cases. I told
you about a win, for example, last quarter at HSBC, a very large ERP in the cloud win. It will take us several months to
fully provision that ERP for HSBC. So it's those factors together that formulate the conversion of the booking to
revenue.
<Q - John Stephen DiFucci>: Just to be clear...
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: And one more time, why are we so confident? We have the contracts. We know the expiration
of the promotions. We know exactly when the PaaS expires. And in addition, you see all of that as it relates to deferred
on the balance sheet.
<Q - John Stephen DiFucci>: Great. Just to be clear, Mark, once you start, you're really giving in these SaaS
examples you gave, still, once it starts to be – you may delay the beginning, when you should begin to start recognizing
the revenue, but it will be recognized as a subscription, so even with the term.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: It's a very important tool, John, because instead of discounting, you actually renew against a
higher rate, and the promotion is basically a window by which you have time to get installed. And it's very important
tool as you're building up a reference base. And that's what we've done. Now the promotions over that period of time,
call that a two or three-year period of time, have declined and declined and declined. So the amount of promotion that's
available in our SaaS portfolio is materially smaller than it was two years ago and materially smaller than it was a year
ago. And so what happens is these things, the confluence of events really come together in Q3, which is where you see
this pop in our revenue. And then from there, you'll begin to see more ratable alignment of bookings to revenue, save
the one point about the PaaS consumption that Safra was making.
<Q - John Stephen DiFucci>: Okay, great. That's all really helpful. Thanks, Mark.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Thanks, John.
