MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Brittany, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to
welcome everyone to the BlackRock, Incorporated Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Earnings Teleconference.
Our host for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer,
Gary S. Shedlin; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, [ph] Christopher J. Meade (00:29). All lines have
been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer
period. [Operator Instructions]
Thank you. [ph] Mr. Meade (0:52), you may begin your conference..
Unverified Participant
Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I'm [ph] Chris Meade (0:58), the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we
begin, let me remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We
call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may, of course, differ from these statements.
As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which lists some of the factors that may cause the results of
BlackRock to differ materially from what we say today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update
any forward-looking statements.
So with that, let's begin.
Gary S. Shedlin
Good morning. Thanks, [ph] Chris (1:32). Happy New Year to everybody. It's my pleasure to be here to present our
fourth quarter and full year 2015 results. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our quarterly
financial performance and business results. As usual, I will be focusing primarily on as adjusted results.

In a year characterized by significant market and FX volatility, 2015 was another strong year for BlackRock as we
generated industry-leading organic growth, maintained stable operating margins, while continuing to invest in our
business, and returned approximately $2.6 billion of capital to our shareholders, representing a total payout ratio of
77%.
The differentiation and strength of BlackRock's diverse global investment platform once again enabled us to generate
consistent and stable financial results, allowing us to continue playing offense despite global macro uncertainty.
We saw strong results from our core business areas and remain committed to investing in a variety of strategic
initiatives that will further enhance our client value proposition and generate long-term value for our shareholders. In
the fourth quarter, BlackRock generated operating income of $1.1 billion and earnings per share of $4.75. Full year
operating income of $4.7 billion increased 3% versus a year ago, and earnings per share of $19.60 were up 1%, which
included the impact of higher tax rate in 2015.
Non-operating results for the quarter included $46 million of net investment gains, primarily driven by a $35 million
unrealized gain on a strategic private equity investment. Our as adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was 30%,
compared to a tax rate of 25.4% a year ago that reflected $39 million of non-recurring discrete tax benefits. We
continue to estimate that 31% remains a reasonable projected tax rate for 2016, reflecting changes in our geographic
business mix, though the actual effect of tax rate may differ as a consequence of non-recurring items that could arise
during the year.
BlackRock's fourth quarter results were driven by $54 billion of long-term net new business, representing an
annualized organic growth rate of 5% and the third highest flow quarter in BlackRock's history, and reflects the
resilience of our differentiated business model.
For the full year 2015, BlackRock generated long term net new business of $152 billion representing a 4% long-term
organic AUM growth rate and a 6% organic base fee growth rate as faster growth in our higher fee Retail and iShares
businesses contributed to a favorable overall change in our base fee mix. Long term net inflows were diversified by
asset class and investment style with positive flows across these categories for the full year.
BlackRock continued to deliver top line growth despite the challenging market. As fourth quarter revenue of $2.9
billion and full year revenue of $11.4 billion were both 3% higher than a year ago. Organic growth and improved
investment performance drove increases in base fees, performance fees, and Aladdin revenue, all of which reached
record levels in 2015.
Fourth quarter and full year base fees, each rose 3% year-over-year, primarily driven by organic growth despite over
$150 billion of negative FX impact and market depreciation on our AUM of the last 12 months. FX was a significant
drag in 2015 and we estimate that full year base fees grew 6% versus 2014 levels on a constant currency basis.
Sequentially, quarterly base fees were essentially flat, despite positive organic growth due to a lower fourth quarter
AUM entry rate, the continued impact of divergent beta on our fee rate as emerging and commodities markets once
again underperformed developed markets and ongoing dollar appreciation against foreign currencies.
Performance fees for the fourth quarter were $169 million, up 17% from a year ago driven by our broad suite of active
offerings, but down $39 million sequentially due to a single hedge fund that delivered exceptional full year
performance and locked in the third quarter.
Full-year performance fees of $621 million rose 13% versus 2014, evidencing strong alpha generation across our
diverse investment platform. Fourth quarter BlackRock Solutions revenue of $171 million was up 1% year-over-year,
and 2% sequentially.
Full-year 2015 Aladdin revenue of $528 million, which represented 82% of the BRS revenue, grew 11% year-over-year
driven by several sizeable client implementations and has more than doubled since 2009. We expect continued business
momentum in Aladdin driven by trends favoring global investment platform consolidation and multi-asset business
solutions.

Our Financial Markets Advisory businesses ended 2015 with $118 million in revenue. Despite lower levels of
opportunistic revenue post-financial crisis, FMA is benefiting from a more stable revenue profile driven by increased
number of mandates and more repeat engagements in the current margin environment.
Total expense for the fourth quarter rose $90 million year-over-year, driven primarily by an increase in compensation
and G&A expense. For the full year 2015, compensation expense increased $184 million or 5% due to higher head
count associated with our growth initiatives, higher incentive and deferred compensation, partly offset by the impact of
a stronger dollar. Recall that year-over-year comparisons of fourth quarter compensation expense are less relevant
because we determine compensation on a full-year basis.
Fourth quarter G&A expense increased $23 million year-over-year or 6%, primarily driven by $23 million of
deal-related expense associated with strategic transactions executed in the quarter. Sequentially, quarterly G&A
expense increased $91 million, primarily reflected a planned uptick in year-end marketing and promotional spend,
higher technology expense, and the previously mentioned $23 million in deal-related expense. Full year G&A expense
of $1.4 billion was 2% below 2014 levels reflecting expense awareness in a volatile market environment
notwithstanding the G&A spend in the fourth quarter.
If markets stabilize and given the impact of recent acquisitions on a run rate, we would anticipate a higher annual level
of G&A spend during 2016. Overall, total expense for 2015 increased 3% from a year ago compared to a similar
increase in revenue over the same period resulting in an as adjusted operating margin of 42.9% for the full year flat to
our 2014 level.
We remain committed to generating operating leverage in our business and have expanded our operating margin by
over 450 basis points since closing the BGI acquisition at the end of 2009. However, as we stated in the past, we also
do not manage the business to a specific margin target either quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year.
The diversification and stability of our business model affords us the option of investing through end market cycles to
grow share. We remain keenly focused on delivering long-term value to our shareholder by striking an appropriate
balance between organically investing for future growth and practical discretionally expenses.
At times, our strategic investments will also begin organic. During 2015, BlackRock closed several transactions
including BlackRock Kelso Capital Advisors, a domestic middle market lending platform; I Cuadrada, a Latin
American infrastructure investor and FutureAdvisor, a digital wealth manager.
In addition, on November 3, BlackRock announced an agreement to assume investment management responsibilities
for approximately $87 billion of cash and liquidity AUM currently managed by Bank of America Global Capital
Management. We expect that transaction to close in the first half of 2016.
During 2015, we also returned approximately $2.6 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share
repurchases. As we entered 2016, our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $2.29 per share of
common stock, representing an increase of 5% over the prior level. Since instituting a dividend in 2003, BlackRock has
grown its dividend at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 22%.
We repurchased $1.1 billion of our shares in 2015 and have now repurchased approximately 10 million shares since we
instituted a consistent and predictable approach to capital management in 2013. We remain committed to this approach
and a similar level of share repurchase in 2016, but could increase such amounts based on potential changes to the
relative valuation of our stock price.
Our 2015 financial results reflect the benefits of our differentiated global business model. Fourth quarter and full-year
net inflows of $54 billion and $152 billion, respectively, were positive in both our active and index franchises and
benefited from significant flows into iShares.
Global iShares generated $60 billion of net new business in the fourth quarter and record flows of $130 billion for the
year, representing full year organic growth of 13%. iShares captured the number one share of global, U.S. and
European ETF industry flows for both the fourth quarter and the full year.

Record fourth quarter equity iShares inflows of $48 billion were driven by demand for U.S. equities and a broad array
of developed market exposures. Fourth quarter fixed income iShares inflows of $12 billion reflected flows into core,
high-yield, and investment grade corporate bond funds.
BlackRock's global retail franchise saw fourth quarter inflows of $7 billion, reflecting the seasonal impact of capital
gains distributions. Full year 2015 net flows of $38 billion, representing 7% organic asset growth were driven by
diversified flows across our top performing fixed income platform.
International retail net inflows totaled $20 billion in 2015 and were paced by strong flows into international equities
and unconstrained fixed income, allowing BlackRock to maintain its year-to-date number one ranking in cross-border
mutual fund flows.
U.S. retail net flows of $19 billion in 2015 demonstrated resilience in a challenging year for the U.S. mutual fund
industry.
BlackRock's institutional franchise have long-term net outflows of $13 billion for the quarter and $16 billion for the
year, as we continue to see sizable asset allocation driven flows both into and out of low fee institutional index
products. However, we also continue to benefit from demand for higher fee active offerings as clients recognize the
value-added alpha-generating platform we have built across traditional and alternative active strategies. The positive
fee impact of this mix shift is in line with our growth strategy and enabled BlackRock's institutional business to deliver
organic base fee growth of 4% in 2015.
We generated $4 billion of institutional flows into core alternatives during the year. Flows were broad-based across a
diverse alternatives platform including infrastructure, fund of hedge funds, fund of private equity funds, and alternative
solutions offerings.
We ended 2015 with another strong fundraising quarter for illiquid alternatives raising $1 billion in new commitments.
Over the last three years, we've raised more than $17 billion in commitments and have nearly $11 billion of committed
capital to deploy for our clients. Committed capital translate into flows and AUM as those dollars are invested and will
be a source of future revenue growth.
In summary, in a year marked by periods of increased market volatility, divergent beta and significant currency
movements, our diversified business model delivered consistent financial results and allowed us to continue investing
for future growth. We remain confident that BlackRock's differentiated platform is well positioned to meet the needs of
our clients and shareholders in the years to come.
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry.
Laurence Douglas Fink
Good morning, everyone, and thanks, Gary. Our fourth quarter and full year results demonstrated that in times of rapid
change and market volatility, BlackRock's diverse business model can consistently generate strong results.
Over the last year, energy prices have deteriorated significantly with the price of oil dropping to levels not seen in more
than a decade. Growth in China remained sluggish, so emerging markets including Brazil face significant political and
economic challenges. And divergence of developed market monetary policies driving heightened volatility in rates,
currency, and equity markets.
The Federal Reserve's action to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly 10 years marked the end of a historical
period of monetary policy accommodation in the U.S. and the beginning of an extended gradual tightening cycle. All
these factors are leading to a much more divergent world in 2016 with higher levels of volatility ahead, as already
witnessed in the first few weeks of the year. And as the investment landscape changes, our clients' needs change as
well.

The differentiation of BlackRock's core business model drives consistency and resilience in our results. This positions
BlackRock to invest in our platform, investing in technology, investing in people, even in the most challenging and
volatile times, and to anticipate and adapt ahead of change so that we're positioned to provide our clients with
investment solutions to meet their evolving needs.
In a more fragmented investment landscape impacted by continued low rates, modest beta-driven returns, investors will
search for income. They'll search for capital appreciation through a combination of both active and alternative
investments, factors, smart beta strategies, and hybrid solutions.
No other firm in the world can provide all of these capabilities on a single platform supported by superior risk
management, technology and investment performance. And this is what's driving a deeper connectivity with our clients
than ever before and once again drove BlackRock's fourth quarter and our full year results.
BlackRock generated $54 billion of long-term net flows in the fourth quarter and $152 billion for the year, representing
annualized organic growth of 5% and 4%, respectively. Flows were driven by client demand for both active and index
solutions across asset categories, asset classes, across regions.
We saw $61 billion in growth in a year when most people talked about there's not demand for active strategies. We saw
$61 billion in growth in our active strategies and $92 billion of growth in index and iShares flows.
We generated flows of $53 billion in equities, $77 billion in fixed income, $17 billion in multi-asset, and $5 billion in
alternatives. We raised $38 billion in our retail platform, $130 billion in our iShares platforms, and in our institutional
platform, we raised $27 billion of active strategies that was offset by $43 billion of low fee institutional index outflows.
What I'm particularly very pleased with is the platform and how broad it is and it's evident, in 2015, there were 13
countries where we had net inflows in excess of $1 billion. In addition, in 2015, we had a record amount of 65 different
retail and iShare products generating more than $1 billion in net inflows. Industry leading organic growth story of
BlackRock that we delivered in 2015 is in addition that we raised 11% growth rates in our Aladdin product. Alpha
driven performance fees and expense awareness translated into positive result in both the top and bottom-line, even in
the face of tremendous headwinds that we saw in global equity markets and FX.
BlackRock has committed in having a deep and broad understanding of the world in which we and our clients operate
and invest in. Our commitment in being truly local in more than 30 countries that we operate in worldwide completely
positions BlackRock to understand our clients' needs and their specific investment requirements to better help them
navigate these markets and we're in a better position, I believe, than any other firm in the world to do that.
The BlackRock Investment Institute provides a platform across regions, across asset classes, across investment styles
for our investors to exchange the knowledge they build in local markets, debate investment topics, share expertise with
a goal of generating better alpha and managing risk for our clients.
This worldwide connectivity also has enabled us to have a deeper dialog and level of trust with clients around the
world. This year, the BlackRock Investment Institute touched nearly 20,000 clients globally through in-person
meetings, hosted conference calls and critical market events and in-depth publications. This knowledge and the
connective tissue combined with the talent of our investment teams has contributed to a strong performance across our
active platform.
As of the end of the fourth quarter, 91% of our active taxable fixed income assets and 90% of our scientific active
equity assets are above benchmarks or peer median for the last three years. Throughout 2015, we continued to make
progress on the reinvigoration and globalization of our fundamental active equity business, generating strong result for
clients with 76% of our fundamental active equity assets above benchmark or peer median for the one-year period,
highlighted by the strong turnaround we've seen in the performance in our flagship equity dividend fund.
The strength of our active performance has translated into flows, as I said earlier, we saw $61 billion of flows in 2015
in our active strategies despite a challenging year for active fund flows across our industry. We continue to diversify
our institutional active platform and deepen existing client relationships by creating hybrid solution-based strategies to
solve our clients' most complex investment needs.

Institutional active net flows of $27 billion in 2015 were primarily driven by fixed income and multi-asset solutions, as
institutions look to BlackRock to solve their most complex investment challenges.
On the retail side, the diversification of our EMEA retail business was a significant driver of results in 2015. And
BlackRock saw active net inflows from retail clients led by our European equity and income, our unconstrained fixed
income products, our high-yield products, and our multi-asset income products.
In the United States, the breadth of BlackRock's product suite across active index in iShares resonated with our retail
clients.
We remained focused on growing Global iShare market share and driving global market expansion, which translated
into strong flows in 2015.
The fourth quarter was a record quarter for iShares as investors continue to turn to BlackRock iShares franchise, which
generated $60 billion of net inflows across asset classes. For the quarter and for the year, iShares captured the number
one share of flows in the U.S., Europe globally with 37% global market share for the full year. 2015 iShares flows was
$130 billion primarily driven by developed market equities and fixed income.
The global core series saw flows of $46 billion representing a 23% organic growth. And record fixed income flows of
$50 billion was concentrated in our high-yield products, including investment grade corporate bonds and our high-yield
bonds.
Fixed income is a strategic priority for iShares, which led the industry in fixed income ETF flows for the quarter and
for the year, driven by iShares' consistency of having 15 of the top 25 fixed income ETFs by net flows in 2015.
Fixed income market volatility rose in December. And during this time of market stress, BlackRock's flagship
high-yield ETF, HYG, enabled clients to transact directly with one another at known, transparent, minute-by-minute
pricing, with ample liquidity. More than $20 billion of HYG traded in the two weeks ending December 18. We have
less than $1 billion in net redemptions, providing our markets and our clients' substantial liquidity with limited impact
on the underlying markets. As we look back in 2015, despite these spikes in market volatility, ETFs and specifically
iShares are increasingly being relied upon by clients for transparent, liquid, cost-effective investment solutions.
We continue to find opportunities to learn from market events to educate investors and focus on the long-term needs of
our clients in iShares and across BlackRock's platform by investing in areas that we believe will result in a more
complete solutions offering for our clients and deliver value for our shareholders. Being aware of what is going on in
the world around us, anticipating change and having the willingness to adapt is a critical part of our responsibility as a
fiduciary to our clients. Throughout the year, BlackRock has made significant enhancements to our platform through a
combination of investments for organic growth, for acquisitions and the evolution of our talent.
Technology is increasingly impacting our clients and our business. In 2015, we made investments to utilize technology
to gain new investment insights and to reach our clients more effectively. We're investing in big data and text analysis
to make better portfolio management decisions across our broad platform of quantitative and fundamental investment
styles.
Factor-based analysis will become more prevalent as market dispersion increases. We made significant enhancements
to our smart beta and factor-based investing platform including the hiring of Andrew Ang. And BlackRock generated
nearly $10 billion of smart beta net inflows in 2015 driven by iShares' Minimum Vol funds.
We're investing in retail technology to empower our intermediary partners for a high-quality, technological-enabled
advice capabilities to improve our clients' investment experiences. We closed on the acquisition of FutureAdvisor in the
fourth quarter, and we recently signed our first two clients representing the first B2B contracts of their kind in the U.S.
digital wealth management space.
We continue to see strong demand for alternative solutions as investors move beyond the boundaries of traditional
strategies to investments in real estate, infrastructure, other forms of real assets across the liquid platform.

Our hedge fund platform has grown 9% annually over the past five years and now stands at $31 billion in AUM, and
we continue to invest to broaden our platform and leveraging our top-performing internal talent to develop products
organically, as well as bringing in new managers.
We raised focus on our responsibility to partner with clients and simultaneously generating long-term returns and create
positive social outcomes. Over the past several years, we've grown our infrastructure platform to more than $7 billion.
This includes the industry-leading renewable power franchise, a strong infrastructure debt capability and meaningful
investments in Latin America like our acquisition and our partnership with Pemex.
These activities offer long-term benefits to both investors and the economies where they contribute to economic
growth, it contributes to the country's job creation and most importantly it contributes to a positive environmental
impact.
2015, we continued to invest in the BlackRock Impact platform, which manages now more than $200 million to
provide investors with the opportunity to generate long-term competitive financial returns and positively impact
society.
At BlackRock, embracing change has always been a core part of who we are. Nearly every year, we take a fresh look at
the organization and reflect on ways to improve it. We then evolve the organization in anticipation of changes of our
clients' needs and anticipation of the global markets.
Together with our Board of Directors, we undertake a deliberate process and effort to continually position our leaders
and roles that can broaden their experience and maximize their potential both for BlackRock and our clients. This is
critical in building a truly global firm. We did this in 2012 and 2014 with very positive benefits. This week, again, we
announced a number of enhancements to our leadership team that are part of this consistent process of developing our
people and evolving our organizations to meet these challenging needs.
Looking at the quality of the leaders taking on new or expanded roles, I'm incredibly proud of the depth of the talent
that we have. And I believe, today, we have the strongest leadership team we've ever had in the history of BlackRock.
And it is the quality and talent of this team that allowed BlackRock to deliver the performance we did in 2015 despite
the volatile markets and positions us very well for 2016. It is this team, they are the reason that we have forged such a
trusting relationship with our clients and why our clients are increasingly turning to BlackRock to solve their biggest
financial challenges.
As we head into 2016, we will continue to make investments in our future. We'll continue to develop our talent and
seeking ways to leverage and grow our diverse platform to meet our fiduciary responsibilities to our clients, our
fiduciary responsibilities to our societies where we operate, and to deliver the returns for our shareholders.
With that, let's open it up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Good morning, Craig.
<Q - Craig Siegenthaler>: Thanks. Good morning, Larry. So, first question on active bond flows. I'm just wondering,
given the improvement in yields over the last six months, what are you seeing across your institutional client base and
how does this compare to retail where there's been a [ph] sharp (32:01) reaction already to high yield bond prices, bank
loan prices and global bond prices where there's been a decline?
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Well, the widening in spreads is a blessing for our insurance clients, that's first and
foremost. Insurance companies are adding to their fixed income exposures now. As I've commented in the past, the

whole insurance industry or a good part of it is short-term liability duration, and they were hoping for higher rates. We
haven't seen higher rates.
Obviously, we're sitting here with a very low 10-year Treasury rate, but we most certainly have seen a widening in
credit spreads. And I think as evidence of a few large bond issues that went public this week, we saw huge demand.
And so, as spreads widen, we expect to see more demand institutionally.
And as you suggested, some of the widening of spreads or the fears of higher rates are going to produce some selling
possibly from retail, but we haven't seen anything dramatic yet. We haven't seen really any dramatic outflows on
iShares yet. So I don't think there is any real massive change yet.
I think one thing you should be aware of, Craig, at this time, this is when you have the institution sitting down on this
year's asset allocation. You're going to start seeing behavior changes probably in February and March when they start
doing the reallocations maybe. And so, most certainly, one would think, in some cases, some pension funds because of
decline in equities, they'll rebalance out of fixed income back into equities if they want to have consistent asset
allocations.
But our performance in fixed income, I think we have 91% of our products above peer median over the last three years
and that's across all our European fixed income, our U.S. fixed income, our unconstrained products, our low-duration
products, mortgage products, high-yield. And so, we're in a pretty good position to have broad-based conversations
with our clients.
<Q - Craig Siegenthaler>: Thanks, Larry. Just as my follow-up, I have an expense question here for Gary. Gary, G&A
expenses have trended down two years in a row now. I heard your color that I think they're likely going to be up in
2016, but can you help us in terms of magnitude and also given the revenue headwinds in the first quarter just from
beta, do you have any wiggle room that if things get worse, you can actually maybe cut a little bit into G&A too?
<A - Gary S. Shedlin>: Thanks, Craig. So, I think – yeah, I think, first of all, we wanted to make sure that people
understand kind of some of what went on in the fourth quarter. As you recall, during the year, we told you we've been
under-spending versus our original expectation going into 2015, and I would say that was a function initially of timing
and as the markets became more volatile during the year, frankly, overall expense awareness.
The fourth quarter G&A was clearly higher and, in fact, we've booked roughly a third of our annual M&P spend in the
quarter alone. And, as you saw, we incurred about $23 million of one-time deal expenses. Given that elevated level of
G&A, the fourth quarter is clearly not representative of a good run rate for next year.
Notwithstanding that, as you saw, G&A expense was 2% below last year, and I think that reflects our ability to manage
the discretionary portion of our G&A expense in an uncertain market environment, and we continue to remain
conscious of the trade-off between growth and margin, especially as we think about that discretionary portion of our
spending and the current markets.
That being said, I think that if markets stabilize, and given the impact of recent acquisitions on our run rate, we would
anticipate a higher level of G&A spend during the year. But there's obviously some discretion tied to that and we'll be
watching it very carefully.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: And, Craig, every year during the financial crisis and after, we do pay attention to our
margins and we navigate our expenses accordingly. And I would say that would be consistent going into 2016.
<Q - Craig Siegenthaler>: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.

<Q - Michael Roger Carrier>: Thanks, guys. Hi. How are you doing? Maybe just a question on, it seems like there
are some more regulatory items on the agenda with the most recently maybe the SEC liquidity proposal. And I know
you guys just submitted a like a comment letter. Just wanted to get your sense on – for the industry, particularly, given
like the market dynamics like maybe what are the pros, what are the cons, you guys mentioned the nuances between
EPS and fund, and I guess the hard part, I think for a lot of you who are in the industry is how to calculate some of
these things based on different environments. So just given your guys' positioning, I wanted to get your thoughts on
how you think this plays out and what are some of the challenges for it.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: This is a real difficult issue that – I think the SEC is going to be broad in how they
think about this issue. A, I think it is appropriate as an industry that we identify the risks associated to liquidity of every
product. I think there should be an appropriate measurement that is consistent and there should be probably different
variants by product as how you think about liquidity, and I think it's important for our investors worldwide to have
some form of measurement tool, so they could assess the liquidity risk associated with any one product.
And then you could see if there is a sharp divergence between one fund and another in terms of liquidity. I think we
learned that with the Third Avenue episode late last year with their divergency related to liquidity in their product, so to
me that is a great example where you could – if we had some form of measurement tool, the investors who invested in
products like that or funds like that could have assessed, am I getting the returns necessary to offset the ill liquidity that
is a component of that investment strategy.
So we're pretty sympathetic to all these things and the dilemma really arises for the SEC because if there is some
assessment of some sort of a large liquidity pool for every product, it really then will reduce investment dollars into the
markets. It's going to put – it will degrade return for retail investors.
The last thing you would want is having retail investors having degradation in their returns because we are all going to
be assess some type of liquidity threshold. And then all the institutional managers will go to a separate account that
may have only 30-day redemption features. So the last thing we want to do is hurt retail.
So I think a measurement tool of some sort is probably correct beyond some type of measurement tool of having some
type of cash holding, I'm kind of – I don't have a hard fast opinion on that, but I do believe that it represents some risks.
And then I think there are different characteristics between liquidity of an ETF and liquidity of a open-end fund. I think
our application has asked that they assess and look at the characteristic differences between ETFs and open-end mutual
funds. And we've recommended to the SEC to develop a separate and comprehensive rule addressing those different
investment product types and their associated risks.
So this is going to be addressed probably sometime in 2016. I think there's going to be quite a bit of time for comment
period and discussion and we'll see where this goes. But I think this is – we are in favor of this. I mean, one thing is
important, especially in an environment where markets are really unpleasant like what we're experiencing now.
One of the big issues is what are Americans doing now with their big energy savings? Are they investing for
retirement? Are they sitting with more of their cash in cash? If we could have more and more investors feel comfortable
that they could invest safely and soundly, and they have a better understanding of the risk and characteristics of
investing and understand the liquidity of a lot of our products, if that can then translate into more clients feeling good
about investing for the outcome of retirement, this is all good. So this is why we are in favor of this type of narrative
and dialog. Obviously, we'll have opinions on how that will play out.
<Q - Michael Roger Carrier>: Okay. Thanks for that. And then Gary, just a quick follow-up on the expenses. The
transaction cost, I think, you said $23 million, that's very clear. Just in terms of the normal seasonality, in terms of what
you see in fourth quarter versus the first – fourth versus the first, like what's that normal, like, maybe drop-off on, like,
the marketing spend just so we kind of understand? And you guys do that every year, meaning from the first to the
fourth. I just want to make sure we get that.
And then if the markets do remain volatile and pretty challenging, is there any way of guiding in terms of the expense
base whether it's G&A or overall, what's more variable meaning you have more discretion there?

<A - Gary S. Shedlin>: Yeah. I mean, I wish I could give you a better answer than you're probably looking for here,
Michael. But I think we obviously are – from an M&P standpoint, we plan a spend level during the year. But frankly,
we react during the year and maintained appropriate flexibility to make sure that we can get the biggest bang for our
dollar and make sure that we're not simply spending money in a time period where we don't think people are going to
be receptive to a lot of the messages.
I think Larry has talked about, volatility, a lot of investors basically may sit on the sidelines. Almost nothing you're
going to tell them or communicate to them is really going to change their mind. So, there is an element of kind of
managing it real time and we're going to continue to do that. So I can't really give you a whole lot of guidance there.
But I think important in terms of thinking about broader margin trends, I know you're tired of hearing me say this, but
we really aren't managing the business to a margin target, either quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year. We are absolutely
committed as part of our financial framework to growing and delivering operating leverage. And I think we've shown
you that we've done that, right?
I'd go back, I said this in my opening remarks. But we've expanded the margin by 450 plus basis points since BGI.
We've reinvested probably $1 billion back into the business, and we're going to continue to commit to striking the right
balance between strategic investments and managing our spend.
It's a lot easier for everyone sitting around this table, candidly, to cut cost than it is to invest for growth. That's the hard
part. And I think that the diversification of our model at the moment gives us the option to continue to invest through a
market cycle when many others may be forced to pull back. But we're not going to be blind to that. I think the key is
obviously kind of watching what's going on here and trying to determine at what point it really becomes more of a
near-term item and more of a mid to long term. And then obviously, we'll react appropriately.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: But let me add one more thing. Our success in 2015 was directly related to the
investments we made in the last few years. I think our differentiated business model has much to do with these
investments, and we are going to – I'm not suggesting we have five or six investments in mind for 2016, or 2017, or
2018. But I do believe we have to have the mindset of growing revenues through investments.
And, however, as you witnessed when – as shareholders in 2008 and 2009, we managed our expenses quite
extraordinarily at times when you had to do that. So it's going to be a mix. But we do have a mind set of growing the
business. And that's the differentiating factor. As Gary said, it's a lot easier to just cutting expenses or cutting head
count, it's a lot more bold to make the investments at the time when everybody is running away from investments, and
we will continue to look at both.
<Q - Michael Roger Carrier>: Okay. Thanks a lot.

Your next question comes from Luke Montgomery with Bernstein Research.
<Q - Luke Montgomery>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Hey, Luke.
<Q - Luke Montgomery>: Hi. Thanks. So, organic base fee growth has been tracking steadily and, I think, quite
robustly at 6%. One of the key dynamics, though, is the fairly rapid growth of your core ETF series, and you've been
reducing fees there. I know you're targeting a different kind of investor with those products, but wondered whether you
expect those products to eventually get enough liquidity that maybe they'll attract more institutional interest, and
whether you see that as a longer-term challenge to maintaining the current level of organic base fee growth?

<A - Robert S. Kapito>: So we're going to respond to what we think investors' needs are and certainly for the retail or
buy and hold customer. They're looking for the core series to get more specific allocations to the generic product and
we're going to respond and we'll respond as far as the fees go as well. But we see that continuing to grow as it gives the
client much better access to that precision instrument that they're looking for.
Institutions on the other hand, I think, we'll see. We're seeing they're expressing first in the high yield because they're
yield hogs and they're looking for yields. But as we expand out the product set I think they will be looking to invest in a
core series as well.
But I don't really think that's going to put pressure on our fees, quite frankly because the institutional set looks
differently at the ETF market than the buy-and-hold set. They're looking for liquidity, so it's important that we grow
these particular products, so they have the liquidity and they're willing to pay for the liquidity and access into those
sectors.
So, it started out, the global core series, which has been very successful for us this year. And we raised a significant
amount of assets, about $46 billion. I think that is going to expand institutionally, and we're going to also buffer that
with other products that institutions are looking at to get that precision investment.
<A - Gary S. Shedlin>: Yeah. Luke, I might just add – just to put into perspective notwithstanding the growth in core,
today, iShares is a $3.1 trillion franchise and the aggregate of the core on a global basis is a little over $200 billion.
So, today, it represents probably a little less than 20% of the overall business. And keep in mind that the average fee
rate for our overall iShares business today is still on the low 30%s, with that 20% obviously reflecting a much lower fee
rate. So, it just gives you a sense of the fee rates still in the overall book of business.
<Q - Luke Montgomery>: Okay. Okay. Thanks. And then as a follow-up, just touching on the leadership changes you
made recently, I was hoping perhaps you could expand on the decision to combine leadership for active equity and
scientific active equity? And if you anticipate whether that could have a meaningful effect on how you're seeking to
manage active equity products?
<A - Robert S. Kapito>: Yeah. So there is less distinction between the active equity business than we were getting
credit for. In the scientific active equity business, it's a business that we use signals, data and lot of quantitative screens
for. And in the fundamental business, we relied more upon our long-term views of the market, management, the
product, et cetera. And we find that there's a tremendous amount of crossover between the two and overlap.
And so rather than let our own internal bureaucracy get in the way of the returns for the clients, we have these groups
now working very closely together and understanding where the overlap is and utilizing that overlap to add additional
alpha into the portfolios. So I think by having these two teams really merged together, you'll see better results and
better alpha from the active equity business. And it will be much less confusing to our clients as to when they come in.
How we are driving alpha and I think that will add to also increased interest in the BlackRock portfolio. And my goal is
to make sure that we are considered a very formidable manager of active equities.
So there will be no one that will have the span of equity products that we have across both the quantitative and the
fundamental offerings. So, yeah, I'm very excited about it, and I think having this group worked together has already
shown us some very good results. And this year, our equity performance is better than it's ever been. So we're going to
continue working on coming up with new ways in the market to add alpha. So very, very positive on this change that
we made.
<Q - Luke Montgomery>: Okay. Thanks a lot for taking my questions.

<Q - Alexander V. Blostein>: Great. Good morning, everybody. I wanted to start with a question around capital
management. It looks like the dividend increase this quarter was maybe a little bit lower than what we've seen in prior
several years. Is that a reflection of just the markets being a little bit choppier than the way you guys are kind of
looking at the cash flow stream over the next 12 months or just alternative uses of capital? And I guess within the same
question, Gary, your comments on the kind of flattish buyback, but relative to valuation of the stock, I wonder if you
could flush it out for us a little bit more?
<A - Gary S. Shedlin>: Sure, Alex. So, on the dividend, as you know, our stated policy is to target a 40% to 50%
dividend payout ratio. That has migrated somewhere between 40% back in 2013 and about 44% last year. And based
on what we know today, we think a 5% increase in the dividend is prudent and aligned with that philosophy.
As it relates to the buyback, I think in the current market, as I mentioned, we continue to repurchase – we are going to
continue repurchasing stock in an amount no less than last year. However, there's been a lot of market dislocation. And
we're certainly not trying to target or signal any type of beta call on this, but we will be watching the relative valuation
of our stock to see if it's prudent for our shareholders to potentially increase as markets evolve over the coming months.
<Q - Alexander V. Blostein>: Got it. And then, Larry, the point you...
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Let me just add – Alex, let me just add one more thing related to the dividend. I think
in this volatile year, especially if you look at some of the high-paying dividend stocks today, I think you're going to see
quite a few companies are going to have to lower the dividends. One of the histories of our platform, we never lowered
the dividends ever even in the financial crisis. And so to me it's about a discipline, it's a commitment in this. So, as
Gary said, we are always committed of having a proposed dividend rate of somewhere between the 40% and 50% level,
and we've stuck to that level and we never – at some years, we had it a little more elevated when we – especially after
the 2008 crisis, above that range but, obviously, with the market turnaround and our business growth it became more
normalized again.
But importantly, when we look at capital management, as Gary said, we do look at the combination of dividend and
stock repurchases. And I think we have quite a bit of flexibility in 2016.
<Q - Alexander V. Blostein>: Right. Understood. And then, Larry, just a question there for you on FutureAdvisor
platform and the relationship that you manage that you guys were able to lock in. Can you spend a minute, I guess, on
the type of services you'll be providing, the economics of that business to BlackRock as a whole? And then I guess just
more importantly, the opportunity that you see for yourself in that marketplace?
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Well, we're very pleasantly surprised how well the reception from our distribution
partners related to the desire of using FutureAdvisor. The business proposition is they use our technology. It is their
name on the platform powered by BlackRock Solutions FutureAdvisor, [ph] not unlike (55:29) how we use Aladdin.
The business proposition is they use this technology to empower their advisors, ultimately to empower their clients
with better digital information.
Many of our products or all the products are from our iShares platform. And we believe this will enhance our
connectivity and the utilization of iShares to many of these platforms, and that is the key business proposition.
Probably the most encouraging thing, I would not be surprised over the next coming months, we announced a number
of other licensing and agreements. So it is very clear, more than ever before, our distribution partners are in need of
digital advice, and they are looking for different ways of connecting with their clients and we believe a combination of
the Aladdin services that we could provide plus the digital advice through FutureAdvisor. No organization has that
combination. No organization has that combination. And so it is actually allowing us to possibly expand their Aladdin
business on top of the digital advice.
But let me be clear, we are paid through the utilization of our products and possibly the licensing of Aladdin products.
But it sets us up to have deeper connectivity with our distribution partners and that's what we're trying to do.
<Q - Alexander V. Blostein>: Yeah. That makes sense. Thanks so much.

Your final question comes from Bill Katz at Citi.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Good morning, Bill.
<Q - William Raymond Katz>: Good morning, everyone. Maybe points of clarifications because a lot of my
questions are already asked. Just on the relative valuation dynamic, Gary, you had mentioned, is that relative to your
historical multiple relative to the group, relative to the S&P? Just trying to get sense of sensitivity about what we
should be watching for there?
<A - Gary S. Shedlin>: Yes, yes and yes.
<Q - William Raymond Katz>: All right.
<A - Gary S. Shedlin>: That was a good question, Bill. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, again, as I said, we're not trying to make
– it's not to me a call on whether beta is going to go up or down, it's a call as to whether or not we think the market is
valuing our stock consistent with our growth.
And I think that's – I think consistency is incredibly important. We've been buying the stock all the way up from the
low $200s to where we are. We haven't been looking for moments of beta weakness and we're going to basically
continue with that along and be mindful if we could see there's a disconnect.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: We have a lot of flexibility, Bill.
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks?
Laurence Douglas Fink
First of all, I want to thank everybody. I thought the questions were quite good this morning and sorry that we didn't
have time to reach everybody, but I'm sure Gary and Tom will spend the time with all of you related to further
questions.
Our fourth quarter 2015 results reflect the strength in a differentiated business model. And I think hopefully this is what
resonates with all of you. It is those investments we made and it's is our ability to execute and manage expenses
accordingly, grow accordingly, especially in these challenging business environments. We're going to continue to
invest to meet the demands of our clients, to meet the demands of society, and hopefully to deliver the long-term
returns to our clients so they have a better future also.
It is incredibly important in these volatile times that everybody, all of us, focus on the long-term needs of our clients,
not the short term noise that we are experiencing every day, but focusing on outcomes for our investors. I do believe
BlackRock is the firm that clients are looking for that outcome conversation. And I do believe we will have greater
dialog with our clients in 2016 than we did in 2015.
With that, everyone, hopefully let's enjoy 2016 a little more and let's hopefully we can enjoy our day-to-day job in a
better environment. Have a good quarter.
