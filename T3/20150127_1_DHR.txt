Thomas Patrick Joyce
Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. We were very pleased with the strong finish to 2014. The Danaher
Business System continued to enhance our competitive advantage, driving market share gains, solid core margin
expansion and record free cash flow generation.
For the full year, our targeted organic investments helped drive 3.5% core revenue growth, and our total revenue is now
just shy of $20 billion. These investments in new products and go-to-market initiatives enabled us to increase market
share in many of our businesses including Fluke, Hach, Gilbarco Veeder-Root, Radiometer, AB SCIEX, Implant
Direct, and Videojet.
From a portfolio optimization perspective, 2014 was also a very busy year for Danaher. We announced or closed 18
acquisitions for nearly $4 billion, improving our market-leading positions across the portfolio. Most notable among
these are our two largest deals, Nobel Biocare and Devicor, which closed in December. We also announced the
combination of our Communications business with NetScout, which we believe will better position these two highly
complementary businesses for long-term success.
Finally, we divested the electric vehicle system and hybrid product lines within our Automation platform. Going
forward, we remain focused on building a better, stronger Danaher by utilizing our robust balance sheet and smartly
deploying our $8 billion-plus of acquisition capacity.
In 2014, we generated a record $3.2 billion of free cash flow. And our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio
was 122%. This represents the 23rd consecutive year in which our free cash flow exceeded net income, an important
metric that represents the quality of the earnings we generate. We also returned more of this cash to shareholders,
increasing our annual dividend to $0.40 per share from $0.10 per share.
Turning to the fourth quarter. Revenues grew 3% to $5.4 billion, while organic revenue grew 4%, exceeding our
expectations. More than half of our platforms delivered mid single digit core revenue growth, including T&M
Instruments, Water Quality, Gilbarco Veeder-Root, Diagnostics, Life Sciences, and Product ID. Acquisitions increased
revenues by 2.5% while currency translation decreased revenues by 3.5%.
From a geographic perspective, high-growth markets increased at a mid single digit rate. Performance was mixed with
solid results in China and double digit growth in the Middle East, partially offset by slowing growth in Latin America
and a high teens decline in Russia. In the developed markets, both the U.S. and Western Europe grew at a mid single
digit rate, an acceleration from the low single digit growth experienced in the first three quarters of the year. Sales in
the U.S. increased at the fastest rate since the second quarter of 2011 with our Gilbarco Veeder-Root and Life Sciences
platforms up more than 10%.
Our fourth quarter gross margin was 52.5%, excluding the impact of productivity initiatives. Core operating margin
increased 70 basis points, with three of our five segments improving greater than 100 basis points. Our reported

operating margin declined 50 basis points to 16.4%, due primarily to increased productivity charges and the dilutive
impact of recent acquisitions. In total, we spent approximately $155 million on productivity initiatives in the fourth
quarter.
For the full year, our gross margin was 52.4% and our gross profit improved nearly $500 million. This allowed us to
increase our combined investment in R&D and sales and marketing over $200 million from 2013, while expanding core
operating margin 65 basis points. We reported fourth quarter adjusted diluted net EPS of $1.04, which compares
favorably to our previous guidance of $1.00 to $1.04, and represents an increase of 8% year-on-year. For the full year,
adjusted diluted net EPS was $3.68, also up 8% from 2013.
Now turning to our five operating segments, Test & Measurement revenues increased 1.5% while core revenues were
up 0.5%. Reported operating margin improved 130 basis points while core operating margin declined slightly. Core
revenue in our Instruments platform increased at a mid single digit rate, with growth in most major geographies. This
was the platform's highest quarterly growth rate in over three years, driven by improving market conditions, organic
investments, and new product innovations such as Fluke Connect.
Fluke core revenues were up mid single digits for the second consecutive quarter, with our core Industrial and
Biomedical product lines each increasing at a high single digit rate or better. Distribution sellout in North America
accelerated sequentially, growing at a high single digit rate. Demand in Europe was also healthy.
At Tektronix, core sales were up mid single digits, representing the highest quarterly growth rate since the third quarter
of 2011. Demand was strongest in North America with solid growth in the military and government, optical, and
semiconductor segments. During the quarter, Tektronix launched the RSA306 radio frequency spectrum analyzer, a
portable USB-powered device which offers as much functionality as a benchtop equipment, allowing engineers in the
field to ensure radio frequencies are free of distortion and interference.
Our Communications platform core revenues decreased at a double digit rate. Mid single digit growth in our security
solution and network enterprise businesses was more than offset by a decline in network management solutions, where
we continue to experience delays from our North American wireless carrier customers. Despite the weakness on the top
line, we were encouraged by our book-to-bill ratio, which was almost 1.2 times for the second half of 2014, and we
believe our Communications platform will return to growth in 2015.
We continue to expect the combination of our Communications business with NetScout to close in mid-2015, subject to
approval by NetScout's shareholders and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including regulatory
approvals and the absence of a material adverse change with respect to either our Communications business or
NetScout.
At Arbor, North American sales increased over 25%, with robust demand from enterprise security customers. During
the quarter, Arbor further strengthened its presence in the enterprise segment with the launch of Pravail Security
Analytics. This scalable cloud-based solution allows organizations of any size to detect and view attacks on their global
networks in real-time and in greater detail than ever before. Fluke Networks saw double digit growth in its network
installation tools and enterprise systems products. FNET's bookings also grew at a double digit rate, surpassing $100
million in the quarter for the first time in its history.
Turning to our Environmental segment, revenues grew 5.5%, with core revenues up 5%. Segment operating margin
declined 330 basis points, primarily due to the dilutive effect of recent acquisitions and incremental productivity
charges. Water Quality core revenues increased at a mid single-digit rate, led by robust growth in our analytical
instrumentation and chemical treatment businesses. Hach had another outstanding quarter, with growth across most
major product lines. U.S. municipal sales were up high single digits, as customers are increasing their maintenance
project budgets.
Sales in China were up over 20%, driven by the government's continued focus on environmental protection. And last
quarter, we highlighted the SL1000 Portable Parallel Analyzer, a breakthrough product that simplifies the water quality
testing process. Hach's new product introductions, including the SL1000, have exceeded expectations with revenue
from new portable lab products tripling from 2013.

ChemTreat reached another sales milestone in December, achieving $400 million in annual sales for the first time.
ChemTreat has now nearly doubled in size from its acquisition in 2007. Notably this has largely been organic, the
result of the development and application of their best in class go-to-market model.
Gilbarco Veeder-Root's core revenues grew mid single digits as sales of point-of-sale solutions and dispensers in the
U.S. increased over 30%. GVR's comprehensive product suite has helped to make it the preferred solution among
customers looking to upgrade their payment systems to comply with upcoming EMV security requirements. Sales were
also robust in China where demand for GVR's vapor recovery and dispenser products grew double digits.
Moving to Life Science & Diagnostics, revenue increased 3%, with core revenues up 5%. Core operating margin
improved 135 basis points. For the full year, core operating margin expanded 110 basis points. This marks the fifth
consecutive year segment core operating margin has improved over 100 basis points. Core revenues in our Diagnostics
platform grew mid-single digits, with healthy demand in both the high-growth and developed markets. For the third
consecutive quarter, core revenues at Beckman Coulter increased at a mid single digit rate, led by immunoassay,
chemistry and urinalysis solutions.
Beckman also experienced strength in their Automation business, where new products such as Power Express drove
record December shipments. The positive momentum in the U.S. continued, with our sales team achieving record
customer retention and win rates leading to mid single digit growth. Beckman received 510(k) clearance for the vitamin
D Total assay on its Access line of instruments. This represents a significant addition to Beckman's Bone Metabolism
Testing Menu, as nearly 1 billion people in the world are estimated to be vitamin D deficient. Beckman also introduced
four immune suppressant drug assays, allowing doctors to better monitor therapeutic drugs in transplant recipients.
Radiometer's core revenues were up approximately 10%, with HemoCue sales increasing double digits and AQT
growing over 35%. 2014 marked Radiometer's 10th anniversary with Danaher. The results over the past decade have
been extraordinary. With the team increasing revenues more than 2.5 times to nearly $800 million, while tripling
operating profit.
Leica Biosystems core sales were up high single digits, with healthy demand across our entire suite of anatomical
pathology instrumentation and consumables. Advanced staining finished the year strong in the U.S., placing a record
number of BOND systems in the quarter. In December, Leica Biosystems acquired Devicor, a leading provider of
minimally invasive biopsy systems and consumables used in breast cancer diagnostics. This acquisition moves Leica
further upstream in anatomical pathology to the biopsy, providing sample control and delivering higher levels of
diagnostic quality and confidence.
Core revenues in our Life Science platform were up mid single digits led again by the U.S. and Europe. AB SCIEX
core revenues grew mid single digits, with strength in clinical, pharma and applied markets. We've been pleased with
the market reception of our new 6600 TripleTOF with SWATH Acquisition 2.0 software, with demand exceeding
expectations since launch in June of last year. Those of you who attended our Investor Day last month heard about
OneOmics, AB SCIEX's innovative partnership with Illumina. OneOmics brings together next-generation sequencing
and proteomics data in the cloud to help advance research across multiple diseases, such as cancer, diabetes,
Alzheimer's and heart disease. This unique solution has received significant attention in the research community and
was named one of the top 15 inventions in 2014 by the Analytical Sciences magazine.
Leica Microsystems' core sales increased mid single digits, with growth across all major product lines. The confocal
line of microscopes continues to garner industry recognition, with the latest SP8 STED 3X receiving a top 10
Innovation Award from the Scientist magazine. The STED further advances research in important fields such as
immunology, by providing scientists a 3D view of previously unobservable details of living cells.
Turning to Dental. Segment revenues increased 6%, while core revenues were up 2.5%. Our core operating margin
improved 185 basis points. As we previously mentioned, during the quarter, we closed on the acquisition of Nobel
Biocare. We're excited to have Nobel Biocare as part of the Danaher team, and the business ended 2014 with its
seventh consecutive quarter of core revenue growth. While still very early, we've been pleased with the feedback from
both associates and customers, and we look forward to sharing further updates on Nobel's performance with you in the

coming months.
Dental consumables core revenues were up low single digits, with 30% growth in China and the Middle East, partially
offset by continued weakness in the U.S. Implant Direct, our value-oriented implant business, continues to perform
well, growing double digits. During the quarter, we expanded our endodontic product line with the launch of
elementsfree, a cordless hand tool featuring motorized extrusion and precise temperature control, giving endodontists
unmatched accuracy and flexibility to perform complex procedures such as root canals.
Dental technology's core revenues were up low single digits, led by double-digit growth in handpieces. Last quarter, we
launch the i-CAT FLX MV, our most recent advance in 3D imaging. Customer reception has been exceptional with
over 100 systems shipped to date. We also expanded our line of dental surgical equipment, with the launch of KaVo
MASTERsurg LUX. The KaVo MASTERsurg line is our latest innovation in surgical instruments for dental implants
and oral surgery, improving productivity and clinical accuracy by enabling dentists to store and program settings for
multiple procedures. The MASTERsurg line also provides better surgical command and flexibility with the industry's
first wireless foot control.
Moving to our Industrial Technologies segment. Revenues declined 1% while core revenues were up 5%. Core
operating margin expanded 120 basis points and reported operating margin expanded 310 basis points to 20.4%.
Automation core revenues grew at a low single-digit rate, led by strong demand in North American distribution and for
industrial automation products in China. This marks the third consecutive quarter of growth for the Automation
platform.
Core revenues in our Product Identification platform grew mid single digits, with high single-digit growth in developed
markets and double digit growth in Europe. At Videojet, core revenue was up high single digits as it continues to gain
market share broadly. During the quarter, Videojet launched Remote Services the industry's first virtual troubleshooting
solution for printers. With Remote Services maintenance technicians can now resolve customer problems up to 90%
faster than field visits. Innovative solutions such as these help Videojet increase their service contracts more than 20%
in 2014.
X-Rite finished the year strong with both sales and orders growing double digits. In December, Pantone announced
Marsala as the 2015 Color of the Year, with extensive media coverage online, in print, and on TV. The Color of the
Year and the billions of media impressions it generates solidifies Pantone's iconic brand and was one of the drivers of
high single digit growth in X-Rite's color standards business in 2014.
So to wrap up, we had a strong finish to the year, with core revenue growth exceeding our expectations. The Danaher
Business System helped us to gain market share, while also driving solid core margin expansion and record free cash
flow. While cognizant of the current macroeconomic challenges, our investments in growth and productivity initiatives
combined with a robust balance sheet leave us confident in our ability to outperform in 2015 and beyond.
We are initiating first quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $0.90 to $0.94, which excludes noncash
amortization expense and certain acquisition-related charges. We are assuming first quarter core revenue growth of 4%
or better. We are also updating our full-year 2015 adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance, which we now
expect to be in the range of $4.30 to $4.40.
The strengthening of the U.S. dollar since our December investor meeting is expected to reduce 2015 earnings by
approximately $0.10 per share. We anticipate offsetting approximately $0.05 per share of this headwind from savings
associated with the incremental fourth quarter productivity initiatives we highlighted, recent acquisitions, including the
Siemens microbiology deal, which we expect to close in the near term, as well as other actions. Core revenue for the
full year 2015 is anticipated to grow between 3% and 4%.

Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We will first go to Steven Winoker with Bernstein. Your line is now open.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Thanks and good morning, guys.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Morning.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Good morning, Steve.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: I hope you're staying warm and dry down there.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: And same to you and to all on the call, thanks for what might have been a challenging
morning for many.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: I'm sure none of us would miss this. Anyway, core operating margin in T&M and
Environmental, could you just walk us through the slight decline in T&M and the bigger one in Environmental, what
drove that? A little more detail there'd be great.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Sure, Steve. The Test & Measurement, obviously, the decline this quarter is a lot less than it's
been in previous quarters, and it's largely driven by the Communications business, which was again down mid-teens.
So a very high contribution margin business, and that volume is really impacting Test & Measurement.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: And then Environmental?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Environmental, it was pretty clear we were having a very strong quarter both at GVR and
across the Water businesses. They have a number of growth initiatives and this created an opportunity to accelerate
some of that R&D and go-to-market investment here in the fourth quarter. I don't think it's indicative of a trend at all. I
think it was an opportunity to get ahead of some things, given the strength we saw that began early in the fourth
quarter.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: And Steve, just to add to that, on the Environmental side, certainly at Hach, in the water
analytics businesses, those businesses continue to perform exceptionally well. They've covered virtually every bet
they've made when it came to some incremental investment to drive top line and share gain. So when those guys come
up with an opportunity to put a little bit more at work to drive growth and share, we tend to be supportive of that if we
can see our way to covering for them.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay. Great. And then on currency, maybe – I know we've talked about currency a lot in
the past. You weren't able to fully offset that for your guide for the year just given how big a drop, obviously, it's been
even since December. But what's your ability, I think, to sort of provide, do you think, maybe additional offsets during
the year? And then secondly, do you have any competitive issues on pricing and whatnot in any of your markets, given
such a large move in currency and competitors' ability to price for that?
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Steve, on the first point, in no way have we thrown in the towel on the balance of going
after that extra $0.05. We're continuing to challenge the teams, as we always do, to try to come back on that. But we're
encouraged by the strong start we've had here coming out of the fourth quarter, encouraged by what we're seeing in the
early stages here of January. So that feels good.
But we know the strength of the dollar is a headwind. We're doing things proactively, as we did, using the productivity
initiatives to get a piece of that back. Siemens is obviously going to help a bit there. And I think we'd also get a little bit
of help, and that's part of the $0.05 that we've clawed back from what we think would be a – maybe a little bit of
deflation, that could help us on some commodity costs and perhaps some freight and transport costs. So I think we've
got a few things that give us confidence in getting the first $0.05 back, but we're continuing to work on the balance for
sure.

<A - Daniel L. Comas>: I think on the second question about competitively, clearly the – there's been an impact with
the euro on our financial results. But competitively, we have not seen that impact. We said after the third quarter, we
thought we were taking share in Europe, we just posted a mid single digit core growth number in Europe. I suspect
that's going to be towards the top of the class here after all companies report. So despite the stronger dollar, we are
performing extremely well in Europe right now.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: All right, guys. I'll pass it on. Thanks.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Thanks, Steve.
Operator
And our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS. Your line is now open.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Hey, Shannon.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Hey. Just in terms of the strength that you saw in the U.S., maybe a little more color on
what particular piece of that might have surprised you most, and what you feel the best about continuing.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Sure. Well, as I think I mentioned, it was a terrific quarter in the U.S., the best since the
second quarter of 2011. It was remarkably broad-based, Shannon. We saw strength at GVR, saw strength in T&M
Instruments, Tek and Fluke continuing to execute better, saw a good sellout associated with the Fluke business. The
Hach business continues to perform very well with our muni customers releasing funds associated with projects. And
we're very encouraged by what we saw in Life Sciences, with good performance in that platform. So it was a number of
businesses that had a very good finish to the year in the U.S.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: And sometimes we've had a good fourth quarter, and then it kind of catches up a little
bit in 1Q. I mean, this – you didn't sense any kind of boost from just kind of year-end flush?
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Yeah, so it's – one of my favorite topics, of course, Shannon, in the first week of any
January is, did we see anything that might cause an air pocket? It looks pretty good from where we sit right now. The
early January orders, and it is still early, appear pretty good. So we're encouraged by that and we think we're off to a
good start.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: And then just on M&A, the world's gotten more volatile here in the market certainly in
2015. Is that good for you guys from an M&A perspective? I mean do you feel better about the acquisition environment
than you did a few months ago, or worse? How does that impact you?
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Well, Shannon, generally, volatility is kind of a positive for the strong corporate buyer.
We've seen some of the restrictions being put on private equity here around leverage. That definitely has a favorable
impact as well.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Thanks, Shannon.

<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Can you just talk about what you're seeing in emerging markets, and maybe within
some of your more cyclical businesses in emerging markets? China maybe specifically?
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Sure, Steve. We're continuing to see very good performance in China. But first of all,
just broadly, across high-growth markets, we clearly have seen a narrowing of the delta that we had seen for a long
time between the high-growth markets and developed markets in general. Part of that is a function of some of the
strength we've seen in the U.S. Certainly our execution in Europe, where we've gained share in a variety of places,
continues to also support good performance on our side in the developed markets.
On the high-growth market side, again, helping – or causing a narrowing of that delta, we've got both a slower position
in China in a macro sense, obviously, some weakness in smaller markets where we have less exposure, but we see a
little bit of impact in places like Russia. And Brazil clearly is in a slower growth mode than it had been in the prior
couple years. Probably a bright spot in the Middle East, with excellent performance from our businesses but actually,
we believe, a pretty good macro environment there at least at the moment. In China specifically, Steve, we've had very
good performance across a number of our businesses. The Environmental business, certainly Hach and GVR, are
performing exceptionally well there.
Our Dental business continues to grow double digits in China. And probably the core weak spot remains the Life
Science business. We've talked quite a bit over the last number of months about some of the issues there relative to
some scrutiny around tenders, some slowing of the release of funding, but we think there may be a point of stability
that we've reached here and maybe some cause for some improvement here in 2015. Dan was actually just there a week
or so ago in China and he may have a couple thoughts.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Yeah, Steve, just to add one or two things. We grew full year in China kind of 8% or 9%. Q4
was a little slower, is more like 6% but I would say the tone there was pretty good. Clearly,Test & Measurement got
better through the year, much better second half than first half. As Tom alluded to, most of the healthcare businesses;
Environmental was up double digit, Dental was up double digit, Diagnostic was up double digit on a very large revenue
base. And Industrial, which was negative, has returned to kind of modest growth as well.
Life Science was down mid single digit for the full year kind of in that zone in the fourth quarter, but I think that the
tone in early January, I think in part because 2015 is the fifth year of their current Five-Year Plan and they are
fundamentally, I think, still very committed as a country to Life Science research. I think the tone is a little bit better
there as well. I'm not saying we're going to bounce back to double digit growth here in Life Science, but would not be
at all surprised if we turn positive here in 2015.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Great. Thanks for the color.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Thanks, Steve.

And we'll take our next question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Good morning, gents.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Hey, Jeff.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Hey. Just a couple quick ones here too. Could you elaborate a little bit, Tom, on the comments
on U.S. muni, do you think there's actually a turn going on there or was there just kind of some project activity in the
quarter?
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Jeff, I think in general, we see some macro strength in the muni market, with some of
the situations in a variety of municipalities getting marginally better. And that's allowed some projects to get released. I
wouldn't say that's the whole story though. The Hach business continues to execute exceptionally well. Many of their

digital marketing initiatives and their expansion of feet on the street across both the muni market and the industrial
market, I think, has helped them to continue to gain share. So I think a combination of a marginally improving macro
environment is part of the story and share gains being the other part.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Have you seen any change in kind of sellers' attitude here with kind of all the turmoil in
general, and kind of the QE in Europe, just any change in tone or activity at this point?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Jeff, it's hard to point to anything specific other than less competition from private equity,
which is a positive.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Right. Right. And then could you just elaborate a little bit more on the acceleration you had in
Europe, was there something that stood out, was it broad-based across the businesses?
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: It was relatively broad-based, Jeff. Life Science executed extremely well. We saw good
growth there. Our Dental business, particularly on the equipment side of the dental business also executed very well.
And PID, those would be at least three that I would highlight.
If I added a fourth it would probably be the Beckman Diagnostics business, also executing very well, so it was
markedly broad. But I wouldn't necessarily think about that as something indicative of a change in the macro
environment in Europe, we saw nothing that would perhaps really indicate that. But instead, we had some teams that, I
think, did an excellent job with some new products and were really driving their sales and marketing initiatives very
effectively.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: And that is in Europe for Europe, right? There's not any kind of export kick out of there on
lower euro?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: That's correct. That's revenue into Western Europe, right.

And we'll take our next question from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is open.
<Q - S. Brandon Couillard>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Morning, Brandon.
<Q - S. Brandon Couillard>: Just a quick one of the Nobel deal. Do the changes in the FX reality affect how you view
accretion there for the year? And any chance you could give us the actual point estimate on 4Q organic growth for that
business?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Brandon, it won't have much of an impact. They do have some cost base over there as we also
have some costs related to some of our other healthcare businesses. The offset is, all told, we have about $200 million
of revenues in Switzerland, so that will be a benefit. So net-net, neither for Nobel nor the Corporation do we think
what's happened with the Swiss currencies is going – it'll be relatively neutral to us. That business continues to kind of
grow at a kind of 2% to 4% clip, and that's been over the last couple quarters, and then they were in that zone for Q4 as
well.
<Q - S. Brandon Couillard>: Thanks. And secondly on the Dental business, I mean a number of companies have
pointed to the strength in the U.S. in the back half of the year. I mean to what degree at all have you seen any vitality in
the developed world, particularly in the U.S.? And is there any sign of optimism in terms of an acceleration perhaps
this year?
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Brandon, I think we're probably most excited about what we see on the equipment side
in Dental. The new product innovations, I think you saw many of those when we were out in California earlier during

the year in 2014. The digital initiatives and I think some of the potential that we have as we integrate the components of
the workflow that Nobel Biocare can bring to the table along with what the KaVo Kerr Group of businesses bring. I
think that's really where our optimism sits relative to the U.S. dental market.
On the consumables side, we see it really as a continuing relatively modest growth market. You've seen pretty
consistent low single digit growth from us. We have seen some inventory destocking in the latter part of last year that
may be carrying over here in the first part of this year but generally, our business continues to perform pretty well in
what arguably is kind of a slow growth macro environment there. Time will tell as to whether or not some of this
reduction in oil prices, if it'll translate to the cost of filling up a tank ends up improving overall consumer sentiment and
gives us a little tailwind there but, boy, probably too early to tell.
<Q - S. Brandon Couillard>: Super. Thank you.
Operator
And our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Hi. Thank you. I guess first of all, I just wanted to see if there was any change in the
expectations on core growth by segment for 2015, given you had a pretty good core growth quarter in Q4. And also just
on Industrial Tech specifically, you had the highest growth rate core since mid-2011, similar growth rate to Q3 but a
tougher base. So maybe just an update on that.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Julian, I would say that PID, clearly the biggest piece of Industrial Tech, continues to perform
quite well. I don't think they're really looking for a change in that growth trajectory here in 2015. In the first quarter as
we highlighted, we think we'll do 4% or better. Again, we're talking 3% to 4% for the full year.
Our internal numbers right now are rolling up around 4% for the first quarter but, as Tom alluded to, we finished Q4
pretty strong and we're off to a very good start here in the first three weeks of January. We also have some extra days
here in the first quarter. That should be a benefit as well. I think the offsets there are two of those extra days, there's a
Thursday and Friday before Easter, which tends to be kind of slow days.
Japan, which was a big grower last year ahead of the VAT increase will likely be down here in Q1 year-over-year. And
as we alluded in the call, we expect our Tek Comms, this will be the last, we think, really poor quarter for that business,
similar to what we saw in the second half of 2015. We're encouraged by what we see in terms of bookings, but from
shipments we're going to have a tough Q1 as well. But all up, things are looking pretty good out of the gate here, or
early in the first quarter.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Thanks. And then just secondly, when you talked about the Q1 EPS guidance, I think
there was a comment around some M&A charges being excluded. I just wondered if I'd misheard that or if there was
anything new in terms of, sort of, presentation of adjusted earnings?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: That is correct. I mean consistent with our past practice for deals that are over $1 billion, we
call out kind of the early charges largely non-cash charges. So we still have a little bit left in Nobel in the first quarter,
and I think that'll be about $0.02.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Thanks, Julian.

<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Good morning, Scott.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: And excuse me, I dialed in about 10 minutes late. If you commented on price, then I
apologize. But is there – I mean, I know your raw material costs are generally lower and it's not a big deal for you guys,
but are you out there with price increases for 2015 more broadly?
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Scott, if you think about where your question might go specifically geographically, it
might go to Europe. And interestingly, we're outperforming in Europe. We think we're taking share in Europe. We had
– we saw broad-based performance across the businesses in Europe, and so no particular concern there.
I think teams are clearly looking very selectively market-by-market, these currency shifts have not been exclusively in
Europe, they've been in quite a number of markets. Generally, we're pretty well positioned in terms of the functional
currency that we transact in. But where there are issues, our teams are carefully looking at those situations, and we'll
take price very selectively where we need to, or compete on price if it comes to that.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: I mean, I guess, I don't want to beat a dead horse, but do you anticipate having positive price
for 2015 on an aggregate basis?
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Yes, Scott. And again, where we will get that, in all likelihood, will be the 40% of
revenues that comes up in the aftermarket.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: Yeah, that's what I was alluding to, if you were in – if you are already out there, catalogs, et
cetera, with price increases.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Oh, yeah. No, that's absolutely right, Scott. That – those gains – those plans were
locked and loaded in the fourth quarter, and we are on the street virtually across the businesses right now with those
plans and in the market with those numbers.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: Okay. And then just as a follow up, kind of the inverse of Jeff's question on private equity
and competition, I mean, have you seen the opposite, which means private equity, I think, for probably the last five
years have been buying up industrial and even some healthcare assets. I mean, have you seen those guys come back to
the table and say it's – they're looking to start unloading?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: They're – I mean, Scott, they're always in the marketplace, and clearly there are assets out
there held in the hands of private equity that we would have some interest in. I wouldn't say that's gotten better or worse
here recently, those discussions.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: Okay. And last but not least, I mean, I know you changed your – to cash earnings. Have you
changed, internally, your hurdle rates at all? I mean historically, you guys have had a pretty strict discipline around
hurdle rates. I'm just wondering, and given your lower financing costs and such, if that's dropped at all.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Scott, we have not changed our internal hurdle rates. That discipline that we've had
over a long period of time remains internally around returns for bolt-ons at three years, and bigger, larger, more
adjacent businesses or new businesses over a five-year period. That discipline has been really important to the overall
performance that we've demonstrated.
What we have said is that we want to be thoughtful and cognizant of this environment, relative to what might be larger
transactions that could have significant strategic value for the corporation, where we might need to take a hard look at
those returns. And the team here and the board are supportive of making the right decisions strategically for the
corporation, in the event that those returns maybe not where we might like them to be. But that's a bridge we'll cross
when we have that opportunity and we'll make the right decision that really drives the long-term strategic competitive
advantage of a platform or a segment.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: Okay. Great. I'll pass it on. Thanks guys.

And our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Hey, Nigel.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Yeah, so just a couple questions on core growth, pretty strong performance across the portfolio ex
T&M. But you're sort of alluding to market share gains, and it sounds like particularly in Europe, and I'm just
wondering is that the case, Tom? And which businesses would you call out where you're gaining share? And perhaps if
you can maybe comment on whether we're seeing the delayed impact from some of the R&D and marketing
investments you've made over the last 12 months.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: We're continuing to make those investments, Nigel, in sales and marketing and in R&D
as I noted in my opening comments. The good performance on the top line and the good gross margin expansion that
we've seen has allowed us to continue to invest aggressively in growth initiatives around both, new product innovation
and go-to-market and feet on the street. The share gains we noted earlier were pretty broad-based and yes, they were, in
some cases, specifically in Europe. A couple of the businesses that I mentioned earlier were around the Life Science
platform, our Dental equipment business and Product ID just to name a few.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. That's great. That's helpful. And then, we've seen consumables leading the way on top line, I
guess this cycle with equipment lagging behind, are we seeing any change? Just the things I hear about the comments
on U.S. and Europe particularly in Life Sciences & Diagnostics, are we seeing an inflection point in equipment?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: We definitely saw a modestly better Q3 and a definitely better Q4 in terms of equipment. So
if you look at our 4%, we were 5% aftermarket and 3% or maybe even a little bit over 3% on the equipment side. And
that's one of the better numbers we posted on equipment and that includes our Communications business which was
again down mid-teens. So if you adjust for that, our equipment business was probably up more like 4%-plus. So we're
not quite prepared to kind of call it a trend here, but we are encouraged by what we've seen for last four months or five
months in terms of our overall equipment orders.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: And that 4% ex Comms would be, what, the best in how many years?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: I'd probably have to go back to the 2011 recovery.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. Mid 2011. Great. And then just going back to the comment on the M&A process, a little bit of
FX and emerging market volatilities, does wonders to shake the complacency of sellers, are you seeing any kind of
change out to from sellers, are they – are bid-ask spreads [ph] something narrow (50:03)?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Nigel it's – as you know, a lot of this has been just in the last 30 days to 45 days. I think it's a
little early to tell, but it's hard not to be a little bit more optimistic.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. Thanks, Dan.

about your manufacturing footprint for the next several years? Even China is growing at 6%, I'm not sure when was the
last time that happened.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Andrew, we've got a long history of moving manufacturing into lower cost regions, not
all of that has been into China. In some cases it's been into Eastern Europe, in some cases it has been into India. And
we'll continue to position our cost structure I think in a way that is resilient over the long term. I think we want to be a
little careful not to change up a supply chain prematurely or in a disruptive way, not knowing kind of what maybe the
sustained currency position is ultimately going to be. So I think the teams are doing an exceptional job positioning that
footprint well for the long term.
And it's not all about the cost of an individual region, it's also about the way we execute in any region. And I think
we've got a number of examples where businesses were – that you might say are in higher-cost operating regions, in
fact, continue to deliver exceptional profitability and have driven real competitive advantage because of their cost
structures, despite their regional positions. So I think we feel pretty good about where we are.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: That's very fair. And just a follow-up question on free cash flow. What should we expect for FY
2015 versus the $3.2 billion you did in 2014, or if you want to talk about cash flow realization?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Andrew, it's early here. We're very pleased with the way we ended the year in terms of free
cash flow, so I think we would be in this sort of zone here. Again, we got a benefit in 2014, given our cash tax rate was
a fair amount lower than our actual provision for the year. It's probably too early to kind of make a call on that where
we stand right now.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: But relatively flat is a good, sort of, hold for now in the model?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: I think that's a good starting point.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Thank you so much.
