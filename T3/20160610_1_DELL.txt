MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning, and welcome to the First Quarter Fiscal Year 2017 Earnings Conference Call for Denali Holding Inc.
the parent company of Dell Inc. I'd like to inform all participants this call is being recorded at the request of Denali.
This broadcast is the copyrighted property of Denali Holding Inc. Any rebroadcast of this information in whole or part
without the prior written permission of Denali Holding is prohibited.
As a reminder the company is also simulcasting this call at www.dell.com/investors. A replay of this webcast will be
available at the same location and will be available until midnight Eastern Time on July 10. Following prepared
remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
I would like to turn the call over to Kristy Bias, Director of Investor Relations. Ms. Bias, you may begin.
Kristy Harris Bias
Thanks, Regina. Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us. With me today is our Chief Financial Officer, Tom
Sweet and our Treasurer, Tyler Johnson. I would like to highlight key changes to financial statements due to our
pending acquisition and divestiture and provide a brief update on the progress the Dell EMC transaction, before
reviewing guidelines of our prepared remarks made on the call.
First, we are now providing the financial results of Denali Holding Inc. the parent company of Dell Inc. At this time
there is no difference down to operating income between the consolidated results of Denali Holding Inc. and Dell Inc.
With that context, we've posted our first quarter press release in web deck on dell.com.
Q1 financial results would also be available on Form 10-Q, which will be filed by Denali Holding Inc. later today.
Second on March 27, 2016, Dell entered into a definitive agreement with NTT Data International L.L.C. to sell
substantially all of its Dell pure-play services business. Dell Services includes process outsourcing, application
management, and infrastructure services. The results of Dell Services are presented as discontinued operations in the
Q1 financial statements. All assets and liabilities attributable to the pending divested services businesses have been
reclassified into the held for sale asset and liability categories on the balance sheet.

On the income statement, the financial results of the business to be divested have been reclassified out of the activity
from continuing operations and listed separately in the category for discontinued operations. For more information,
please refer to NOTE 2 of the Form 10-Q.
Third, I want to briefly mention that Dell's plan to combine with EMC is on schedule under their original timetable and
the original terms. On June 6, the SEC declared effective to joint proxy and registration statements for the Dell EMC
transaction. EMC's special shareholder meeting is scheduled for Tuesday, July 19. We've received clearance from the
U.S. SEC, the European Commission and other geographies to proceed with the transaction. The ability to close the
transaction is now dependent on receipt of required regulatory approval from China, EMC shareholder approval and
other customary conditions.
With that update, we will limit our discussion regarding the transaction during this call and recommend that you review
the merger agreement and the effective joint proxy for more details.
I'd like to remind you that all statements made during this call that relate to future results and events are
forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ materially from those
projected due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in the cautionary statement of our of web
deck. We assume no obligations to update our forward-looking statements.
Our Q1, GAAP net income, includes approximately $700 million of adjustments that are not reflected in our
non-GAAP net income. The majority of these adjustments are non-cash and relate to purchase accounting. Please, keep
in mind, that based on accounting adjustments associated with the go-private transaction, there will continue to be
significant bridging items between our GAAP and non-GAAP results for the next few years, although the impact will
decline in each subsequent quarter.
Please see the supplemental slides beginning on slide 10, for more details on the non-GAAP adjustments. Finally,
before I turn it over to Tom, note that we will be referring to non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP
revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA on a
continuing operations basis.
A reconciliation of each of these measures to its most directly comparable GAAP measures, can be found in the
supplemental material of our web deck. Please also note that unless otherwise specified, all growth percentages refer to
year-over-year progress.
Consistent with prior quarters, we will not be providing any guidance on future financial results. Now, I'll turn it over
to Tom.
Thomas W. Sweet
Thanks, Kristy. As we continue our transformations, I know there may be lots of questions, from everyone, regarding
the different activities underway. I want to make sure for the purposes of this call, that we give you a full review of our
quarterly earnings performance and answer any relevant questions. I'm pleased with our results this quarter, which were
generally in line with our expectations, despite macroeconomic challenges that persist. Considering these near-term
challenges, we're making balanced decisions between growth and profitability. We remain committed to our long-term
focus to grow revenue and profit and generate strong cash flow. All of the financial results, I cover will be from
continuing operations, excluding, Dell pure-play services unless otherwise stated.
Revenue for the first quarter was $12.6 billion, down 3%, driven by declines in our Client Solutions and in the
Enterprise Solutions Group, while Software revenue was flat. On a constant currency basis, our revenue grew low
single digits, as we drove deeper coverage through our direct sales force and optimized the channel.
I will discuss business unit results in more details later. On a regional basis, EMEA and the Americas declined in
revenue, but we did see growth in APJ, specifically in our second largest country China, which had growth of 5%.
Gross margin was $2.6 billion, up 9% and was 20.9% of revenue, up by 230 basis points as we continue to manage

cost, deliver a mix of higher margin solutions and drive disciplined pricing.
OpEx was $2.1 billion, an increase of 4% and 16.4% of revenue, up 100 basis points, given our investments in the sales
force, R&D, and marketing. Operating income was $565 million, up 37% and 4.5% of revenue, up by 130 basis points.
We believe that the investment we made in expanding our sales force were proved accretive over time. As the industry
continues to shift towards more emerging technologies, we are strategically investing and participating in segments,
such as software-defined and Internet of Things that will drive long-term profitability and strong cash flow generation.
I will now turn it over to Tyler, who will provide additional commentary on our profitability and liquidity before I get
into individual business unit results.
Tyler W. Johnson
Thanks, Tom. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $659 million, up 28% compared to the prior year and equal to
5.2% of revenue, up 120 basis points. On a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted EBITDA was $3 billion. Please see slide
10 on our Web deck for more details on our EBITDA adjustments.
In Q1, we had a use of cash from operations of $63 million, including discontinued ops, an improvement of
approximately $800 million from the prior year due to better working capital management and profitability.
As a reminder, our cash generation is seasonally low in Q1 due to personnel-related payouts and a sequential revenue
decline after the holiday season in Q4, which unfavorably impacts cash, given our negative cash conversion cycle. On a
trailing 12-month basis, cash from operations was approximately $3 billion, up 103%.
We ended the quarter with $13.5 billion, principal value in total debt. Of this amount $9.1 billion was core debt, down
$500 million from last quarter after payment of a $400 million note that matured in April, in addition to our quarterly
term loan amortization of approximately $100 million.
The remaining $4.4 billion of debt was used to fund our Global Financial Services business and included $3.4 billion of
structured financing debt. Our cash and investments balance was $6.2 billion ending the quarter approximately $500
million lower due to debt repayments. This balance includes approximately $600 million associated with shares that
have [ph] elected (09:03) appraisal rights.
Since the LBO, we have reduced gross debt by $5.1 billion including $2.8 billion of optional settlement and advance in
maturity. This along with other balance sheet optimization initiatives, such as our Term Loan B Repricing equates to an
annualized interest savings of approximately $275 million.
As we work towards closing the Dell EMC deal, we recently completed significant debt offerings and issuances, which
we will use to fund the transaction. We issued $20 billion in multiple series of First Lien Notes with maturities ranging
from 3 years to 30 years, and a weighted interest rate of 5.47%. We allocated a $5 billion Term Loan B with a
seven-year maturity, and a cost of LIBOR plus 3.25% with a 75 basis point LIBOR floor and a step-down in pricing
based on achievement of a leverage ratio. And earlier this week, we priced the offering of a $3.25 billion of five-year
and eight-year unsecured high yield notes at a blended rate of 6.5%, which is expected to close on or around June 22
subject to customary closing conditions.
Our all-in cost of debt post the Dell EMC transaction is estimated to be below 4.5% given current LIBOR rates. Our
cash management philosophy has not changed as we transition to this new company structure. We expect strong cash
flow generation to continue driven by profitable growth and efficient working capital management, and remain
committed to paying down debt and investing in the business.
Let me turn it back over to Tom who will take you through the individual business unit results.

Thanks, Tyler. Starting with our Client Solutions business, revenue for the quarter declined by 3% to $8.6 billion.
Operating income of $385 million grew 76% and was 4.5% of revenue, up by 200 basis points. Operating income
favorability was primarily driven by improved cost and balanced pricing decisions.
Consumer revenue was down 1% and commercial revenue was down 4%. According to IDC, PC unit shipments
declined by 12.5% versus their forecast of a negative 11.3% for the calendar Q1 quarter. IDC recently adjusted their PC
unit forecast down from minus 5.4% to minus 7.3% for the full calendar year 2016.
Despite this downward adjustment, they still anticipate improvement through the year. In calendar Q1, we continued to
benefit from market consolidation, gaining 160 basis points of worldwide unit share. This marks the 13th consecutive
quarter of year-over-year share gains. We maintained our number three worldwide unit share position and also moved
up to the number one unit share position in the U.S., which was driven by double-digit growth in notebooks.
In consumer, we outperformed the industry worldwide, gaining 130 basis points of the unit share. In commercial, we
outperformed the industry worldwide, gaining 160 basis points of the unit share. Our strength in notebooks was driven
by the momentum we're seeing in our new Latitude products, which were announced in January, and are enabling us to
outgrow the commercial notebook market.
In consumer notebooks, our growth was driven by channel expansion. We also continue to see growth in our [ph]
2-in-1 (12:40) form factors. We recently launched the world's first 17-inch 2-in-1 laptop, the Inspiron 17 7000,
designed to deliver strong performance with an array of choices to meet customer needs.
We are seeing growth in our attached software, peripherals and services business driven by growth in displays. In
displays, we remained number one in market share, gaining unit share year-over-year for the 12th consecutive quarter.
We continue to see growth in our up-sell services attach rates for ProSupport and ProSupport Plus.
Recently, we announced that we are expanding the availability of Premium Support, a service for consumer PCs
currently offered in the U.S., in Canada to 110 additional countries across APJ, EMEA and Latin America. Premium
Support provides 24/7 anytime, anywhere phone access to expert technicians, onsite service after remote diagnosis and
proactive automated support for consumer PCs and tablets.
While the PC market has been on a persistently downward trend, we do believe that the market will stabilize as
adoption continues in new product offerings, such as Windows 10, Skylight processors and 2-in-1s.
We remain focused on deepening our sales coverage, delivering great products and solutions with a focus on
commercial, and winning new customers that will be accretive as demand improves. Given the current realities of the
market, we will continue to balance revenue and margin dollar growth and are well positioned to continue to gain unit
share and grow profitability as the PC market stabilizes.
Turning to our Enterprise Solutions Group, revenue was $3.6 billion, down 2%. Operating income declined 20% to
$192 million and was 5.3% of revenue, down 120 basis points as we continue to make investments in our sales force
and solutions that position us to address our customers' critical IT needs in the data center.
Organizations of all sizes are modernized in their traditional data center environments. They are embracing
next-generation IT architectures and technologies, including cloud, converged, hyper-converged, software-defined and
security solutions.
We firmly believe that a hybrid cloud approach is the industry [ph] in state (15:11) over the next decade. This approach
gives enterprises full control of how and where capacity is introduced and company critical data is processed and
stored.
Additionally, the growing requirement of organizations for agile, scalable and cost effective solutions is driving
demand for hybrid cloud. Our offerings in this area have great momentum. At Dell, we are partnering with industry
leaders, including VMware, Microsoft and Red Hat to bring differentiated hybrid cloud solutions to market.

The examples include, the Dell Hybrid Cloud Platform for VMware, where we have worked closely with VMware to
integrate the best of Dell and VMware technology, including integrating new software-defined storage support with
VMware Virtual SAN. The Dell Hybrid Cloud System with Microsoft where we are delivering solutions across various
industries, such as financial services and managed service providers.
The fifth generation Dell Red Hat OpenStack Cloud Solution, which was recognized as one of the best solutions at the
2016 OpenStack Summit and the Cloud Flex Pay program, which provides customers with flexible cost effective ways
to deploy Dell Cloud Solutions via Dell Financial Services without requiring a large upfront or long-term commitment.
Turning to servers and networking, revenue declined 2% as we did a nice job balancing the top line and profitability.
Our hyper-scale server revenue, which you all know varies quarter-to-quarter based on deal size and timing, declined in
the quarter. While this part of the business is typically lumpy and high volume, it is also low margin.
We continue to focus on our Tier 2 public cloud providers, telcos and service providers, where we can offer
engineering expertise, semi-custom solutions and services through our Datacenter Scalable Solutions business or DSS.
DSS now accounts for 8% of our PowerEdge revenue mix. DSS is one of our growth engines, delivering strong
momentum and contributing to an overall improvement in operating margins over time. Despite the decline in
PowerEdge, there was continuous strength in our modular server business driven by double-digit growth in our FX
converged infrastructure product, which now accounts for 6% of our PowerEdge revenue mix.
According to IDC, x86 server results from Q1 calendar 2016, total server industry shipments declined by negative
2.9%, below IDC's forecast of 0.7% growth. Dell maintained number two unit worldwide share position, but lost 130
basis points of share and declined relative to the industry. We maintained number one rank in APJ and North America,
and maintained our number two share positions in other regions. Breaking this down one more level, we saw declines
in our hyperscale share as we actively manage where we participate in this category. Within mainstream, we declined
in share year-over-year, but continue to see growth in [ph] delays (18:25).
Storage revenue declined by 2% in the quarter, and was primarily impacted by weaker traditional storage market.
Similar to the rest of the industry, we are responding to a shift in trends as customers transition from traditional direct
attached disk drives to next-gen storage technologies such as all-flash software defined, converged and
hyper-converged solutions.
We are investing in these areas and seeing success across these emerging categories. For example, within our Dell
Storage SC product line, our all-flash and hybrid SC series revenue grew about 20% and now accounts for
approximately 18% of our total storage revenue mix. While only approximately 10% of storage revenue
software-defined storage grew triple digits beginning this quarter.
Based on IDC's calendar Q1 2016 report on external storage, the market declined by a minus 3.7%, compared to their
prior forecast of negative 1.9%. We maintained our external storage revenue share position at number six and moved
up to number two in total internal and external capacity. We were also one of the fastest growing hybrid array vendors
gaining 170 basis points of revenue share year-over-year.
While our results in ESG were subdued in Q1, we expect solid performance going forward as we help our customers
transition from traditional private data centers to hybrid environments. Looking out to the back half of this year with a
combined Dell, EMC Enterprise Solutions business, we expect growth and improving profitability as our revenue mix
shifts to new emerging categories that have a higher software content with richer margins.
Moving to our software business, revenue was $334 million, flat year-over-year. Operating income was $28 million or
8.4% of revenue. We saw improvement in the quarter driven by growth in Security and Boomi, which are delivering
innovative scalable solutions to the market. The Gartner recently recognized Boomi as a leader in its 2015 Magic
Quadrant report for Enterprise Integration Platform as a Service. This is Boomi's third consecutive year in the leader
quadrant.
We continue to benefit from a number of steps taken to reduce our cost and rationalize our portfolio. We believe we
have the right cost structure in place in the investment with our sales teams that will improve top-line growth and

profitability in FY 2017.
In closing, I'd also like to highlight a couple of our growth businesses that performed well in this challenging
environment. SecureWorks, which successfully completed an IPO in April, publicly reported their Q1 earnings last
week. Based on their reported results, SecureWorks grew 28% in the quarter and is on a $400 million revenue run rate
with a highly predictable recurring revenue business in a growing industry. We believe this newly public company is
well-positioned in the cyber security market. And Boomi, which I mentioned earlier, continues to have success as the
leading provider of Integration Platform as a Service, growing at high double-digit rates.
Given the challenging market conditions and industry dynamics, I'm generally pleased with our overall performance in
the quarter. We've executed well in balancing revenue and profitability and managing working capital while continuing
to invest for long-term growth. In closing, I'm excited about the pending combination of Dell and EMC and look
forward to the opportunities ahead.
Now, I'll turn it back to Kristy to begin Q&A.
Q&A
<A - Kristy Harris Bias>: Thanks, Tom. We will now begin the Q&A portion of the call. We ask that each participant
ask one question with one follow-up if you have one. Regina, can you please introduce the first participant?
Operator
We'll take our first question from the line of David Phipps with Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - David Phipps>: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on completing some of the historic
funding. Could you talk a little bit about the consumer segment and how you're able to hang in, if you have only a 1%
decline and what type of [ph] attack (22:45) you're taking on that from the marketplace?
<A - Thomas W. Sweet>: Sure, David. Look, I mean, I think with consumer our approach has been that we want to
provide product offerings across various price bands and markets that we can step in a balanced way and into the
various markets that we participate in. So I think the team did a really nice job this quarter of being disciplined around
pricing. I think we had a nice selection of new products that have rolled out, and I think what you see there is an
indication of the discipline and balance between our direct model and the channel, with the channel growing nicely and
our direct business contributing pretty well as we went through the quarter.
So I think overall that they balanced revenue and margin growth properly. I'm pretty pleased with their overall
performance there. And I think given the optimization we've been doing around our go-to-market capabilities in that
space, I think they executed well and I'm looking forward to having them continue to execute well.
<Q - David Phipps>: Then just as quick follow-up. The operating margins overall expanded about 30 basis points, but
the gross margin and the operating expenses moved around. Was that largely because of the mix within the products
year-over-year?
<A - Thomas W. Sweet>: You're talking about consumer or you're talking about overall client?
<Q - David Phipps>: Overall business.
<A - Thomas W. Sweet>: Look, I think what we saw was an improved profitability profile in our client business. I
think, again, that was a combination of the cost activities that we have under way as well as the pricing discipline that
we have. I think you guys have heard me talk pretty consistently over the last couple of years about balanced pricing
and making sure that we have balanced performance. We want to grow. We want to grow our share, but we want to do
that in a way that's accretive to gross margin dollars. And so, I think what you saw with the results for the quarter
overall was that [ph] continued tact (24:53) as the team executed through the sort of the economics that were out there
in the environment.

<Q - David Phipps>: Those are my questions. Thank you.
Operator
We'll take our next question from the line of Frank Jarman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Frank Jarman>: Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions, guys. I just wanted you to focus on the ESG
segment. You talked a little bit about how in the server space you lost 130 bps of share and how you're actively
managing your participation in the hyperscale market. So I was just curious can you provide a little bit more color there
as you think about the server market and business specifically evolving over the next few quarters. Thank you.
<A - Thomas W. Sweet>: Yeah. If you think about that marketplace and what we're trying to do, the market was
generally weaker than what had been forecasted. So in a market like that what we focused the team on was, look, I
absolutely want to grow, but I want to be careful around growing with no profit. And so we tried to balance where we
spent and where we stretched in terms of velocity and where we didn't see elasticity in the demand cycle, we didn't
chase it with gross margin dollars through aggressive pricing. So the market was a bit more challenging. I thought we
balanced it pretty well.
On the hyperscale space, we're always balancing that. You can go and get a lot of volume there and spend a lot of
money and not make any money. And so, it's one of those areas that where it makes sense and where it's strategic, we're
going to play there and make sure that we have the right sort of velocity, but I'm also concerned and we're also
balanced around driving and ensuring that the margin profiles make sense.
In the mainstream server space, to be blunt, I wish I'd had a bit more velocity there overall in the quarter, but again, I
thought that the team did an okay job, I should say, in sort of balancing that given that the market was softer than what
we had anticipated it to be. And I think you heard me comment on the IDC means, a negative minus 2.9%. So, again,
where there was activity and strength, we took it. Our performance in APJ was pretty good in the server space. EMEA
was a bit softer, as with some of the elements in Americas.
So I think, again, as you think out into the future, what we're going to try and do is we want to grow, we want to grow
share position, but I want to do that in a way that's accretive to gross margin dollars. And so, I think you'll continue to
see us try to drive velocity there, but I am going to be disciplined and we are going to be disciplined about ensuring that
it comes with accretive profitability. So look, Frank, it was a bit of a balancing act this quarter as we worked our way
through, what the dynamics of the market look like. And, again, I didn't want to chase a bunch of low value share out
there and burn some margin against it.
<Q - Frank Jarman>: Got it. Super helpful. Thanks, Tom. I'll hop back into the queue.
<A - Thomas W. Sweet>: Thanks, Frank.
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of Thomas Eagan with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Thomas Eagan>: Thanks for taking my question. Just a couple of follow-ups on some [ph] that you (28:27)
answered already Tom. On the Consumer side, I know you mentioned that there's been a balance between direct and
the channel and that's helped you this quarter. But that business has done considerably better than the market and even
better than some of your key peers. Is there anything that you're doing besides just balancing? Are there any
promotions that are going on? Is it the product? What's causing the Consumer business for you to hold up so well when
we look at everything else that we were seeing in the peer group and it's not holding up well?
<A - Thomas W. Sweet>: Look, again, I think remember that our – we're reporting both consumer and small business.
So one, you have a blend of consumer small business, because they tend to buy similar products. Having said in our

small business side of the consumer's business was pretty strong. Within the consumer space, I think we've got a great
set of capabilities around our products, right?
So award winning XPS 13, we've refreshed the Inspiron online. I think the team is doing a better job over the last
number of quarters on. Think about our model, Thomas, around attach and ensuring that in our direct sale business, that
we're attaching financing and the software and peripheral products. And so, I think that's clearly up. Those are clearly
interesting profitability areas for us. We have expanded the channel and we've been disciplined about that in terms of
expanding that times both our channel presence and our retail presence. I think what you're seeing in many respects is
some of the activity that's happened as a result of the consolidation that's happening in the business.
And so, it's not a secret that some of the other manufactures have pulled back. And we won't get into details on that, but
in that the top three providers from an OEM perspective continue to gain share. And I think we're taking advantage of
that in a disciplined way around share gain and being balanced on that in the context of taking opportunities within the
channel, within the retail space, with the right set of product offerings at the price points and supplementing that with
our direct business, which is generally a bit more profitable business for us. So, look, I just think the team is executing
pretty well to be honest, right? And so, I've got to give them some credit for that.
<Q - Thomas Eagan>: Okay. And then a follow-up maybe on Frank's question. On the ESG side, I think most of us
have seen pretty significant pullback in IT spending across the board on storage, on servers, on lots of things. I mean
it's not just your company that's seeing it, but we're seeing it on all aspects of it.
What are you seeing out there from clients in terms of the decision making? Are they taking a step back because of the
economics? Are they taking a step back because they're trying to decide as they move from the old standard
architecture to maybe some of the new hyper converged architecture? Are they taking their time to make those
decisions and do you think there is a point where once they get passed that that things start to speed up a little bit or do
you think we're sort of in a slowdown for a while as your customers try to figure out what it is they really want and how
they want to set up their architecture?
<A - Thomas W. Sweet>: Yeah. It's a great question. Look, I won't pretend to have all the answers, but I think
contextually, there's a couple of things going on. One is, the macroeconomics are a little bit softer than what people
thought they were going to be come into the year around GDP and some of the IT spend that's happening. So, I do think
clearly that's a factor as CIOs think about budgets and forecasts in the context of how they – the business that they're
supporting is running and operating.
I think if you just click it down though or you actually think about trends that are happening, it's clear that there's a lot
of conversations and a lot of thinking going right now in this context of IT architecture and where are customers
migrating to. Now, in many instances it is, is our CIOs and IT professionals that we work with or thinking through
trends or I should say strategies around technologies that take some time, and I do think there might be a bit of a natural
pause that's happening as people think about architectural design and architectural pathways forward.
We're seeing lots of interest in some of the emerging technology platforms around software defined and converged, you
saw our performance, I highlighted the fact that although my mainstream servers were down – or my servers were
down, we did see growth in some of the modular products around FX conversion infrastructure blades, some of the
software defined and hyper-converged products that were offering our solutions, I should say that we're offering. So,
you are seeing some trends in some of these new emerging platforms now.
I've spend a lot of time over the last few weeks talking with a lot of people around cloud, cloud transition, how does
that – how is cloud impacting traditional companies in particularly companies like us and I tend to think that we're in
the early innings of a cloud transition, we ultimately think the world is hybrid. At the end of the day, it's not going to be
all on-prim or all off-prim, and I think it's going to be an emerging trend that's going to happen over a number of years.
So, I don't think it's going to be an immediate thing, but it clearly we're seeing customers thinking through architectural
strategies as they think about new business capabilities that they want to enable.
And then how do they get more optimization out of their IT infrastructure, how do they drive more efficiency
productivity and take complexity out, which is why you're now seeing some of the trends we're seeing around

converge, which is easier to manage, it's generally a little bit more cost effective to rise of interest and hyperscale with
these building block technology that it has a scalable out. So, we're seeing some of those phenomenon, which to be
blunt is one of the reasons we're so excited about the Dell EMC combination because it clearly positions us in the
leadership position in a number of these important categories as ITR contextures continue to evolve. So I apologize that
this is a rather whirly and windy answer to your question, but it's a pretty complex environment out there right now as
people think their way through strategies around technology.
<Q - Thomas Eagan>: Okay. Thanks. Hope you get to take tomorrow off for management questions, right.

Our next question will come from the line of Arun Seshadri with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Arun A. Seshadri>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions and echo the congrats on getting the financial [ph]
quarter's (35:50) this transaction done. Just a couple of questions. First, if you get a little bit on the ESG side again, I
don't know if you could give us some quantification on the sort of sales investment that you've done on a
year-over-year basis. And then if you could also comment a little bit in terms of what type of investments you're
making outside of sales in terms of solutions in some of the areas you're focused on right now?
<A - Thomas W. Sweet>: Hey, Arun, can you repeat the second half of that question? It broke up a little bit on my
end?
<Q - Arun A. Seshadri>: Sure, Tom. So I was just saying outside of sales side, I think, you said generally that you're
making investment and solutions.
<A - Thomas W. Sweet>: Yeah.
<Q - Arun A. Seshadri>: I think you gave us some sense or sort of the areas you're focused on in terms of
investments?
<A - Thomas W. Sweet>: Yeah. Look, on the investment – first on the sales capacity, right, I think you guys know that
I think we've quoted somewhere around roughly 1,500 incremental sales mix that we've added to the overall capacity of
the organization. So I'm actually not going to name you a specific dollar amount, but I would just give you, you could
probably do some simple math around average head cost, head count costs all-in. Most of those sales makers are
probably [ph] two quarters and two-and-a-half quarters (37:09) in from a productivity ramp perspective. So we are
expecting to see improved productivity in that head count structure as we go through the year.
And so look, it is a drag, if you will, on from in just a pure OpEx dollars. We clearly have expanded that OpEx spend
because of that. We do think it's the right long-term investment, but it's not loss to me, when you look at the ESG P&L
for instance in terms of some of the OpEx dynamics that you see within that P&L.
From an R&D and from a development perspective, there is a sizable investment going into the cloud space around the
hybrid cloud solutions and capabilities. There is a sizable investment going into some of our next-generation server and
server technology as we think about getting – preparing that, and we're continuing to invest in some of the converged
infrastructure capabilities and some of the modular business. And we went public about this, been talking about the
Internet of Things and some of the solution builds that we're doing in that space.
So, we had some investments and we continue to make a number of these types of investments. We are trying to be
disciplined and balanced about it, but one of the advantages, Arun, and we've talked about this with you from time to
time of being a privately controlled companies, we have the discipline and the opportunity to make these investments

that we know are the right investments for the long term, but may not pay off in one to two quarters. And so, those are
the areas we're investing in. We're going to continue to be patient around the sales force productivity ramp. Obviously,
we have high expectations for them, as we move forward, but we do expect to see that to be a continued benefit as we
move forward from a better coverage model in a better – given the portfolio that we're selling.
<Q - Arun A. Seshadri>: Great. That's helpful, Tom. And then, as a follow-up, if you could sort of talk about gross
margins have, obviously, significantly sort of moved higher, you're at almost 21% of the second quarter in a row. Just
wanted to get a sense for how we should think about the gross margins, so there's anything sort of one-time or different
from a mix perspective?
And then, secondly, if you could also comment on OpEx, was there any seasonality in OpEx and how we should think
about that sequentially going forward? Thanks.
<A - Thomas W. Sweet>: Yeah. Look on margins, look, I mean, there's also a few puts and takes in the margin in
terms of things that have moved around on you, but I think there was a relatively consistent performance from Q4 to
Q1 in terms of margin percentage. I would expect – look, I'm not going to give forward guidance, but that margin
percentage is going to move around a little bit on you given the mix of product, and when you think about Q2, which is
dynamically a bigger quarter for us, given some of the back to school and public buying that happens in Q2.
So, I think there's probably some seasonal trends there that I could point you to that might be helpful as you think about
the margin. I'm less concerned though about margin percent than I'm about margin dollars, because ultimately, what I
want is dollars. And so, I'm looking for accretive margin dollars and that's how we manage the P&L and how we
manage and how we think about driving the growth vectors that we're driving.
So, look, there are a number of – there's nothing extraordinarily unusual in the margin profile this quarter in terms of
one-timers or one-off type items. There's always some cats and dogs that you're dealing with, but nothing of that
significance. And so, I mean that's sort of the – that my thinking around margins at this point.
<Q - Arun A. Seshadri>: Great. Thanks.
<A - Thomas W. Sweet>: Yeah.
<A - Kristy Harris Bias>: Regina, let's take one more question.
Operator
We'll take our final question from the line of Umesh Bhandary with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - Umesh Bhandary>: Hi, guys. Thank you for squeezing me in here. Maybe the first question here is, I mean,
obviously, you guys have had an impressive run in terms of gaining share in the PC market. So, maybe just how do you
think about your ability to sort of continue to do that going forward? And really just talk about sort of the stead-up of
the PC market has sort of – you alluded to Gartner is sort of coming out with that, lowering their guidance for the PC
sales. I mean, how should we sort of think about that going forward?
<A - Thomas W. Sweet>: Look, I mean, I think the PC market continues to be – it's a cyclical market that can be
challenging and it is challenging. So, I think, you just got to step back and understand the context around the PC space.
So, you start with the – a couple of just sort of, the state of the space and you think about the fact that it's a
consolidating market. I think the top three OEMs, if you will, have roughly 55% of the market. That some IT marketing
analysts would forecast that that's going to continue to expand, as you move forward, over the next few years. I think
you look at the installed base, which is about 1.8 billion devices, I think 1 billion of those devices are over three years
old now.
And I think, roughly, I think 600 million is also over four years to five years – or past four years old. So, there is – and
it's clear that refresh cycles has heavy long dated. But there are some catalyst on the horizon, it's hard to call on which
quarter you see some of that activity, but there is a renewed interest or a growing interest, I should say in Windows 10

from our commercial customer base, particularly some of the capabilities and feature set of Win 10s, you got the Intel
Skylight processor that gives you some incremental capability around energy and compute power, if you will.
So, look as we do, we are optimistic that it's – that we begin to see some elements of a refresh cycle as we move later
through the year on into next year, hard to call the exact quarter. So, in light of that from our perspective, what we try
to do is ensure that in a consolidating market, we take share. We tried to balance that with taking share and taking share
profitably, which means that given our orientation, which is heavily commercial versus consumer, it means making
sure that we win in that mainstream, notebook space, making sure that we win in the desktop space, even though the
desktop space has been probably a bit more challenging than the mobility products, and ensuring that as these new form
factors are coming online, the rise of interest in two-in-ones. We've seen the phenomenon of tablets where that was a
hot product form factor for a number of years, that's been in sort of the markets – that's been declining pretty rapidly
over the last few quarters, as people realize that work gets done on a product with a keyboard and that a tablet is a great
consumption device for browsing or e-mail or – but it's not a great device to do work on.
And so that's why we're seeing the rising two-in-ones with detachable screens or detachable keyboards and there is a
migration between a classic notebook and that tablet into these form factors that of the two-in-one form factors. So look
our strategy is share gain. In a consolidating market you got to grow, we got to do that in a way that's disciplined back
to my whole point that you guys continue to hear me talk about which we are on balance, and ensuring that we drive
margin dollars as we grow. And that's been the playbook we've been running.
I think the team has done a great job of having the right products out there. We've got probably the best set of products
we've had in a long, long time, well positioned across the various price bands. And – but it's an execution gain at the
end of the day in a market like this and you've got to make sure, you are executing well and ensuring that you're
listening to your customers as you do so.
<Q - Umesh Bhandary>: Got it. So, if I just may have real quick follow-up here. I think you guys have, obviously,
had this goal of getting to investment grade to even when you're just [indiscernible] (45:50) on Dell, now
[indiscernible] (45:52) that process accelerates. I mean is that sort of contingent upon, like you're being able to do some
asset sales. So, you think sort of on an organic basis, you can get to investment grade within the 18 months to 24
months, that's so we have sort of outlined?
<A - Thomas W. Sweet>: Well, look, it's Tom and I'll let Tyler really address it. But we've been fairly consistent in
our conversations over the last number of years. We clearly have a heritage as an investment grade company. The LBO
sort of took us off that – took us below investment grade given the debt that we've put on the balance sheet. And I think
the team and the company has done a terrific job of managing the liquidity in debt pay downs since the LBO. And so
Tyler, I mean, why don't you [indiscernible] (46:38)?
<A - Tyler W. Johnson>: Yeah, I mean look without providing guidance on this call. I mean, obviously we've
announced the sale of the services business to NTT, and so along with that and free cash flow generation and working
capital benefits. We definitely see line of sight to gain back to investment grade in this 18 months to 24 months period
that you here just talk a lot about?
<Q - Umesh Bhandary>: Great. Thank you very much.
<A - Thomas W. Sweet>: Thank you.
