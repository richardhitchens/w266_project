MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Vanessa and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to
welcome everyone to the Medtronic Third Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank
you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jeff Warren. Please go ahead, sir.
Jeff Warren
Thank you, Vanessa. Good morning, and welcome to Medtronic's Third Quarter Conference Call and Webcast. During
the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Gary Ellis, Medtronic Chief
Financial Officer, will provide comments on the results of Medtronic, Inc.'s fiscal year 2015 third quarter, which ended
January 23, 2015. The acquisition of Covidien closed at the beginning of Q4 on January 26, and did not affect the Q3
operational results. Thus, our comments today on Q3 results cover legacy Medtronic only. After our prepared remarks,
we'll be happy to take your questions.
First, a few comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and our
revenue by business summary. We also updated our combined historical Covidien/Medtronic financial statement
presentation to include combined financials from Medtronic's third quarter. You should note that some of the
statements made during this call may be considered forward-looking statements and that actual results might differ
materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could
cause actual results to differ is contained in Medtronic's periodic reports filed with the SEC. Therefore, we do not
undertake to update any forward-looking statement.
In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on the Investors portion of our
website at medtronic.com. Finally, unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are

in comparison to the third quarter of fiscal year 2014, and all year-over-year revenue growth rates are based on a
constant currency basis.
With that, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak.
Omar S. Ishrak
Good morning, and thank you, Jeff, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. This morning, we reported third
quarter revenue of $4.3 billion, which represents growth of 8%, and Q3 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.01,
growing 11%. EPS on a cash basis, which we will be officially transitioning to in Q4, was $1.07 and grew 10%.
Q3 was a very strong quarter, with revenue growth well above our outlook range for the fiscal year and exceeding our
mid-single-digit baseline goal. All three of our groups contributed to our robust performance with our largest group,
Cardiac and Vascular, delivering impressive double-digit growth. Restorative Therapies and Diabetes also had solid
quarters, both growing in the mid-single digits.
Our Q3 results were balanced from a geographic perspective, with 8% growth in the U.S. and 7% growth in
international markets. Our teams are executing on important product launches around the world and our customers are
responding to our differentiated healthcare solutions that seek to demonstrate both clinical and economic value.
Looking ahead, while our results were especially strong this quarter, I want to emphasize that our goal remains to
deliver strong and consistent mid-single-digit revenue growth. We believe therapy innovation, globalization and
economic value are not only the right strategy to achieve growth, but that our diversification, differentiated approach
and competitive advantages will enable us to deliver dependable growth in healthcare.
Importantly, following the close of Q3, we completed the acquisition of Covidien, a significant milestone in
Medtronic's history. We believe that the combination of our two companies meaningfully accelerates our strategies,
diversifies our growth profile and increases our financial flexibility. Over the long-term, we feel that our collective
organization can become the leading, integrated health technology and solutions partner to healthcare systems around
the world.
Looking now to our Q3 results. We continue to quantify, communicate and execute on each of our independent growth
vectors. Our new therapies growth vector contributed 550 basis points to our overall growth in Q3. This is 240 basis
points higher than last quarter, and well above our previously stated expected range of 150 to 350 basis points. Our
organization continues to develop and launch fundamental new therapies, innovative new products and the related
wraparound programs, which are being received enthusiastically by our customers around the world. Gary will
highlight these when he discusses our detailed business results later, but it is worth noting that CVG, RTG and Diabetes
all have significant ongoing product launches that are contributing to our results today, as well as strong innovation
pipelines to fuel our future growth. Our new therapy growth vector will be further bolstered with the addition of
Covidien, which adds breadth in new complementary clinical areas and also provides two key strategic tuck-ins,
Peripheral Vascular and Neurovascular, which are expected to accelerate growth in our CVG and RTG portfolios.
Our next growth vector, emerging markets, contributed 150 basis points to our overall growth, just within our expected
range. Greater China, Middle East and Africa, Central and Eastern Europe, and Latin America all delivered
double-digit growth. The Middle East and Africa region in particular had another impressive quarter with 22% growth.
This region's performance is driven in part by execution in our channel optimization strategy as we continue to connect
directly with customers and align our priorities to the urgent challenges of the local healthcare systems. In Turkey and
Saudi Arabia, we are serving more patients as these countries rapidly develop and fund healthcare infrastructure. Other
countries in the region are also taking large steps to improve their healthcare system, and are looking for partners like
Medtronic to help them achieve better quality and value.
Overall, we remain confident and enthusiastic in the long-term outlook of emerging markets. We are focused on
developing new public and private partnerships, as well as executing on our channel optimization strategies. We also
expect Covidien to further strengthen our presence in emerging markets as we leverage our combined infrastructure,

customer relationships, and breadth of products and services. This should enhance our ability to consistently contribute
150 to 250 basis points to Medtronic's overall growth from emerging markets.
Finally, services and solutions, our third growth vector, contributed 50 basis points to our overall growth, within the 40
to 60 basis point annual range that we have targeted. We have more than doubled our services and solutions revenue
over the past year with strong growth in Cardiocom and Cath Lab Managed Services. Cardiocom grew over 20% as we
continued to develop and offer solutions to manage the broad population of heart failure patients, resulting in clinical
and economic benefits for the healthcare system. Cardiocom has multiyear customer agreements that produce an
attractive stream of high-quality recurring revenue.
In Cath Lab Managed Services, we continue to generate rapid growth in Europe as we are fast becoming an ideal
partner for hospitals that seek to drive operational efficiency. In addition, we're actively expanding our Cath Lab
Managed Services business model globally with several new accounts in Middle East and Africa, Latin America and
Canada. As of the end of Q3, we had over 50 long-term agreements with hospital systems, representing $1 billion in
revenue over the life of the contracts, which have an average span of five to six years. As we look ahead, we're working
on converting a full pipeline of Cath Lab Managed Services contracts with hospital providers around the world.
Turning to the P&L. Q3 non-GAAP diluted EPS grew 11% or 13% on a constant currency basis, which was above our
baseline expectation to grow EPS 200 to 400 basis points faster than revenue growth. Year to date, we have grown EPS
by 9% on a constant currency basis, 400 basis points above our constant currency revenue growth. Our organization
delivered a strong operational quarter, and our bottom line was further enhanced by the tax rate benefit from the
extension of the U.S. R&D tax credit for 2014. Gary will walk through some of these dynamics in greater detail shortly.
Our growth continues to feel strong free cash flow generation, delivering $1.7 billion in Q3.
The acquisition of Covidien gives us increased financial flexibility, providing an opportunity to assess our mix of
dividends and share buybacks going forward, which our board typically valuates in June. In addition, it solidifies our
ability to deliver on our commitment to return 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders. We have a strong balance
sheet, and disciplined capital allocation remains extremely important. We will prioritize potential M&A investments
that are aligned with and strengthen one or more of our three growth strategies, while at the same time offer high return
metrics, minimizing near-term shareholder dilution.
Before turning the call over to Gary, I would like to discuss the integration of Covidien. We were excited to complete
the acquisition in early Q4, and immediately began executing the comprehensive integration plans that our two
companies have developed over the past seven months. Throughout the planning process, and now into the integration,
we've had four clear priorities that are guiding our two organizations. These priorities are preserve, optimize, accelerate
and transform. Our first and highest priority is to preserve. Both Medtronic and Covidien have been consistently
executing and meeting our individual growth commitments. We must preserve the ability of both companies to
continue to deliver reliable mid-single digit constant currency revenue growth, as well as EPS leverage. Medtronic and
Covidien are highly complementary in terms of the customers we call on, the products we sell and the markets we
serve. Our customer-facing commercial and R&D organizations will, therefore, not be affected by the integration. We
will be focused on minimizing unnecessary disruptions and delivering on our commitments as we come together as one
company.
Our second priority is to optimize, to optimize our non-customer facing functions' cost structures. Specifically, we will
target facility duplication, administrative redundancies, indirect costs and other back-office functions. We have
structured detailed cost savings plans, which we have already started implementing, and Gary will provide more details
later in the call. Our third priority is to accelerate. While there are numerous potential revenue synergies we are
currently assessing and prioritizing, we are focused on realizing two immediate opportunities. First, we intend to
leverage Covidien's Peripheral Vascular sales force to drive sales of the recently approved IN.PACT Admiral
drug-coated balloon in addition to the entire breadth of our collective CVG Peripheral Vascular platform, including
directional atherectomy. This group will also continue to develop clinical evidence to support this growing area of
medicine, building upon Medtronic IN.PACT SFA and Covidien's DEFINITIVE AR studies.

Second, we expect that combining Covidien's Neurovascular business with our Restorative Therapies Group will
significantly enhance our neuroscience strategy, creating a comprehensive product portfolio for neurosurgeons,
intervention neurologists and interventional neuroradiologists. One of Covidien's neurovascular products worth noting
is the Solitaire Revascularization Device. During the International Stroke Conference last week, four significant stroke
trials were presented that tested Solitaire. The trials, MR CLEAN, EXTEND-IA, ESCAPE and SWIFT PRIME,
confirmed effectiveness of stent thrombectomy and were noted by some to be the most significant advancement in this
space in over two decades.
The findings of three of these studies have been published in The New England Journal of Medicine, providing
evidence that the standard of care for the treatment of stroke should be changed to include stent thrombectomy as a
primary treatment in addition to IV-tPA. Finally, our fourth priority in combining Medtronic and Covidien is to
ultimately transform healthcare. This applies to both how we innovate and develop new value-based offerings in the
market, as well as how we partner with key stakeholders throughout the global healthcare industry to drive new
transformative business models and solutions.
We believe we have an opportunity to truly meet the universal needs of healthcare, improving clinical outcomes,
expanding access and optimizing cost and efficiency in no way – in a way that no other company can. Our
industry-leading products, clinical and economic expertise, global footprint and financial strength position us to be the
preferred partner for physicians, hospital systems, patients, payers and governments around the world.
I'm confident in our team's ability to execute on these four priorities, and I'm truly excited about the potential for the
collective talent and expertise of our new organization to live and fulfill the Medtronic mission. Together with our
partners, we can alleviate pain, restore health and extend life for millions of people around the world.
Gary will now take you through a more detailed look at our third quarter results. Gary?
Gary Lee Ellis
Thanks, Omar. Third quarter revenue of $ 4.318 billion increased 3.7% as reported or 7.5% on a constant currency
basis after adjusting for a $158 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency. On an organic basis, revenue growth
was 7% after adjusting for the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. Q3 revenue results on a geographic basis were as
follows: Growth in the U.S. was 8% and represented 57% of our overall sales. Non-U.S. developed markets grew 5%
and represented 30% of our overall sales. And growth in emerging markets was 12% and represented 13% of our
overall sales.
Q3 diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis were $1.01, an increase of 11%. Q3 GAAP diluted earnings per
share were $0.98, an increase of 31%. This quarter's GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments on an after-tax basis included a
$66 million charge for acquisition-related items primarily associated with transaction costs in connection with the
Covidien acquisition, a $25 million gain on the MicroFrance divestiture within our Surgical Technologies division, a
$62 million gain on the sale of our remaining equity investment in Weigao, which is earmarked to fund the Medtronic
Foundation in a payment that occurred back in Q2, and a $49 million in interest expense related to debt issued in
advance to finance the Covidien transaction.
It is worth noting that on a non-GAAP cash basis, Q3 diluted earnings per share were $1.07, an increase of 10%.
In our Cardiac and Vascular Group, revenue of $2.224 billion grew 10%. Results were driven by strong double-digit
growth in Low Power, Structural Heart, and AF & Other, along with mid-single digit growth in High Power and Aortic
& Peripheral Vascular, partially offset by modest decline in Coronary. In the Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure division,
revenue of $1.269 billion grew 12%. High Power revenue of $650 million grew 4%. We estimate the global High
Power market is growing modestly, with low-single-digit growth in international markets offsetting low-single-digit
declines in the U.S.
In the U.S., we estimate we have gained several percentage points of High Power share since launching our Attain
Performa quadripolar CRT-D system. Our CRT-D implant volumes, which were flat prior to this launch, grew nearly

20% in Q3 as the U.S. market continued to show strong preference for the combination of our AdaptiveCRT algorithm
and Next Generation quadripolar technology, which includes steroid on every electrode to reduce capture thresholds,
short middle electrode spacing to reduce peripheral nerve stimulation, and fast vector express programming.
In the quarter, the FDA approved two additional versions of our quadripolar leads, the Straight and S-shape, giving
even more options to the electrophysiologist. U.S. High Power growth also benefited from accelerating adoption of the
TYRX anti-infection envelope technology for use in high-risk implant procedures. We have signed our first TYRX
risk-sharing agreement and have a strong pipeline of U.S. hospitals interested in partnering in this innovative business
model. In January, we started enrollment in our 7,000 patient RAPID trial, which is assessing the clinical and economic
effectiveness of TYRX. We expect results from this trial in FY 2018.
In Japan, we launched our Evera MRI SureScan ICD in the quarter. Evera MRI, which allows for full body MRI scans,
is garnering strong adoption in the Japanese market, resulting in 13 percentage points of ICD share gain in Japan this
quarter. Low Power revenue of $489 million grew 17%, driven by the continued strong global launch of Reveal LINQ.
We continue to see strong adoption of this innovative diagnostic, with daily implant growth up in the high single digits
sequentially.
Looking at the U.S. pacing market, we were pleased to see improvements in both initial implant volumes and our
overall market share, driven by the continued mix shift toward Advisa MRI and growing pacemaker pull through from
the expanded use of Reveal LINQ in patients with unexplained syncope.
In Japan, we continue to see good traction of our Advisa MRI pacemaker, where our share remains over 250 basis
points above pre-launch levels despite competitive entrants. Looking ahead, we have completed the enrollment phases
of our U.S. and CE Mark clinical trials for our Micra Transcatheter Pacing System and expect CE Mark by the end of
this quarter with U.S. approval to follow in FY 2017.
AF Solutions grew over 30%, globally driven by continued robust growth of our Arctic Front Advance CryoAblation
system. Leveraging the increasing body of clinical and economic evidence on safety, efficacy and procedural efficiency
of Arctic Front, we continue to take AF ablation share, growing nearly twice as fast as the overall AF market despite
new competitor product introductions.
Turning to our Coronary and Structural Heart division, revenue of $737 million grew 8%. Our coronary business
declined 2% with our global drug-eluting stent revenue share declining slightly as we begin to enter our next new
product introduction cycle. The international launch of our Resolute Onyx DES occurred late in Q3 and is off to a good
start. Resolute Onyx builds on the superior deliverability and proven clinical performance of Resolute Integrity, with
thinner struts to improve deliverability even further. It is the first stent to feature our core wire technology, which
markedly enhances visibility. In our broader coronary product portfolio, Q3 saw the continued rollout of our new NC
Euphora Noncompliant PTCA balloon plant family, as well as strong sequential growth in U.S. revenues from our FFR
co-promotion alliance with ACIST Medical Systems.
In renal denervation, we remain confident in our leadership in this field. Since the results of HTN-3, we have analyzed
confounding factors of that trial, performed groundbreaking pre-clinical research, and engaged numerous expert
clinicians and stakeholders. In the coming days, we plan to formally submit the U.S. IDE for our global clinical
program, and we look forward to providing further details in the future.
Our Structural Heart business grew 22%, driven by another strong quarter in transcatheter valves, which grew over
60%. Our U.S. launch of CoreValve continues to drive growth and we estimate this resulted in U.S. sequential share
gains. In addition, hospital customers are reacting positively to the new TAVR DRGs, which were established in
October, and in general resulted in improved reimbursement and hospital economics for institutions looking to establish
TAVR programs.
Enrollment in our CoreValve Evolut R U.S. study is well underway and we continue to plan for U.S. launch in mid FY
2016. Evolut R is our next-generation recapturable system with a differentiated 14-French equivalent delivery system.

In international markets, we received CE Mark for the Evolut R 26 and 29 millimeter valves, broadening our size
offerings for this innovative platform into the largest segments of the market. Looking ahead, we expect the global
TAVR market to grow in the 20% to 25% range over the next year.
In our Aortic and Peripheral Vascular division, revenue of $218 million grew 5%. Aortic revenue grew 3%, led by
strong growth in Thoracic. In AAA, the launch of the Endurant 2S, a unique three-piece version of our market-leading
Endurant platform, is off to a good start.
Revenue for our Peripheral business grew 16% in Q3. During the quarter, we received U.S. FDA approval for our
IN.PACT Admiral drug-coated balloon for use in the upper leg, though this did not contribute revenue in Q3 as the first
commercial U.S. implants occurred earlier this month.
In addition, 12-month results of the landmark IN.PACT Admiral DCB study were published online in the journal
Circulation in December, showing the highest rate of primary patency and lowest rate of clinically driven TLR ever
reported from a study of interventional treatments for peripheral artery disease in the upper leg. We expect our
IN.PACT Admiral DCB to drive growth in Peripheral in the coming quarters, and we plan to broaden the launch and
have our Covidien Peripheral sales force start selling the product later this month.
Now, turning to our Restorative Therapies Group. Revenue of $1.645 billion grew 5%, with all three divisions
contributing to growth. Results were driven by double-digit growth in Surgical Technologies, mid-single digit growth
in Neuromodulation and low-single digit growth in Spine. Spine revenue of $740 million grew 2%. Both the global and
U.S. spine markets grew in the low-single digits, the third quarter in a row of modest sequential improvement. Our core
Spine business grew 1% in Q3.
We are seeing good adoption of our recently launched Pure Titanium Coating interbody fusion devices, the PRESTIGE
LP Artificial Cervical Disc and our new DIVERGENCE Anterior Cervical Fusion System. We recently received FDA
approval for our DIVERGENCE standalone system and ZEVO Anterior Fixation System.
FY 2015 is an important year for product and launches in our core Spine business. And as we have noted all year, we
expect this to support a return to modest growth for our overall Spine business in FY 2015.
In addition to working with surgeons to develop leading differentiated technologies in Spine, our business continues to
focus on procedural innovation. Sales of products to perform our OLIF25 Procedure grew nearly 30%. This innovative
minimally invasive procedure utilizes an oblique trajectory to avoid nerve bundles in the psoas muscle, providing an
alternative to lateral approaches that are dependent on nerve monitoring.
We also continue to develop and deploy our differentiated Surgical Synergy program, which innovates our enabling
technologies, surgical tools, spinal implants and expertise to improve surgical outcomes and efficiencies. We now
estimate that 16% of our thoracolumbar procedures use our proprietary POWEREASE system of powered surgical
instruments and over 20% use our StealthStation surgical navigation technology.
Interventional Spine, which primarily consists of our balloon kyphoplasty product line, had stable sales in Q3. The
business had low-single digit growth in the U.S. and mid-teens growth in Japan, offset by declines in Europe where the
business experienced pricing pressure in Germany.
BMP sales of $122 million grew 9%, with stable underlying demand. We do believe we have turned the corner and
would expect BMP sales growth to be slightly positive going forward.
Turning to Surgical Technologies. Revenue of $418 million grew 11%. Surgical Technologies had solid balanced
growth contributions from all three of its businesses: Neurosurgery, ENT and Advanced Energy.
Neurosurgery had double-digit growth, with strong sales of Midas Rex power equipment and the O-arm Surgical
Imaging System. ENT grew in the upper-single digits, driven by the recent launches of the StraightShot M5
Microdebrider and the NuVent sinus balloon. In Advanced Energy, strong adoption of our proprietary Aquamantys
tissue sealing and PEAK PlasmaBlade technologies drove solid mid-teens growth.

In Neuromodulation, revenue of $487 million increased 5%, led by upper-single-digit growth in our Gastro/Uro and
DBS businesses. Gastro/Uro had a strong quarter of InterStim sales worldwide. In DBS, our global focus on neurologist
referral programs and the strength of the EARLYSTIM data in international markets continues to drive solid growth.
In Pain Stim, we estimate the U.S. market is declining in the mid-single digits as slower trialing activity is affecting
new implant growth. However, we estimate we gained modest U.S. market share and maintained our global share on
the strength of our RestoreSensor SureScan MRI spinal cord stimulation system, with its proprietary AdaptiveStim
automatic stimulation adjustment feature and access to MRI scans anywhere in the body.
In our Diabetes Group, revenue of $449 million grew 6%. However, after adjusting for the $23 million in deferred
revenue that was recognized in Q3 last year, the group grew 12%. Diabetes had a strong quarter in international,
growing 12%, including growth of 36% in emerging markets. In the U.S., we continue to see strong adoption of our
MiniMed 530G System with Enlite CGM sensor.
We recently announced the result of a retrospective analysis from over 20,000 MiniMed 530G users in the journal of
Diabetes Technology & Therapeutics, which found that the pump's Thresholds Suspend feature reduced hypoglycemia
by 69%, with an even greater benefit at night, without significantly increasing hyperglycemia.
We were also pleased that the U.S. FDA lifted their warning letter on our Diabetes business in late-December.
In international, we began the limited launch in select markets of our next-generation MiniMed 640G System with the
Enhanced Enlite CGM sensor. In addition to incorporating a brand new insulin pump design and user interface, the
MiniMed 640G System features SmartGuard technology, which automatically suspends insulin delivery when sensor
glucose levels are predicted to approach a low limit and then resumes insulin delivery once levels recover.
We continue to make progress in bringing this technology to the U.S. and plan to submit the PMA for this system later
this calendar year. The predictive low glucose management clinical study associated with this PMA is underway, which
is studying our next-generation insulin pump and fourth-generation CGM sensor. This sensor has new intelligent
diagnostics that are expected to result in enhanced accuracy and it is 80% smaller than the Enlite sensor currently sold
in the U.S.
Turning to the rest of the income statement. In addition to commenting on our Q3 results, I will also make some
forward-looking comments which are based upon the combination of both Medtronic and Covidien P&Ls and also
reflect the number of reclassifications that we have made to the Covidien P&L in order to be consistent. Information on
these reclasses is available on the footnote section of the combined historical Covidien-Medtronic financial statement
presentation on our investor website.
The Q3 gross margin was 73.9% and it included 20 basis points of negative impact from foreign currency. The gross
margin continues to include significant spending related to resources diverted to address quality issues in
Neuromodulation.
The Q3 gross margin was also negatively affected by product mix shift toward diagnostic and AF products in CRHF
and the acquisition of NGC Medical.
NGC Medical, which was acquired – we acquired in Q2, has a gross margin that is similar to our existing Cath Lab
Managed Services business and is significantly below our corporate average. However, NGC and Cath Lab Managed
Services have operating margins that are close to the corporate average due to the lower spend in SG&A and R&D.
Looking ahead, for the newly combined company, after taking into account the Covidien reclassifications I mentioned
earlier, we would expect gross margins to be more in the 69% to 71% range on an operational basis. This outlook does
not include the impact of the Covidien inventory step-up arising from the purchase accounting rules.
Third quarter R&D spending of $373 million was 8.6% of revenue. We are pleased that our past R&D investments are
resulting in faster organic revenue growth and we continue to invest in new technologies as well as generating clinical
and economic evidence to drive future growth.

When you combine Medtronic and Covidien, we would expect R&D expense to be more in the range of 7% to 7.5%.
Third quarter SG&A expenditures of $1.487 billion represented 34.4% of sales. Q3 SG&A on a constant currency basis
were 34.3%. Looking ahead, in addition to the reclassification, this is the line item that will reflect most of the benefits
from our cost synergy initiatives. Taking this into account, as well as the pre-existing leverage initiatives of both
Medtronic and Covidien, combined SG&A in the range of 32% to 33% on an operational basis seems reasonable in Q4.
Amortization expense for the quarter was $89 million. For Q4, we would expect the combined company amortization
expense to be in the range of $450 million to $600 million, reflecting the impact of the Covidien acquisition. This is a
wide range as the preliminary purchase accounting and related amortization of intangibles have not yet been
determined and likely won't be until the end of the quarter. It is worth noting that we will be shifting in Q4 to cash
earnings per share and, thus, we'll exclude this expense from our non-GAAP earnings.
Net other expense for the quarter was $24 million, including net gains from our hedging program of $54 million. We
hedged the majority of our operating results in developed market currencies to reduce volatility in our earnings from
foreign exchange. However, a growing portion of our profits are unhedged, especially emerging market currencies,
which can create some modest volatility in our earnings. As I will talk about in a moment, the mix of our earnings that
are unhedged will increase further with the addition of Covidien.
Based on the current exchange rates, as well as the reclassifications of the combined company, net other expense in the
fourth quarter for the combined company is expected to be in the range of $35 million to $60 million.
Q3 net interest expense on a non-GAAP basis was $4 million after adjusting for the $77 million incremental net interest
expense related to our December 2014 $17 billion bond offering used to fund the Covidien acquisition. While we
excluded this incremental interest expense from our non-GAAP earnings this quarter because of the difference in
timing between the debt issuance and the closing of the acquisition, we will include the incremental interest expense on
our non-GAAP earnings going forward.
At the end of Q3, we had approximately $31.1 billion in cash and investments and $28.8 billion in debt.
Subsequent to Q3, there are a number of items that will affect our year-end cash and debt balances, including the
addition of a $3 billion term loan; the approximately $15 billion of cash consideration paid for Covidien; the addition
of approximately $5.5 billion in previously-held Covidien debt at fair value and a $2 billion in cash; and the $1.2
billion in debt maturing in March which we will retire using existing cash.
Based on current rates, we would expect Q4 net interest expense for the combined company to be in the range of $195
million to $215 million.
Our non-GAAP nominal tax rate in Q3 was 17.1%. Included in our third quarter tax rate is a $29 million benefit
associated with the extension of the U.S. R&D tax credit. It is worth noting that on a combined company basis, the
non-GAAP nominal tax rate excluding amortization has been running in the range of 18% to 19%. And as we had
noted in the past, the combined tax rate going forward could be approximately two percentage points better.
In Q3 we generated $1.7 billion in free cash flow. We remain committed to returning 50% of our free cash flow to
shareholders. In Q3, we paid $300 million in dividends and there were no share repurchases given restrictions related to
the Covidien acquisition. As of the end of Q3, we had remaining authorization to repurchase approximately 34 million
shares and we intend to restart our share repurchase program later in Q4, pending Irish Court administrative approval,
which is expected in early March.
Third quarter average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 996 million shares. It is important to note that we
expect the cash we received from stock-option redemptions, which was $165 million in Q3, will also continue to be
used to repurchase shares on the open market to partially offset the dilutive impact. These share repurchases are
incremental to our commitment to return 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders.
For Q4, we would expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be approximately 1.440 billion shares,
reflecting the shares issued in the Covidien acquisition.

Next, I would like to comment on our revenue outlook for the fourth quarter, which will be our first quarter reporting
combined Medtronic-Covidien results.
For the fourth quarter, we believe constant currency revenue growth of 4% to 6% on a combined pro forma basis is
reasonable, and we expect to be in the upper part of the range. While we cannot predict the impact of currency
movements to give you a sense of the FX impact, if exchange rates were to remain similar to yesterday for the
remainder of fiscal year, our Q4 revenue would be negatively affected by approximately $420 million to $480 million,
which would result in reported revenue on an actual FX basis of approximately $7 billion to $7.1 billion.
Taking into account our revenue and P&L comments that I have already covered, it would not be surprising to see
models for our Q4 cash earnings per share somewhere in the broad range of $1.08 to $1.13.
Next, I would like to provide some high-level framing comments on fiscal year 2016. While we intend to give our
revenue outlook and earnings per share guidance, per our normal practice, in our Q4 call, given the changes resulting
from the addition of Covidien, here are some items to keep in mind as you think about our next fiscal year.
First on revenue growth. While we are not formally providing our FY 2016 revenue outlook, we believe it is reasonable
to think about our revenue growth in the mid-single digit range on a constant currency basis, consistent with our
baseline expectations.
Next, keep in mind that we will have an extra selling week in the first quarter of FY 2016, which we would estimate to
have an impact of approximately 100 basis points to 150 basis points of incremental revenue growth for the full fiscal
year, or approximately 400 basis points to 600 basis points in Q1. This gives us increased confidence that we could be
in the upper-half of the mid-single digit revenue growth baseline expectation in FY 2016.
Regarding foreign exchange, the significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar represents a strong potential headwind in
FY 2016. Even though our legacy Medtronic businesses continue to realize the benefit of our hedging program on
major developed market currencies, it is not possible to completely hedge FY 2016 and FY 2015 rates given today's
exchange rates. This would result in our legacy Medtronic businesses experiencing negative impact from foreign
currency, albeit somewhat mitigated by the benefit of our hedging program. At the same time, the legacy Covidien
business does not have the same benefit today.
Taken together, if exchange rates were to remain similar to yesterday throughout FY 2016, our combined FY 2016
revenue would be negatively affected by approximately $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion. On the bottom line, based on
today's rates, this could translate into a $0.30 to $0.40 negative impact to earnings per share.
Turning to our focus on cost synergies. As Omar had mentioned, cost synergy activities are underway and we are in the
process of finalizing our FY 2016 targets. We are targeting over $850 million in cost synergies through FY 2018.
In terms of timing, it is reasonable to straight-line these savings over the three years, and our organization will be
working hard to exceed this goal.
Also, looking ahead, I would like to note that we anticipate holding our Q4 Earnings Call before market opens on June
2. This is two weeks later than our normal timing as this will be the first quarter where Covidien results will be
combined in our financial reports. However, we do believe we will have an earlier view on our revenue results and will
plan to pre-release revenue on May 19.
I will now turn the call back over to Omar.
Omar S. Ishrak
Thanks, Gary. And before opening the lines for Q&A, let me briefly conclude by reiterating that Q3 was a strong
quarter for Medtronic. And as we look ahead, we're excited to welcome Covidien into our organization. The
operational momentum of both organizations is moving in the right direction, giving us increased confidence in the

future.
This does not happen without a lot of hard work and discipline. I want to take a moment to express my appreciation to
both the Medtronic and Covidien teams for staying focused, avoiding any distractions and delivering on their
commitments during this transition period.
While there are a number of moving parts in the financials as we combine the two companies, and we are facing
increased headwinds in the near term from foreign currency, our priority is to sustain the operational performance of
the company, striving to reliably deliver on our baseline financial model, mid-single digit constant currency revenue
growth, constant currency EPS growth 200 basis points to 400 basis points faster, and returning 50% of our free cash
flow to shareholders.
To achieve these goals, we continue to execute on our three primary growth strategies: therapy innovation,
globalization and economic value. We believe our acquisition of Covidien will meaningfully complement and
accelerate all three of these strategies, strengthening our long-term market competitiveness, as well as driving further
sustainability and consistency in our long-term financial performance.
With that, we will now open the phone line for Q&A. In addition to Gary, I've asked Mike Coyle President for Cardiac
and Vascular Group; Chris O'Connell, President of our Restorative Therapies Groups; and Hooman Hakami, President
of our Diabetes Group, to join us. In the future, we intend to have Bryan Hanson, the new leader of the Covidien
Group, on our earnings call.
We are rarely able to get to everyone's questions, so please limit yourself to only one question and, if needed, only one
related follow-up. If you have additional questions, please contact our Investor Relations team after the call.

Q&A
Operator
Your first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Hey, good morning, Omar.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Good morning.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: And obviously congratulations on a very strong quarter for the company. Let me start
with a couple of items now that the transaction has closed. One, I was hoping you could give us an update on your
thoughts on capital allocation. You've talked about the 50% return commitment and that is still in place. Can you give
us updated thoughts on the split between dividend and buyback?
And second, there's a number of drivers this quarter – really, over the last couple of quarters. That have been some new
products, but also in some cases your market is getting better and you gaining share in this market. Can you just talk
about the sustainability as we think about FY 2016 and start to think about our pro forma models? Thanks.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Thanks, Mike. Let's take both your points. First of all, in terms of the returning to shareholder.
Like we mentioned earlier, our commitment remains, first, to sort of firm up our commitment and almost guarantee the
fact that we can return 50% of our cash flow to shareholders. So, that's an important element of the Covidien
transaction; it enables us to do that.
Now within that, as you point out, the mix between dividend and share buyback is something that we're considering.
We will think about changing that ratio. We think we have the capacity to do that. However, lots of moving parts right
now, and we need to kind of settle down on exactly what we have. We need board approval. The board meeting happen
in June. So really, until then, we cannot make any firm pronouncement. What I will say is that our intention is to make
a commitment that we can stick to, that we will say something in a balanced fashion that you can rely on in the future,

and we're certainly looking at changing the mix to increase the amount dividend. Hey, Gary, do want to add to that at
all?
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: No, I think that's right. As we've indicated, there's a process we need to go through. We need to
kind of see over the next couple of quarters how things play out in the normal process as the board will look at this split
in the June timeframe, and that's when we would intend to discuss it with them.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: With respect to your second point, Mike, I agree that there were lots of new products that
helped us. And so, we had revenue growth actually over our mid-single digit targets, fueled by a lot of the new
products, and an improving market like you point out. Now, we have a pretty rich pipeline. If you think about it, the
drug coated balloon is going to come out. In Diabetes, we have the 640G in Europe, which was just launch. So we've
got a series of new products that are coming out, so we have some level of sustainability in terms of the product
releases.
But, look, let me just say that the more important point here is the mid-single digit growth. I mean there'll be quarters
where you go, hopefully, only up rather than down. But our real goal here is to sustain this mid-single digit trajectory
through diversification of our product lines and businesses; diversification of our geographies where we get the growth
from, particularly from emerging markets; diversifying within emerging markets as well; and finally, diversifying as to
the nature of the revenue, more service revenues. And so if you do all of that, we think we can get a business that can
deliver consistently in the mid-single digits, and I think that's what we're zeroing in on rather than swings one way or
the other that may happen from quarter to quarter.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Gary, from your FY 2016 commentary, there was a number of puts and takes there, and
the challenge of the Street, as you've seen with other companies over the last several weeks, has been to stay on top of
FX and the impact that has on each company's earnings. Right now, the Street seems to be aggregating around roughly
$445 million for FY 2016. Any preliminary thoughts on whether that's roughly the right range, whether FX is
appropriately reflected in that type of number?
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Obviously, we're not giving guidance yet for FY 2016, and so I don't want to comment
necessarily on whether the $445 million is right or not. But I do think, back to your point, Mike, I think what I have
seen is many people are updating their models for foreign exchange and I'm challenging that. I mean that's the biggest
thing, as we go through our – we're going right on through our planning process as we speak. And so, we're trying to
get a handle on this and understanding as we go forward.
I think most models seem to have a pretty good sense on it. Kind of, as I indicated in my comments, that $0.35 to $0.40
range is kind of where I think most people are landing. Some are a little bit lower than that. I mean the issue that we
have to understand is based on today's rates, and the reality is the foreign exchange rates, I mean if they weaken another
5%, there's just additional impact on that, especially until we can get Covidien into our hedging program as we move
forward. Because Covidien in effect for all intents and purposes is not hedged, and that's going to increase our volatility
until we can get that into our own program here.
So I think right now, many models have updated for foreign exchange, which I think is appropriate, and that's reflected
in the models. And as a result of that, I think in all the other parameters, assuming that they put in the right interest
expense and assume the kind of the operational growth and synergies that we've talked about, I think you're probably
going get in the range you're discussing. But again, we're not giving any guidance right now for FY 2016.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Understood. That's helpful. Thank you, Gary, and congrats again on the quarter.

Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Gary, I wonder if we could come back to margins for a second here. Your gross margins have
been under pressure the last couple of quarters, but actually this quarter they reversed that slide. But I wonder if you
could shift focus from gross margins to operating margin and specifically on two points.
If you think about your organic growth rate – that's the highlight of this quarter – organic growth has doubled for
Medtronic the last four quarters, but even it's still sort of flat to down. I wonder if you could walk us through kind of
EBIT commentary in your mind the last four quarters as you have for gross margin the last couple of quarters.
And then secondarily, and I think about your pro forma guidance with Covidien for the fourth quarter, SG&A is
actually stronger or there's more leverage than what we'd expect. So can you talk to us about that $850 million synergy
number and what we can imply about that $850 million number and how conservative it may be based on your stronger
than expected fourth quarter SG&A guide?
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Yes well overall, I mean first of all you have to understand as we go forward on a lot of these
things, there's going to be reclasses between how Covidien has been classifying their numbers and so to be consistent
with Medtronic. And so, it's even harder to take a look at some of the percentages versus where Medtronic historically
has been to make some sense out of that. So, I would just encourage all of you to go to their investor website where the
IR team has tried to lay it out on a pro forma basis and give you kind of a perspective on what it looks like when you
get the reclasses in there and look at the combined companies.
As you indicated, I mean, gross margin overall, which have been under a little bit of pressure, especially within
Medtronic itself, we're starting to see some improvement in that area overall. We still expect there's more there. We're
getting some favorable manufacturing variances being generated. We're getting and we're seeing some of that quality
cost for example that's declining now in Diabetes, where we'll expect that to occur over time here in Neuromodulation.
So from a Medtronic legacy perspective, the gross margins, as we expected, we would expect to see it kind of
improving, with the exception of the mix issue that I mentioned also in my comments, which is the fact that as NGC
and some of these service businesses become more and more prevalent, those are going to have a negative impact on
the gross margin but not necessarily the operating margin.
Back to your exact point, what we really think we need to do is start focusing more as a company on the operating
margin of the organization because that's where, really, where the profits obviously are going to be generated. And
Covidien has lower margins in some of their businesses. Clearly, the service model has a different, lower gross margin,
I should say. But the operating margins of all these organizations are basically consistent with where Medtronic is at.
And back to your point, that's where our focus is, is to increase and drive operating margin improvement and
performance.
That is going to come from the standpoint primarily of the SG&A leverage as we discussed. Fourth quarter is always a
lower percentage just from the standpoint that we have. It's our highest revenue month. And just as a percentage of
revenue, the spending tends to be better in that quarter naturally. If you look historically, that's normally what you
would see.
You put that on top of the fact that as we go forward, we will start to see some of the synergies initially starting to play
out. Some in Q4, although not as much. As we get into FY 2016, as we indicated right now, I would kind of
straight-line those, that $850 million, kind of in for the FY 2016. We're still detail planning exactly how that will play
out, but that's a good assumption right now.
And obviously, if we can accelerate and drive the $850 million more, we will do that. I mean that's the commitment we
have at this point in time, but we will – and that's on top of the synergies, the organization, both Covidien and
Medtronic already had as far synergies we're going to try to focus on. So the operating margins of the organization,
especially on a combined basis going forward, with those initiatives that both companies had, plus the synergies, will

continue to improve as you go forward into the next several years.
You have to be a little careful of taking a look and saying, well, what's happening to operating margins or EBIT
margins right now, because currency has impact on this, because the gains and losses are, where do you – those are in
non op expense or other income and expense line item, the gains are back down there. So, you have to pull all those
into consideration and take a look at what's really happening with our EBIT and operating margins.
But in general, we're happy. The earnings per share is growing very nicely and it's clearly exceeding our leverage
targets that we've indicated as we go forward. So, we're achieving the overall objectives and we're managing the
business on bottom line growth.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: And, Gary, the other area that could help to offset some of the currency pressure next year
obviously could be tax. Could you just give us an update on where Medtronic or core Medtronic sits with the IRS tax
settlement and timing there? And then secondarily, can we assume the fourth quarter tax number is a good predictor of
2016 or not necessarily? Thank you.
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Yes. As far as the tax case, we're literally in the process right now. The case is being heard. This
is the Puerto Rico transfer price dispute that we have with the IRS. This is literally being heard as we speak. We expect
that will continue over the next several weeks before the trial will be concluded. And then, it'll depend on how much
time after that it takes for the court to reach a decision and make a decision where we're at.
But we would expect that could be anywhere – I mean that could be several, 6 to 12 months. I mean that could be a
while out before we actually have a response from the decision on that one. So, we're not necessarily expecting
anything in FY 2016 at this point in time. Obviously, that would be a positive if it happened, but we're not expecting
anything currently in FY 2016.
The tax rate for the Q4 and kind of the general direction that we gave you, that's probably directionally still what we
would say as we're expecting that as we go forward. The combined rates of the two companies on a cash tax rate basis
have been kind of in that 18% to 19% range. We still expect that there's about at least a 200 basis point improvement
on that, just related to the financing costs. As we get a better sense of that, as we go into FY 2016, we'll give more
updates, but right now that's still a good assumption to use.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Great. Thank you very much.
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Thanks.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Thanks. Next question?
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Thanks for the question and congratulations on the quarter and closing Covidien. I just
wanted to return, Omar, to some of the comments that you had made earlier, just on the growth profile of being
mid-single digits and driving 200 to 400 basis points of leverage. I'm just curious, given some of the I guess tax
advantages that you'll see next year, as well as the cost synergies, why can't Medtronic be more of a mid-single digit,
double-digit EPS growth profile company, at least more in the medium term?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Well, a number of things. First of all, we want to stick to mid-single digits, and we did say
that's 200 to 400 basis points of EPS leverage on top of that. To deliver that on a sustained basis is you've got lots of
variables you've got to take into account. You've got market surprises and other things that contribute. So, we just want
to be a little cautious as to what we put out there.
We also think that the total shareholder return, if you include the return that you get from the dividend, actually takes
into double-digit total return. So, that's what we are looking at. Anything beyond that at this point is premature for us. I

realize that there's synergies which we will get which will give us some enhancement of our operating leverage. But at
the same time, we've got variables to do with increasing our dividend versus what we do in terms of the share buyback,
which we'll look at.
So there's lots of moving parts here, Kristen, that we want to look at before we make a pronouncement, and we think
that overall a double-digit total shareholder return is a pretty attractive proposition for a company of this size,
especially if you can rely on that consistently. So again, we think that that's a reasonable sort of a goal that we can
have. Again, reliability, consistency, sustainability comes first in our mind before we get too eager about trying to
bump these numbers up too high.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Okay. And then just, I guess, more micro question just on the CRM market. I was
wondering if we could just kind of walk through and balance some of your commentary around the success that you've
been having on the high-power side. I mean it looks like your U.S. growth rate was just about 1%. So, maybe just share
kind of your view on the overall market. And then also, just on the low-power side, what you think the pacemaker
market is doing? Obviously, LINQ has been a big driver to the performance there. Maybe some comments just around
that underlying business as well.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Yes, thanks, Kristen. Look, Mike has been driving this, has been waiting for a question like
this to explain the markets. I'll let Mike, let him go here. Go ahead, Mike.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Thanks.
<A - Michael J. Coyle>: So, Kristen, on the high-power side, we think globally it's still fairly flat in terms of overall
growth of the market. Our growth at 4% obviously represents a market share capture, and the three primary drivers of
that were kind of highlighted in the script. The AdaptivCRT and the quadripolar lead release that we've had in the U.S.
has been driving market share. We think, on an initials basis, were up roughly 10 points in initial market share in the
CRT-D segment of the market here since the launch of those products, and those have been having a nice effect on our
overall growth.
In addition, in international, in Japan the MRI safe ICD market entry has been driving significant initial market share as
well. And then the TYRX product line, the anti-infective coating, it actually impacts pacing and ICDs but has a bigger
impact on ICDs in terms of our ability to use it to both drive ASP and to drive share in replacement. So, those have
been the primary drivers on the high-power side.
On the low-power side, the overall market, using our kind of two quarter averaging convention, is up roughly 5%
inclusive of diagnostics. But frankly, diagnostics is the driver there. And if you looked at core pacing, the therapeutic
pacing, you'd see a low-single digit decline on a constant-currency basis for the overall market.
We're obviously driving that Diagnostics revenue growth. And even within the pacing side, we are taking market share
on a mix shift toward the Advisa MRI pacing product in the U.S., and it basically is also helping us drive growth in that
area. So, those are the primary drivers on the implantable side.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Okay. Just as a follow-up. I guess if you've taken nearly 10 percentage points of share in
CRT just in the U.S., I guess I would of thought that the high-power business would have been up more than 1% this
quarter. Is there a comp issue or is there something else kind of moving the numbers within there? And how big, I
guess, should we expect Diagnostics to really be? It seems like you're going to far exceed the number that you put out
at the Investor Day back in June.
<A - Michael J. Coyle>: Yes. Well, on the question of prior year, quarter comps, we have been for the last several
quarters deliberately trying to take down the number of products sold in quarter-end bundles, because obviously there's
discounting associated with those that we would rather not be doing. And so, we have seen in each of the last couple of
quarters a fairly significant destocking of hospital inventories that's included in the numbers. That was particularly
pronounced last quarter, which is why you saw 5% growth even though we were really on an underlying basis closer to
7% growth for CVG.

So that continued in this quarter, not as dramatically as it was last quarter. And we think we're coming to the end of
that, where the comparables will be fairly flat year-over-year going forward. The other question was...
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Diagnostics.
<A - Michael J. Coyle>: Diagnostics. So we've said, we believe this is sort of the next billion-dollar product segment
for us. We obviously see three patient populations driving the penetration rates. We've seen syncope, atrial fibrillation,
cryptogenic stroke. All of those are very underpenetrated and, in fact, most of the revenue growth we've seen in that
product segment has been concentrated to the U.S. and Germany and the U.K. So we think that there's plenty of
opportunity to continue penetrating into those patient populations, as well as to continue the growth of that into other
geographies.
So again, we're going to start to run into tougher comps going forward. The LINQ product was released mid-quarter
fourth quarter last year, as well as, frankly, CoreValve in the U.S. So, those are going to become tougher comps. But on
the other hand, we have, obviously, numerous new product drivers that Omar mentioned, including in the DCB in the
U.S., the ability to use that to drive share of Covidien products in the peripheral space, the Onyx product in DES in
Europe, the 26 millimeter and 29 millimeter CoreValve products in Europe and, as I said, the continued penetration of
things like LINQ and TYRX into other geographies beyond the U.S.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Perfect. Thanks very much.

Your next question comes from the line of David Roman from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - David Harrison Roman>: Hi. Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I want to just to start, Gary, if you'd go
into a little bit more detail around cash access. I know what you've disclosed so far is that you should be able to get
about 60% of your annual free cash flow in an unencumbered manner post the Covidien transaction. But I also think
you've talked about that number potentially rising over time. Can you maybe just help us understand the mechanics of
what drives that number higher and where that could ultimately go, directionally speaking, over time?
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Yes. As we've indicated before, the transaction now being completed, what we basically have is
the – where we were about 35% of Medtronic, legacy cash flow was, in effect, available and 65% was, in effect,
unavailable for use in the U.S. That now with Covidien, we pulled – all of Covidien, in effect, is available. And so just
normal – numbers go from 35% of Medtronic to basically about 60% of the combined company will have cash that is
untracked and available going forward just as a result of combining the two organizations and the two companies.
And that's the legacy Medtronic trapped piece continues to be that way going forward because based on how the tax
rules work. And as a result of that, what occurs over time however, will be as over time, is you have more and more of
the cash flow being generated from, in effect, untrapped subsidiaries or untrapped parts of the organization, then your
cash flow will start to improve from that 60% to whether it's 65%, 70%, 75% over time. But that occurs as that – you
basically product shift and you get cash coming from basically untrapped locations. You can't just make changes
without making basically product shifts and making some decisions that really, organizationally and operationally, shift
where the cash is being generated. And that's what's going to take time. It'll occur as the organizations, both
organizations, continue to grow, and as we make investments into new product innovation going forward.
<Q - David Harrison Roman>: Okay. That's helpful. And maybe as a follow-up on the more strategic side. Omar, I
know you've talked a lot about the opportunity that exists to sell products like the drug-coated balloon through the
Covidien peripheral sales force. But as I think about other product categories that you haven't highlighted as much,
maybe you could talk about the opportunities in Neurovascular, for example, given your presence with the
neurosurgeon, whether it's in Neuromodulation or Spine, and then also the potential just to pull for – pull through some

of the general surgery technology that are used anyway in the vast majority of the procedures that Medtronic is
performing across the entire suite.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Yes, we just want to take this whole thing a step at a time. And like I've mentioned, we've had
two clear businesses, which are separable, which we are integrating into the RTG and CVG groups. You obviously
understand the drug-coated balloon, but also the Neurovascular business is being integrated into our RTG group, which
will enable us to have a more comprehensive offering into the neuroscience departments. And I'll let Chris comment on
that in a minute. With respect to the other areas, sure, in concept, there's lots of places where we can sell together. But
right now, if the two businesses simply preserve their growth trajectories, and we get the benefits from these two kind
of tuck-ins, so to speak, we'll create a pretty good business. Which is reliable, which can deliver consistently, and we
don't want to risk any distractions through any complicated cross-selling methods and sales teams incentives getting
even different from what it was before in the short-term, because the risk of distraction and losing momentum in those
areas can be very high. So therefore, we're taking that a step at a time.
Over time, some of those technologies show that there are opportunities for one sales force to have a broader basket of
products depending on who the customers are. What I would point out is that our philosophy here starts with the
customer and the physician, and then works back to the technology. We don't start with the technology. So if customers
require us, require products that come from some other group or division that makes sense for their usage, we will put it
through that channel. We don't want to force fit technologies into places where customers aren't necessarily using them.
And if you really look at this slew of surgical technology products, although, in principle, there's a lot of shared
technology, the usage amongst customers is actually quite separated. And we want to understand that carefully before
we start doing any sorts of integration. But I'll let Chris actually comment on the neuroscience strategy, which I think is
shorter-term and quite exciting. Chris, go ahead.
<A - Christopher O’Connell>: Sure. Thank you. Yes. The Neurovascular opportunity is really exciting for Medtronic.
Really, the first priority as we get into that though is to help the Neurovascular organization get off the ground with the
mechanical thrombectomy market growth and therapy penetration given the new clinical evidence that's come out into
the market that Omar referenced earlier. And obviously, we have a lot to contribute to that given our depth of expertise
in market development. So that's really priority number one. But clearly, the opportunity to leverage that therapy in our
broader neuroscience strategy is there. Just to remind, there are three main users of mechanical thrombectomy. Number
one is the interventional neuroradioloigst; number two is the neurosurgeon, who's trained in endovascular techniques;
and the third and smaller one is interventional neurology.
The market, particularly in the U.S., is trending towards the neurosurgeon, and as you know, we have seven major
product categories serving the neurosurgeon today across RTG, of which we're number one in every segment. This is
the one category we're not – we have not been present in, and so the opportunity to cross sell and partner with
neuroscience centers is obviously very strong, and we're just in the early phases of that, but we look forward to
providing more information on that opportunity going forward.
<Q - David Harrison Roman>: Great. Thank you. I look forward to getting another update in June.
<A - Jeff Warren>: All right. Thanks. Next question.

Your next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins from Bank of America.
<Q - Robert Adam Hopkins>: Thanks, and good morning. Congrats on a very strong revenue quarter. Question for
Gary. It looks like it was also a really good free cash flow quarter for you, so I was just wondering if you could give us
a sense as to as you close the transaction, what is the free cash flow generation of the combined entity as you sit here
today? I know it obviously improves over time, but just right out of the chute, what is the free cash flow coming out of
this combined entity in your view?

<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Yes, well, we did have a very strong cash flow, free cash flow this quarter now. That's
historical. Our Q3 tends to be one of the highest free cash flow quarter generations for us. And so Q1 starts off a little
slower and Q3 tends to be one of the strongest, and so we saw that again this quarter and it was very strong. There are
some – other things in the quarter, I mean, obviously, for example, I would tell you, one thing that helped our free cash
flow is the hedging contracts that we do have. We get hedge accounting from the P&L perspective, but basically, those
hedge contracts are collateralized. And so, actually, we're receiving cash on those as we have gains obviously on some
of the contracts going forward.
And that's – so that was a couple hundred million dollars of impact in the quarter, which is a positive, obviously, from a
cash flow perspective. But it really relates to gains that will be recognized in future quarters as we go forward. But in
general, your comment is right, Bob, that it was a very strong free cash flow and we're very – and we're comfortable
that both Covidien and ourselves continue to generate very strong cash flows. I mean, I think the number that we're
looking at right now on a kind of a combined basis just kind of starting off the chute, if you look at both companies, is
you're somewhere in the ballpark of $7 billion of kind of a free cash flow going ahead. Now, that's obviously going to
be impacted a little bit by this FX issue I mentioned.
And so that we have to understand exactly, the impact of the foreign exchange on the cash flow. But in general, if you
just took – look at the two companies and the cash flow generation and increase you would normally expect from that,
I'd say you're somewhere in that – kind of around that $7 billion ballpark starting up.
<Q - Robert Adam Hopkins>: Great. Okay. Terrific. I appreciate that. And then as a follow-up real quickly, why
wouldn't the tax shield kick in right away relative to that 18% and 19%? And, Omar, I was wondering if you could just
comment on which markets in the U.S. do you think are improving? I mean, a lot of your growth is Medtronic
product-driven, but it does feels like, especially the U.S., that certain markets are improving and getting better here.
Thank you.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Yes, let me take that one first and I'll let Gary comment on the tax here. I think you're right.
Look, in general, the overall sense that we get in the U.S. is improving across the board actually. But clearly, given
where the CRM market has been, I think there's clear improvement in some of those areas. On top of that, you've got to
remember, we're a fairly big player here or the biggest player in – certainly in the CRM market. And as our products
are successful, it actually draws the market up with us. And things like the LINQ product, we don't know for sure, but
we're pretty confident that it's bringing in increased sales of other implantable devices along with it. And that will
reflect on a stronger market.
So because of our share position, and I think if we succeed, we pull the market with us. So I've got to say that from an
overall market perspective, if I were to bias in any way in the U.S., it's got to be in the CRM that we probably see an
uptick in the market growth. But overall, you can read the provider earnings just like we can, and they appear to be
strong. That means the overall procedural volumes are stabilizing to improving in the U.S. So that gives us confidence
of the future, and I think just general confidence, the economy's helping us within elective procedures as well. Gary?
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Yes, just quickly on the tax rate, Bob, to clarify. I mean, what we're saying is the combined
company, if you just took our combined tax rates on a cash earnings per share basis, it's kind of in that 18% to 19%
range, what we've historically been at. And we would expect that two points of improvement, just from the financing of
the transaction, would be coming immediately. So basically, going forward, we would assume kind of for Q4 and on,
that we'd be more in the 16% to 17% range just based on those parameters at this point. Again, we'll give more
guidance as we get into FY 2016, but those numbers right now are still what we would expect, and back to your point,
that should start happening right away here in Q4.

Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Sung from Bernstein.
<Q - Derrick Sung>: ... sitting in. Omar, I wanted to go back to the top line growth profile here, and I think you've
been very clear about what the growth drivers will be kind of from a product category perspective on the Medtronic
side to get you to that mid-single or even above mid-single digit growth in the near future, DCB and the High Power
new launches, et cetera. Could you spend some time talking about your view of the Covidien business now and what do
you see as kind of the key product category growth drivers on the top line that will drive kind of that mid-single, midto
high-single digit growth going forward on that side of the business?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: The question is best answered – next quarter, we're going to have Brian on the call as well and
he can give you a little more specifics. But our initial understanding is the following. Obviously, the two key strategic
tuck-ins are important. Although in the Neurovascular side, it's more for product, Covidien products related growth
driver that we will see. Now aside from that, we see continued strength in Surgical Solutions within Covidien, the
operating room tools. Covidien has a strong position and we see continued growth with actually very modest pricing
pressure, which is like less than we normally see in our other businesses. We also think that some of their newer
technologies, in the early stage technologies also which are just being created, will also have some traction. The
emerging markets in Covidien, especially with their value products that I think the emerging markets will want before
the legacy Medtronic products will have traction, a little longer term because those products are just being developed,
but those are important.
And finally there's a big push, a strategic push, which I'll really let Brian comment on next time or in future calls,
around an acceleration of moving to minimally invasive technologies. And I think this movement from open to MIS is
a pretty big push that will be a focus for the Covidien group. Finally, the procedure growth that we see overall in the
U.S., the sorts of products that Covidien has will benefit most from that, much earlier than the Medtronic products
because they're hospital-based. And the value proposition, like I mentioned several times, is hospital-based. So that's
my attempt at kind of describing some of the areas that we're particularly excited about. But if you can just hold off till
next quarter and you'll hear Brian, and I'm sure you'll get a lot more detail and be more specific about some of these
growth items.
<Q - Derrick Sung>: Sure. That's great. Thanks, Omar. As a follow-up, if I could just follow up on one of the points
that you mentioned there, which is emerging markets, both Medtronic individually and Covidien together. So this
quarter, your emerging market growth kind of improved to 12% from I believe it was 10% or so last quarter. Can you
talk about kind of the pathway to get to mid-single digit EM growth, if not higher? And then in the context of Covidien,
does Covidien give you synergies that could lead to sort of one plus one equals three type benefit on the emerging
market side or do you also kind of view the emerging market side of Covidien as separate, similar to your prior
comments on Covidien where you talked about just sort of trying to preserve growth rather than, initially rather than
look at the synergies, how you see that playing out? Thanks.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Let me take that question. Now first of all, just to get the numbers straight here, I think our
emerging market growth in the last quarter was also around this 12% number. So, but the point is that we're below at
least the 15% benchmark that we set ourselves. And a lot of that – and Covidien's actually in the same range. We'd like
to get this thing up to at least 15% if not higher. That's our goal. I think we have every expectation that we can get
there, and we should have every expectation that we can get there given the opportunity that exists. However, and
we've laid out strategies to, which we achieved, which is channel optimization, public and private partnerships, some
government deals. So there are things that we're doing that'll make this growth sustainable in that range.
The other thing that we're doing which, I think with Covidien will help us enormously, is the diversification within the
emerging markets. Right now, in a legacy Medtronic basis, China represents about 50% of our total emerging markets.
So the whole rate just depends on China going up and down. And China, although we've grown in the double digits in a
sustained fashion, is a market where the distribution channels have to be optimized over time, and there will be pluses
and minuses. And if we can diversify more, that'll help stabilize our emerging market growth to the mid teens, if you
like. With Covidien, China will only be about 30%. We'll have Middle East and Africa and Latin America in particular,
which will be big contributors, a bigger proportion than where it was at legacy Medtronic. So the diversification with

Covidien will help us. And to your point about how do we – are there any real synergy type things with Covidien from
a revenue perspective, we haven't built anything concrete into our thinking today.
But clearly, the scale that Covidien will give us in emerging markets, our joint sales will give us, will allow us to
penetrate into new geographies much more rapidly than we could if we were alone. And that means to countries that
otherwise we wouldn't go to because look, it costs the same to set up an office and all that, whether you're Covidien and
Medtronic together, that size or just Medtronic alone. And so that scale helps us fund going into new geographies. This
also includes going into new regions of existing geographies like China. So I think that's where you'll see the maximum
benefit. The other area that I've also mentioned in the past that we expect to see fairly rapid traction is that through
Covidien, we have an earlier entrée into hospitals because the nature of the products that they sell. And moving those
hospitals, building on those relationships, and taking them to our chronic disease management therapies, because of our
relationship and credibility with them, we expect that that'll accelerate. So we have lots of directional reasons why we
expect emerging markets to be enhanced fairly soon with this merger as opposed to some of the other areas that we've
talked about before.
<Q - Derrick Sung>: That's great. Thank you.
<A - Jeff Warren>: Thanks, Derrick. We have time for one last question.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch from BMO.
<Q - Joanne K. Wuensch>: That's my childhood fearful name. It's Joanne Wuensch from BMO. Quickly, the Reveal
LINQ starts to annualize in the fourth quarter, somewhat tougher comps, but this thing seems to have a ton of
momentum behind it. Should we think of it as sort of the gift that keeps on giving as you push further and further into
patients and grab more and more cardiac rhythm management market share with it?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Certainly, I think of it as the gift that keeps on giving, and I mean, to be fair, if you look at the
patient populations that Mike described, they're still highly underpenetrated in those disease states. So there is a
growth, but obviously, the nature of that growth will be different from the comps that we had last year. But an
expectation that this is a market that is still highly underpenetrated, I think that's just factually true, and we need to
execute to capture that. But, Mike, I'm sure, any more comments on that, Mike?
<A - Michael J. Weinstein>: No, I think as you say, there's plenty of momentum in terms of the penetration rates
going forward. They're low in every one of the three categories that I talked about. Again, we're not going to be looking
at 300% year-over-year growth, but we will be looking at meaningful, especially dollar growth associated with this. But
I think the other point that Omar referenced earlier that's important to keep in mind is this is really helping us with our
device revenue as well, from the standpoint that if you look at syncope patients with Reveal LINQ, we're now treating
about two and a half times as many this past quarter as we did a year ago in the third quarter. And roughly 8% of those
patients will wind up getting a pacemaker or ICD in the first year, and over the three, three and a half year life of a
Reveal LINQ, roughly 20% of those patients will be identified as being appropriate candidates for device therapy. So
this is not only helping us with its own revenue, it's also helping us in terms of getting patients who need these
therapies identified and appropriately treated. And obviously, we'd get differential market share of those patients
because we're the ones who found them.
<Q - Joanne K. Wuensch>: And then my second question has to do with renal denervation. You sort of gave us a
teaser at the beginning of this call starting your IDE shortly, or filing the IDE shortly. What will be different this time
than the last time you worked through the FDA process on the product? Thank you.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Go ahead, Mike.
<A - Michael J. Weinstein>: So actually, a lot will be different. We obviously will be using a different device from
the standpoint that the spiral will be the device of choice. We will be actually ablating in a different location and with a

different protocol. A lot of work went into the study design itself, obviously to see if we could increase the treatment
effect in the treatment arm, which I just referenced on how we plan to do that, lower the effect in the control arm,
which basically we've been working with numerous experts in the field to identify what drug regimens and comparators
should be used, and they will be meaningfully different in this proposed study than what we used before. And
obviously, we're going to be trying to really tighten the variability that we saw in both the treatment and control arms,
and we have a number of ideas in protocol to be able to deal with that. So we are meeting with FDA on a specific
proposal on how we would restart this study. Obviously, it's going to be up to them to accept that protocol, so we still
have work to do. But I think we know what we want to do with the next IDE study, and we will see if we can come to
agreement with the agency on moving forward on it.

Good. Well, thank you. Thank you for all of you – thanks to all of you for your questions. And with that, and on behalf

obviously very excited about the future and we look forward to updating you on our progress in our Q4 call, which, as
Gary mentioned earlier, will be on June 2. And with that, I'd like to say my final words of thanks and have a great day.
