Ryan Weispfenning
Thank you, Maria. Good morning, and welcome to Medtronic's first quarter conference call and webcast. During the
next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Gary Ellis, Medtronic Chief Financial
Officer, will provide comments on the results of our fiscal year 2016 first quarter which ended July 31, 2015. After our
prepared remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions.
First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and
a revenue by division summary. We also updated our combined historical Covidien/Medtronic financial statement
presentation.
You should also note that some of the statements made during this call may be considered forward-looking statements
and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional
information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports filed with the
SEC and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement.

In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on the Investors portion of our
website at medtronic.com.
Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the first quarter
of fiscal year 2015. In addition, unless we say otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates, including revenue
growth ranges given on today's call are adjusted for the extra selling week in the first quarter and given on a
comparable constant currency basis, which adjusts for the negative effect of foreign currency translation and includes
Covidien plc in the prior year comparison, aligning Covidien's prior year monthly revenue to Medtronic's fiscal
quarters. These adjustment details can be found in the reconciliation tables included with our earnings press release. In
addition, all foreign currency translation calculations are done on a comparable basis.
With that, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak.
Omar S. Ishrak
Good morning, and thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone for joining us. This morning, we reported first quarter
revenues of $7.3 billion, which represents growth of 12% at the upper end of our mid-single digit range after adjusting
for the extra selling week in our first quarter. Q1 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.02.
Q1 was another strong quarter where our employees around the world executed and delivered results that were at the
high end of our objectives. The underlying fundamentals for our business remains solid with robust contributions from
all four of our groups. CVG and Diabetes grew in the high single digits while RTG and MITG grew in the mid-single
digits after adjusting the growth rates for the extra selling week this quarter.
From a geographic perspective, our performance in the U.S. was particularly strong with high single-digit revenue
growth again after adjusting for the extra week. Our teams continued to execute on important product launches and our
customers around the world are responding to our differentiated healthcare solutions that seek to demonstrate both
clinical and economic value.
We remain focused on our three growth strategies: therapy innovation, globalization, and economic value. These
strategies aim to create a competitive advantage for Medtronic by capitalizing on three long-term trends we see playing
out in healthcare. Namely, the continued desire to improve clinical outcomes, the growing demand for expanded access
to healthcare and the optimization of cost and efficiency in healthcare systems, including the move to value-based
healthcare. We believe our three growth strategies are the right ones to achieve long-term growth and the resulting
diversification, differentiated approach and competitive advantages will enable us to deliver on our baseline financial
expectations.
We've translated each of our strategies into three independent growth vectors with clearly-stated near-term objectives
for each one. We continue to quantify and communicate our performance against these goals on a regular basis.
In therapy innovation, we delivered above-goal performance again in Q1, with the new therapies growth vector
contributing approximately 1,020 basis points to our total company growth, including the benefit of the extra week. But
even after adjusting for the extra week, this result was well above our goal of 150 basis points to 350 basis points of
growth. We're staying strong [inaudible] (05:10) for new therapies across all groups. In addition, our pipeline remains
full with a number of new therapies and services expected to come to market over the next few years.
In our Cardiac and Vascular Group, the recent launches of our CoreValve Evolut R transcatheter valve, IN.PACT
Admiral drug-coated balloon and Micra Transcatheter Pacing System combined with the continued growth of Reveal
LINQ, as well as the upcoming U.S. launch of Evera MRI ICD are all expected to drive strong growth this fiscal year.
Our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group is driving growth with its differentiated Endo GIA Reinforced Reload and
LigaSure Maryland Jaw and also has a full pipeline of minimally-invasive innovations that are expected to launch over
the coming quarters.

In Restorative Therapies, we are building momentum from new products in Neurovascular such as the Pipeline Flex
device for intracranial aneurysms and Solitaire FR stent thrombectomy device. In RTG's Surgical Technologies
division, a number of new imaging and navigation products are expected to drive growth over the coming quarters. Our
Diabetes Group is realizing growth from its MiniMed 530G and 640G systems and has a number of advancements in
the pipeline as they continue to drive towards an artificial pancreas. Taken together, we feel confident we can deliver
sustained growth from new therapies, contributing significantly to our baseline goal of mid-single digit revenue growth.
Turning to globalization, our emerging markets growth vector contributed approximately 190 basis points to our Q1
total company growth, including the benefit of the extra week. After adjusting for the extra week, this result fell below
our baseline goal of 150 basis points to 200 basis points from emerging market growth vector. This was largely due to a
planned delay in distributor sales in Saudi Arabia in preparation for a channel optimization move. We have a
controlling interest in the newly formed joint venture with our largest distributor in Saudi Arabia. Starting in the second
quarter, this joint venture is expected to deliver incremental revenue and improved margins over our historical
performance in Saudi Arabia.
While the Middle East and Africa region was weaker this quarter owing to the delayed distributor sales, we did see
notable improvements in China, India and Russia. Mainland China grew in the low double digits above our estimated
growth of the China medical device market. Our China results benefited from initial implementation of our channel
optimization strategy in the region, which is focused on transitioning our distribution channel to include consolidated
platform distributors.
We also saw improvements in India, which grew in the mid-teens and Russia, which grew in the upper teens. And over
the long term, we believe strongly that the penetration of existing therapies into emerging markets represents the single
largest opportunity in med tech. In addition to standard market development activities, our differentiated approach of
local channel optimization, government contracts and private partnerships are all aimed at unlocking this opportunity.
Turning to economic value, our services and solutions growth vector contributed approximately 50 basis points to our
growth in Q1 on a legacy Medtronic basis or 30 basis points on an overall Medtronic basis. While this overall result
was below our goal of 40 basis points to 60 basis points, we intend to grow into our goal of services and solutions are
adopted by the legacy Covidien businesses.
In Cath Lab Managed Services, we are generating rapid growth as we are fast becoming the ideal partner for hospitals
that seek to drive operational efficiency. We're now expanding our Cath Lab Managed Services business globally with
new accounts in Eastern Europe, Turkey and Saudi Arabia. Since the program's launch two years ago, we have
completed 59 long-term agreements with hospital systems, representing $1.3 billion in revenue over an average span of
six years. And we have a large number of potential contracts at various stages of negotiation with providers around the
world. In addition, we have now signed the first three Operating Room Managed Services deals in Europe each
spanning nine years; ORMS applied the CLMS business model to an operating room setting, utilizing the breadth of
MITG's products and expertise.
In Diabetes, Q1 was the first full quarter of operating Diabeter, a Netherlands-based diabetes clinic and research center
that we intend to expand across Europe. With the Diabeter and our continued strong progress with partnerships such as
IBM, we continue to transform our Diabetes Group from a market-leading pump and sensor company to a leading
provider of holistic diabetes management solutions that we believe will expand access, integrate care and improve
outcomes so that people living with diabetes can enjoy greater freedom and better health.
We continue to focus on providing solutions to providers that go beyond purely medical devices, including taking a
leadership position in aligning our solutions to new value-based payment models that are merging in healthcare. We
were pleased to see the U.S. Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services proposed bundled payment initiative for hip and
knee replacements. While Medtronic does not participate in hips and knees, CMS may well broaden these bundled
payment initiatives to other care pathways where we do have leadership positions.
Proposals like this from CMS demonstrate that a move to value-based healthcare is underway. The proposal mandates
that participating hospitals be at risk for the cost and quality of a joint replacement surgery and 90 days of post-acute

care. As bundled payments take hold, we expect to offer unique comprehensive solutions to healthcare providers,
encompassing our devices, associated diagnostics and home-based patient monitoring programs all wrapped in
risk-sharing business models.
Next, turning to our integration efforts, the integration of Covidien into Medtronic continues to go extremely well. As
I've mentioned before, we've organized our activities in four clearly defined areas: preserve, optimize, accelerate, and
transform. We've been successfully achieving our first and highest priority, preserve, as evidenced by the continued
revenue growth across all of our groups and geographies. We continue to monitor talent retention and overall employee
satisfaction, both of which remain strong.
Our second priority, optimize, is focused on achieving the expected minimum of $850 million in cost synergies by the
end of FY 2018. As planned, we have already completed over half of our value capture initiatives in the fiscal year and
these savings are expected to build as we go through the year, with an FY 2016 goal of achieving $300 million to $350
million in savings. We're executing on our indirect sourcing plans where we are using best-case contracts and improved
purchasing power to achieve meaningful savings. We're also realizing significant real estate savings, having already
closed over 60 facilities, most of which were redundant field offices or distribution centers.
Our third priority, accelerate, is related to a disciplined process of assessing and prioritizing the numerous revenue
synergy opportunities, which include leveraging the legacy Covidien's Peripheral Vascular sales force to drive sales of
drug-coated balloons and leveraging Covidien's Neurovascular division to enhance our neuroscience strategy in RTG.
In accordance with our plans, we have aligned the sales forces and integrated the back offices expeditiously in both of
these areas, including moving the North American commercial operations of both businesses on to Medtronic's
enterprise system SAP.
Our fourth and final priority is transform. We are positioning the company to play an increasingly larger role in
delivering higher value in healthcare, aligning our solutions to the emerging value-based payment models and
partnering with new stakeholders to lead and succeed in the transforming healthcare marketplace. An early example is
our Operating Room Managed Services initiative in MITG where we take over the management and operations of
hospital operating rooms.
While we had a number of successes in Q1, we also faced some challenges, including underperformance in our U.S.
Core Spine business. Some of our recent product rollouts are taking longer to reach scale, but we're seeking to actively
address our performance through a series of near, medium, and longer-term actions. In the near term, we intend to sign
more large system deals to provide procedural volume share by using our new integrated RTG commercial
organization.
Over the medium term, we will translate our Surgical Synergy initiative into a more specific commercial offering and
focus the efforts of our new integrated commercial organization in promoting it. Over the longer term, we expect to see
the impact of the changes we're making to our product development processes, which include incorporating several
methods that have been successful in other parts of the company.
Turning to the P&L, Q1 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.02. Foreign currency translation continues to be
a significant headwind affecting our Q1 EPS by $0.13 to $0.14. On a constant currency basis, our non-GAAP diluted
EPS growth represented over 400 basis points of leverage, above our baseline expectation of 200 basis points to 400
basis points.
We delivered $1.1 billion of free cash flow in Q1 after adjusting for certain litigation payments and nonrecurring tax
payments. We remain disciplined in allocating our capital with a focus on creating long-term shareholder value. As a
result of the Covidien acquisition, we have increased ability to deploy our cash in the U.S., solidifying our commitment
to return 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders.
In June, we announced a 25% increase in our dividend, our 38th consecutive year of increasing our dividend. We
expect to not only grow our dividend over time with earnings growth, but increase our dividend payout ratio to 40% on
a non-GAAP basis within the next few years. As an S&P Dividend Aristocrat, we remain focused on delivering
dependable long-term dividend growth.

In addition, we remain disciplined when evaluating potential M&A opportunities. Any investment we must make – any
investment we make must be aligned with and ultimately strengthen one or more of our three growth strategies, while
at the same time offer high return metrics and minimize near-term shareholder dilution.
Gary will now take you through a more detailed look at our first quarter results. Gary?
Gary Lee Ellis
Thanks, Omar. First quarter revenue of $7.274 billion increased 70% as reported, 12% on a comparable constant
currency basis after adjusting for a $529 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency and including the favorable
impact from the extra week, or at the upper end of the mid-single-digit range after adjusting for the extra week.
Our first quarter results included an extra week due to our 52-week, 53-week fiscal year. While the exact benefit of the
extra week is difficult to estimate, based on our analysis, we calculate that it added approximately 6 percentage points
of growth on the quarter, or approximately 1.5 percentage points of growth for the full fiscal year. Legacy acquisitions
and divestitures from both Medtronic and Covidien contributed 30 basis points net to Q1 growth.
Q1 diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis were $1.02, an increase of 3%. Q1 GAAP diluted earnings per
share were $0.57, a decrease of 34%. In addition to the $372 million after-tax adjustment for amortization expense, this
quarter had several GAAP to non-GAAP after-tax adjustments primarily related to the Covidien transaction, a $165
million charge related to amortization of the remaining inventory purchase price step-up, a $53 million charge for
acquisition related items and a $52 million net restructuring charge.
Our Cardiac and Vascular Group, which accounted for 35% of our total company revenue, grew in the high single
digits. This was a result of strong low double-digit growth in Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure, and mid-single digit
growth in both Coronary & Structural Heart and Aortic & Peripheral Vascular divisions. Cardiac Rhythm & Heart
Failure, or CRHF, had strong above market low double-digit growth again in Q1. We estimate the overall CRHF
market continues to grow in the low to mid-single digits.
The market is showing strong preference for our leading differentiated technologies, including our Viva XT CRT-D
with its AdaptivCRT algorithm and Attain Performa Quadripolar Lead, the Arctic Front Advance CryoAblation
System, the Evera MRI ICD in Japan, and Reveal LINQ insertable cardiac monitor in the U.S. and Europe. Strong
demand for our Reveal LINQ resulted in diagnostics growth in the high 20%s, and is also resulting in meaningful
pacemaker pull through. In Europe, the launch of our premium Micra Transcatheter Pacing System is off to a great
start. Micra is one-tenth the size of a traditional pacemaker and is placed directly inside the heart.
Looking ahead, the robust productivity of our CRHF pipeline will continue as we expect to launch the Evera MRI ICD
in the U.S. imminently. In addition, the MRI safe version of Viva CRT-D in the U.S. and Europe, the full market
release of the Arctic Front Advance CryoAblation System in Japan, and the full market release of the third-generation
Arctic Front ST Cryoballoon in Europe are all expected by the end of this fiscal year.
Coronary & Structural Heart, or CSH, grew in the mid-single digits driven by growth in transcatheter heart valves,
drug-eluting stents and balloons. Transcatheter heart valves grew in the low 30%s globally and in the high 30%s in the
U.S. In Q1, we received U.S. FDA approval for Evolut R, the first and only recapturable heart valve in the U.S. and the
first commercial implant started late in the quarter. Our team is focused on training U.S. centers on this next-generation
valve with its differentiated 14 French equivalent delivery catheter, and we expect to be in all of our current U.S.
accounts by the end of the calendar year. In Europe, Evolut R is driving strong growth, helping us gain share in
Western Europe, and we estimate we now hold the number one TAVR position in 11 European countries.
In Japan, we received PMDA approval for CoreValve and are anticipating reimbursement approval [audio gap] (21:28)
in our third quarter. Last week, we announced that we have entered into an agreement to acquire Twelve, a
development stage company that is executing first in human clinical evaluations of a unique transcatheter mitral valve
replacement design that we believe represents leadership technology in this space and accelerates our time to market in

this important new growth area.
In drug-eluting stents, we grew in the low single digits and are holding global share on the strength of Resolute Onyx in
CE Mark countries and Resolute Integrity in the U.S. It is worth noting that we continue to grow our U.S. DES share as
an increasing percentage of our U.S. DES sales are included in multiline CVG customer agreements that leverage our
broad cardiology product lines, the innovative therapies, and wrap around programs and services.
In Q1, we also commenced enrollment in two important clinical trials, our first in human trial for our Drug-Filled Stent
and our SPYRAL HTN off- and on med-study in renal denervation.
In Aortic & Peripheral Vascular division, or APV, revenue grew in the mid-single digits with low double-digit growth
in Peripheral Vascular partially offset by low single-digit declines in Aortic. And in Peripheral, we continue to execute
a strong U.S. launch of our IN.PACT Admiral drug-coated balloon and maintain our leading market position on the
strength of our exceptional clinical data. Q1 was the first full quarter of launch utilizing our combined Medtronic and
legacy Covidien peripheral sales force. We expect to file for expanded indications for IN.PACT Admiral with a PMAs
U.S. filing in the second half of this fiscal year for in-stent restenosis indication, as well as a CE Mark filing by the end
of this fiscal year for an AV fistula indication.
In atherectomy, we continue to see strong growth in new accounts from our HawkOne 7-French directional
atherectomy system, which has helped us stabilize share and see share gains above the knee. Last month, we started the
U.S. launch of the Entrust delivery system, which is used to place our EverFlex self-expanding peripheral stent.
In our Aortic business, while we faced increased competitive pressure outside the U.S. and felt the impact of market
reimbursement cuts in Japan, the business grew in the U.S., driven by the continued market adoption of our Endurant
IIs AAA Stent Graft, which resulted in sequential share gains.
During the quarter, our Aortic business announced a number of important developments in both its organic and
inorganic product pipeline, including first implants of our next generation Endurant Evo AAA stent graft platform,
initiation of a U.S. feasibility clinical study for the Valiant LSA branch thoracic stent graft platform, acquisition of the
Aptus emulating product line, and the initiation of a joint development and staged acquisition agreement with Arsenal
Medical to commercialize the company's novel aneurysmal sac filling foam technology in AAA stent graft [ph] gene
(24:46) applications.
Now, turning to our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group, revenue grew in the mid-single digits and accounted for 34%
of the total company revenue. MITG's revenue performance was driven by a high single-digit growth in Surgical
Solutions and low single-digit growth in Patient Monitoring & Recovery. The group benefited from strength in surgical
volumes in the U.S., which has been occurring now for the past three quarters. Surgical Solutions grew in the high
single digits with high single digit growth in Advanced Surgical, low single digit growth in General Surgical, as well as
low double-digit growth in Early Technologies.
Advanced Surgical strong quarter was driven by balanced low double-digit growth in both Advanced Stapling and
Advanced Energy as the business benefited from new products, the continued trend of surgical procedures moving
from open to minimally invasive, and the underlying strength of surgical volumes in the U.S.
Early Technologies was driven by strong growth in GI Solutions and Interventional Lung Solutions. Patient Monitoring
& Recovery grew in the low single digits. Respiratory & Patient Monitoring, Nursing Care and Patient Care & Safety,
all grew in the low single digits. Respiratory & Patient Monitoring growth was driven by strong U.S. patient
monitoring sales. Nursing Care had strong sales in the enteral feeding.
Now moving to our Restorative Therapies Group. Revenue grew in the mid-single digits and accounted for 25% of
total company revenue. Results were driven by mid-20%s growth in Neurovascular and high single-digit growth in
Surgical Technologies, with low single-digit growth in Spine and Neuromodulation. Spine grew in the low single
digits, in line with the global market. However, in the U.S., our Core Spine business underperformed the market. We
recently realigned our RTG commercial sales management, and we expect these changes to result in better alignment of
incentives and an improved focus on cross-selling in our Surgical Synergy program, which integrates our spine

implants and Surgical Technologies imaging and navigation equipment.
We also expect the Core Spine business to improve as its numerous recent and upcoming product launches reach scale,
including our Elevate expandable cage and SOLERA VOYAGER System in thoracolumbar, as well as our
DIVERGENCE Stand Alone Interbody Cage, the ZEVO Anterior Cervical Plate System, the PRESTIGE LP Cervical
Disc and the ANATOMIC PEEK PTC interbody spacer in cervical.
In Neuromodulation, revenue increased in the low single digits, driven by mid-single-digit growth in Gastro and Uro
and DBS, and low single digit growth in Pain Stim. Our U.S. Pain Stim business grew in the mid-single digits, in line
with the market. In pumps for pain and spasticity, we have implemented the required changes to the distribution
processes and are executing against our commitments under the consent decree we received in late April. Following an
initial decline in SynchroMed II implants, we saw stabilization in the back half of the quarter.
In Surgical Technologies, revenue grew in the high single digits, driven by mid-teens growth in Advanced Energy, high
single-digit growth in Neurosurgery, and mid-single-digit growth in ENT. Surgical Technologies continues to benefit
from diversified growth coming from disposables, service revenue, and a strong adoption of new products, including
the Straightshot M5 Microdebrider and NuVent sinus balloon.
Our Neurovascular division posted strong revenue growth in the mid-twenties. New products such as our Pipeline Flex
device for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms and Solitaire FR 4x40 Revascularization Device for stent
thrombectomy are driving solid double-digit growth in flow diversion and stents.
We are also seeing increased pull through of our neurovascular access products given the strength of Pipeline and
Solitaire. Earlier this week, we acquired Medina Medical and its aneurysm embolization mesh technology for
hemorrhagic stroke, which we believe can disrupt the coil market.
Now moving to our Diabetes Group. Revenue grew in the high single-digits and accounted for 6% of total company
sales. Low double-digit growth in Intensive Insulin Management division was driven by continued strong adoption in
the U.S. of the MiniMed 530G insulin pump system with the Enlite CGM sensor. Growth was also driven by the
continued international launch of the next generation MiniMed 640G insulin pump system with enhanced Enlite CGM
sensor. We continue to make progress at bringing this technology to the U.S., and plan to submit the PMA for this
system to the FDA later this calendar year.
In our Non-Intensive Diabetes Therapies division, revenue growth in the high 60%s was driven by sales of Professional
CGM and infusion ports for type 2 diabetes. In our Diabetes Services & Solutions division, high single-digit growth
was driven by strong consumables sales in the U.S.
Our Diabetes Group announced several new partnerships in the quarter, including Samsung, Becton, Dickinson and
Glooko. We also received the FDA approval in Q1 for the MiniMed Connect, which allows users to view their insulin
pump and CGM data on a smartphone and provides remote monitoring and text message notifications for their
caregivers. This product is expected to launch in the second quarter.
Turning to the rest of the income statement, after adjusting for certain non-GAAP items mentioned earlier, the Q1
operating margin was 27.2%, which included a 110 basis point negative impact from foreign currency. On a
comparable constant currency basis, this represents a 40 basis point improvement in operating margins versus the prior
year, reflecting a relatively stable gross margin, a 110 basis point improvement in SG&A expense as a percent of sales,
and a negative 60 basis point change in net other expense due to one-time items all on a comparable constant currency
basis.
Included in the Q1 operating margin were non-GAAP gross margin, SG&A as a percent of sales and R&D as a percent
of sales of 69.3%, 33.7% and 7.7%, respectively. It is worth noting that the non-GAAP gross margin, SG&A and R&D
were negatively affected by 130 basis points, 30 basis points, and 40 basis points from foreign currency, respectively.
Also included in the operating margin was net other expense of $61 million, including net gains from our hedging
program of $64 million. We hedged the majority of our operating results in developed market currencies to reduce the
volatility in our earnings from foreign exchange. In addition, a growing portion of our profits are unhedged, especially

emerging market currencies which can create some modest volatility in our earnings.
Assuming current exchange rates for the remainder of the fiscal year, which includes [ph] $1.12 euro and ¥1.22
(32:19), we expect the FY 2016 net other expense to be in the range of $185 million to $235 million, which includes an
expected impact on the U.S. medical device tax of approximately $210 million. For Q2 FY 2016, we expect net other
expense to be in the range of $55 million to $65 million based on the previously mentioned exchange rates.
Overall, we continue to expect the full year FY 2016 operating margin to be in the range of 28% to 29% on an
as-reported basis, which includes over 100 basis points of margin improvement on a comparable constant currency
basis offset by a similar amount of negative FX impact. This results in approximately 400 basis points of operating
leverage on a comparable constant currency basis related to the cost synergies, which are the majority of where – which
are now expected in SG&A as a result of the Covidien acquisition, as well as the continued execution on the legacy
leverage initiatives of both Covidien and Medtronic. We continue to expect operating margins in the first half of the
year to be below the full year range, improving in the back half of the year as the foreign exchange headwinds lessen
and cost synergies accelerate.
Below the operating profit line, Q1 net interest expense was $191 million, a significant increase from the prior year
comparable quarter but consistent with Q4 FY 2015 as we are including the incremental interest expense from our
December 2014 $17 billion bond offering. At the end of Q1, we had approximately $18 billion in cash and investments
and $35.6 billion in debt.
Based on current rates, we would expect Q2 net interest expense to be in the range of $175 million to $185 million. Our
non-GAAP nominal tax rate on a cash basis in Q1 was 18.1%. On a full year basis, we continue to expect our FY 2016
non-GAAP nominal tax rate on a cash basis to be in the range of 16% to 18% and we expect to be at the higher end of
this range until the presently expired U.S. R&D tax credit is reinstated.
In Q1, free cash flow was $592 million, which includes $92 million of certain litigation payments as well as $407
million of non-recurring tax payments that primarily relate to an IRS settlement. We remain committed to returning
50% of our free cash flow excluding onetime items to shareholders and then also continue to target an A credit profile.
In Q1, we repurchased $750 million of our ordinary shares and paid $538 million in dividends.
As of the end of Q1, we had remaining authorization to repurchase approximately 100 million shares. First quarter
average daily shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1.436 billion shares. For FY 2016, we continue to expect
diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be in the range of 1.433 billion to 1.437 billion shares including
approximately 1.433 billion shares in Q2.
Let me conclude by providing our fiscal year 2016 revenue outlook and earnings per share guidance. We continue to
believe that full year revenue growth in the range of 4% to 6% on a comparable constant currency basis plus the
incremental approximate 150 basis point benefit from our Q1 extra selling week remains reasonable. This operational
revenue growth expectation is consistent with our stated baseline financial goal of consistently delivering mid-single
digit revenue growth. Our revenue outlook assumes CVG, MITG and RTG grow in the mid-single digits and Diabetes
grows in the upper single to low double-digit range all on a comparable constant currency basis and including the
benefit of the extra week.
While we cannot predict the impact of currency movements, to give you a sense of the FX impact if exchange rates
were to remain similar to the beginning of this week for the remainder of the fiscal year, then our FY 2016 revenue
would be negatively affected by approximately $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion including a negative $425 million to $475
million impacting Q2.
Turning to guidance on the bottom line, we continue to expect cash earnings per share in the range of $4.30 to $4.40,
which includes an expected $0.40 to $0.50 negative foreign currency impact based on current exchange rates and
approximately $300 million to $350 million of targeted value capture synergies from the Covidien acquisition.
As you think about your FY 2016 models and quarterly gating, it is worth noting again that a higher percentage of the
negative FX impact is in the first half of the year, while more of the value capture synergies occur later in the fiscal

year. While we don't give quarterly earnings per share guidance, I would note that Q1 and Q2 are often similar. But this
year, Q1 profitability was favorably affected from the extra week, and thus we would expect Street models to adjust Q2
down a few pennies from Q1. As in the past, my comments on guidance do not include any unusual charges or gains
that might occur during the fiscal year.
I will now turn it back over to Omar.
Omar S. Ishrak
Thanks, Gary. And before opening the lines for Q&A, I'd like to briefly conclude by reiterating that Q1 was a strong
quarter and we feel good about the remainder of the fiscal year. We remain focused on reliably delivering in our
baseline financial model, mid-single digit constant currency revenue growth, EPS growth of 200 basis points to 400
basis points faster than revenue on a constant currency basis and returning 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders.
As the world continues to move towards value-based healthcare, Medtronic is well positioned to provide medical
technology solutions that improve outcomes while lowering costs. In fact, using biomedical engineering to improve
outcomes is the essence of the Medtronic mission that our founder, Earl Bakken, drafted 55 years ago to alleviate pain,
restore health, and extend life. This is something I'm extremely passionate about and dedicated to as our more than
85,000 employees.
We're confident that our three growth strategies – therapy innovation, globalization, and economic value – are the
appropriate strategies to achieve our mission. The focus on these three strategies is expected to result in both revenue
diversification and sustained revenue growth. We expect to further leverage this revenue growth with our productivity
initiatives which have been significantly improved by our transformational acquisition of Covidien.
We expect to deliver consistent and reliable results, which when combined with our solid underlying fundamentals,
strong secular growth drivers, and disciplined capital allocation will enable us to create long term dependable value in
healthcare.
With that, we will now open the phone lines for Q&A. In addition to Gary, Geoff Martha, who recently replaced Chris
O'Connell as the President of our – the Restorative Therapies Group is here. Geoff is a proven leader who was held –
who has had responsibility for developing Medtronic's growth strategies, executing the Covidien transaction, and
overseeing the integration. And I'm confident in his ability to leverage the opportunities within RTG.
Also joining us today to answer your questions is Mike Coyle, President of our Cardiac and Vascular Group; Bryan
Hanson, President of our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group; Hooman Hakami, President of our Diabetes Group; and
also given the growing importance of our Cath Lab Managed Services business, Rob ten Hoedt, President of our
Europe, Middle East and Africa region is also present.
We're rarely able to get to everyone's questions, so please limit yourself to only one question and one follow-up. If you

<Q - David Ryan Lewis>: Just a quick question for Omar, then one for Gary. Omar, just your business momentum has
been very, very strong and that continued obviously in this quarter. You've always talked about 4% to 6%. I guess on a
go-forward basis, what's now providing you – as you look about the product portfolio, what gives you that confidence
in that 4% to 6% range? And what has to go right to continue deliver on the upper end of that range over the next
several quarters given some of your larger products are beginning to anniversary or the comps are getting more
challenging?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Well, we think that we've got a pipeline of new products coming out that will replace the
products that are lapping in growth. And besides some of them have continued momentum even after the anniversary
period, like the transcatheter valve where the market continues to grow. But as I pointed out in almost every group – in
every group, we have a very strong pipeline of products coming out all the way from our Diabetes team to RTG,
Minimally Invasive, CVG, all of them have several new products in the pipeline. So we see these new therapies
momentum continuing.
And in addition, I'm looking to supplement that with significant growth from both emerging markets as well as services
and solutions, which kind of diversify our sources of revenue and can contain any surprises that may come up. And so
we think that that range is a pretty reliable range and after the acquisition of Covidien it's given us even more
diversification.
<Q - David Ryan Lewis>: Okay. So the upper end of the range, Omar, is not necessarily out of contention here even
over the next several quarters.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Well, I say the whole range, but you're right. I mean the momentum right now suggests that
the upper end of the range is the place to go but the range is there for a reason. And so, it's – we're going to stick to the
mid-single digit range and we'll do everything we can to get to the upper end of the range.
And given our momentum, especially with new therapies and given the fact that in both services and solutions and
emerging markets, we expect our momentum to actually pick up in the back half of the year, there's a good possibility
we could drive the higher end but the range, like I said, is there for a reason.
<Q - David Ryan Lewis>: Okay. Omar, very clear. Thank you. And then, Gary, just one comment on the quarter.
Obviously, revenue momentum very strong. You had the extra selling week. I think there – some are saying in this
particular quarter with the extra selling week, there could've been more leverage to the bottom line.
Gross margins were fine. There were some – it looks like some discretionary spending; obviously, some currency.
Could you just give us a sense of why we wouldn't have seen more upside in the first quarter and how we're tracking
versus some of the Covidien synergies? We talked about the $850 million number; I think there's an expectation that
number could have upside. So sort of this quarter relative to the extra selling week, we're obviously not more
leveraged. And how are you feeling about potential upsides to the Covidien synergy number as we progress through the
balance of the year? Thank you.
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Yeah, David. I think you addressed kind of why we – you didn't see quite as much of it hitting
the bottom line here in Q1. I mean, overall, obviously we saw very strong growth both on the top line and we feel good
about where we ended up on the bottom line, but there's obviously a lot of headwinds. I mean, the majority – the
biggest one being obviously the foreign exchange. As we've highlighted, foreign exchange especially in Q1, but Q1 and
Q2 is probably at the peak here in these next couple of quarters and we clearly saw that in Q1 and we think that'll
probably become a little bit less as we go through the year.
In addition, the synergies are occurring basically as exactly as we expected. And when you think back, to your point,
we're probably a little bit ahead of schedule on achieving the overall synergies that we've laid out. But we always knew
that a majority of those were going to be back-end loaded in the quarter – or, excuse me, in the year because it just
takes time for [ph] physicians (45:05)to be consolidated. We're having to pull together two different companies. There's
a lot of investments being made as we do that.

And so we knew that the synergies – we have no expectation that we won't meet or exceed the $850 million that we've
laid out as an organization. We're well on our way towards that schedule. But we knew from a timing perspective that
that's a little bit more in the back end of the year, as you would expect and so, we weren't getting as much benefit here
obviously in Q1 to offset some of the foreign exchange issues.
So in our view, yes, you might have expected a little bit more to the bottom line especially on the strength of the
revenue growth, but there's a lot of moving parts that we're still dealing with here as we pull these two companies
together. And everything is on schedule, everything is going as we would expect, but timing is also as we expected and
we expected there'd be a little bit less in Q1 and improving as we go through the fiscal year.

Our next question comes from Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Thank you, guys, and congratulations again on the quarter. Let me focus, if I can, on
couple businesses. One I wanted to touch on was Neurovascular, which you said grew mid 20%s and obviously is
accelerated on the back of the stroke trials that came out over the past year. Can you just talk about how you see that
market for stroke developing and the implications versus sustainability of the recent performance?
And then second, if you can give us any more insight into the upside performance within CRM. How much of that
came from Reveal LINQ, which has obviously been a big driver the last few quarters versus kind of the underlying
base CRM business, the ICD market, the pacemaker market?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: I'm going to give you a little overview and then I'll ask Geoff and then Mike to help out with
more details here. I think, Mike, from my overall perspective, the stroke market is one of our biggest opportunities and
we're very excited about it. We think we're in the early phases of penetration with our new therapies and so we expect
the momentum just from the therapy itself to continue.
But looking into the future, we're looking at the entire stroke care pathway more carefully and we've got other products
that are also impacting the stroke disease area, which we expect will have some level of pull-through from our presence
in the stroke market. But beyond that, I think both Geoff and Mike can add more color to that and certainly Mike can
add color to the CRM question. So Geoff, do you want to start?
<A - Geoffrey Straub Martha>: Yeah, sure. I mean, we're seeing a lot of the growth in the last quarter come from the
ischemic stroke market here and thrombectomy, and we see that market continuing to grow worldwide in the 25% to
30% range and in the U.S., even a little higher than that. And obviously, the growth that's coming now in the stroke
intervention piece here is from the clinical evidence that's come out recently. And we see a number of barriers though
that – and that's driving a lot of growth.
And there are a number of barriers though that we're working on that I'd like to comment on. One is the diagnostics
space and I'm going to let Mike comment on that and we're – because there's a play there for our diagnostics in his area.
But then there's others like the ER physician education, EMS routing, some focus on neurologists, and these are areas
that in addition to the intervention, we're focused on all of those areas with our team out of Irvine. And so we're feeling
very good about it.
You saw in the hemorrhagic space, that's all ischemic. You saw we did this Medina acquisition, which is around mesh
coils which should help us in the hemorrhagic space where we're not leading right now, and we think this will help us
in a big way there as well. So we feel very bullish about it just based on the clinical data, but there's a lot of other levers
that we're working on like you mentioned. And maybe, Mike, if you want to comment on the diagnostics piece.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Yeah. And broadly, Mike, your vision on stroke and then go onto the CRM question.

<A - Michael J. Coyle>: Sure. I think you asked about CRM growth and one of the drivers is certainly LINQ in stroke,
in cryptogenic stroke. In fact, the size of the revenue contribution of LINQ just in the cryptogenic stroke indication is
very similar to the size of the Solitaire contribution in the stent thrombectomy area so – and we're the only company
that has a complete now profile of both diagnostic and therapeutic devices to treat ischemic stroke. So we view this as
one of the largest opportunities within the company.
Broadly speaking on Cardiac Rhythm in general, we have modestly better market conditions and we're taking share
virtually all of the segments that we participate in. So first, obviously, LINQ has now fully anniversaried its
introduction which occurred in the fourth quarter of last year. So it's encouraging to see that continued growth
momentum in syncope as well as in atrial fibrillation monitoring and so it continues to be a strong driver.
In addition, especially in syncope, which is more than half of the uses of the product, we get pacemaker pull-through
from that. Roughly 8% to 9% of those patients will wind up having a pacing indication in the first year that results in a
pacemaker. And over the three-year life of the device, we typically would expect to see that 20% of those patients
becoming indicated for pacemakers, which is driving new, obviously, market growth for us and we're capturing
virtually all of that share of new pacemakers.
In the ICD market, we've seen modestly improved conditions mid-single digit growth in initial implants, which is very
encouraging which obviously we're benefiting from, but also from share obviously from the Attain Performa product
line in CRT-D segment, as well as the MRI-safe Evera product line in Japan where we're seeing some very nice
growth.
And then, of course, in the AF segment, we continue to grow well above the market with our CryoAblation
technologies really becoming sort of the preferred intervention for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation ablation. So all of those
are driving growth for us, including things like TYRX in the [ph] anti-infective count (51:37). So those items are all
contributing to improvement to the market conditions and improvement in our share position.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Can I ask one quick follow-up for Omar and Gary? If I think about the time period since
the Covidien acquisition, you've made a number of small, call it, technology pipeline acquisitions. I think I can count 8
to 10 just off the top of my head. Can you just talk about the cumulative dilution from all these really small
acquisitions? I mean, Twelve is not that small but Medina, in RF Surgical and all these other ones, what's the
incremental dilution from that that you're absorbing in your FY 2016 guidance? Thanks.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Well, first of all, the way we look at this is that the business units themselves make product
trade-offs and several of them, we kind of cancel existing program to cover for us. So the first responsibility to cover
the division actually goes right down to the business units and there, yeah, there's a real savings. And then as we go up,
we cover it in a group and then we cover it at a corporate level and through that, we kind of cover the whole division.
The actual amount – I don't know, Gary, do you have a sense of how much that is? I mean...
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: No. I mean, Mike, as far as the – we're having to add it up myself to say what is it we're
covering because back to Omar's point, most of this is being either covered by the business unit or the group as they go
forward with this. There are several – the small technology acquisitions that you mentioned where there's actually
existing...
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Some revenue.
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: ...revenue, et cetera that there's almost no dilution and would be neutral and it's highly positive.
Some of the more technology-based that are going to have more of an impact from the standpoint of more clinical trials
like Twelve, for example, the transcatheter mitral, that will have more a dilution impact but, yeah, that will be out
basically – Michael and his team will view them as an R&D program and they'll cover that in their R&D basically
budget as they move forward.
So I haven't even added up myself as far as that. It's sad but it's [audio gap] (53:41) us being focused this discipline and
saying if we do these types of acquisitions, we've got to cover that. If it is dilutive to the company, which some of them

<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Thanks. Okay.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Next question.
Operator
Our next question comes from David Roman of Goldman Sachs.
<Q - David Harrison Roman>: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I want to maybe just start with Spine, given
the management change that occurred over the course of the quarter. And maybe Omar and team, if you go in just a
little bit more detail and helping us understand the progression to turning that business around and what specific factors
will influence an acceleration from that business and when you think we can get back to sort of a market growth-type
rate in the core franchise?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: I'll let Geoff add depth to the answer here. Look, my expectation is that getting back to the
core growth can be soon enough, so we want to get there as quickly as possible. And I think we're taking aggressive
action, especially in the near term to do with the way in which we're leveraging our integrated sales force with our
products and the way we're kind of grouping these products together much more aggressively than before to make a
difference in these accounts. In the midterm, we'll drive more technological synergy through Surgical Synergy, and
we've got a sales force position for that. And longer-term, we're addressing some of the speed-to-market issues in our
product development area, which we are addressing right now. But they take a little time to come through the product
itself. Geoff, please add to that.
<A - Geoffrey Straub Martha>: Yeah, sure. Sure, David. First, two macro comments, one, losing – being a shared
donor in Core Spine in the U.S. is not acceptable to us, and we have a real sense of urgency around turning that around.
So that's number one, and the team is committed to that. Number two, we're making some tangible changes in the
Restorative Therapies Group. And the biggest one, I'd say, is managing it as an integrated group versus a holding
company with a series of business units underneath. And when you do that, this also allows us to leverage our breadth
to differentiate and drive growth in very targeted areas, which I'll get to in a second. But the biggest beneficiary of this
change, I believe, will be our Spine business globally, in the U.S. especially.
So some of the changes – some of the specific impacts were, one, we've moved to an integrated sales force in the U.S.
and in Europe, and that is enabling us to do some much more efficient health system wide selling. In our case, we can
combine some capital equipment from our Surgical Technologies business, navigation and imaging in with our Spine
products. And so that's helping a lot. And then more specifically, enables us to drive the Surgical Synergy concept. And
this is where navigated procedures in Spine, using nav, using our imaging, and driving that to more of a standard of
care.
So there are several components of that. And again, Spine will benefit from this, a tighter technology integration
between our nav and imaging technology with our Spine implants and instruments, and an R&D roadmap based off the
Surgical Synergy offering versus just an R&D roadmap that's independent Spine and independent Surgical
Technologies. We can get to one rep in the cases versus having a ST rep in there and a Spine rep. We're developing and
putting together, more robust clinical and economic data, and just really trying to drive the Surgical Synergy strategy as
a standard of care. And today, we estimate only 14% of Core Spine procedures are navigated. So we see a lot of upside
here, and a lot of it is driven by working much closer together with our Spine and our Surgical Technologies business.
And then finally, we've got just a laser focus on just improving our innovation cycles in Spine, the speed and the
impact. And I don't want to pull any punches, we've – we're not as fast as we need to be, and that's another contributor
to some of these other players gaining share on us. And this is something that we're focused on, at the Spine level, at

the RTG level, and also pulling in some broader Medtronic resources to improve the speed and effectiveness of our
innovation cycles in Spine. So we feel like we've got a lot of levers to pull here and we're focused on it, and so I just
laid out some short, medium and longer-term. I think the innovation cycles, you won't feel that for a couple of quarters,
but the other stuff, the other initiatives, the integrated selling and surgical synergy, you should feel in the more near
medium-term.
<Q - David Harrison Roman>: Okay, that's good perspective, Geoff. Thank you. And then maybe just following up
on that, Omar or Gary, anybody could talk about some of the parallels that may exist between this selling model and
what you've been able to realize on the cardiology side of the business, because I think in your prepared remarks, you
talked about an increased number of stents, for example, being on broader product line contract sales. And if you look
at your performance in those businesses, clearly, you're benefiting from the breadth of product lines that you have to
offer. Are there any parallels that you could draw between that experience and the Spine/imaging navigation side of the
business that may give us more confidence in sort of the success of the strategy on the Spine side of the business?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Yes. Look, I can give you the strategy very well. That's exactly it. I think our new-term
strategy is exactly what you described, that we've learned from our CVG experience that putting an integrated sales
force together with a complete suite of products with specialists in the field can drive, and some aggressive contracting
based on that, can drive pretty quick growth in sales and capture good accounts. And we really haven't done that in
Spine because the sales forces have never really been put together. There have been informal contacts, but it's not the
same as organizationally being integrated. And I think that's one of the things that we have done in the last three
months to four months, and we're absolutely going to leverage as we go forward. And so the CVG parallel is a good
one.
<A - Geoffrey Straub Martha>: This is Geoff. Just to build on that, I mean, I'm not ashamed to say that we're
definitely looking at the playbook that Mike Coyle and the CVG team has followed over the last four plus years. And
we definitely are getting a lot of our confidence and inspiration from that. And then don't overlook MITG either,
because they've done a lot of this over the last couple of years as they compete against a J&J. And so I think we have
two parallels to look at that aren't exactly the same, but we're drawing lessons from both of those and have already
taken steps. And then finally, one advantage we have that even CVG – no offense, Mike – doesn't have is we have real
technology integration between the navigation and imaging, and the power tools and the implants.
So there's real technology integration there to drive procedural innovation that not only gets at economic outcomes,
could you do these procedures more efficiently and faster, but also clinical outcomes. We need to do a better job of
developing that data and getting it out there, because once surgeons try this, they really like it. And we – and some –
and there's a lot of surgeons, in particularly in Spine, that are more experienced and sometimes they say, hey, look, I
don't need this. But once they try it, typically, they don't want to go back to do an unnavigated. So we feel very good
about that, and we just have to really focus on this more over the next couple of quarters.
<Q - David Harrison Roman>: Okay. Great.

Our next question comes from the line of Robert Hopkins of Bank of America.
<Q - Robert Adam Hopkins>: Thanks, and good morning. So want to start out first with Omar. I was wondering if
you could just elaborate a little bit on your comments on emerging markets since it's so topical. And so I guess my
question is, just specifically, what was the growth in emerging markets for Medtronic? And was Middle East and
Africa the only area where you saw a slowdown? And then I was just wondering if you could comment generally on
your confidence in the near and intermediate term that emerging market growth can continue.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Well, first, I'm very confident. In fact, the Middle East and Africa was really the only region
which was significantly impacted because of the reasons that I stated, because of the distributor sales. I mean, the

underlying operational performance was fine, and we expect that to bounce back this very quarter. I think Latin
America was a little softer than we'd like, but the other regions were much stronger than they've been historically. And
then in particular, I know that's in everyone's mind here, we were actually quite pleased with what we saw in China.
We had low double-digit growth in China, which actually is better than what we've been seeing in most quarters last
year. We feel that we've outperformed the overall market, although the med device market was reasonably strong. We
did outperform it, but the underlying market was quite robust.
We feel at this stage with what we know and what we can – intelligence that we can get from our own people and the
market itself, we feel pretty good that we can continue this and, in fact, accelerate it in the back half because we'll get
some tailwind out of the Middle East, and China seems to be okay, at least from what we can see. Latin America
maybe a little more pressured, but China seems strong, India is definitely coming back. Russia is definitely really
strong, Southeast Asia is also well into the teens in growth. And so we've got every reason to believe that with our
diversified position right now, we have a right to expect sort of double-digit growth out of emerging markets. And I
haven't given up, like I said earlier, on the objective of high double digits because I think that's what we're entitled to.
We've just got to find a way to unlock it.
<Q - Robert Adam Hopkins>: Great. That's very helpful. And then for my second question, I think I heard mentioned
that Bryan was on the line, and so I want to ask a question about...
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Yes.
<Q - Robert Adam Hopkins>: ...Covidien's businesses, both this quarter and how they've been trending just especially
on the kind of the core general surgery markets of energy and stapling. Just some thoughts on how the legacy Covidien
business is doing, and specifically energy and stapling, in the quarter and recent trends.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Go ahead, Bryan, yeah.
<A - Bryan Hanson>: Hey, Bob. It's good to hear from you. Yeah, so, so far, so good right? We've been able to stay
focused on the business, we've been able to continue to perform as part of Medtronic as we have in the past. I feel
really good about the new products that we've launched, Omar mentioned a couple, but we have a whole family of
products in Advanced Stapling and Advanced Energy, they are doing quite well for us. And of course, as you know,
Bob, we're not going to sit and wait for those to continue, we've got others coming behind them. So I see the
momentum in surgery, in particular in the U.S., elevating just because you see more surgical procedures. But I also see
that shift from open procedures to MIS. And that's creating momentum not just for us, but really, for all players in the
surgical marketplace. So good market that we're in. We've not lost our focus, which is key, and we continue to deliver
technologies that our patients and customers need.
<Q - Robert Adam Hopkins>: Great. Good to hear from you. Thanks, Bryan.
<A - Ryan Weispfenning>: Yeah. Thanks, Bob. Next question.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart of Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Hey. Good morning, everybody. I guess just as a, I guess, follow-up on Bob's question, I
was just wondering, kind of for Omar and then also for Bryan, just kind of under the new kind of Medtronic umbrella,
has there been any change of thinking for the Covidien Group now on the idea of robotics and the importance of
robotics, especially now that J&J has announced that they are teaming up with Google to have a platform? And I don't
know whether or not being under the Medtronic umbrella has changed kind of thoughts in that realm. And then I have a
second follow-up.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: I think – okay. First of all, I'll just say a few words, and then I'll let Bryan make the brunt of
the commentary on this one. First, from an overall Medtronic perspective, look, the importance of robotics is pretty
clear. And it's a trend that we can drive in an application-focused way. And I feel confident that our team can address

that market. I think from an overall change perspective, I think a focus on some longer-term investments is probably
the biggest single change that I hear from Covidien, ex-Covidien employees. But I think Bryan is best suited to give
more color to that, as well as the robotics strategy. Go ahead, Bryan.
<A - Bryan Hanson>: I mean, there's been a number of changes if I think about just broadly, how we think about our
strategy, but specifically to robotics, we're continuing down the path that we were on previous to the acquisition and
we're going to continue that path as part of Medtronic. And you spoke a little bit about some competitors out there that
are focusing in the area as well. And I actually like to see that because we are making significant investments in this
area. It gives me confidence that robotics is here to stay. The embodiment of what that's going to look like and how it's
going to get traction is still a question mark in my mind, but I do feel like it's here to stay. The way I look at it from a
strategic standpoint is we, as an organization, are highly focused on optimizing surgical procedures around the world.
And I kind of look at it as three legs of a stool from a surgical perspective. One is open surgical procedures, because
there's a whole heck of a lot of procedures that are still done open and they're done inefficiently. And we have
Advanced Energy and Stapling products that can help the efficiency of those procedures, and we're going to continue to
invest there. The other leg of the stool is what I would define as traditional MIS. This is an area that I think we've done
quite well and have shown our ability to lead the market, and we're going to continue to invest from a therapy
innovation standpoint on that leg of the stool.
And we have been making significant investments in robotics and that will continue. I'm looking forward to the day
that we actually enter the market with robotics, and we're driving revenue and not just investment, but that will come.
But to me, all three legs of those – of the stool need to be in play for someone to be sustainably successful in the
marketplace.
In addition to that, you've heard a little bit of talk about it today, we would overlay our capabilities from a service
perspective and bring OR managed services to the table so that we can further optimize the efficiency of the operating
room. And to me, the combination of those three things I referenced from a therapy standpoint with services really will
differentiate us in the space. But robotics is a piece of the puzzle, I guess, is what I'm saying, it's not the whole puzzle.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Got you. And then my follow-up question was just more broadly, Omar, for you. Now that
you've had Covidien under your belt for, I guess, now about eight full months, how are you thinking just about all the
businesses? And I guess as you look more holistically, too, at the Medtronic portfolio, do you think at this stage, you
have come to any conclusions or do you think you're close to coming to any conclusions that there are some businesses
that maybe don't or no longer fit in the portfolio that we could see some divestitures? Or do you think that all the pieces
still make sense?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: First, from an overall perspective, I think you understand the way in which we've organized
into the four groups. So that's our kind of primary strategic alignment. The goals and objectives of each of those groups
are clear into which sorts of market spaces they participate in. And within MITG, we're still looking through that
portfolio. I know there were some questions around some of those businesses.
I think right now, we're still looking to see a number of things. First of all, do they add to our overall strategy of MITG?
And we're going through that carefully. We're not prepared to conclude on it completely, but right now, they're all
contributing. Do they fulfill our mission and they're in line with our mission? They are. So right now, we've got what
you've got, and we're driving to see if we can get growth from all of them.
I think it's a little premature to decide, although I know it's been six months to eight months. But we made some
changes in the way in which we invest and to see if that investment change will result in – or what they'll result in, I
think we need a little longer to assess. So I'd say, Kristen, that we're still – at this stage, we've got everything there. It
all fits from a clinical relevance perspective, from a mission perspective. Whether we can – in a new paradigm of
investment of some of those businesses, can we change the equation more, we'll have to see. So it's a little bit works in
progress still. But by and large, we're treating them like they should be in that they're completely part of MITG. Bryan,
do you want to add anything to that?

<A - Bryan Hanson>: Well said. I mean, we're working through our own strategy and, again, some mindset shifts
associated with our own strategy, and we haven't worked through that yet. As we do, we'll get a better feel for the fit of
these – of all aspects of what was legacy Covidien and make decisions based on that.
One thing, too, and not just from the perspective of MITG, but if you look at the broader Hospital Solutions
opportunity and the services that we bring to bear, we also have to look through that paradigm to make sure that the
products that we have, if they don't fit the MITG strategy, still might fit the overall Hospital Solutions strategy. So a lot
to still work through, but clearly, we're looking at it.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.
<A - Ryan Weispfenning>: Okay. We probably have time for one more question. Thanks.
Operator
Our final question will come from the line of Joanne Wuensch of BMO Capital Markets.
<Q - Joanne K. Wuensch>: Can you hear me?
<A - Ryan Weispfenning>: Yes, we can, Joanne.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Hello.
<Q - Joanne K. Wuensch>: Terrific. Thank you so much. One of the things that struck us during this earnings season
was the commentary from a number of companies regarding hospital surgical volumes. If we take a big picture or big
step back, big picture, what do you see going on in terms of that in the United States, and how do you see that in the
coming months and quarters?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Well, again, I'll let Bryan and maybe Mike Coyle should comment on that a little bit because
they've got two of the bigger businesses here. But clearly, the U.S. is strong and procedure growth is strong. Now on
both the MITG and CVG, we've taken share, but I think we'll all acknowledge that the procedure growth is really
strong. And we think that the revitalized economy, as well as the Affordable Care Act, are both contributing to that
depending on the nature of the procedure. We think it's too early to tell, but we think there are some sustainability to
this. But I think maybe, Bryan, your perspective first, and then I'll let Mike Coyle also comment on it also for a little
bit. So, Bryan, go ahead.
<A - Bryan Hanson>: Yes. Again, I don't know that I have a whole lot to add to what you said, but it's clear to us and
we've got folks that are in the operating room in the U.S. every day. And the best litmus test for me on whether or not
sort of procedures are up, or when these guys go in the morning and look at the boards, and they see the number of
procedures either during the week and on the weekends, and we're definitely seeing a heightened number of surgical
procedures. And from every company that I've seen present, everyone seeing that momentum in their organization. I
would expect this to continue, though we've had it now for three quarters. And the question for me will be when it
annualizes, what does it look like at that point. But it is contributing so far for us in driving our mid-single-digit growth
and I would expect it to continue.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Mike, you've also seen some good growth in the cardiac space...
<A - Michael J. Coyle>: Right.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: ...so go ahead. Why don't you make some comments?
<A - Michael J. Coyle>: Sure. I would echo that certainly in the pacemaker and ICD arena, we've seen the
improvement come in initial implants, which is very encouraging. And from my perspective, we're seeing sort of
mid-single-digit growth in initial implants and in ICDs in particular, which is quite a change from what we've seen in
recent years. Just anecdotally, talking to customer accounts about this, they do seem to think that the availability of
insurance for people who absolutely need it because they have a sickness and they can't be turned down for coverage is

helping drive those volumes.
<Q - Joanne K. Wuensch>: That's very helpful. And then as a follow-up, when the Covidien agreement was
announced last year, one of the ideas was to cross-sell what we call the buffet table of products as you went into the
hospital administrator. Given that it's early days, what kind of feedback are you receiving when you go in to say, hey,
we've got, I think the quote was six of the top ten areas really well covered now by products? Thank you.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: First, we – you might've said that on day one, I'm not sure, but certainly, as we laid out our
strategies, that was number one of our core strategies. It was more around value creation because we had Covidien
products which created value within the hospital and with our Medtronic products, which were like chronic disease
products. And we said that in value-based healthcare, we'd have a broader set of assets that we could use to participate
in a value-based healthcare model where a broader continuum of products helps. So that was our primary notion around
the breadth that we had. The fact that we have more – that we're a more significant partner to a hospital, I think, is
important, but that alone is not one of our key strategies.
I think that gets us in the door, but each of our product lines have to perform competitively with the physicians and
against our competition, and then if you do have a seat at the table which others don't, then we go and leverage that.
But that's not our primary integration point with Covidien. I mean, there are others like Peripheral Vascular and
Neurovascular, which are much more directed revenue synergy efforts where we're seeing very good results, and then
in operating room managed services, where this aspect of moving towards value-based healthcare is, again, where we're
seeing real benefit. I think those are the ways in which we can make a true differentiated impact in healthcare. I think
the fact that we're just broader helps, but that's not a critical growth driver for us on its own.
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Yeah. (sic) Joanne, this is Gary. Just to add to what Omar said, I mean, I think as he indicated,
to the idea to say that there's a lot more contract of the entire portfolio, no, that hasn't happened nor did we necessarily
expect that, that was going to be the case. But clearly, it has helped us get into, as we know, with governments or CEOs
and hospital systems. It's clearly helped us as we deal with insurance companies, et cetera, that we have a broader
portfolio. So we're talking about a lot of different options, but as – could we point to a bunch of contracts where we've
negotiated across the product portfolio, the answer is no, and we didn't expect that.
What we did expect, however, was that just the strength of the portfolio will clearly get us in conversations with
high-level officials across organizations in much better format, and I think that is happening and you're seeing that on
some of the Hospital Solutions. You now see that we have our first Hospital Solutions with the – in the operating room
with basically the former Covidien product line. So we're seeing that all happening. And back to Omar's point, we're
seeing the synergies across the individual product portfolio, but not from the standpoint of we're all contract bundling
perspective.
<Q - Joanne K. Wuensch>: Terrific. Thank you so much.
<A - Ryan Weispfenning>: Okay. Thank you.
Omar S. Ishrak
Okay. Thanks to all of you for your questions. And with that and on behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to
thank you, again, for your continued support and interest in Medtronic. We look forward to updating you on our
progress on our Q2 call, which we currently anticipate holding on December 3. Thank you, all, and have a great day.
