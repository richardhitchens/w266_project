Steven M. Mollenkopf
Thank you, Warren, and good afternoon, everyone.
We just completed a solid quarter, with record performance in QTL, as the global adoption of our broad set of
technologies drove all-time high 3G/4G device shipments by our licensees. In addition, we had several major
accomplishments, including the resolution of the NDRC investigation, our announcement of a $15 billion stock
buyback authorization and a 14% increase in the dividend.
We are pleased that the NDRC investigation has been concluded and believe that our Licensing business is now better
positioned to participate in China's broad adoption of 3G/4G technology. The impact of the resolution and the recent
agreement with a large licensee in China, announced on the January call, are starting to positively impact the QTL
business. Derek will discuss this in more detail in a few moments.
While we are ahead of our expectations in the first half of the fiscal year, we are guiding the second half lower due to a
number of factors in QCT. First, the extent of the impact of OEM concentration at the premium tier and the impact of
share loss in the Galaxy S6 and Note. Second, the altered launch plans of the OEMs in the premium tier, with some
OEMs delaying launches and an OEM rationalizing their portfolio by de-emphasizing designs using our legacy parts.
We are not seeing a change in design share or the competitive environment, but rather a change in timing of some 810
designs.
And finally, QCT continues to face competitive pressures in China. The China contribution to earnings is roughly flat
to the previous outlook with more strength at the premium tier offsetting some expected share loss in the low tier in the
fourth quarter. As I will explain later, we expect this near-term trend to improve as we launch new parts and China
enters a modem transition later in this calendar year.
Based on our current customer engagements and our future product roadmap, we do not believe these product cycle
issues reflect a long-term change in QCT's competitive positioning. However, we do believe the impact of the current
product cycle will extend into next fiscal year. Clearly we are not pleased with our reduced outlook. Accordingly, we
have initiated a comprehensive review of our cost structure in QCT and throughout the company. The goals of this
review are to align our cost structure with the changing marketplace and improve efficiency. We have begun a
comprehensive assessment of costs and opportunities for greater efficiency company-wide with the help of an outside
expert and will be reporting on those initiatives on the Q3 Earnings Call.
With respect to the roadmap, we remain confident that our differentiated Snapdragon processor and modem leadership
positions us well across multiple price tiers and customer segments entering the next product cycle. In the premium tier,
we are very pleased with the design traction on the Snapdragon 810 with over 60 designs having won the key premium
design slots with the exception of Samsung.
Since our last Earnings Call, LG has begun shipping the innovative G Flex2, Sony has announced the incredibly thin
Xperia Z4 phone and tablet, and Xiaomi has announced the Mi Note 4 with category 9 carrier aggregation. Recent
teardowns and press reports correctly highlight the advantages delivered by our integrated approach.
We are also encouraged by the customer interest in our new Snapdragon 820, which is on track to ship in the second
half of this calendar year and is built on the latest FinFET node. The Snapdragon 820 represents a new design point for
our SoC architecture and will be the first to include our new custom 64-bit CPU micro-architecture.

Since our last call and in response to the competitive environment in China, we have also enhanced the Snapdragon 615
which will be commercial this year. In addition, we expect a modem transition in China later this year, and we are
seeing signals to the OEMs from the operators consistent with this view. Our Snapdragon 425 with industry leading
uplink carrier aggregation and a new low cost RF frontend is well-positioned for this opportunity and is on track to be
in devices later this calendar year, well ahead of our competition.
Turning to the longer term outlook, the smartphone opportunity remains a strong positive for Qualcomm and we
forecast continued healthy global demand in the near term and over the next several years. IDC estimates that over 8.5
billion smartphones will be sold from 2015 through 2019. We also continue to gain traction in adjacent areas where our
mobile technologies and capabilities can deliver next generation solutions: areas such as automotive, the Internet of
Things, mobile computing, and networking. These areas are expected to represent large new opportunities for
Qualcomm with over 5 billion new non-phone connected device shipments expected in calendar year 2018.
Further, shipments in these areas are contributing over 10% of QCT's fiscal year 2015 estimated revenue. In
automotive, for instance, we have over 40 connected car programs with 15-plus OEMs and we recently announced two
new modems, the Snapdragon X12 and X5 that augment our portfolio to support connectivity across all tiers of the
automotive industry. Our scale and position in mobile makes us well positioned to capitalize on these opportunities.
In summary, we are well-positioned to address the significant opportunities ahead given the strength in our core
businesses and traction in new growth opportunities. We are focused on completing our implementation of the
rectification plan in China, concluding new license agreements in China, and improving compliance. We're also
investing in the future generations of the modem and connectivity including 4G enhancements such as LTE U and 5G
as well as future evolutions of Wi-Fi and the convergence of Wi-Fi in cellular. We are confident in our QCT road map
for the reasons I just explained, but intend to take a comprehensive look at our cost structure, in light of the changing
industry dynamics and structure.
I would now like to turn the call over to Qualcomm's President, Derek Aberle.
Derek K. Aberle
Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone.
As Steve noted, we delivered a solid quarter, achieving record non-GAAP operating income. QCT operating
performance was in line with expectations, as favorable operating expense offset slightly weaker mix. QTL
performance was ahead of expectations, with revenues, earnings before tax and total reported device sales all setting
records, driven by strong 3G/4G device shipments, improved compliance in China and a catch up amount for
prior-period sales from the licensee with which we recently resolved the dispute.
Fiscal Q2 revenue for QTL was up approximately 17% year-over-year. Even without this catch up amount, and in the
face of foreign exchange headwinds, QTL would have delivered a record quarter across these same metrics.
As you are aware, we recently announced a resolution with China's National Development and Reform Commission
regarding their investigation of us under the China antimonopoly law. As part of this resolution, we agreed to
implement a rectification plan that modified certain of our business practices with respect to the licensing of our 3G
and 4G essential Chinese patents for branded devices sold for use in China. Since that time, we have been
implementing the plan and offered the revised license terms for our current 3G and 4G essential Chinese patents to both
our current licensees and to a number of unlicensed OEMs and manufacturers.
Following the offers, we have met with a large number of licensees, both in and outside of China, to discuss the revised
terms. Although we are still relatively early in the process, we are making good progress to date, as over 35 licensees
have accepted the revised terms so far, including with respect to 3-mode devices sold in China. The rate at which
licensees are accepting the new terms and signing new license agreements has been accelerating throughout the
process. We now have 125 licensees in total with licenses covering 3-mode devices, with more than 85 in China,

including Huawei and ZTE.
We are making progress on the under-reporting issues in China as well. We estimate that approximately 200 million
units were sold during calendar 2014, but not reported to us by our licensees, in line with our prior guidance. To put
this in greater context, we have also increased our estimates for the calendar 2014 global 3G/4G market by
approximately 20 million units, versus our prior guidance, and now believe that a larger percentage of the units shipped
in 2014 were 3-mode devices, where we had a low collection rate during the year. In other words, the percentage of
calendar 2014 units that were reported to us came in higher than previously expected.
As we continue to implement our compliance and audit plans, as well as conclude new 3-mode license agreements, we
believe that this collection percentage will continue to increase and we are seeing early evidence of that in the March
quarter sales. While we are making good progress, we do expect this process to extend beyond this fiscal year. It is also
possible that in some cases, it may require litigation and/or actions to compel certain licensees to honor their contracts,
and for unlicensed companies to execute new licenses. We are prepared to pursue that path if it becomes necessary.
We are raising our fiscal year outlook for QTL based on favorable total reported device sales in the second fiscal
quarter, in addition to higher forecasted total reported device sales for the second half of the fiscal year. Total reported
device sales for the second fiscal quarter came in above the high end of our guidance range, a portion of which was
driven by higher than expected catch up amounts. Our outlook for the second half of the fiscal year reflects updated
favorable reported device sales trends, improved compliance in China and expected continued progress on concluding
license agreements in China, offset by foreign exchange headwinds.
We now expect QTL revenues to grow approximately 8% at the midpoint year-over-year. This includes the favorable
effect of some catch up payments for prior sales offset by the negative effect of foreign exchange. Without including
these two effects, we estimate that QTL revenues would grow by more than 8% in fiscal 2015, as we believe the
negative foreign exchange impact is larger than the catch up benefit.
Turning to our view of global 3G/4G device demand, we continue to see very healthy growth and have increased our
calendar 2014 global 3G/4G device shipment estimate to approximately 1.37 billion units, up approximately 27%
year-over-year. As a reminder, this includes those devices we expect to be reported to us as well as our estimates of
unreported and unlicensed device sales, but excludes TD-SCDMA devices that do not implement LTE.
We saw strength in both developed and emerging regions during 2014 and finished the year with favorable replacement
rate trends in developed regions as well as LTE volume strength, particularly in China. We expect these growth trends
to continue throughout calendar 2015. We now expect global 3G/4G device shipments to be 1.52 billion to 1.6 billion
units in calendar 2015, up approximately 11% to 17%, with our bias continuing to be towards the high end of that
range.
It's worth noting that we are still in the very early days of LTE adoption. According to GSMA Intelligence, only about
8% of global connections are LTE. In February, China granted nation-wide FDD LTE licenses to both China Telecom
and China Unicom. Each of the Chinese operators has announced significant investments in LTE network build-outs
and has set aggressive targets for LTE subscriber additions this year. For calendar year 2014, we are increasing our
estimate of reported 3G/4G devices to between 1.174 billion and 1.19 billion units.
Turning to estimated 3G/4G device ASPs, the ASP of devices reported to QTL during the second quarter of fiscal 2015
was approximately $196 at the midpoint. Absent the effect of prior period catch up units, the reported ASP would have
been approximately $211 at the midpoint, up $14 sequentially, driven by stronger ASPs in both emerging and
developed regions reflecting a favorable mix of higher-tier handsets.
We are now forecasting global 3G/4G device ASPs to decline approximately 11% to 12% year-over-year in fiscal
2015, an improvement to our previous estimate of 12% to 13%, despite an increase in negative foreign exchange
effects. The improvement is primarily due to a favorable mix of higher tier handsets and stronger pricing in the low to
mid-tiers of LTE devices in China. We now expect global 3G/4G total device sales in fiscal 2015 to be up
approximately 8% to 11% over fiscal 2014 despite foreign exchange headwinds driven by both stronger units and ASP,
particularly in emerging regions.

Turning to the regulatory issues, we have been notified that the Korean Fair Trade Commission is conducting a new
investigation of the company. We believe this new investigation relates primarily to our licensing business and we are
cooperating with the agency.
To conclude, QTL is making good progress on our efforts in China while experiencing strength in underlying demand
where we continue to see strong global 3G/4G device sales and stronger global ASP trends.
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call over to George Davis.
George S. Davis
Thank you, Derek, and good afternoon, everyone.
Fiscal second quarter revenues were $6.9 billion, up 8% year-over-year, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.40,
up 7% year-over-year, at the high end of our prior guidance range.
In QCT, MSM shipments were 233 million, in line with expectation with revenue of $4.4 billion. Implied revenue per
MSM was approximately $19, down slightly quarter-over-quarter reflecting a lower mix of premium tier shipments
than previously expected. QCT operating margin was 17%, in line with our prior expectations.
In QTL, total reported device sales by our licensees were a record $75.8 billion up 14% year-over-year at the high end
of our guidance range, including the impact of a higher than expected catch up report. Non-GAAP combined R&D and
SG&A expenses increased 2% sequentially driven primarily by seasonal increases in payroll taxes.
We continue our aggressive capital return program returning approximately $2.6 billion to stockholders in the quarter
including $689 million of dividends paid, and $1.9 billion in stock repurchases. And as you'll recall, in March we
announced a major increase in our capital return program, including an increase in our stock repurchase authorization
to $15 billion and our plans for a $10 billion buyback in the next 12 months, which is incremental to our ongoing return
of a minimum of 75% of free cash flow.
Fiscal second quarter cash flow from operations was negative at approximately $650 million this quarter reflecting a
long-term capacity prepayment of approximately $950 million made by QCT as part of our supply chain cost-reduction
initiatives and the payment of the approximately $975 million NDRC fine.
We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $29.6 billion. Our non-GAAP tax rate during the quarter
was 20%, above expectations due to business mix. We now expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 19%
for fiscal 2015.
Looking ahead, as we already indicated, we are reducing our financial forecast for fiscal 2015, primarily due to lower
expected revenue and profitability in the premium tier for the QCT business. We now estimate fiscal 2015 revenues
overall to be in the range of approximately $25 billion to $27 billion, down approximately 2% year-over-year at the
midpoint.
The increased impact of the product cycle issues in QCT is affecting our revenue and margin outlook for the chip
business. We now expect QCT revenue for the fiscal year to be down approximately 6% year-over-year, with operating
margin for fiscal 2015 between 14% and 17%. We expect combined non-GAAP, R&D and SG&A expense to be up
1% to 3% year-over-year. This represents a reduction of 2% overall, relative to our prior guidance. However, this
outlook does not factor in potential reductions to be identified as part of the cost assessment that Steve discussed.
On the QTL side, as Derek indicated, we are raising our fiscal 2015 revenue outlook to approximately 8% growth
year-over-year, reflecting higher total reported device sales, as well as the larger-than-forecasted catch up royalties
reported this past quarter. We continue to expect QTL operating margins will be within our prior 85% to 86% guidance
range.

We expect fiscal 2015 non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $4.60 to $5.00, down approximately 9%
year-over-year at the midpoint relative to fiscal 2014, and down $0.15 at the midpoint from our prior guidance.
Turning to our fiscal third quarter, we estimate revenues to be in the range of approximately $5.4 billion to $6.2 billion,
down approximately 15% year-over-year and 16% sequentially at the midpoint. The sequential changes reflect both the
chip revenue challenges and the normal seasonal effects of QTL coming off its seasonal peak quarter.
We estimate non-GAAP earnings per share in our fiscal third quarter to be in the range of $0.85 to $1.00 per share,
down approximately 36% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect fiscal third quarter non-GAAP combined R&D
and SG&A expenses will be up 6% to 8% sequentially, primarily driven by QCT product roadmap spend that was back
half loaded, certain supply chain initiatives, as well as costs related to marketing and legal.
In QTL, we estimate total reported device sales of $61 billion to $67 billion will be reported by our licensees in the
June quarter for shipments they made in the March quarter, up approximately 10% year-over-year at the midpoint, but
lower sequentially as compared to the seasonally higher holiday quarter shipments in Q2. We estimate that the QTL
reported device ASP will be modestly up versus the second fiscal quarter, which included higher than expected,
lower-price catch up units. We expect QTL's operating margin percentage to be between 83% and 85%, lower
sequentially due to seasonal factors, OEM mix, as well as increases in marketing and legal expenses. We expect that
the implied royalty rate, as you calculate it, will be lower quarter-over-quarter reflecting licensee mix, as well as the
impact of the new licensing terms in China.
In QCT, we anticipate MSM shipments of approximately 210 million to 230 million units during the June quarter,
down approximately 6% sequentially and down approximately 2% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect revenue
per MSM to be down 8% to 9% sequentially due to unfavorable mix in the premium tier and price competition in the
mid-tier. We expect QCT operating margin for this product cycle to bottom in the fiscal third quarter at approximately
7% to 10% of revenue, reflecting lower volumes, weaker mix and timing of roadmap spending pushed into the quarter.
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Warren.
Warren Kneeshaw
Thank you, George. Operator, we're ready for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets. Please go
ahead with your question.
<Q - Tim Long>: Thank you. Just a question on the chip side. I guess you mentioned before the GS 6. You also
mentioned the Note. So just curious, is that this upcoming one later this year and maybe talk a little bit about how we
should think about the rest of Samsung's portfolio? And clearly it's hit the revenue numbers. I'm curious if that's also
been something that looks like the gross margin is down again for that division? So if you could just maybe touch on
Samsung and the impacts across the model. Thanks.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: Hi, Tim. It's Steve. So, yeah, you should think of the current generation of flagship
products at Samsung, we anticipate a similar share picture to what you see today on the GS6. I think that's what we're
saying. Now, the next design cycle, as I mentioned in my remarks, I think we feel that we have a very competitive
roadmap.
We are also seeing OEMs and I think this applies to that OEM, looking at their portfolio and rationalizing it. What that
really means is putting more concentration on the newer products and less on the legacy products as you would

typically see in a particular year. And that obviously given our design-in share impacts the outlook as well.
So those product cycle issues I think we're seeing being compounded by the fact that the premium tier is very
concentrated really in two players right now
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Brian Modoff with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Brian Modoff>: Hi, guys. Can you perhaps talk about some of the cost synergies or cost savings that you might
see as you go through this kind of evaluation of your cost structure? Are you targeting things like wafer design cycle
times? Or can you maybe talk about it and how you see that potentially helping your operating margins, particularly in
QCT as we move forward? Thanks.
<A - George S. Davis>: Hi, Brian. It's George. I would call it an acceleration of many of the things that we started in
2014, which were fairly comprehensive. We brought down the rate of spending substantially in 2014 exiting the year
lower than the run rate we had coming into 2014. We then forecasted to bring it down further in 2015, and we've
actually are a couple points below our original guidance on OpEx as well. But we'll be looking pretty comprehensively
across the board and certainly that touches everything from how can we become more efficient, testing projects once
again for ROI and things like that. So we're – as you would expect, it will be comprehensive, and we'll look forward to
reporting on it next quarter.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead with our question.
<Q - Mike Walkley>: Great. Thanks. Just building on those last two questions, on the QCT with operating margins
potentially bottoming out below 10% in the third quarter, September quarter and you've talked about it extending into
the first half of fiscal 2016. Other than looking at operating costs, how does the gross margin improve given the
competitive cost environment? Or to ask it another way, what's the timeframe and thought process to maybe get back to
high teens to 20% operating margins in QCT? Thank you.
<A - George S. Davis>: Yeah, I think we're – we view it as a bottom, because first, you know, Q3 really is an
incredibly concentrated quarter when you look at the premium tier, and it has within that, meaningful Samsung GS 6
impact. We expect to see some improvement with the premium tier launches of other leading OEMs that use our
Snapdragon. We also expect cost and efficiency activities to start to moderate some of the market structure impacts
over time. But ultimately we're going to continue to invest strongly in the roadmap, and we think that's the basis for
having a competitive position in the next product cycle that is different than what we're experiencing now.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: Mike, this is Steve as well. I think also if you look up and down the product line, the
current product cycle that we're in, at the top tier, we think it turns over with the 820. At the bottom tier, you tend to see
a modem transition, particularly in China, which is advantageous, we think, to us.
We are also moving rapidly toward advanced nodes, which we think will actually help us in terms of delivering
products to market at better cost. There's a little bit of a trough right now in the cost equation because we're at
20-nanometer. As we move on to further nodes, we think we get into a better cost perspective, and I think we're
differentiated also in our ability to do it.
We are also – just to follow up on the cost side, the cost structure of the company, we want to make sure that we put
ourselves in a position where we're a little bit less sensitive to these market dynamics, and then we can ride them out
easier as well.
One other element on that also is that the adjacent markets, as they start to contribute more, again, I said they were
about 10% of QCT this year, that tends to help us as well. They tend to be fairly highly leveraged from the same

triangulate a couple of the data points you gave us with respect to the catch up and how large that was. Any other
information you can give us in terms of the excess TRDS this quarter that the catch up helped would help kind of
bridge the gap between the TRDS this quarter and next quarter. So whatever you can do to give us a sense as to the size
of the catch up period in this quarter would be helpful.
Then, Steve, a question on GS6 and Note going forward. I understand how the evolution of using your custom core and
moving down to 14-nanometer, et cetera. With everything you've said about the concentration at the premium tier, if in
a situation you don't get back into Samsung, where does that leave you? If your share in the GS 6 and Note, going
forward, is roughly the same as what it is now, and it's back and forth, is there enough other market to make the
margins work, get you back into the 20% plus range at QCT?
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Ehud, this is Derek. Yeah, we're not – as you suspected, we weren't planning on breaking out
exactly the amount of the catch up. One of the points I wanted to highlight was, you know, we had 17% year-over-year
growth in QTL this quarter, and that was in the face of some meaningful foreign exchange headwinds. And so when
you sort of looked at that impact, netted against the catch up amount, you know, the foreign exchange impact was
actually, for the year, will be greater and would be for the quarter as well. So still even if you strip out the catch up,
would be a record quarter for QTL and really strong growth.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: And, Ehud, on the question about the premium tier and the concentration, first of all,
when we look at customer interest, we don't think that that is the scenario to plan for. We do think that our roadmap is
very compelling. We like the impact that we're getting, the interest that we're getting from the OEMs, I think broadly.
We also think that our business, which is also supported by our modem leadership, also we think is in a good position
when you look at the competitive dynamics as well. That being said, it would help us a lot if the industry structure was
to be different. We don't have a lot of control over that, but I would say the history of that is that it does move around
quite a bit, and we want to be in a position to participate in that. And I think one of the reasons that we're looking at our
cost structure is to make that easier to handle, should we have to ride out a product cycle or not.

Your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Blayne Curtis>: Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions. Just maybe from a very high level, you obviously
already reduced full-year guidance based upon kind of same factors, and Apple's supply chain really hasn't changed
that much since December. They had a knockout quarter and it's been kind of holding in. You know, Samsung's been
very public about their AP plans for a long time here at 14 nanometer. So I'm just trying to figure out what has
changed, really since the end of last year and then definitely since your first negative revision of maybe $1 billion?
Now you're doing that again.
And then when you look at gross margin, clearly the GS 6, that shouldn't really have an impact on gross margin. I'm
just curious, it looks like it's down again in June. What's really the driver for another stepdown of a couple hundred
basis points? Thanks.
<A - George S. Davis>: So the change in the guidance is really more a change in our view of the sizing and the
concentration in the third quarter compared to our original estimates. And Steve talked about some things about some
of the OEMs pushing out their timing based on what they were seeing in the marketplace and other factors. There is
some gross margin impact actually that we see going into Q3. And then I think the balance of the impact is really the

timing of roadmap spending is heavier in the second half. I don't know, Steve, if you were going to say something?
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: I was just going to say just a little bit of color on – from the perspective of an OEM.
OEMs typically have pretty broad portfolios and they may put emphasis in one place or another depending on the
reaction of a flagship launch and the timing of a flagship launch. I think this year is probably characterized a bit by the
first calendar quarter of 2015 was probably a little stronger in quarter for a U.S.-based flagship company.
And then people move around, I think, based off of big launches. So I think when the Galaxy S6 came out, people
moved around their plans a little bit, including Samsung. So that tends to ripple through to us beyond our control.
Those things can also change a lot during the year, but I think this is our best estimate of where we are today.

Your next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Thanks. My question's for Derek on the licensing side. What I'm trying to understand is I
think you said you'd signed 35 licensees on these new terms since you've started discussing with them recently. Can
you give us some kind of broad indication as to, is that, does that actually cover a significant part of the phones that you
weren't licensing, the 200 million or so run rate? That's just one question now because I'm just trying to think about the
visibility you might have as we head into fiscal year 2016 of recapturing some of those licensing revenues. That's my
kind of first question.
The second one is as I think about what you weren't collecting on last year, that 200 million number this year would
have grown I assume given the market share the Chinese vendors have gained and it would have grown revenues quite
meaningfully as well. So should we think about at some point over the next whether it's one, two, or three years that
200 million unit number, which has a revenue number attached to it in TDRS that you then license against and it should
be significantly higher when it starts coming in? Or is that the wrong way of thinking about it? Thanks.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Kulbinder, this is Derek. So just to be clear the 200 million number that we put out for 2014 is
sort of a combination of units that we think are actually being sold by licensees who didn't report them as well as
basically unlicensed activity. The most prominent one we talked about is 3-mode. So it's a little bit hard to translate that
over into the kind of the new terms.
If you think about the new terms that we're going out to offer, if the licensees accept them after we offer them and
discuss them with them, they'll impact both the 3G volumes, which would be sort of how we've thought about the
under-reported amounts as well as then impact the 3-mode, which we had kind of bucketed as unlicensed. So it's a little
bit hard to split that out in terms of what percentage get picked up that we weren't collecting anything on at all.
But we are – I think we are making good progress. We have got a relatively significant number that kind of run the
spectrum of very large to small companies that have already accepted the terms. And generally when they've accepted
them, they've applied to the 3-mode devices sold for use in China. So I think that has been a positive trend for us.
There have been a couple of other positive things. One is as I tried to explain, the market we think actually came in
larger in 2014 than we thought when we originally gave out that 200 million unit number, which means by that holding
steady effectively our collection percentage went up. It also went up in the face of kind of a worse or a more difficult
market shift because more of the market also, we believe, was 3-mode where there's a larger portion of unlicensed
activity.
So kind of in a worsening market environment and a growing market, we were able to kind of hold the number flat
which means we're making progress. We believe that, that's going to get better even going into the March quarter based
on the early evidence we're seeing. And we do have kind of a plan as we have talked about that the past sales will be
things that we're working on to drive collection, but it's going to take some time. And I think we've indicated just where
we sit in the fiscal year with kind of the June cutoff for shipments flowing into our fiscal year that it's likely that, you
know, more of that will come in in fiscal 2016 than 2015.

Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Stacy A. Rasgon>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. First of all, if I sort of back into the royalty rate
trajectory, you're probably – you seem to be guiding royalty rates or implied rates next quarter to maybe 3%, probably
down 20 basis points, and maybe even a little more in fiscal Q4. So I'm assuming that is the mix as the China volume
starts to come back in, which you suggested actually is coming in at a lower rate. How should I think about the
trajectory of royalty rates as I go into 2016 and beyond as presumably the Chinese volume should be the piece that's
growing the biggest, and it will be under the new royalty rate terms?
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Stacy, this is Derek. Yeah, I mean, we indicated that if you look at sort of
quarter-over-quarter Q1 to Q2 relatively speaking sort of in line in terms of the implied rate that you guys calculate. We
do see that taking a step down in the back half of the year, and I think you pretty much hit it on the head that really the
primary drivers – there's some OEM mix in there and a number of the other factors that always move it around. But we
do expect a couple of things impacting the back half, two of which are the licensees. Kind of the impact of the licensees
accepting the China terms in China but also with us concluding agreements on 3 mode where we weren't collecting
before, as we bring that revenue into the program that will come in at a lower rate as we talked about when we
announced the resolution.
So kind of the combination of those factors will push it down. Really hard to say longer term beyond kind of this year
where that goes just for all the reasons I have previously explained in terms of market share of OEMs and ASPs and
caps and all the other drivers that move it around.

Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - James E. Faucette>: Great. Thank you very much. I wanted to ask two, I guess, follow-up questions on a lot of
those that have already been asked. First, can you talk a little bit about from a visibility standpoint? I think one of the
things that may be concerning to some investors is the – I guess the poor or lack of visibility relative to new product
launches that seem to be taking you a little bit by surprise. Can you talk about if that indeed has been the case, et cetera,
on the chip side?
And then on the royalty side, Derek, I just wanted to ask about – as you're addressing the new licensing structure how
are you handling the nonessential IP licensing and what – how we should think about the impact of that? And can you
give us any sense of – I know that you weren't very specific of in terms of, like, what the – like, the rate at which things
are – you're signing up new licensees, but that it's improving. But in the long run, how should we think about what a
reasonable ultimate capture rate should be and that kind of thing? Thank you.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: James, on the chip side, the way I would think about it. One of the OEMs, what they
tend to do in fact the one that you're probably concerned with, they tend to – they tend to hold two designs until very
late in the process and make a decision very late in the process. And in some cases, actually might go to market with
multiple designs, one with our chip, one not with our chip, and then make a decision regionally even during the ramp of
the design. So it can be quite difficult to project share and units as a result of doing that much later in the process than I
think people typically think.
The other element which is mix of OEMs and who wins in the marketplace and whether an OEM decides to rationalize
their portfolio by no longer focusing on SKUs in the n-minus-1 product cycle, for example, that tends to be something
that we don't have great visibility into, and it tends to be something that the market controls. So I think we're all trying
to figure out how to get a better handle on that.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: And this is Derek. So on the first question, which really was around how we're going to deal
with the patents that are sort of outside the scope of the commitment we made to the NDRC. You know, as you know,

we've typically licensed generally our whole portfolio together, but one of the things that we agreed to as part of the
rectification plan in China is that we would separately offer to license just the 3G, 4G, you know, essential Chinese
patents, and then we would negotiate agreements for the rest of the portfolio kind of separate from that. So really the
first order of business for us is to go out and really implement the commitment that we made, which is to offer these
terms and around the essential portfolio and get those concluded.
And then as part of those discussions, it could involve some of the other patents, or we could end up dealing with the
need for licenses to the rest of the portfolio down the road a little bit. What we've included in our guidance and our
thinking around fiscal 2015 really just is based on what we would expect to collect on the essential portfolio and
doesn't build in incremental revenue at this point for the remainder of the portfolio, although we do believe there's an
opportunity there.
On compliance, we think that we're in a position really to kind of drive the business back more to normal course before
we had the investigation, and I think we're pleased with some of the early trends we're seeing. It's going to take some
time to get there, but we do believe that we can get back to a high compliance environment in China, you know, with
some of the tools that we have available to us and now with the investigation behind us. We do also think there's going
to be some industry dynamics that will help.
I do think that there's going to be consolidation around the OEM base in China so you'll have a fewer number of larger
players which I think is just an easier thing to deal with from compliance standpoint than a lot of smaller players. And
they're going to build successful export businesses where there's a need to play by international rules both inside and
outside of China. So I think over time those trends really point in a positive direction for us.

Your next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your
question.
<Q - Tal Liani>: Hi, guys. Two quick questions and then a big one. First, when it comes to exchange rate, are we –
what's the mechanism for exchange rate? And is there a risk that actually you see the impact of the exchange rate next
quarter because of the mechanism? If you can clarify.
And then the bigger question I have is really for next year, and this question was asked many times, but maybe a
different way. Is it all – if you think about competition and you think about MediaTek, Intel and Marvell and the local
Chinese, how does it get better from here? I understand that this one is a trough from an expense point of view or a
margin point of view, but on the business, how does it get better from here? What needs to happen for you to see
growth in revenues on the semiconductor side? Let me stop here and let you answer. Thanks.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Hello. This is Derek. Maybe I'll answer your first question on the FX. Really the primary FX
effect on the company is really around the licensing business, and a couple things to remember there I think that you
know is that, you know, obviously the sales are reported to us one quarter in arrears. But the basic – probably the most
significant exposure for us is really the euro, and, you know, basically when the licensees – and not all of them do it the
same, so it's somewhat difficult, you know, to always estimate precisely the impact, but I think we have a pretty good
sense of it at a higher magnitude.
But basically there's a mechanism for them to convert their sales in local euro back into dollars for purposes of
calculating the royalties and that creates an impact to the business. If you think about this year in particular, there's
probably at least a couple percentage points of revenue growth that QTL has been impacted by just on FX alone.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: And on next year, I'd say the forward-looking view in terms of the competitive
environment, it's – I would say for us we don't see it changing that much. And I would say our view of the current
competitive environment may be different than what you see. You know, we look at the modem tier and modem
leadership and the accounts where that's important, and we feel pretty good about our position there. I think that's an
important differentiator for us.

We have also moved quickly to advanced nodes. One of the things that we did this year and we're currently investing in
is moving rapidly across the tiers to the advanced nodes, which we think is a good strategy and enables us to leverage
our feature leadership in the premium tier down. And that, I think, has good results.
It's being offset a little bit now because of the concentration in the premium tier, so you're not seeing that maybe as
broadly as you would think. The product cycle is quite fast in China, as I mentioned. The modem transition later this
year, I think a number of OEM or our competitors are having a difficult time producing 5-mode designs and certainly
having the ability to do multi-SIM and all of the VoIP and international features that allow them to grow. At the same
time, we are changing the table stakes across the tiers on the modem.
So we actually view our roadmap as getting stronger over time, at least based on our view of the competitive
environment. I don't think at the premium tier, with the exception of the vertical threat at one of the OEMs, we don't see
that dynamic being as threatening as perhaps was implied in the question.

Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead with your
question.
<Q - Timothy Arcuri>: Thank you very much. I had two. First of all, Steve, can you, again just from a high level, can
you remind us or maybe discuss the high-level merits for keeping the two businesses together? You had filed
previously to split the business up in the past, but you're being hit with these investigations and this new one from
Korea. So again, just getting your view there would be good.
And then secondly, I noted that George talked about having to prepay $950 million for some capacity, and that's in the
face of, you know, declining economics in the chip business, so I was wondering if you could just discuss how we
should be thinking about that prepayment? Is it opportunistic or is it more defensive, I guess? Thanks.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: So on the business structure, it's something that we've looked at throughout the
company's history, I think a couple of times even publicly. It's something that is constantly and periodically discussed
at the management team and at the board level. There are a lot of puts and takes, and those puts and takes change over
time depending on the situation. But I would say, just broadly, you should think of the businesses as having significant
synergies in the ability to deliver products to market.
So for example, the channel of QCT is very, very important to be able to introduce new technology into the industry
and share it at scale and be able to work. There are many, many things like that, but that is one of the ones that we want
to make sure we can maintain, particularly given that we're driving into an environment where you're going to see
convergence between Wi-Fi and cellular. And the modem itself is moving much more rapidly than I think people are
thinking. At the same time, the industry, the number of players who are investing in those technologies, and that
breadth of technology, is decreasing. So we think we have an opportunity there for us to continue to deliver modem
innovation.
That being said, it is something that we actively evaluate and it's obviously something that is on the minds of investors
and something that we spend time talking to them actively about, getting their perspective.
<A - George S. Davis>: Hey, Tim. It's George. On the capacity prepayment, it's really part of our overall supply chain
initiative to drive a more cost effective supply chain. And it's an opportunity that we saw and that our partners saw to
bring them a little bit more certainty and for them to provide us with a better long-term cost roadmap.

<Q - C.J. Muse>: Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess the first question, in terms of
QCT, can you walk through implied PBT margins into September? And your long-term outlook for MSM pricing?
And then a little bit bigger-picture thinking on the chipset side, as you think about adjacent growth, particularly
hyper-connected areas, like IOT and auto, do you have the scale across technology, customer relationships and
distribution to succeed? Or do you need to look at acquisitions? And if yes, would you consider large scale M&A? Or
would you continue to focus solely on bolt-on acquisitions? Thank you.
<A - George S. Davis>: Hi. It's George. Yeah, on op margin, you're really seeing the effects both of the positioning
within the premium tier, which is having some impact on the gross margin, but also primarily it's the increase in OpEx
in the quarter having a little bit of an effect as well. So it's a combination of mix, the OpEx effects and just the market
overall in the third quarter.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: And with respect to the adjacent businesses, there are a lot of technologies that are
leveraged from the mobile space. There are some things that are not. For example, we got things like networking from
the Atheros acquisition, and we believe we're going to get a strong portfolio of technologies with the announced
acquisition of CSR, which we hope will close here, you know, in this year. I think one of the things you get besides
technology is the sales channel and the ability to sell into different types of customers than our current slate in the
handset business, and we actively plan that out, and that's one of the reasons why we have done M&A.
It is also, I think, an environment in the industry right now where there's a lot of consolidation, particularly in the
semiconductor space, and it is something that we think about and I think we can potentially have an opportunity to
de-risk some of those things if we continue down through our strategy. And we're trying to keep our strategic options
open, at the same time maintain our capital structure.

Your next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri with CLSA. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Srini R. Pajjuri>: Thank you. Steve, this question has been asked, but I just want to ask it a little differently. You
said modem differentiation is your key competitive advantage, and you seem to be banking on that to regain some of
the business. I'm just curious, given the lead that you have, it appears that Samsung is using an internal modem even
now, even though I guess they could have used your modem with their own processor. I'm just wondering, is the
modem technology that mature that customers don't care as much about the differentiation, or you know, what do you
think caused that? Thank you.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: Well, I think when you have a vertical decision, there can be many more elements in
the decision than just the technical merits or what might happen outside of that environment, they may have the ability
to [ph] share (55:32) one place or the other. When we look at the tear downs of those decisions, we tend to see that it
compares, at least from a feature and a geography point of view, to a product that we probably delivered two
generations ago. So I would actually view it as more evidence of our modem lead.
Now, it is possible to launch portions of the SKUs without having the modem expertise. But I think you're always
better off having the application processor and the modem together and have that worldwide scale particularly given
the industry structure today. We're seeing that be very attractive in the case of the international OEMs or the Chinese
OEMs that want to go internationally. So we still think the modem is an important component.
If you look what's ahead of any modem player, they have an enormous number of bands, they have to sync up Wi-Fi
and the cellular network. Just recently the FCC gave a very positive ruling on the spectrum that will be used for
LTE-U. So we think the modem still has an enormous migration. And then upstream and beyond that, you're going to
have 5G, so the modem continues to be big.
In addition, hopefully we're not downplaying the strength of our application processor. We have, we think, the best
mobile CPU coming, and that's going to be a portfolio of products, not just one product. And our strength in the GPU

is, I think, quite strong. We're the market leader in terms of mobile GPU shipments, and if you look at the performance
of the 8994, I think you'd see it's quite strong. So we feel like we're in a good position there. We just need to get
through this product cycle, maintain the investment in the roadmap and at the same time sort of get ourselves in a
position where we can weather out these storms a little bit easier and I think we're going to have a reasonable business

Your next question comes from the line of Tavis McCourt with Raymond James. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Tavis C. McCourt>: Thanks for taking my question. Derek, you ran through a few numbers and I want to make
sure I have them right because they're not adding up to me. I think you said QTL ASP this year would be down 11% to
12% in the fiscal year, device sales would be up 8% to 11% but revenues would be up 8% or so. Was that the right
numbers for fiscal 2015?
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: So I think we probably – we kind of mix and match a little bit. The units are for calendar year.
You know, the ASP that we gave was a global ASP. That's, remember, not the one that necessarily will get reported to
us. That's sort of the all-in number assuming we were getting 100% compliance. We haven't given guidance on a
reported ASP for fiscal 2015 for a number of reasons including it's probably going to get bounced around by things like
catch up payments and the timing of signing some of these new agreements. So I think that may be your difficulty in
trying to triangulate the numbers back to the 8% revenue guide for QTL.

into new markets outside of smartphones and how to fund those investments so that we can actually see a better return
on your invested capital in other segments of the business? Thank you, gentlemen.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: Mark, you were breaking up a little bit, so I'll try to answer what the question was. And
I think it was related to how we can continue to invest and have confidence given that some people are trying to go
internal.
Our evaluation of the efforts to go internal, they actually tend to be more expensive than if you had bought them
externally, particularly when you amortize the R&D investment across all of the many different technologies that are
required to produce an integrated or a mobile smartphone offering.
In fact, I would say, particularly given the fact that in some cases people are launching very early in the node, you
really pay a penalty for yield. And our estimates is that it would be quite expensive right now to be launching without
good yield. I think you also see if you look at teardowns, the difference between the size, both footprint on the board as
well as cost to assemble all of the components that we have in Snapdragon using external partners, it tends to be fairly
expensive.
For example, Snapdragon has GPS integrated inside of it and putting that out externally tends to be fairly expensive.
There are a number of things CODEC, a number of things that sit there and become more expensive. So our view of the
trend is that things are moving more toward integrated versus less toward integrated. And when we look at the
economics, it's quite difficult, we think, to have people compete, have the same internal offering unless you have a
fairly large scale, R&D scale.
