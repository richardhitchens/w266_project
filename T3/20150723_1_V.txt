Let me also remind you that this presentation may include forward-looking statements. These statements aren't
guarantees of future performance and our actual results could materially differ as the result of a variety of factors.
Additional information concerning those factors is available in our most recent reports on Forms 10-K and Q, which
you can find on the SEC's website and the Investor Relations section of our website.
For historical non-GAAP or pro forma-related financial information disclosed in this call, the related GAAP measures
and other information required by Reg G of the SEC are available in the financial and statistical summary
accompanying today's press release.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Vasant.
Vasant M. Prabhu
Thank you, Jack. We reported another solid quarter of financial results with strong revenue and earnings growth against
an economic backdrop that continues to be uncertain. Most of our results were in line with our expectations going into
the quarter with a few highlights and exceptions. Let me speak to those first.
First, we recognized a tax benefit of $280 million. When we last talked to you in April, we had estimated that this
would be a fiscal fourth quarter event, so this is essentially a change in timing. This resulted in an effective tax rate of
22% in Q3 and shifted $0.12 cents of EPS into the third quarter from the fourth. Based on the shift, we now expect our
tax rate in the fourth quarter to approximate 34%, and for the full year, we are now anticipating a rate between 29% and
30%.
Second, revenue growth of 12% on a nominal basis was significantly higher than we anticipated in spite of continuing
foreign exchange rate headwinds of approximately 3 points in the quarter. Revenue growth outperformance was driven
by sustained high currency volatility that substantially offset the foreign exchange rate headwinds as well as low client
incentive levels than previously assumed.
Third, our expectation for higher client incentive levels in the third quarter did not come to pass due to lower payment
volumes and performance adjustments in specific geographies as well as the timing and impact of certain issuer deal
renewals. Some of these client incentives are shifting to the fourth quarter as these deals are signed. As a result, client
incentives will be higher in the fourth quarter both in dollars and as a percent of gross revenue. Despite this, we now
expect client incentives for the full fiscal year at the low end of the 17.5% to 18.5% range.
Finally, we revalued the Visa Europe put option, taking $110 million noncash non-operating expense. The increase in
value of this liability was a result of an increase in estimated Visa Europe adjusted sustainable income. As a reminder,
US GAAP requires us to estimate the put option liability each quarter.
Moving on to the quarter's business drivers and our financial results. Global payments volume growth in constant
dollars for the June quarter continued to be solid at 11%, in line with the March quarter. The US grew 9% and
international grew 14%. In the June quarter, US credit grew 12%, flat compared to the March quarter as the effects of
the Chase conversion begin to wane. US debit grew at 6% in the June quarter, down about 0.5 points compared to the
March quarter. Gasoline prices continue to have a significant negative impact, reducing growth in aggregate US
payment volume by approximately 3 percentage points. We continue to see the largest share of these savings going to
debt repayment and stronger consumer balance sheets.
International payments volume growth of 14% was powered by China, the Middle East, Southeastern Europe and South
Asia. The modest uptick in growth rates versus last quarter was driven by the initiation of domestic payments volume
reporting by a large Chinese bank. More recently, through July 21, US payments volume growth was 10%, with U.S.
credit growing 12% and debit 8%, not materially different from Q3 trends.
Global cross-border volumes registered their third consecutive quarter of 8% constant dollar growth, though the
international component declined 1 point to 9% compared to the March quarter. As has been the case all year, outbound
corridors of Russia, Canada and Brazil remain challenged. Brazil in particular was hurt both by a weak currency on

issuing and lapping the FIFA World Cup on acquiring. The strong dollar has continued to depress inbound commerce
into the US. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we're monitoring travel into South Korea due to the Middle East
respiratory syndrome virus also known as MERS and the impact on outbound Chinese travel from the recent equity
market correction.
In Venezuela, currency controls have effectively shut down the cross-border business for private banks. The bolivar
continues to depreciate and we have moved to local currency collection. All this will significantly reduce revenues
from our Venezuelan business for the foreseeable future.
On the positive front, outbound US spending remains robust as well as cross-border trends across the rest of Latin
America, Asia-Pacific and the Middle East. Through July 21, cross-border volume on a constant dollar basis grew 8%,
with a U.S. growth rate of 7% and an international growth rate of 8%.
Transactions processed through Visa's network totaled $18 billion in the fiscal third quarter, an 8% increase over the
prior period, but down 3% from the March quarter. The US grew 8% while international delivered 7% growth. As most
of you know, in Russia, we transferred domestic processing to the new national processor, NSPK, in April. This
resulted in an aggregate 2 point decline in processed transaction growth in the June quarter. We expect this drag on
process transaction growth to continue for the next three quarters, approaching almost 3 percentage points each quarter.
Through July 21, processed transaction growth was 8% with a US growth rate of 10% and an international growth rate
of 1%, the international growth rate of course being impacted by Russia.
Now to financial results. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $3.5 billion, a 12% year-over-year increase and was
driven by solid results across all revenue line items. Strong global payments volume drove service revenue to $1.6
billion, up 9% over the prior year. The quarter also benefited from previously announced pricing action. Data
processing revenue was $1.4 billion and grew 6% over the prior year's quarter, based on continued strong growth rates
in Visa process transactions both in the US and internationally.
While on the subject of data processing revenue, let me call out a dynamic associated with the transition of Russia
domestic processing to the NSPK. While we are no longer processing these domestic transactions, we continue to own
the issuer client relationship. For this reason, we will continue to recognize the associated processing revenue in our
data processing revenue line. This will be offset by payments to NSPK for the actual processing, which will flow
through our network and processing expense line. In short, the revenue stays the same as before, but our expenses will
increase.
International transaction revenue grew 21% to $1 billion as the impact from the previously announced pricing action
and higher currency volatility offset soft cross-border volume growth.
As expected, total operating expenses for the quarter were up 11% over the prior year. Higher personnel costs were the
key driver, impacted by above normal employee incentive accruals tied to better than expected year-to-date
performance.
In terms of the fiscal fourth quarter, we still expect net revenue growth to approach double digits despite continuing
foreign exchange rate headwinds and higher client incentive than we had in the third quarter. Expense growth rates will
moderate from Q3 levels with the full-year growth rate coming in as we expected in the mid single digit range, which is
a couple of points higher than current consensus. For fiscal 2015, we now expect to end with double digit constant
dollar net revenue growth and mid-teens adjusted EPS growth.
We were active in the market in the quarter, repurchasing a total of 15.5 million shares at an average price of just over
$68. Fiscal year-to-date, we have purchased 44.1 million shares at a price of just under $66 per share for a total of $2.9
billion. We currently have authorization to repurchase up to $2.8 billion of stock.
Finally some early observations on fiscal 2016. As we look ahead, currency volatility could moderate from record
levels, reducing the revenue contribution of cross-border transactions. We will lose the benefit of recent conversions
and absorb the full-year impact of large deal renewals happening in the fourth quarter. Also, China start-up costs
remain unclear at this time

On the positive front, we're heartened that despite an uncertain global economic environment, payment volume growth
has remained steady and healthy. We hope that as the dollars stabilizes, cross-border growth rates will accelerate and in
the US we will lap the sharp declines in gas prices. We're working through the details of these and other headwinds and
tailwinds and how they might impact us next year. As we always do, we will provide a more comprehensive point of
view when we talk to you again after the fiscal fourth quarter.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Charlie.
Charles W. Scharf
Thank you very much, Vasant, and good afternoon to everyone and thank you all for joining us. I guess let me start by
just reiterating how pleased with are with our quarterly results. As Vasant mentioned, revenue growth of 12% was
better than we anticipated, especially given the FX impact of about negative 3 points. Adjusted net income growth was
33% as our anticipated tax benefit was accelerated to the fiscal third quarter from a previously expected fourth quarter.
Adjusted earnings per share of $0.74 excluding the revaluation of the Visa Europe put option and including $0.12 from
the tax benefit I just mentioned, payments volume growth of 11% on a constant dollar basis, the effect of a strong US
dollar and lower gasoline prices continued to negatively impact growth by 3 points and process transactions and
cross-border volume both grew at 8%.
Overall, our results were especially pleasing given that we continue to see very little change in the overall global
economy with a few exceptions. We are hopeful, but not counting on, an improvement in the US economy, but we see
very little improvement with the US consumer in our numbers thus far, if any. There are positive signs in employment
and housing and the accumulated savings from lower gas prices should help, but we'll have to wait and see.
Internationally, we see continued weakness in Brazil and Russia, but we see strength in Southeastern Europe and parts
of Asia-Pacific.
I'd like for a second to address the topic of Visa Europe for a moment. As you may have read in our earnings press
release and 10-Q filing, we've updated our language regarding the put option valuation, which Vasant just covered.
Separately, we announced that we're in discussions with Visa Europe about a potential business combination. I've said
many times that we believe there is compelling logic for both Visa, Inc. and Visa Europe to merge and is something
that we would like to pursue, so this should not be a surprise to anyone. We're targeting to resolve these discussions
quickly, certainly by the end of October, and we'll provide an update during the fourth quarter earnings call, if not
sooner.
Given these discussions, we may be restricted from buying back our stock. There's also no assurance that any
transaction will ultimately be agreed or implemented. At this time, there's really nothing more we can add and won't
comment beyond what I've said here or disclosed in our 10-Q. Rest assured that when there's an update to be made, we
will do so in a public forum.
Let me move on now and talk about our business, and let me start with our client-related activity, which I feel great
about. Starting with our issuing co-brands, we renewed our co-brand credit card partnership with Southwest Airlines in
the United States. Visa will continue to be the exclusive payment network for Southwest's terrific co-brand credit card.
This renewal is an extension of our 15-year longstanding partnership with Southwest Airlines. It represents one of our
largest and fastest growing co-brand partnerships in the world.
We renewed an important co-brand partnership with Avios, the loyalty program for British Airways and Iberia, a
partnership with Visa covering the United States, Canada, Bermuda and the Caribbean. AAA extended our
longstanding 37-year credit card partnership agreement. We also renewed the credit card portfolio for Wyndham
Rewards, the loyalty program for Wyndham Hotel Group, the world's largest hotel company based on number of
hotels.
And turning to our business internationally, we renewed our strategic credit partnership with Shinhan Card, the largest
issuer in Korea, and Lotte, another top-ten issuer in Korea for debit and credit. SoftBank SB, Japan's third largest

mobile carrier has partnered with Visa to launch a new prepaid card offering to their 37 million subscribers. And
Gazprombank, one of Russia's largest financial institutions, renewed a multi-year debit and credit agreement.
Let me make a couple of comments about China. I don't have very much to add since we last talked about it last
quarter, but I want to reiterate a couple of things. We continue to move forward with our work to enter the domestic
Chinese payments market and look forward to growing our investment within China. Our business model, as you all
know, is about partnership with banks, retailers, governments and technology companies. We believe our ability to help
them grow will help accelerate broader economic growth within China, both in the cities as well as the rural areas. And
we continue to view this as a significant and important opportunity and one which is very long-term in nature.
Vasant talked a little bit about Russia. Here we completed the full migration of our domestic transaction processing to
the NSPK in accordance with the law. As Vasant said, Visa is now only processing cross-border transactions into and
out of Russia.
And our work to transform commerce and build out digital payments platforms to support our clients continues. First,
on Visa Checkout, we continue to gain momentum. We have over 270 financial institution partners globally. We have
over 160,000 merchants who are currently live globally with over $50 billion in total addressable volume. New
merchant partners include US companies such as Under Armour, Taco Bell, Dunkin' Donuts, Williams-Sonoma, Eddie
Bauer, LivingSocial in Canada and Starbucks in Australia. To date, we have over 5 million registered users and we've
launched Visa Checkout in 16 markets around the world. New markets include China, Hong Kong, New Zealand,
Singapore, Brazil, Colombia, the UAE and South Africa, to name a few. We continue to see great reactions from our
merchant clients and have launched several new global marketing campaigns, including with Dunkin' Donuts, zulily
and Fandango in the US and Cineplex Theatres and Indigo Books & Music in Canada.
Second, we continue to expand the Visa Token Service. More than 2,300 financial institutions and banking partners are
participating. In addition, Apple Pay in the US and Google globally. International expansion of our token service will
begin later in the fall within our US, Canada and Asia-Pacific regions and allows us to begin tokenizing Visa Checkout.
Third, we continue to build out our capabilities to support our merchant partners. We're partnering with Verifone in a
way that enables merchants to offer their customers a more streamlined, secured purchase experience across digital and
face-to-face commerce environments. Verifone will connect its point-of-sale gateway to Visa's CyberSource global
merchant payment management platform, providing merchants with a single platform to protect customer payment
data, mitigate fraud and integrate digital and offline payment systems.
Last but equally important is payment security. Obviously, this is an area which is evolving and for us, we're doing
everything we can to differentiate ourself through innovation. Given the current cyber threat landscape, especially
facing merchants, we're committed to developing solutions, help the industry better detect and respond to data
breaches. We announced a partnership with FireEye to bring the first of its kind cyber security capabilities to the
payments industry and extend our combined expertise and intelligence to acquirers, merchants and issuers of all size.
The Visa and FireEye community threat intelligence system will bring together threat information from both
companies, allowing merchants and Visa clients to easily access our leading knowledge of cyber attack data to quickly
detect and respond to the attacks. These new solutions will focus on minimizing risks and vulnerabilities and detecting
and responding to breaches faster.
On a final note regarding FIFA and football, for our investors but also our clients and all of our partners. We view the
stewardship of our company, our brand and our clients with the utmost importance and try to hold ourselves to the
highest standards. We seek to partner with those who think and act like us. I don't believe that FIFA is living up to
these standards. Furthermore, their subsequent responses in my opinion are wholly inadequate and continue to show its
lack of awareness of the seriousness of the changes which are needed. To this end, we believe two things need to
happen to ensure credible reform. First, an independent third party commission led by one or more impartial leaders is
critical to formulate reforms. Second, we believe no meaningful progress can be made under FIFA's existing
leadership. Football itself is a great sport for which we are proud to be associated and we want to be proud to be
associated with FIFA and hope and look forward to working with them to that end.

To close, I just want to reiterate that we are pleased with our financial performance to date. Although we will provide
full-year 2016 metrics next quarter, we feel good about our business, our performance and our innovation initiatives,
which should drive our success in the future. And as a reminder, we have nothing incremental to say about our
discussions with Visa Europe.
With that, Vasant and I are ready to take your questions.
Jack Carsky
Jamie, we're ready for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Togut, Evercore ISI. Sir, your line is now open.
<Q - David Mark Togut>: Thank you. Good afternoon.
<A - Charles W. Scharf>: How are you?
<Q - David Mark Togut>: Very good. Thanks. Could you talk about your strategic options in Europe in the event that
you don't consummate an agreement with Visa Europe? In particular, have you looked at possibly acquiring some of
the domestic payment networks in Europe?
<A - Charles W. Scharf>: Listen, we have, and I've talked about this broadly as well, we have a terrific relationship
with Visa Europe today. We've been operating in the fashion that we've been operating now since we've gone public.
We work closely together on a day in and day out basis. And they have responsibility for the business and brand in
Europe, and we do everything we can to enable them and vice versa. And that's the relationship that we would see
continuing if these transactions, if these conversations didn't move forward.
<Q - David Mark Togut>: Thank you.
<A - Jack Carsky>: Jamie, next question?
Operator
Our next question comes from Chris Brendler, Stifel. Your line is now open.
<Q - Chris C. Brendler>: Hi. Thanks. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to talk about the
strong growth in cross-border revenue this quarter, how sustainable that is and whether or not you see additional
opportunities for pricing down the road. Thanks.
<A - Vasant M. Prabhu>: We had, as you saw, good growth in cross-border. It's a few things. We talked about the
geographies that are doing well and some of the things. We were helped on cross-border revenue growth by two other
things, as you know, pricing and also by currency volatility, so we had spread revenues that flowed through that line.
As we look ahead, I think if the dollar starts to moderate, a big chunk of our business is somewhat depressed right now,
which is the commerce into the US and several corridors are soft like Brazil. It has hurt in a couple of different ways,
Russia, et cetera.
So there is hope as we go into next year that with some of those things now lapping and the dollar hopefully stabilizing
that things could ramp up in terms of volume. On the other hand, volatilities may go back to more normal levels and
would reduce that line. So a couple different trends there but all in all we feel good about it.

<Q - Chris C. Brendler>: Excellent. Fantastic results. Thank you.
<A - Jack Carsky>: Next question, Jamie?
Operator
Our next question comes from Smitti at Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is now open.
<Q - Smittipon Srethapramote>: I know it's early days so far but I was wondering if you could share with us
qualitatively if the transactions that you're seeing taking place on Apple Pay and other mobile payment systems starting
to take share away from cash transactions from consumers who use it? Or is it mainly just a basic substitution of plastic
for mobile at the moment?
<A - Charles W. Scharf>: I honestly don't think we have enough real data yet to talk intelligently about it. All I can
talk about is my own experience, which is I've been using it for both. I mean when we have more acceptance and we
start to see more transactions, we'll have a much better feel and we'll make sure we share that.
<Q>: Okay, fair enough. Thank you.
<A - Jack Carsky>: Next question, Jamie?
Operator
Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis. Your line is now open.
<Q - Lisa D. Ellis>: Hey, guys. Can you talk a little bit about your competitive strategy against PayPal now that they're
independent and to what degree you view them as a competitor and what sort of specific competitive initiatives you
have in place?
<A - Charles W. Scharf>: Sure. I've talked about our relationship with PayPal in the past. I'm not sure it changes very
dramatically whether they're owned as part of a broader company or they're independent. Something like half the
transactions that go through eBay wallets are general purpose cards, of which we're roughly half, and that's important.
But they also have a very big business that they then use our transactions to mine from to disintermediate our client's
relationship with us and the client's relationship with our clients, ultimately which are their banks. And so that's
something which has to evolve and is not something that we think is sustainable for the long term.
Our view is when we think about what we've got to do in the marketplace, we actually don't spend a lot of time
thinking about what PayPal's doing or what we're doing any more or less than we look at all the interesting things that
people are doing in the world of digital commerce. What we're focused on is the fact that we're lucky enough to have a
platform and have a client base where we're a leader in the payments business globally. Commerce is moving to digital
platforms. And forget about all of our competitors or people who want to compete with us, we're doing everything that
we can to ensure that we're going to be as successful in the world of digital commerce as we have been face-to-face.
And so to that end, you see our solutions in the marketplace such as Visa Checkout, which I obviously covered here
and I've talking about elsewhere. But it also relates to all of the other mobile solutions and digital solutions that you've
heard us talk about, everything from our Token Service to the digital enablement program, as well as just even more
broadly opening up API as an access and allowing others to access our services in a way that inserts us as the payments
network into experiences that people are building. So that's what we're focused on and it's very much focused on the
opportunity that exists in the world and not any one individual company out there.
<Q - Lisa D. Ellis>: Terrific. Thanks.

Our next question comes from Bob Napoli, William Blair. Your line is now open.
<Q - Bob P. Napoli>: Thank you. I know you said nothing on Visa Europe and maybe this is something you could
answer. When you did change the valuation on the put option, can you tell us what you're looking at, like what
information you're looking at to change that? And then I know there was a formula out there, put call for buying it. If a
transaction happens, would it be under that previous contract formula?
<A - Vasant M. Prabhu>: Yeah, I'll talk about how we go about the put valuation. And in general, I think we're not
commenting anything on the transaction discussions themselves. But we do have to revalue the put every quarter and it
has to be done on the basis of updated information, the most up-to-date information we have. And based on that, we did
that again this quarter. And as a result of that, we came up with a value that is reflected in our Q. And that is a formula
that we've used I believe for the entire eight years that the put has been in place. And it relates to making estimates of
what sustainable net income would be and then there's a multiple applied to that, all of which is described in some
detail.
So when you run through that based on the best information we now have to estimate sustainable net income for Visa
Europe and you look at the multiples you have to apply, methodology being exactly the same as what we've used
before, you get to the value we laid out in our 10-Q. So, that's pretty much all there is to it. There really isn't anything
different than we've done before.
<A - Charles W. Scharf>: The only thing that I would add to that is that and, as I've referenced, we spend a lot of time
with Visa Europe because we're connected at the hip, and it's very clear that with their change in leadership over the
last year and a half, they have moved to a more commercial model and increased what they would view as the
economics that they are providing for their clients. And that translates through to this view of sustainable income that
we've been able to observe that Vasant just referenced.

Our next question comes from Craig from Autonomous. Your line is now open.
<A - Charles W. Scharf>: Craig, you there?
<Q - Craig J. Maurer>: I'm here. Can you hear me?
<A - Charles W. Scharf>: Hey, Craig, we got you. How are you?
<Q - Craig J. Maurer>: Okay. I had a question on commercial card. We've been seeing weakening trends across
several issuers, including Amex and USB and I was hoping that you could comment on what you're seeing in that
segment.
<A - Vasant M. Prabhu>: Yeah, in general, we had a good quarter on the commercial card. Volume growth in the US
for commercial payments volume is 10% in the June quarter; it continues to perform well. We renewed several
multi-year US and Canadian clients. There's a lot of interest from non-financial institution participants who want to
provide value-added services within the commercial payments industry and these would be things like technology
providers or health care entities and B2B programs, entertainment verticals and so on. So all-in-all, we feel pretty good.
<A - Charles W. Scharf>: The only thing I would add to it is when we look at the detail behind the numbers, you
actually do see a fair amount of divergence based on the type of clients that you have. So clients that are focused on the
oil industry, and it's a long list of them, you do see fairly significant weakness, which is to be expected. But on a
portfolio basis, there are other types of businesses that are performing much better, so overall we do get here in the US
that 10% number, but a lot more differentiation than at least we've seen recently.

One moment. Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani, KBW. Your line is now open.
<Q - Sanjay Sakhrani>: I guess philosophically, I was just wondering if you could just rehash, Charlie, how you
would think about a large M&A transaction and the criteria you would use to assess its value and go forward with the
deal? Thanks.
<A - Charles W. Scharf>: Sure. What we've said consistently is, first of all, we would start with our first preference
would be to grow organically. We've got amazing assets and we've got amazing people here that have built great things
without having to rely a lot on acquisitions. And so that really, and it genuinely is our first and foremost way that we
want to go about building things. Having said that, there are certainly times when it makes sense to buy things. And I
always like to point back to the three things that we've done so far as the type of things that we think could continue to
make sense.
CyberSource was the most significant acquisition that we've done in the payment space, and we're not looking to get
outside the payment space. Things that we do want to strengthen the benefits that our clients get of running transactions
over a core network and CyberSource allowed us to broaden the capabilities that we had in the online space. So just in
the core of the business, but made tremendous sense for us.
We then bought a company called PlaySpan, which at the core of what we got from PlaySpan was technology and
people. And those people and that technology is what built and powers Visa Checkout today. It wasn't for the rest of the
business of PlaySpan. The rest of it was actually very small. And then the Fundamo business, which got us far more
engaged and understanding and brought us some capabilities in the mobile payment space in the emerging markets.
And so as we look at the type of transactions that we're looking at, what we've said is there's Europe. Europe is the big
one that could be on our radar screen because that put exists and because of this compelling logic. And beyond that,
we're mostly focused on smaller things that again would add to the capabilities of the existing network that we have.
<Q - Sanjay Sakhrani>: Is there a specific financial criteria that you would look at?
<A - Charles W. Scharf>: No. No, I think every one of these deals are different. I mean you take the deals that I just
described, you evaluate them differently, including what it would cost you to go build something versus acquiring it
and how much time it would take to get to market and what that would be.
I did not talk about a fourth company, because it's small, but very important that we just acquired called TrialPay,
which inserts us into the merchant-to-merchant offers business. We bought that because we thought it was important to
get in the market sooner, and the time it would take to build it would be much longer than that. So each one of these I
think would have a very different rationale, and if it was a big enough transaction that we would talk about the
economics, we know we would have to have compelling logic, both strategically and financially for you all.

Our next question comes from Darrin Peller, Barclays. Sir, your line is now open.
<Q - Darrin D. Peller>: Straightforward but just one question. I mean it looks like, I think we saw a shelf was filed, so
whether or not something actually happens with Visa Europe, can you just remind us again on how you think about
balance sheet flexibility, or debt leverage possibilities? And then really just in terms of capital structure and use of
cash, I think you mentioned there could be restrictions on buybacks. Is that included in your guidance for the year?
Thanks, guys.
<A - Vasant M. Prabhu>: Yeah, in terms of Visa Europe transactions, if it happens, should it happen, when it
happens, we've always that said we would be viewing that transaction as an opportunity to do two things at one thing at
a time. Clearly it's a great transaction in terms of reuniting the Visa family. But beyond that, we would also use that as
the trigger to put in place a long-term capital structure. And I don't think our views on that have changed much. In
terms of the second question, Jack, was there another question on that one?
<Q - Darrin D. Peller>: It was around buybacks, and whether or not it's included.
<A - Vasant M. Prabhu>: Oh, on buybacks. Yes, as you know, there are certain rules under which companies can or
cannot buy back stock depending on the information that is either available or not, and how material it is and all of that.
And it is our sense at this point that we might not be able to buy back stock in the quarter, but things can change.
<Q - Darrin D. Peller>: Is that in your guidance already?
<A - Vasant M. Prabhu>: In terms of our, it's impact on our guidance. If we end up not buying back stock for the
entire quarter, if that's what happens, it'll have some modest impact on this year. It will certainly have some impact on
next year, depending on whether we cash out later on and so on. So there's a fair number of variables there. It depends
on how long we're not buying and how fast we catch up, all those kinds of things.
<A - Charles W. Scharf>: For one quarter it's not that material.
<A - Vasant M. Prabhu>: Yeah, for one quarter as you can run the numbers yourselves, it won't be that significant,
but it is certainly different than what we might have expected when we last talked to you, so you should definitely
factor that in.
<Q - Darrin D. Peller>: All right. Thanks, guys.

Our next question comes from Dan Perlin, RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
<Q - Daniel R. Perlin>: I want to revisit a comment you made earlier about, let's just say, competitors who use your
information to mine data to ultimately change behavior away from your bank partners. And I'm just wondering, would
the operating rules that you set forth in VDEP be a means with which to preclude that practice from happening?
<A - Charles W. Scharf>: Well, in VDEP, VDEP does address the usage of our client's data. So the answer to the
question is absolutely. I think the reality is, we sit between a series of people that participate in the payment system. It
used to be just the issuers and the acquirers and the merchants. Now there are additional parties being introduced to
that. And we do think it is our responsibility to all of our clients to ensure that data is being used appropriately and the
way they want. And that's two ways. So whether it's issuer data that passes over our network, the issuers should be
comfortable with. And if it's merchant data that happens to pass over our network, the same is true there. So VDEP is
one means. But it's a broader concept that we do take very seriously.
<Q - Daniel R. Perlin>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Vasant M. Prabhu>: Just want to clarify if I wasn't clear earlier that when we talked about our full-year mid
teens, that does envision the possibility that we might not be buyers of our stock in the fourth quarter.

<A - Jack Carsky>: Jamie, next question?
Operator
Our next question comes from Jason from Jefferies. Your line is now open.
<Q - Jason Alan Kupferberg>: Thanks, guys. Just a clarification and a question. Clarification is just on the revenue
guidance for the year. Is there any minor tweak up here at all? Because I know you are still saying kind of low double
digits, but I think you had been saying the low end of low double digits previously. I'm not sure if I heard that same
language on today's call. Whereas the only change in the revenue outlook, just the extra 0.5 points of currency
headwind.
<A - Vasant M. Prabhu>: Yeah, we were sort of rounding down to 2% last quarter. We're rounding up to 2.5%. So the
currency effect as you know has been growing through the year. I think the only thing we would say is the third quarter
came in clearly better than we expected because currency volatilities were higher. The incentive piece moved some into
the fourth quarter. So I think as we said earlier, incentive levels both in dollar and rate terms, percent terms, will be
higher in the fourth quarter. So we said last time that we would expect revenue to approach double digits in the fourth
quarter, and that is still our best estimate for the fourth quarter.
<Q - Jason Alan Kupferberg>: Okay. And then just a clarification is on the incentive adjustments in certain
geographies that I think you mentioned as one of the reasons why the incentive line came in lower than expected. What
exactly was that? Did some issuers have to pay back some incentives to Visa?
<A - Vasant M. Prabhu>: Well, it's a couple situations that varies depending on the geography. Volumes don't come
in as expected, so they don't earn the incentives that we or they might have expected. So it hits you both on the gross
revenue line and net revenue line and on the incentive line. And then in a particular, a few situations, there are unique
things in contracts that are resolved within the quarter, so you know.
<A - Charles W. Scharf>: It's also just flat out timing of when things get signed. Remember so when we – you know
that's a little bit of – I like to talk about this internally. Just we have to do budgets and we give you guidance, but we
really don't know as we look out in the future what the timing of our clients are going to be and how different
negotiations will actually take place. So when we come to an agreement with a client, it then needs to be documented.
The processes and the timing is usually driven by them. Very often they need to go through their own approvals, and
it's very, very easy for these things to slip by weeks or even a month if not more, depending on how far out we're
looking. And so that's just a very natural thing that happens, which hard for us to predict and hard for us to control.
<A - Vasant M. Prabhu>: Yeah, and this quarter, we had a few international banks that moved into the fourth quarter,
and they'll get done in the fourth quarter. And that's the timing issue.
<Q - Jason Alan Kupferberg>: Okay. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Hi, guys. Vasant, I just wanted to ask can you help us quantify the impact price changes had
on the quarter and maybe what percentage of the price changes have showed up in the third, and do we expect the full
impact in the fourth?
<A - Vasant M. Prabhu>: Yeah. We told you last time, there'll be some modest additional impact in the fourth
quarter. One of the price changes was coming in with a little bit of a lag. So there'll be a modest, it's a small uptick in
price impact. But yeah, I don't think we've specifically quantified the price impact in total, but it takes two lines, the
service revenue line and the international line. And it's those two price increases we took, just to remind everybody, it's
the increase in the US acquirer service fee on all credit products which went up by 2 basis points and the international

And there'll be a little more impact in the fourth quarter than there was in the third.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Okay. Helpful. Just one quick one. Will the intangibles associated if there is an acquisition of
Visa Europe will be amortized or will it be long-lived?
<A - Vasant M. Prabhu>: Well, that is getting very far ahead of things right now. If there is a transaction, if and
when, and once the details can, are clear, we can talk about all of that.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: All right. Super. Thanks, guys.
<A - Jack Carsky>: Next question.
Operator
Our next question comes from Glenn Greene from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.
<Q - Glenn E. Greene>: Thank you, just wanted to go back to the incentives conversation. Obviously it was lower
than I think most of us thought in the quarter. And it sounded like it was timing. Did some of that timing kind of bleed
into next year? And I don't know, Vasant, if you we're starting to try to call out that incentives as a percentage of gross
revenue increased going into fiscal 2016. And just to clarify, did you have incentives meaningful for Costco or does
that kind of happen when the volumes come on?
<A - Vasant M. Prabhu>: Yeah, I think it's too early to give you any particular point of view on 2016. We'll do that
when we talk to you in October, and we'll also talk about Costco and its impact on 2016 and so on. As it stands today,
the incentives, the deals we were thinking we would get done this year still look like they're going to get done this year.
So we'll probably see the full year impact of them next year, but it doesn't seem like any of them are moving into next
year at this point.
<A - Charles W. Scharf>: The only thing I would add is just on Costco for a second is Costco, the impact to us of
Costco is next year for us fiscally. So that's whether it's incentives, whether it's volume, revenue associated with it,
that's when you'll see the impact of Costco. And then the other thing I would add is we've, those of you that have been
covering us for a long time know this, we do view our incentives going up as a good thing. It's incentives go up when
we're driving more business through the system and so that wouldn't be a surprise to us.
<Q - Glenn E. Greene>: Okay. Great. Thanks for the clarification.
<A - Jack Carsky>: Next question, Jamie?
Operator
Our next question comes from Kevin from Macquarie. Your line is now open.
<Q - Kevin D. McVeigh>: Great. Thank you. I wonder is there any type of sensitivity to think about relative to the FX
volatility in terms of a certain band of volatility, how it impacts the revenue. Because obviously we've seen a nice
pickup, and not to get 2016 specific, but just any band in terms of how it impacts the revenue?
<A - Vasant M. Prabhu>: Yeah I mean there's two dimensions here, and in this quarter you probably saw both
dimensions at play. One, I believe there's publicly available information on currency volatilities and different metrics
you can look at. So at least you can get a relative sense of how currency volatility is doing versus last year or prior
quarter or on a multi-year basis and so on. And it's been high. The other thing that also had an impact on this quarter
was the year-over-year comparison. This was a quarter where not only were volatilities high in this quarter this year,
but they were unusually low or lower than they've been recently in the third quarter of last year. So we sort of benefited
from both things when you look at a year-over-year comparison. But you can look at external data to track some of this.

Next question comes from Ken Bruce of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
<Q - Kenneth Bruce>: Thank you. Good evening. My question relates to the co-brand partnerships and the just
general issuing partnerships and it really is independent of any one, but I guess if you could step back and look at,
there's been a lot of discussion about the increasing competitiveness on some of these deals. And I'm hoping you might
be willing to share some observations from your position at the table as to how the balance of power, if you will, is
shifting, if there's any clear kind of direction of who's capturing more of the economics or just how things have evolved
over the last couple of years.
<A - Charles W. Scharf>: Sure. Listen, I think co-brands are certainly a very competitive part of the business,
especially here in the United States. We've been lucky enough to have a significant number of the large and successful
ones. And so when you're the big incumbent and they come up for renewal, they're always on your mind and you're
very tuned to what's going on in the competitive environment.
But just as we talk about on the issuer side, people ask about, well, is the issuer side getting more competitive in terms
of the way networks think about it. And I think the reality is since we've gone public, there's been an extraordinary
amount of competition between us and our competitors on these deals. And you see that competition embedded in the
numbers that we've all been printing for years now. So the answer is, yes, you see it in the co-brand space, but I also
think that the co-brand business and the issuing side of the business, there has been more concentration that has
developed.
And the other thing which I think is becoming quite important now is with the evolving nature of payments and things
that are going on, whether it's issuers or co-brands, I think what we wind up seeing is that our clients are making very
significant strategic decisions at this point relative to who they want their payments partner to be. They're not talking
about this as a commodity. They're not talking about just network services as something that you need to look at in
terms of just what the price is. They're sitting there saying payments is an important part of my business, whether I'm a
co-brand partner, because these are my most important clients, or on the issuing side, where they say payments this
quarter, what I do, I need someone that's going to help me navigate and be successful in this brave new world of digital
commerce and evolving payments that we live in and I need to pick the very best partner to do that.
So we're thrilled with the success that we've had, not just with Costco, but Southwest, as you've seen, is a terrific
partner, and other conversations that we have ongoing. And so the answer is, yes, financially they are competitive,
again we've seen that. That's to be expected. But there are two parts to the conversation.

<A - Charles W. Scharf>: So on the first piece, the answer is no. What has been published is helpful relative to what
we need to do in order to do the work to apply for a license to start establishing the functions that have to reside in
China. So those have been very, very helpful. Relative to how regulations evolve and what the actual business would
look like in China, that's a ways off and we do not have a tremendous amount of clarity on that yet.
And I'm sorry, what was the second part of the question?
<Q - James Schneider>: The timing for when you get more clarity.
<A - Charles W. Scharf>: I don't know. No one knows. We live here in the United States and so we know our own
system quite well and we never know what timing looks like in this country. But listen, I think the Chinese government
has been, the State Council issued its decision. They've come out with some more information, which is certainly
helpful. And at this point, we have plenty of information to do the work that we need to do to be in a position to apply
for a license and to do the work. And honestly, that's what we're focused on. I mean, there's a lot of work for us to do,
both to make the application but also be in a position to be able to operate, if we're lucky enough to be issued one of
those licenses, and that's what we're focused on.
And as I said, when we talk about this being a long-term opportunity, it's for some of these reasons you point out. We
don't know exactly what the regulatory climate will ultimately be. We don't know exactly the role we will play until we
actually get there. But we do believe that there's great value for all the participants in the marketplace for us to be
helpful. So we feel very good about what we can do in the country and what it means for us in the long term, but again
it'll likely be long term and not short term.

Our next question comes from Mr. Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: Great. Thanks. Good quarter here. I just wanted to ask on the delta from your reported 12%
revenue growth and the 6% to 7% you expected. Can you break it down for us by component, what each driver was in
terms of how big it was? I heard FX volatility, lower incentives. Did pricing stick maybe better than expected? Things
like that.
<A - Vasant M. Prabhu>: No, I'd say you got them. Volatility is normally going into a quarter, we don't assume that
volatilities will stay at the sort of the high levels they were last quarter. We assume things may settle down a bit, which
they actually might in the fourth quarter given things are settling down in Greece and settling down in China and places
like that. So it was the spread revenues from volatility. It was somewhat lower incentives. It was offset by exchange
rates. So you've got all the factors. Pricing didn't have an impact relative to what our expectations were. It was as we
expected. So I think you've said it.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: Okay. And so did you size the FX volatility and how big that was? And then also separately,
on OpEx, were there any one-timers that drove up the OpEx, or was that really just personnel? Thanks for taking the
questions.
<A - Vasant M. Prabhu>: Yeah, on the OpEx as we said, the year is progressing better than we might have expected,
and so we made some adjustments as we normally do at this time of the year in accruals for incentive compensation.
That would probably be the single biggest item that shows up in the expense growth. Other than that, the only thing I
said in my comments was that we had exchange rate impacts of up to 3 points. And fortunately, the currency volatility
stayed at levels that offset a significant portion of that.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: Offset them. Okay, bulk of that. Got it. Thanks so much.

All right. Our last question will be coming from David from Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.
<Q - David Hochstim>: Yeah, thanks. Maybe I have a two-part question then. Is there any update on the EU's efforts
to regulate inbound cross-border fees? And a follow up.
<A - Charles W. Scharf>: There's no update.
<Q - David Hochstim>: Okay.
<A - Charles W. Scharf>: Part two?
<Q - David Hochstim>: Yes, maybe just expand on what you said about US credit payments volume growth, and how
much of the deceleration was Chase conversion related, and what you're seeing in the way of discretionary spending
relative to last quarter.
<A - Vasant M. Prabhu>: Really no change whatsoever in terms of what we're seeing. There's a big impact on debit
from the gas pricing because, I think three to one people use debit cards rather than credit cards. And yes, the Chase
conversion will continue to moderate and will mostly be gone I think after the next quarter or so. And that will mean
that our credit payment volumes will reflect whatever the gas impact is. And the gas impact will also begin to moderate
as we lap it. But in terms of how people are deploying their savings from gas, there really hasn't been any change, and I
think Charley referred to that in his comments. So the US consumer remains sort of okay, not great.
