MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to Accenture's Third Quarter Fiscal 2016 Earnings
Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer
session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being
recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, KC McClure. Please go ahead.
KC McClure
Thank you, Roxanne, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today on our third quarter fiscal 2016 earnings
announcement. As Roxanne just mentioned, I'm KC McClure, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations.
With me today are Pierre Nanterme, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and David Rowland, our Chief
Financial Officer.
We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago. Let me quickly outline the
agenda for today's call. Pierre will begin with an overview of our results. David will take you through the financial
details, including the income statement and balance sheet, along with some key operational metrics for the third
quarter. Pierre will then provide a – for the fourth quarter key operational metrics – excuse me – for the third quarter.
Pierre will then provide a brief update on our market positioning before David provides our business outlook for the
fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2016. We will then take your questions before Pierre provides a wrap up at the end of
the call.
As a reminder, when we discuss revenues during today's call, we're talking about revenues before reimbursements or
net revenues.

Some of the matters we'll discuss on this call, including our business outlook, are forward-looking, and as such, are
subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to risk factors set forth in today's news
release and discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings.
These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in this call.
During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful
information for investors. We include reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures, where appropriate, to GAAP in
our news release or in the Investor Relations section of our website at accenture.com. As always, Accenture assumes no
obligation to update the information presented on this conference call.
Now, let me turn the call over to Pierre.
Pierre Nanterme
Thank you, KC, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We are very pleased with our third quarter financial results
and the strong momentum we have built in our business. I am particularly pleased that we again delivered double-digit
revenue growth in local currency, gaining significant market share. Our results clearly demonstrate that we are
executing our strategy very well, further differentiating Accenture in the marketplace.
Here are a few highlights from the quarter. We delivered strong new bookings of $9.1 billion, bringing that to $26.4
billion for the year-to-date. We generated very strong revenue growth of 10% in local currency. Operating margin was
15.5%, an expansion of 10 basis points from adjusted operating margin in the third quarter last year.
We delivered earnings per share of $1.41, up 8% from adjusted EPS in the third quarter last year. We generated strong
free cash flow of $1.5 billion and we returned $1.2 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and
dividends. So, we have delivered excellent third quarter results. And as we enter the fourth quarter, I feel very good
about our business, and I am confident in our ability to deliver our business outlook for the year.
Now, let me hand over to David. David, over to you.
David P. Rowland
Thank you, Pierre, and thanks to all of you for joining us on today's call. As you heard in Pierre's comments, our third
quarter results were strong across almost every dimension of our business. Once again, our results demonstrate the
power of our highly-differentiated growth strategy, which is built on five businesses delivered in an industry-relevant
context and focused on being the market leader in helping our clients rotate to the New.
Looking at our results at a high level, there are a few major themes which I think are important to note. First, 10% local
currency growth marks the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. These results were a strong indication
of the durability of our growth model, which is underpinned by our focus on achieving market-leading scale across our
key industries and geographic markets.
This is best illustrated by our broad-based growth in the third quarter, which reflected double-digit growth in eight
industries and eight geographic markets, and strong double-digit growth in the New, especially in digital-related
services, continue to be a key driver of our results.
Second, operating margin of 15.5%, 10 basis points higher than last year's adjusted results, was consistent with our
objective to deliver modest margin expansion while investing significantly in our people and our business.
Our profitability agenda is enabled by our drive to achieve fit-for-purpose economics across each of our five
businesses. We're pleased with our progress year-to-date, which has yielded 10 basis points of operating margin
expansion and 10% growth in EPS on an adjusted basis, while, at the same time, creating the capacity to make
important investments for long-term market leadership.

Third, as expected, we generated strong free cash flow in the quarter of $1.5 billion and returned roughly $1.2 billion to
shareholders through repurchases and dividends. We're well-positioned to deliver free cash flow in excess of net
income for the full year. And importantly, we continue to invest to acquire scale and capabilities in key growth areas,
investing roughly $835 million across 11 acquisitions through the third quarter.
So, we're very pleased with our results in quarter three, which combined with our first half results, position us very well
to achieve all of our key financial objectives for the year.
With that said, let's get into the details, starting with new bookings. New bookings were $9.1 billion for the quarter.
Consulting bookings were $4.9 billion, with a book-to-bill of 1.1. Outsourcing bookings were $4.2 billion, also with a
book-to-bill of 1.1. We're very pleased with our overall new bookings, particularly in Consulting, which represented
the second highest new bookings quarter following the record set in quarter two.
Looking at bookings by business, our new bookings results were highlighted by strong demand in Operations, which
had an estimated book-to-bill of 1.4. Strategy and Consulting services combined had an estimated book-to-bill above
1.0, well within our target book-to-bill range. And Application Services had a book-to-bill of 1.0. Across the board,
digital-related services continued to be a significant driver.
Additionally, we had 10 clients with new bookings in excess of $100 million. And year-to-date, we've delivered $26.4
billion in new bookings, reflecting 9% growth in local currency.
Turning to revenues, net revenues for the quarter were $8.4 billion, a 9% increase in USD, and 10% in local currency,
reflecting a foreign exchange headwind of slightly less than 2%. Our Consulting revenues for the quarter were $4.6
billion, up 12% in USD and 14% in local currency. And our Outsourcing revenues were $3.8 billion, up 4% in USD
and 6% in local currency.
The trends in revenue growth across our business dimensions were very similar to last quarter. Strategy and Consulting
services combined posted another quarter of strong double-digit growth. Operations again had double-digit growth, and
Application Services grew high single digits. And across those four businesses, digital-related services were a
significant contributor to growth, with estimated growth in the range of 30%.
Taking a closer look at our operating groups, Products led all operating groups with 16% growth, reflecting strong
overall momentum in the business. Growth continued to be broad-based, with double-digit growth across all industries
and geographies. H&PS grew 12% in the quarter, driven by very strong growth in North America and the growth
markets as well as in the Health business. We're also pleased with strong growth in Public Service, especially in North
America and the growth markets.
Financial Services also grew 12%, led by very strong growth overall in banking and capital markets, with solid growth
across all other dimensions. Communications, Media & Technology delivered strong growth of 8%, which was
consistent with our expectations. From an industry perspective, electronics and high-tech, as well as media and
entertainment, continued their strong double-digit growth. Communications revenue was flat, driven by modest
declines in Europe and North America, offset by double-digit growth in the growth markets.
Lastly, Resources grew 1% in the quarter. The two divergent trends within Resources continued with utilities, again,
delivering strong double-digit growth across all three geographic regions, while energy and chemicals and natural
resources remain challenged due to cyclical headwinds.
Moving down the income statement, gross margin for the quarter was 31.9% compared to 32.5% in the same period last
year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 11.1% compared with 11.3% for the third quarter last year.
General and administrative expense was 5.3% compared to 5.8% for the same quarter last year.
As a reminder in quarter three of last year, we recorded a non-cash settlement charge as a result of an offer to former
employees to receive a voluntary lump-sum cash payment from our U.S. pension plan. The following comparisons
exclude the impact and reflect adjusted results.

Operating income was $1.3 billion in the third quarter, reflecting a 15.5% operating margin, up 10 basis points
compared with quarter three last year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.5% compared with an effective tax
rate of 25.7% in the third quarter last year. Net income was $950 million for the third quarter compared with net
income of $889 million for the same quarter last year. Our diluted earnings per share were $1.41 compared with EPS of
$1.30 in the third quarter last year, reflecting 8% year-over-year growth.
Turning to DSOs, our days services outstanding were 41 days compared to 39 days last quarter and 37 days in the third
quarter of last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.5 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating
activities of $1.6 billion net of property and equipment additions of $94 million. Moving to our level of cash, our cash
balance at May 31 was $3.5 billion compared with $4.4 billion at August 31.
Turning to some other key operational metrics, we ended the quarter with global head count of over 375,000 people.
Our utilization was 91% compared to 90% last quarter, and attrition which excludes involuntary terminations was 15%,
up 2% from quarter two and consistent with the same period last year.
With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the third quarter, we repurchased or redeemed
4.3 million shares for $478 million at an average price of $112.44 per share. As of May 31, we had approximately $5.9
billion of share repurchase authority remaining.
Finally, as Pierre mentioned, on May 13, 2016, we made our second semiannual dividend payment for fiscal 2016 in
the amount of $1.10 per share, bringing total dividend payments for the fiscal year to approximately $1.4 billion. So,
with three quarters in the books, we're very pleased with our results and we're now focused on quarter four and closing
out a strong year.
Let me turn it back over to Pierre.
Pierre Nanterme
Thank you, David. Our very strong results in this quarter demonstrate that we are executing the right growth strategy
and that we are providing highly relevant services to our clients. We are benefiting from the investments we've made to
rotate our business to the new digital cloud and security-related services, which together now account for
approximately 40% of our total revenues.
Let me share with you example of how we are leading in the New. We continue to see strong demand for our Digital
capabilities, and we were very pleased that Accenture Interactive was recognized by Advertising Age magazine as the
largest and fastest-growing provider of digital marketing services. Through Accenture Interactive, we are bringing a
unique combination of design and customer experience capabilities to 70 companies in the Fortune Global 100.
In cloud, we are focused on building strong platforms for key industries, such as our Life Science Cloud for R&D. This
truly innovative solution to collect, share, and analyze clinical data is now being used by seven top pharma companies,
including Pfizer, Merck, GSK, and Lilly to accelerate drug development and improve patient outcome.
In security, we're expanding our capabilities with the acquisition of Maglan, a cybersecurity company based in Israel,
with strong expertise in cyber defense. And we just opened a new Accenture lab in Israel that is dedicated to cyber
R&D in threat intelligence, incident response, and Internet of Things security. This is all about helping clients become
more resilient in today's digital world.
We continue to see strong demand from clients to help them with their most complex mission-critical issues. In
Accenture Strategy, we have developed a unique approach to help clients make sustainable improvement in their
enterprise-wide platforms. We are now a leader in this space with a totally new zero-based methodology, which we
have delivered with excellent results at many consumer goods companies, including Unilever and Mondelnz. We are
now taking this approach to clients in healthcare, retail, and Financial Services.
We continue to invest across our business to drive growth and further differentiate Accenture in the marketplace.
During the quarter, we announced two acquisitions. We are taking the majority stake in IMJ, one of the Japan's leading

digital agency; and we acquired OPS Rules, an analytics consulting company, to expand our capability in machine
learning, supply chain, and operations analytics.
We continue to collaborate with leading players in the technical system to further strengthen our capabilities in
cutting-edge technologies. We work with IPsoft, a market leader in artificial intelligence, to launch a new practice
focused on its virtual agent platform which is called Amelia. Our new practice will help clients leverage artificial
intelligence to realize efficiency gains and generate new growth opportunities.
And we continue to invest to drive even more innovation and productivity in our Global Delivery Network. We
launched a new intelligence automation platform called Accenture myWizard to deliver smarter and more efficient
application services. We are already using myWizard with more than 200 clients to drive productivity improvements.
Turning to the geographic dimension of our business. I continue to be very pleased with the strong and balanced roles
we are driving across all three of our geographic regions and especially in our largest markets. In North America, we
delivered 11% revenue growth in local currency, driven by double-digit growth once again in the United States,
bringing us to eight quarters in a row of double-digit growth in the U.S.
In Europe, we delivered 12% revenue growth in local currency. I'm particularly pleased that almost all of our largest
markets generated double-digit growth, including the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Germany, and
France. And in growth markets, we grew revenues 6% in local currency, led primarily by double-digit growth in Japan
as well as strong double-digit growth in China, India, and Mexico.
Before I turn it back to David, I want to reflect on a couple of Accenture growth trends that are particularly important
to our future growth. The first is our portfolio of intellectual property. Over the years, we have made a significant
investment and now have more than 5,000 patents and patent-pending applications in areas such as artificial
intelligence, cybersecurity, drones, virtual agents, Internet of Things, and other platforms. Our intellectual property is
an important asset which drive differentiation and value in the marketplace.
Second is our brand and I am proud that Accenture was just ranked number 38 on BrandZ Top 100 Most Valuable
Global Brands, our highest ever on this list. Again, our brands transcends our unique positioning in the marketplace and
drives significant competitive advantage. It reflects the trust our clients place in us and enables us to attract top talent.
So, with the first three quarters of the year behind us, I'm very pleased with our performance. We have very good
momentum in our business and I feel confident that we are well-positioned to deliver a strong fiscal year 2016.
With that, I will turn the call over to David to provide our updated business outlook. David, over to you.
David P. Rowland
Thank you, Pierre. Let me now turn to summarize our business outlook. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect
revenues to be in the range of $8.25 billion to $8.5 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be negative 1%
compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and reflects an estimated 6% to 9% growth in local currency.
For the full fiscal year 2016, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we now assume the
impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be negative 4.5% compared to fiscal 2015. For the full fiscal 2016, we
now expect our net revenue to be in the range of 9.5% to 10.5% growth in local currency over fiscal 2015. For
operating margin, we now expect fiscal year 2016 to be 14.6%, a 10-basis-point expansion over adjusted fiscal 2015
results.
As a reminder, we closed our Navitaire transaction last quarter, which lowered the full-year FY 2016 tax rate by
approximately 1.5%, and increased diluted earnings per share by $0.74. Our guidance for fiscal 2016 excludes the
impact of this transaction. We continue to expect our adjusted annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 24% to
25%.

For earnings per share, we now expect full-year diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2016 to be in the range of $5.29 to
$5.33, or 10% to 11% growth over adjusted fiscal 2015 results.
Turning to cash flow, for the for the full fiscal 2016, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of
$4.1 billion to $4.4 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $500 million, and free cash flow to
continue to be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion.
Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $4 billion through dividends and share repurchases and also continue to
expect to reduce the weighted average diluted shares outstanding in the range of 1.5% as we remain committed to
returning a substantial portion of cash to our shareholders.
With that, let's open it up so that we can take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Bryan Keane, Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Hi, guys. Good morning.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Morning.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Operating margin guidance to start the year, I think, was 10 to 30 basis points, which has kind
of been your historical practice. This year, it sounds like you guys will only do 10 basis points expansion. Just want to
make sure I understand why the low end this year, and does that change anything going forward about your historical
typical practice of 10 to 30 basis points of expansion.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah. So, Bryan, if you look at the 10 to 30 basis points, as you well know and the others
know, that has been kind of our target range for many years now. And if you look at our results over the last five years,
we've kind of covered the full scope of that range, including having been at 10 basis points expansion at least once, if
not twice, in that period, and I think one year being at 30 basis points. So we've covered the expanse of that range. And
so coming in at 10 basis points this year isn't inconsistent with kind of our historical performance.
Having said that, if you look at where we are year-to-date, we're at 10 basis points of expansion through the first three
quarters. And so, at this point, based on what we see, it just feels very clear to us that we are trending in that direction.
I think the important point to note, and this is different about this year versus other years where we've been at 10 basis
points of expansion, is that we embarked on a journey, especially a few years ago, to really raise our game in the
investments that we're making in our business, including, but not limited to, the significant capital investments that
we've made in acquisitions, which also flow through our P&L.
And so, when you look at the 10 basis points, it really is a direct intention of what we're trying to accomplish by
positioning our business for the long-term, by investing at a scale that is truly differentiated in our sector and positions
us for long-term leadership. And so, we're actually very pleased with the 10 basis points of expansion in that it, on one
hand, supports, we believe, double-digit growth in EPS, but, on the other hand, underneath it, it represents significant
investments that we're making in our business and our people.
And the last comment that I'll make is that if you were to look at our underlying margin expansion, excluding the
investments, the underlying margin expansion is quite healthy and would compare very favorably to what we've done
in any previous year. So, we feel great about the economic leverage in our model, and we feel great about the focus that
we've had on investing.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Okay, great. And then just a quick follow-up, at the Analyst Day, I think you mentioned the
potential to hire around 100,000 gross heads. It doesn't look like you guys are on track for that. I just was looking for an
update maybe on gross hires for the fiscal year. Thanks so much and congrats on the quarter.

<A - David P. Rowland>: Thank you, Bryan. I think last year, we commented that our hiring was going to be over
100,000. This year, we'll be less than 100,000. And I might add that we are quite pleased with that result. We view that
as a positive outcome in the way we are able to, let's say, moderate our head count growth in recent quarters, while, at
the same time, supporting continued strong top line growth. I mean, That's an equation that we like.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Thanks so much.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of David Grossman, Stifel Financial. Please go ahead.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Good morning, David
<Q - David Grossman>: Hi. Good morning. Thank you. I was just wondering if we could just kind of look at the
overall business. Recently, we've talked about the ebb and flow of the business and the shifting priorities, which has
favored consulting growth versus outsourcing. Can you help us understand whether that trend continues at the same
rate or whether that's beginning to equalize?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yeah. If you look at our business and, indeed, these last few years, all the industry in all the
markets are under significant transformation. They want to transform their business in the different industry to what we
call rotate to the New in all the digital space. They want as well to improve their operational efficiency, and they want
to implement new capabilities.
So at the end of the day, if you look at the nature of the transformation of our industries, they are more related to
consulting type of services. I mean, this is the nature of the demand, because of the unique nature of the transformation
in the industries. If you look back few years ago, where outsourcing was going to be stronger, it was actually linked to
the fact that you have less need for true industry transformation and the innovative play. And the industries were more
looking for straightforward efficiency gains and, to some extent or a great extent, the natural answer we provided at
Accenture to straightforward efficiency gain through around the outsourcing, the labor arbitrage, more productivity,
tackling the cost in operation and in IT.
So I feel this natural shift from a bit less of outsourcing to a bit more of consulting is reflecting the true nature of the
transformation in the industries. And by the way, we feel extremely good about our positioning in this rotation, if you
will, based on our industry knowledge, based on the investments we made in rotating to the New, and based on the fact
that we still have significant capability and great scale to tackle the cost efficiency programs from our clients.
<Q - David Grossman>: So, no real material change in the pace, Pierre, of how that's migrating through the market?
<A - David P. Rowland>: We see that trend continuing. Yeah.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yeah. I mean, definitely we see that trend continuing. [ph] I mean, you have cycle. We are in
sort of a (28:59) cycle of transformation for all the reasons we all know around the call, and I guess this cycle will
continue as long as the industries will be in this transformational phase.
<Q - David Grossman>: All right, very good. Thanks. Just one quick follow-up, I'm wondering if you could just
quickly contrast your comment about IP and how you view IP at Accenture versus perhaps how a product company
views IP.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yeah. I mean, very pleased. I mean, for us, IP is very important, and that's why I wanted in
that call to put the attention on our IP portfolio. That's something we've been talking a lot. We have so many things to
discuss with all of you. But we've been very active from an IP standpoint and especially as again we are in a phase of
reinvention and in a phase of innovation; reinvention, innovation equal intellectual property building.

And for us, we are building intellectual property in many things, and you're right, it's more than products or sometime
we feel that IP equals software or application product, and IP could be behind processes, operating models. There are a
lot of things you can – methodologies, [ph] approaches, paths of solutions (30:27) and this is all what we do. And I was
quite impressed recently when I've been reviewing our IP portfolio with our 5,000 patents or patent-pending activities,
and I felt that it would be good for me to share that with all of you as again an element where Accenture is quite on top
of its game in order to drive innovation and to protect, more important, our innovation inside Accenture for the benefits
of our clients and for the benefits of our investors.

The next question is from the line of Joseph Foresi, Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.
<Q - Joseph Foresi>: Hi. My first question here is what are the challenges in growing Digital at this point? Do you
think the growth rate can keep up there and are you finding enough talent? And maybe even some color on the margins
in that business would be great.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Good question. So far so good. It's – every day, we're working on it at Accenture and as you
see, we've been extraordinarily active these last few years, certainly three, four years. Every day, we are taking actions.
These actions [ph] have been rolled, (31:44) if you will, in order to lead in the New, as you need skills and capabilities
and we've been very active from a talent standpoint, all the credit to our operating group leads, but as well to Ellyn
Shook, I would like to recognize during the call here, our Chief HR Officer leading all our talent agenda and we are
very active. I would like as well to recognize Roxanne Taylor from a brand standpoint, because brand is absolutely key
in attracting talents. And that's why I wanted as well in that call to put some emphasis on the brand because it's very
important in our strategy to attract talent.
Of course, we've been very active from an acquisition standpoint. You've seen us raising our game these last four years
and this is our objective to continue with that phase moving forward as long as we could find relevant companies,
relevant acquisitions that will bring their capabilities.
But we need to continue as well to invest from an organic standpoint. We develop our own platforms, thinking about
the Accenture Cloud Platform and thinking about Accenture [ph] currency platform (33:00) in analytics, in marketing,
and so forth.
So, we are very active across the path of Digital. Of course, as you will see for us, Digital is covering Interactive,
Mobility, Analytics, Cloud, Security, we are even now considering the next play and thinking about artificial
intelligence. So, so far, I feel good. You're right to ask the question. It's a kind of everyday commitment from
Accenture to invest in the New and to lead in the New, and I'm pleased with the momentum we are creating, and I see
that continuing.
<Q - Joseph Foresi>: Okay. And just as my follow up, to go back to the margin question. With acquisition activity
kind of being strong over the last couple years and you needing to invest in Digital, which is obviously growing very
well and driving the business, should we expect a moderation in that 10 basis points to 30 basis points typical margin
expansion target, or is that still the case going forward? Because it seems like you're in a heavy investment mode and
I'm just wondering sort of how to think about that going forward. Thanks.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Well, first of all, certainly, I'm not going to provide guidance on this call. And I'll come
back to that question – if I can just ask for your patience, I'll come back to that question in more detail at the
Investor-Analyst Day in October.
What I will say is that our focus on investing at scale doesn't end this year. This is a cycle that we're in. But I'll also tell
you that as I've mentioned the last two investment Analyst Days and I referenced again in the script, we're very focused

profitability improvement in our business to both support our ambition for higher investments but also support our
ambition for margin expansion as a way to support our goals to grow EPS.
And I would say as a general rule, the economic leverage that we have in our model hasn't changed; and in fact, I might

Our next question is from the line of Jason Kupferberg, Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jason Alan Kupferberg>: Good morning, guys.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Good morning.
<Q - Jason Alan Kupferberg>: Hey, David. Just wanted to get a quick clarification on one of the answers you gave to
– I think it may have been Bryan's question about head count growth this year and new hires. And it sounded like you
were kind of alluding to nonlinear dynamics, perhaps, between head count growth and revenue growth, if I heard you
correctly. And I just wanted to clarify that because it looks like billable head count year-to-date has actually grown
faster than revenue, but I just wanted to clarify what you were referencing there.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah. Well, what I was referencing was, first of all, just the fact that we will hire fewer
people this year than we did last year is one point. The second thing I was referencing is that if you look at our
sequential growth and head count in recent growth quarters, it's certainly moderated over, let's say, the prior seven,
eight quarters and probably beyond. The third thing I was referencing, although I didn't say it specifically is that, it is
true, if you look at our head count growth in the third quarter year-over-year, it was at a rate above our revenue. But
that rate above our revenue was less than what you've seen in recent quarters.
And so, there's – without getting overly specific, there are three things that factor into that. One would be our focus on
automation, as an example, in the mix. Although as we've said, that is early days but yet a big focus for us going
forward. Things like chargeability are in the mix; things like attrition levels are in the mix, when you consider the
hiring number; and of course, the revenue yield that we're getting per billable head is also in the mix.
And that can be influenced by things like the mix of work that we're doing across the five business, mix of work by
geography, and it can also include pricing. So, all of those things are kind of in the mix. And in some way, all of those
are contributing to what has been a more moderate growth sequentially in our head count, and that's really all I was
pointing out.
<Q - Jason Alan Kupferberg>: Yeah. Okay. No, that's super helpful. And maybe just to pick up on that point around
utilization. I think you've been running at 90% plus for seven straight quarters after never having been at those levels
prior to last fiscal year. So, do you feel like this is a new normal and that we're unlikely to see this slip below 90%?
And would it also be fair to say that you're kind of maxed out at this 90%, 91% range, or could there be further
headroom depending on how the revenue mix evolves over time?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah. I guess I won't declare that it's maxed out. I mean, there are things that could work in
our favor going forward that could influence that metric further. If you look at kind of our historical norm, we are kind
of at the higher level of that range for sure, and we are running hot, and I think that reflects the activity in the market.
We could come down a click or two to in different quarters. And a lot of times that happens with periods in the year
where we tend to bring on, let's say, more heads. So for example, in the fourth quarter, we have a lot of our new joiners,
campus hires, that will start with us in the fourth quarter, early in the fall.

So, the simple answer is that no doubt we are running at a very high level of utilization reflecting the dynamics that we
see in the market, but we're in a zone right now that we feel very comfortable, very comfortable managing, but it could
also be a click lower and we wouldn't be worried about that.

And we have a question from the line of Lisa Ellis, Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Good morning, Lisa.
<Q - Lisa D. Ellis>: Hi. Good morning, David. I have a question. In the market, it looks like and you're seeing the
demand for the new digital security services, cloud services is, if anything, accelerating. And yet, as I guess a number
of folks now have called out, a lot of your forward indicators have decelerated a bit: head count growth, the pace of
M&A, even though it's still elevated has slowed down since last year. So, can you just comment on kind of like that
disconnect or how you're thinking about that? Because, if anything, it seems like the demand is accelerating, not
decelerating out there.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: [ph] I can speak of that (40:33) and good morning, Lisa. On the point you're mentioning
around deceleration of some of our capability, when you're talking about acquisitions, it might very well be that we're
going to make less transactions than last year, a few, but on the other end, we will certainly deploy a bit more capital
than last year because we expect to close the year with a bit more than $1 billion being deployed. So, I guess, it's – so
we are not slowing down at all our acquisition agenda, at least in term of volume of capital deployed, and by the
volume of capital deployed it means the capabilities we are bringing back at Accenture. So, I do not see on Digital,
anything in Accenture which would reflect a kind of slowing down of our appetite to grow, of our appetite to invest,
and of our appetite to accelerate in the New.
From a head count standpoint, I will let David comment again.
<A - David P. Rowland>: I guess, Lisa, one thing I would point out is that, I mean, really, to get underneath your
question, you would have to get into the more granular details of our business, which are not practical for us to get in
externally. But let me just make the point that as the business is rotating overall, we are also rotating a lot of talent
within our head count. And so, what is not apparent, but simply looking at the overall numbers, is the talent rotation
that has taken place. And I can assure you that our pace of investing and acquiring head count specifically focused on
driving this new agenda and the digital-related services agenda as part of that has not slowed down at all.
In fact, I would say the demand for talent in the New and talent in digital-related talent is one example, but also
including cloud and security, and our business has never been higher. And it is, as Pierre referenced earlier for Ellyn
Shook, I mean, that is job number one for her is managing the talent supply side to fuel the New. And I think our pace
of activity is not slowing; if anything, our appetite for that talent is increasing. But it's underneath the overall number
that we communicate. So, we feel like our indicators are positive indicators right now. Yeah, Pierre?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Just to build on this, because this is a very important question you're raising. Coming back to
talent, I know that we have lots of questions regarding the total head count. And I guess – and we're watching that very
carefully with David to see that we've been able to grow more our revenues with a little bit less hiring of people, which
on balance, we will all recognize is a good direction.
If you look from a managing director standpoint, so all about the leadership of Accenture, I just would like to reconfirm
that this year, in fiscal year 2016, we promoted much more managing directors than ever this last four years. And I
think from the recruiting of leaders, managing directors, we've never been so active in the market in recruiting new
leaders.

So, it's important to segregate the leadership we are hiring and promoting at scale because the leaders are driving the
business from the total head count, which we all expect will continue to grow less, a bit less, than our revenues moving
forward, due to the factor of automation and productivity in our operations.
<Q - Lisa D. Ellis>: Terrific. Thank you. That's great color. Thanks a lot.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Thank you, Lisa.

And our next question is from Dave Koning, Baird. Please go ahead.
<Q - David J. Koning>: Yeah. Hey, guys.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Hey, David. Good morning.
<Q - David J. Koning>: Thanks for taking my question. I guess first of all, the Digital business you talked about, it's
about 40% [ph] of rest (44:58) growing about 30%. That would imply that the other 60% is maybe flattish to down.
Maybe you can talk a little bit about that? And then, is this kind of the formula that Digital keeps growing in that range
and that the rest of the business is more flattish? Is that kind of the formula going forward?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: I think the formula going forward is very simple. We want to grow. That's our goal in life is
to grow and to grow more than the market. In order to grow more than the market, we believe at Accenture, and this is
at the heart of our strategy, that it's going to be by leading in the digital-related services. To be clear, we want to make
Accenture the leading professional services company in digital-related services. This is what we are working on this
last few years and we will continue moving forward. We have evidence that this rotation to the New is happening at big
scale.
Now, so the most significant part of our growth will come from digital-related services, because this is our strategy,
first, and second, this is where the demand is. Now, that being said, we want to continue making our core, if you will,
extremely competitive in the marketplace. I just mentioned in the call that we invested in our new intelligent delivery
platform called Accenture myWizard, which is bringing a lot of success in Accenture. So of course, we're growing
much less in the core than in the New, which is exactly reflecting our strategy.
Now, the core is still positive, growing less, but it's still positive. And I believe that on the core, Accenture is growing
more than the competition, at the end of the day, which has always been our value proposition, is to grow more than the
market in the New and much more, and it's to grow more than the market in the remaining core, which is what we do,
of course, at a much lower level and lower pace, but still positive. Right, David?
<A - David P. Rowland>: It is, and, David, let me also just clarify some subtleties in the way we talk about
digital-related services in the New, just to remind you and the others as well. So we initially started talking about
digital-related services, which was defined specifically to include Accenture Interactive, Mobility, and Analytics. And
digital-related services is what I referenced was growing in the range of 30%.
Following introducing digital-related services several quarters ago, we rolled forward, kind of evolved that, to talk
about the New, which includes digital-related services, cloud-related services, and security. With the New, we
commented that it is now about 40% of our revenues. We did not comment on the growth rate for the New, but I will
say that digital-related services of the three components of the New, is the fastest growing. So that helps you as well.
We talk about the New and digital-related services, and it's important to just reinforce the understanding of the
definitions.
<Q - David J. Koning>: Got you. Okay. That's helpful. And then, I guess, the one other question I had, the growth
markets grew 6%, and the North America and Europe were more like 11% to 12%. I would've thought a few quarters
ago that maybe China and Brazil, the gap would have been – that the slower growth would happen, but it actually

seems like now, that gap – the growth markets are growing quite a bit slower than the others. Maybe you can just
comment on that a little bit.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yeah, I mean, happy to comment, I guess. Fact of the matter is growth markets are growing
lower than the other two, maybe just because the other two are growing exceptionally well, especially Europe at 12%,
which, of course, is a remarkable achievement.
Now, when you look at the growth markets, needless to say, that it's a mixed bag of very different situations when
we're talking our growth markets. I mean, first, we're extremely pleased that we continue with our double-digit growth
with Japan. By the way, I don't know and maybe will provide information, many quarters now, we've been growing
double digit in Japan, but it's starting to be spectacular. And of course, it's a very large market for Accenture, not only
for [ph] still going to growth (49:52) market, but for Accenture as a whole.
So, I'm extraordinary pleased with the turnaround we've been driving in Japan, with the momentum we are making in
Japan and with the acquisition we have made of IMJ because it's to accelerate the rotation to the New in Japan.
I'm very pleased with the new momentum we are creating in China this year, together with India and Mexico. Now, as
you know, in the growth markets, there are two factors impacting the growth markets. First is these markets are more
vulnerable to the commodity markets at large in term of energy and natural resources. There are significant countries
very dependent on natural resources and energy. And, of course, they are affected by the commodity price going down,
and, accordingly, we are affected with this factor.
Secondly, the situation in Brazil; we all know what's happening in Brazil, so our growth have been slowing down in a
market which is very important for Accenture. That being said, and I love being public on this because I would like to
recognize the incredible leadership of Roger Ingold and now Leonardo Framil leading our practice in Brazil where
we're doing more than resisting, and when I say more than resisting, it means on a year-to-date standpoint, we are
growing in Brazil, which is probably, according to any standards, a remarkable achievement.
Now of course, we're growing less in Brazil than we used to grow in the past. So on balance, 6% is reflecting very
different dynamics. This is what – it's something I like a lot in Accenture is our diverse portfolio of businesses where
indeed, when you look at the growth markets, when Brazil is a bit under pressure or commodity markets, we benefit
from growth elsewhere. And on balance, the 7% is pretty good from my perspective.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah. Yeah, if you isolated chemicals and natural resources and energy and then looked at
the underlying growth in growth markets, it'd be very similar to what we see in the other areas. It has that unique
dynamic as well as the other points Pierre mentioned.
<Q - David J. Koning>: Got you. Great. Well, thank you.

<A - David P. Rowland>: Good morning, Jim.
<Q - James Schneider>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could maybe talk a
little bit about Financial Services. It's an area where you've talked about previously being driven by transformation, and
that pace continues to be pretty strong.
Can you maybe give us any sense about whether you're seeing any tone change from your Financial Services
customers, either in banking or elsewhere, in terms of the overall IP spending outlook and – that would suggest that we
are seeing any slowdown in that pace of change – change-driven services in particular?

<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yes. I'm probably going to take this one, David, from my prior role. It seems that all my life I
will comment on Europe and Financial Services. But very happy to do it. Let's start with the beginning. We're pleased
with where we are with Financial Services overall. If you look at the results we posted these last few quarters, we had a
good momentum in Financial Services.
Second, it's an industry which is ongoing some significant rotation to the New, for obvious reasons. It's a B2C industry
and we have a lot of activities in terms of rotating to the New and creating digital capabilities in Financial Services.
This is as well an industry where we see a lot of potential in what we're calling automation, if you will, to create more
automated processes, bringing [ph] virtual agent (54:43) to provide financial advisory services. So, that's the part which
is creating some momentum.
However, on the other side of the coin, if you will, it's an industry which is still under pressure, especially in Europe,
for all sort of reasons. Negative interest rates have been good, especially in that industry for their commercial business.
The regulatory constraints are high, as you know, especially in Europe with all the Basel legislation and all the
constraints which has been put on the banks. And so, the profitability of the banks has been affected these last few
years. So at the same time, they need to rotate to the New, but at the same time, they need to work on their costs.
So, there is a bit of this story with our Financial Services clients investing in the New but being extremely cautious
about their cost play. That's why after this kind of good momentum we have in Financial Services, we might see some
moderation of our growth with our verticals in Europe a bit. Nothing we are over-worried about because we believe the
potential is still there, but it's an industry which is under cost pressure.
<Q - James Schneider>: That's helpful. Thank you. And then, maybe one for David. DSOs edged back up to 41, and I
guess, they've kind of been – have been on a little bit of an upward trajectory over the last four, six quarters. Can you
maybe give us a sense about whether that says anything about the overall cash flow trends for the business, and
whether that in fact is a longer-term trend?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah, I would say, I mean, just to be completely transparent, it was a little higher than I
would have wanted in the quarter, but yet, we still generated very strong cash flow. We are very focused on managing
our DSO, and I'm hopeful that we will see it click down at the end of the fourth quarter.
As I've said before – well, first of all, even at the levels that we're at, as you know, you hear us say all the time, we're
still very much industry-leading. I do think that we are in the zone of what I think could be a reset kind of new normal
and let's say in that 40-day-plus or minus kind of zone. And so, we'll continue to focus on it as one of our key
operational priorities, and I'm hopeful we can continue to manage it kind of in that zone.
<Q - James Schneider>: Thank you.
<A - David P. Rowland>: All right. Thank you.

<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: Good morning. Forgive the noise; I'm at the airport.
<A - David P. Rowland>: No problem.

guidance here? What areas specifically are running better than expected?

Page 14 of 15
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah, well, really, I mean, the revenue raise is just a reflection of posting roughly 11%
growth year-to-date, and if you look at the guidance range of the 6% to 9% and if you just – you know, we just simply
did the math. If you do the mathematical extension of that, you get to the 9.5% to 10.5% range. I think in terms of
what's driving it of late, Products is very, very hot right now. And the thing that is impressive about Products, which
also happens to be our largest operating group, is that their growth is broad-based across every industry in that
operating group as well as each of the three geographic areas. And so, I would say that what is driving us to a strong
close to the year, if you will, and hence, raising the revenue a half a point on the upper end, you would start with
Products in the strong story there.
Health & Public Service is another strong story, very good growth in the third quarter and very strong momentum as
we look to the fourth quarter. I would say our business in North America is another source of momentum. If I had to
name, let's say three big drivers, I would pick those two operating groups in North America. And then, of course,
underneath that, as Pierre covered very well, is just the ongoing continued momentum in Digital and the New, which
we certainly will continue into the fourth quarter.
So, those are some of the big themes in terms of driving what we hope will be a good strong close to the year.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: Okay. No, that's helpful to hear. Thanks. Just, I guess, also on the follow-up, I think it was
David Grossman's question on IP and software, and how the deconsolidation of Duck Creek. That action there, how
does that fit in the strategy of owning IP and platforms? Any comments? Thanks.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yes. Elaborating a bit on what I've said before. So, we're working on our IP, again, from a
process standpoint, a methodology standpoint, from product solutions standpoint and, of course, in the context of
working with our partners. And it might very well be that we are creating IP on top of some market solutions, which is
where we are making the bridge with your question around software, not software. In our business, we are working
with software companies and the job of Accenture for many years has been to bring an industry expertise, an industry
wrapper on top of these solutions.
And on this wrapper we are bringing, we're working on protecting our own IP, when appropriate and when possible.
This is where Accenture will make the bridge with the software providers. The software providers are all our friends
and we're working with the best possible companies and they are coming to Accenture, that's why we are a good
partner to bring industry expertise and this is on the industry expertise and wrapper, we could build IP.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Pierre, do you want to comment on Duck Creek? He also asked about Duck Creek and how
that fits in with our strategy.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Oh, yeah, and Duck Creek is clearly a good illustration of what we are doing. Duck Creek is
a fantastic company, an excellent solution. We certainly believe this is one – the best in the marketplace in policy
administration, in insurance policy administration in some markets including the United States. We wanted to invest
more in Duck Creek to establish an even stronger leadership in the different markets of Duck Creek. And we believe
that the right way of doing it was to partner with someone who would bring some strength in term of investing together
with us, in that case Apax Partner. And we're very pleased that Accenture, together with Apax, will be able to investing
behind Duck Creek and move Duck Creek solution to the next level and establish a stronger leadership. This is all
about the new Accenture.
At Accenture, we will look always at all the ways to invest, to bring the right solution, to be smart, to be thoughtful and

month, on July 19, we will celebrate the 15 years anniversary of Accenture's IPO. And we have performed extremely
well over the years by continually reinventing our business. Since our IPO, we have delivered compound annual
growth of 8% in revenues and 14% in adjusted EPS, creating significant value for our shareholders, for our clients and
for our people.

to talking with you again next quarter. In the meantime, if you have any question, please feel free to call KC and all the
best to all of you.
