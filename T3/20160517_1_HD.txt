Now before I turn the call over to Craig, let me remind you that today's press release and the presentations made by our
executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our
expectations and projection. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors identified in the
release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Today's presentations may also include certain non-GAAP measurements. Reconciliation of these measurements is
provided on our website.
Now let me turn the call over to Craig.
Craig A. Menear
Thank you, Diane, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the first quarter were $22.8 billion, up 9% from last year.
Comp sales were up 6.5% from last year and our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 7.4%. Diluted earnings per share
were $1.44 in the first quarter. We were pleased with the start of the year. In the U.S., all three of our divisions posted
positive comps in the first quarter led by our southern division. And all 19 U.S. regions and top 40 markets saw single
to low double-digit comps in the quarter.
Internationally, our Mexican and Canadian businesses had another quarter of solid performance. Mexico reported
positive double-digit comps in local currency, making it the 50th consecutive quarter of positive comp growth. Our
Canadian business also posted mid single-digit comps in local currency for a total of 18 consecutive quarters of positive
comp growth.
While winter had somewhat of a positive impact on our business and certainly drove variability in demand, the first
quarter was not an early spring story. It was in execution in the core of the store story. We continue to see broad-based
growth across our store, as both ticket and transactions grew in the quarter. All of our merchandising departments
posted positive comps, and we saw a healthy balance of growth among both our pro and DIY categories, with pro
outpacing our DIY business in the U.S.
As Ted will detail, our customers continue to respond positively to our deep assortment of trusted brands, as we are the
product authority for both our pro and DIY customers.
The Interline integration is progressing nicely. We continue to move forward on a number of exciting sales-driving
initiatives, and we have outlined a path to truly realize the value of the Interline acquisition and the total pro
opportunity over the next 18 to 24 months.
We also continue to believe that blending the physical and digital channels into a seamless customer experience, which
we call interconnected retail, provides a unique opportunity for us to expose the power of The Home Depot. This has
been and will continue to be one of the central tenets of our company's strategy, and we will remain committed to the
investments in our interconnected capabilities.
For the quarter, online traffic growth was double digits and our online sales grew 21.5%. Investing in interconnected
capabilities goes beyond our dot-com business, as we are also continuing to further invest to more effectively meet
customers' demands for increased fulfillment options. The rollout of COM, our new customer order management
system, is on track to be fully deployed in our U.S. stores before year end.
Following behind the COM rollout is the implementation of BODFS, or buy online deliver from store. In certain
markets where BODFS has been introduced, the demand has been much stronger than we anticipated. This is a good
problem to have, but it is challenging delivery capacity, which we're working to address. We still expect BODFS to be
fully rolled out by the end of the fiscal year.
For the spring season, we are focused on further connecting our in-store and online experiences. We offered a more
expanded assortment of spring seasonal products online. We also leveraged our digital assets to more effectively target
customers with a personalized message pertaining to relevant products and special buys. Additionally, we use digital

media to highlight local in-store assortments to drive footsteps to our stores. To ensure our stores were properly staffed
for the busy spring selling season, we hired over 80,000 associates to meet the demand of these increased footsteps.
We continue to see great productivity from our supply chain. The flexibility and nimbleness of our supply chain was
especially evident in the quarter as we navigated spiky demand without sacrificing in-stock levels. We continue to see
dividends from investments made in our supply chain in our in-stocks, inventory productivity, logistics costs, and
service to our stores and customers.
Our BOSS via RDC capability, which enables us to fulfill buy online ship to store orders through our RDC network,
leverages both our inventory and our fulfillment channels. The cost savings of this initiative have been above our
expectations in both our ship times and customer satisfaction scores continue to improve. We have made great strides
with our supply chain over the past several years, and we continue to optimize our network with initiatives like Supply
Chain Sync. While Sync is in its early days of a multiyear rollout, we are pleased with our initial results.
Though it is early in the year, our view of the macro environment remains consistent. We believe that housing data
indicates continued tailwinds for our business. As Carol will detail, because of our outperformance in the first quarter
versus our plan, we are increasing our sales and earnings per share guidance for the year. We now expect fiscal 2016
sales growth of approximately 6.3% and diluted earnings per share of $6.27.
Today, we have over 400,000 associates, and I want to close by thanking them for their hard work and dedication to our
customers. In addition to serving our customers in our stores, through Team Depot, our associate-led volunteer force,
our associates donated their personal time to complete more than 1,000 projects in service to our local communities
over the past 12 months.
And with that, let me turn the call over to Ted.
Edward P. Decker
Thanks, Craig, and good morning, everyone.
We had a strong first quarter, driven by continued strength across the store, particularly with our pro customers. An
unseasonably warm February was followed by a more normal but wetter March and April. While weather positively
impacted our sales performance in the first quarter, spring has not yet arrived in many of our markets.
In the first quarter, total comp transactions grew by 4% while comp average ticket increased 2.5%. Our average ticket
increase was somewhat impacted by commodity price deflation, mainly from lumber and copper. The total impact to
ticket growth from commodity price deflation was approximately 15 basis points.
Transactions for tickets under $50, representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales, were up 2.7% in the first quarter.
Transactions for tickets over $900, also representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales, were up 9.5% in the first
quarter. The drivers behind the increase in big ticket purchases were appliances, roofing, sheds, and windows, all of
which had double-digit comps. The departments that outperformed the company's average comp were appliances, tools,
building materials, lumber, lighting, hardware, millwork, and decor. Electrical, paint, flooring, indoor garden, kitchen
and bath, plumbing, and outdoor garden had positive comps but were below the company average.
Pro heavy categories continue to show great strength as we saw double-digit comps in fencing, pressure-treated
decking, boards, fasteners, doors and conduit. In addition, the core of the store continued to perform well and we saw
strength in maintenance and repair categories across the country. Tool storage, commercial industrial lighting, portable
power, power tool accessories and tools and wiring devices had double-digit comps in the quarter. The core categories,
including garage organization, laminate flooring, landscape lighting, vinyl plank and wood flooring had comps above
the company average.
Our store associates did a great job executing our Eighth Annual Spring Black Friday event and creating excitement in
our stores. In particular, special buys around Appliances, Outdoor Power and Hardscapes were well received by our
customers, resulting in double-digit comps in those categories.

As Craig mentioned, The Home Depot is the product authority for both our professional and DIY customers. We have
the deepest assortment of the leading programs in the marketplace. Many of these brands are billion-dollar categories
for us. Our pros recognize our brand advantage and pro sales outpaced the company average in the first quarter. We
continue to use detailed analytics to help us balance the art and science of retail.
In marketing, we maintain our best-in-class creative, and we are also optimizing our ad effectiveness with targeted
digital marketing. We remain focused on leveraging customer data to build the right message at the right time for the
right customer. As we have made strategic moves away from print and mass marketing to more targeted digital
marketing, we have seen great results. Since 2010, our return on advertising spend has nearly doubled.
Now let me turn our attention to the second quarter. We continue to be the leader in the marketplace for innovation and
value that save our customers both time and money.
To maintain the momentum in our double-digit comping pneumatics category, we are introducing the new Milwaukee
pneumatic framing nailer, which is the latest addition to the M18 FUEL lineup. This high-powered nailer delivers
fasteners much faster than competing battery-powered nailers, saving our pros time on the job site. And new from
DEWALT is the 20-volt MAX brushless finish nailer. This compact and lightweight finish nailer has innovative
features including depth adjustments and multi-functional LED lights to illuminate work pieces. These are great
examples of innovative and exclusive products from trusted best-in-class programs.
For our DIY customers, we are excited about the new exclusive launch of Pergo Outlast+ laminate flooring. This
easy-to-install laminate is water resistant and uses Spill Protect 24 technology, a proprietary coating that prevents water
from seeping into the floor. Outlast+ flooring allows customers to install laminate flooring in high-traffic and
water-prone areas such as kitchens, bathrooms and mud rooms.
In addition to all the great new products, we are excited about our upcoming events. Our Thrill of the Grill, Memorial
Day, Father's Day and Fourth of July events are right around the corner, and we have an incredible line-up of great
values and special buys to help our customers enjoy this outdoor season to the fullest.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Carol.
Carol B. Tomé
Thank you, Ted, and good morning, everyone.
In the first quarter, sales were $22.8 billion, a 9% increase from last year, driven primarily by positive comp sales as
well as the impact of Interline Brands. Versus last year, a stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted total sales growth by
approximately $196 million or 0.9%.
Our total company comps or same-store sales were positive 6.5% for the quarter, with positive comps of 10.2% in
February, 6.7% in March and 4.3% in April. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 7.4% for the quarter, with positive
comps of 11.8% in February, 7.7% in March and 4.6% in April. We estimate weather-driven demand have positively
impacted our U.S. sales growth by approximately $250 million. The variability in our comp sales performance during
the quarter was due in large part to weather and to the timing of Easter this year versus last year.
Our total company gross margin was 34.2% for the quarter, a decrease of 13 basis points from last year. The change in
our gross margin is explained largely by the following factors. First, as expected, we had 25 basis points of gross
margin contraction due to the impact of Interline. Second, we had 12 basis points of gross margin expansion in our
supply chain, driven by lower fuel costs and increased productivity. For fiscal 2016, we continue to expect our gross
margin rate to be about the same as what we reported in fiscal 2015.
In the first quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased by 122 basis points to 20.7%. Our expense
leverage reflects the impact of positive comp sales growth along with great expense control. For the year, we now
expect our expenses to grow at approximately 35% of our sales growth rate.

Our operating margin for the quarter was 13.5%, an increase of 109 basis points from last year. Interest and other
expense for the first quarter was $237 million, up $44 million from last year due primarily to higher long-term debt
balances. In the first quarter, our effective tax rate was 36.5% compared to 34.3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2015.
Recall that the effective tax rate in the first quarter of last year was favorably impacted by the settlement of a tax audit.
For fiscal 2016, we expect our income tax provision rate to be approximately 37%. Our diluted earnings per share for
the first quarter were $1.44, an increase of 19% from last year.
Now moving to some additional highlights. During the first quarter, we opened one new store in Mexico and we ended
the quarter with a store count of 2,275 and selling square footage of 237 million. Total sales per square foot for the first
quarter were $377, up 6.5% from last year.
Now turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, inventory was $13.2 billion, up $913 million from last year,
reflecting both the impact of Interline and the seasonality of our business. Inventory turns were 4.8 times, up one-tenth
from the first quarter of last year.
In the first quarter, we repurchased $1.25 billion or approximately 9.45 million shares of outstanding stock. For the
remainder of the fiscal year, we intend to repurchase approximately $3.75 billion of outstanding stock using excess
cash, bringing total anticipated 2016 share repurchases to $5 billion. Computed on the average of beginning and ending
long-term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters, return on invested capital was 29.2%, 300 basis points higher
than the first quarter of fiscal 2015.
Now turning our attention to the full year. While U.S. GDP forecasts have pulled back slightly since we built our 2016
sales plan, we continue to see strength in the housing market, with home price appreciation, housing turnover and
household formation trending where we thought they would.
Sales in the first quarter exceeded our expectations, not just because of favorable weather, but because of higher
demand for many of our core product categories. While we ordinarily don't raise our sales growth guidance so early in
the year, we're going to roll forward some of our first quarter outperformance, giving the underlying strength of the
business.
Further, the U.S. dollar has weakened such that the current spot rate of exchange is now in line with the FX rates we
used to build our plan. Because of this, we are going to a single point estimate instead of a range for our 2016 guidance.
From the high end of the guidance range we provided in February, today we are raising our sales and earnings per share
growth guidance.
We now expect our 2016 sales to grow by approximately 6.3%, with comps of approximately 4.9%. For earnings per
share, remember that we guide off of GAAP. We now expect fiscal 2016 diluted earnings per share to grow
approximately 14.8% to $6.27.
We thank you for your participation in today's call. And, Derek, we are now ready for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Seth I. Sigman>: All right, thanks. Good morning, nice quarter, guys.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Good morning, thank you.
<Q - Seth I. Sigman>: So in aggregate, it seems like weather did help the quarter. You talked about $250 million or so.
Can you elaborate on where you saw that benefit and if that means you actually pulled some sales forward, or do you
think that's just incremental?

<A - Craig A. Menear>: So obviously, with a warm February, we had a great start to the year and we saw outdoor
project business in the North very, very strong. The $250 million that we've estimated, that is hard to understand
exactly how much of that is pulled forward, but that's what we're estimating is the demand that we saw from the
weather benefit. We think there's $40 million-ish or so of seasonal product pull-forward.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: And the rest of the outperformance was in building material categories like concrete and
pressure-treated lumber, so on and so forth. That really is weather-driven demand.
<Q - Seth I. Sigman>: And just to follow up there, does that $250 million consider that spring weather hasn't arrived
in some markets as you alluded to, and would that be factored into that number?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: That's right. We think we pulled forward true spring related categories $40 million to $50
million. And as you know, I don't know where you're sitting, Seth, but as you know, in certain parts of the country,
spring has not yet arrived. So we're still anticipating a bang up spring quarter.
<Q - Seth I. Sigman>: Don't we know it? All right, and then just one follow-up on the pro initiatives here. The
extension of credit earlier in the quarter, can you talk about how that's going and how incremental to the numbers this
quarter that may have been?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: We're very pleased with the new value proposition that we're offering on our private label card
for our pros. You'll recall that we are now offering 60 days to pay, 365-day returns, and discounts at the fuel pump.
What we're seeing with our pros is great receptivity. New accounts are ahead of our sales plan, which is great news.
But, Seth, remember that we just rolled this out to all stores in January, so there was no measurable impact to the top
line because of this, but we anticipate that to come.
<Q - Seth I. Sigman>: Great, thanks very much.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Yes.
Operator
Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Thanks, good morning. I just want to clarify something. When we use the word
pull-forward, and if we take the $40 million out that's seasonal, just thinking about the other part that was "pulled
forward", maybe other projects getting done a little earlier, do we know if that's typically a one to three-month pull
forward? These are projects that presumably could get done in other parts of the year, and where I'm going is I'm trying
to think about how that could impact the second quarter versus others later in the year.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Here's how we've looked at this. We think there was $250 million-ish of weather-driven
demand. It's not all seasonal pull-forward. This is just activity because of great weather earlier in the quarter. We're not
rolling that forward because we anticipated that these were projects that would be completed later in the year and just
got done earlier in the year, so we're not rolling that forward. It will bleed into Q2, Q3, maybe even Q4.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: To your point, I mean if somebody was doing a concrete project that maybe they had planned
for the summer and they said hey, look, the ground's not frozen in the North, I can do it now, then they do it, it's hard to
tell which quarters it's come from, but it's certainly probably the next couple quarters.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: So as we think about the shape of the year, and this might help the modeling, we now think that
the first quarter will be the highest comping quarter. As a result, the first half will be slightly higher than the back half
of the year. And if you look at the comps that we are projecting for Q2, Q3, and Q4, we expect them to be in the similar
range, not a lot difference in those comp numbers.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Okay, that's helpful. My follow-up on the online business, I think you mentioned growth
of about 21.5%. Anything different about the pickup in-store percentage that's changed? And then your comment on the

delivery strain maybe from delivering from store, is that because Home Depot is offering the customer the option of
where they want the product from, or that's your systems that's choosing to deliver from store?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: So first of all, a comment on – the percentage of pickup is around 40% where the customer is
choosing the option to pick up their items from HomeDepot.com in our stores. And as it relates to the delivery, we had
piloted the delivery program for a while. We saw mid-single-digit growth in deliveries with the pilot. When we went
into additional markets, markets like Atlanta, for example, we saw a pretty substantial increase in the customer option
to choose that delivery, and we're seeing double-digit growth in deliveries.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Okay, thanks.
Operator
Next, we'll hear from Michael Lasser with UBS.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: Good morning, thanks a lot for taking my question. Carol, as you mentioned, it's not
typical for the company to raise its guidance after the first quarter, and you have seen strong first quarters in the past.
So what's different about what you're witnessing in the business right now to inspire so much confidence for you to
move estimates higher?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: It's really the strength across the store. And as you know, when we build our sales plan, we use
our directionally correct but imperfect sales forecasting model, which is an economics-driven model. We do not build
market share gains into our forecast. As we look at the performance in the first quarter, clearly there was some share
shift. Look at appliances. Ted called it out, appliances contributed 50 basis points of our comp growth in the first
quarter. So we are confident with what we saw in the first quarter and what we're seeing early in May to roll forward
the outperformance of the first quarter.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: So you mentioned GDP forecasts are a little lower. Housing is about where you thought
it was. So what's changed is you're gaining a little bit more market share than you originally thought?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: We don't plan market share, as you know, so we believe there were some share shifts, and that
was confirmed by NYX data that came out that showed that from a census perspective, anyway, we did grow share.
The other thing that we must look at is housing and just some other things that are happening within the housing market
that we haven't built into our plan but we find to be of interest. Here's a statistic. We've seen home equity values
increase 94% since 2011. How is that possible? Because home prices are up 25% and people have been continuing to
pay down their mortgages. So there's a wealth effect that's occurring with homeowners. And this wealth effect, as we've
talked at length, if you feel like your home as an investment and not an expense, you spend differently in your home
and you can see that in our big ticket categories.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: And then my follow-up question is on the expense outlook. You're now expecting to
grow 35% of the rate of sales. Is that all due to what's happening in the first quarter, or do you expect to see some
expense good guys in the remainder of the year? Thank you so much.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Yes. Well, despite beating our sales plan considerably in the first quarter, our total expenses
were actually $13 million under our plan. That was driven by lower utilities as you would expect because of warmer
weather in February, but also we're not seeing the kind of pressure on medical as we had anticipated. So now for the
full year, we anticipate that our expenses will be lower than our original plan which is helping take our expense growth
factor down from what we had said at 40% to now 35%.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: Okay. Good luck with the rest of the spring.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Thank you.

And next we have Kate McShane with Citi.
<Q - Kate McShane>: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to follow-up on the other question that was just
asked. Just given some of the earnings that we've seen so far for Q1 that, that the health of the U.S. consumer I think is
being called into question somewhat. So I wondered if you could, beyond, Carol, what you've already mentioned, just
talk about the DIY business and if there's any read-through there to the overall take of the consumer and just how much
of the out performance of pro versus DIY is driven versus maybe the housing statistics versus your initiatives?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Okay. I would say that when you look at the strength of the business, it really comes across
the board. We're really pleased with the mix of both transactions and ticket growth that we had. That's something we
look for in terms of balancing the business. We see the consumer continuing to engage in big ticket sales with
transactions above $900, growing at 9.5% in the quarter. So while our pro business was strong and we're pleased to see
that, we were also very pleased to see the growth in our DIY business. And so the balance is what really is what we're
striving to achieve, and we're seeing that balance across the store.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: And again, I go back to the housing data, the housing data suggests that homeowners feel like
they have more value than they did before. Look at negative equity. Homes with negative equity have dropped from
22% at the beginning of 2012 to now 8.5%.
<Q - Kate McShane>: Thank you. That's very helpful. And then my second follow-up question is slightly unrelated. I
know you spent some time in the prepared comments talking about buy online ship from store, which I think you're
rolling out by the end of the year. Just wonder if we could have more detail in terms of how much of that program, how
much of your merchandise that program will address. Is it going to be eligible for everything that's online and in the
store? How do – how that – excuse me, how will we expect that to work by the end of the year?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: It pretty much is almost everything we sell, whether it's online or in-store, will be eligible
were delivery and we'll leverage the supply chain network that we've built out to do that in the most cost effective way,
using our RDCs as flow through points for product that will come from our distribution points that a customer chooses
to have delivered, so definitely a broad approach to the assortment that we carry.
<Q - Kate McShane>: Thank you.

And, Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research, your line is open.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Thanks, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So I just wanted to go back to the buy online
and deliver from store economics, trying to understand it a little bit more. Our research suggests that, particularly
millennials, really want to do that. They don't really necessarily want to pick up in-store, and I was just wondering,
looking at the uptake is exceeding expectations, what are the margins attached to that business?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: So first of all, I would say that in our business we have a lot of project business. We have a
lot of things that are big and bulky. And so I think that's why in many ways, we're seeing a significant portion of our
customers choose to pick up their product in-store and then potentially have it delivered from store. We also have pros
who are interested in having the product delivered from store to their job sites. It saves them time. It saves their runners
from having to come into the stores overall. And then candidly, we've been doing delivery from store for quite some
time...
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Yes, we have.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: ...for years. And it's – that's just part of the overall operating cost of doing the business. And
so we approach that on a day in and day out basis as part of operating the business and our value proposition for the
customer across product takes that into account.

<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: So I mean, and refresh my memory, do you guys charge for that? Or is that not charged for
when you deliver?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Yes, we do.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Okay.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Yes, we charge for it, and there's options for tighter windows where there's a premium paid.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Okay, perfect. And then I wanted to go into the credit changes, extending from 30 days to 60
days and just try to understand a little bit more the credit limits attached. I know you guys I think are using a bank to
help you with that. What are your upper credit limits? And is there thought of expanding that out? And maybe just a
little tutorial on that, that would be great. And that's my last question. Thank you.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Sure. So our private label credit card is unwritten by a third party, and on – I'll give you
averages and then talk to you about outliers. So, for our commercial customers, these would be our pros. The average
line of credit is $6,600 which seems to adequately meet their needs, but we do have some higher spend pros. So the
third party underwriter will extend larger lines. And we have six-figure lines to many of our customers who ask for
those lines. Furthermore, if there's a situation where the credit lines tighten up a bit, we have a second look program
with another third person provider that will take a second look at the request and up the line of credit. So we have a
number of tools in our toolkit to adequately provide the financing requirements of our pros. The biggest tool is moving
to 60 days. Because think about it, we're providing working capital support for them. They're going to get paid by their
customers before they have to pay us back.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: And so you said, I think you said there's some six figures out there. I mean do you – with the
mix of the business, are you anticipating that $6,600, I think that you referenced, going up meaningfully? And is there –
would you guys ever think of taking some of this on your own balance sheet or no?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: No, we'll let the customer take us where they take us. We want to grow the pro, and if they need
more credit, we're happy to support them in that effort. In terms of taking it onto our balance sheet, we love the
arrangement that we have with our third party underwriter today.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: All right. Perfect. Thanks, guys. Thanks for taking my questions.

And moving on, we'll next hear from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.
<Q - Christopher Michael Horvers>: Thanks. Good morning, everybody.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Good morning.
<Q - Christopher Michael Horvers>: So I wanted to just, at the risk of beating a dead horse, so to speak, follow-up
on California and oil markets. We've seen someone like Costco see some variability in California, and they sell a lot of
food, so it's a bit surprising to us. Are you seeing anything different in those markets that alerts you or causes any
concern?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: No. Overall, we're really not, and the area that we watch most closely is Texas. We have 178
stores in Texas. Texas actually outperformed the company average in the quarter. I think all major markets in Texas
performed well. Texas clearly has diversified their economy, more so over the past few years, which I think is a benefit.
Clearly, in Western Canada, we saw some pressure, as you might imagine, not quite as diversified environment there.
So we haven't really seen any major shift.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: No, and actually in California, Governor Brown just released some water restrictions...

<A - Craig A. Menear>: Yes, which is great.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: ...which will be good for our garden business. So our California business is doing quite well.
We did have a pop-up store in North Dakota. We popped it up during the height of the fracking days. Chris, we're
popping that store down.
<Q - Christopher Michael Horvers>: It's a big pop-up.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Yes, yes, that's about the only impact really.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Right.
<Q - Christopher Michael Horvers>: Understood. And can you talk about any research that you've done around
millennials and household formation? Are they coming to form households now? Will they – do you think they'll act
like Gen X did before them, and how do you think it impacts the long-term outlook of the box and the online business?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: We actually have done a fair amount of research here, and it was part of our strategic
planning last summer where we had several groups of millennials actually work on what Home Depot looks like eight
years to 10 years out as well. What our research tells us is that basically this is a delayed cycle, that the millennial
generation has many of the same desires that generations prior to them have. We're seeing, as household formation
goes up, roughly a third or so of those formations are happening with millennials at the tail end of that age group. It
appears there's about a six-year delayed cycle here, but our research indicates that in many ways, they'll act the same as
previous generations.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Yes, the average age of new homebuyers last year was 33 years old. That's like the edge of the
millennials. So that is another proof point, that at some point, they want to own a home.
<Q - Christopher Michael Horvers>: Yes, and then one last just clarification question. Was there any impact in the
monthly because of the Easter shift?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Yes, so if we look at how we reported comps, and I'm talking to the U.S. now, March was
reported at 7.7%. If you shifted for like-for-like for April, that comp would have been a 9.2%. April was reported at
4.6%. It would have been like-for-like 3.6%.
<Q - Christopher Michael Horvers>: Understood, thanks very much.

Our next question comes from Matt McClintock with Barclays.
<Q - Matthew McClintock>: Yes, good morning, everyone.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Good morning.
<Q - Matthew McClintock>: I was wondering if we could ask a question on appliances. Thinking about the
longer-term opportunity within that category, particularly now that you're seeing other channels of retail that are maybe
more challenged right now, the department stores, et cetera, looking at that as also a new growth opportunity, can you
maybe just update us on your thoughts and maybe how those thoughts have changed now that you're seeing more
competition in that category?
<A - Edward P. Decker>: We haven't seen the impact of any increased competition. Our Appliance business was
extremely strong again in the first quarter. In fact, it accelerated as we exited the quarter. We've been leaning into that

space, as you know, and we're going to expand the appliance square footage in another 100-odd stores again this year.
So we're very happy with the results. In fact, in certain markets that some competitors entered the space, we saw
significantly higher performance than the rest of the country.

And next question in the queue, we have Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.
<Q - Brian Nagel>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Good morning.
<Q - Brian Nagel>: Congratulations on a nice quarter.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Thank you.
<Q - Brian Nagel>: So my first question with market share, anything as you look at the data to suggest – maybe
comment on market share one way or the other. And particularly with what seemed to be somewhat volatile weather
through the period, did that impact market share trends at your chain within the channel through the quarter?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: I don't think we really have any way of knowing if weather really impacted share. We're
really focused on making sure that we're driving everyday great value for our customers and trying to bring innovative
products that solve problems for them. Ted, I don't know if you have any additional comments.
<A - Edward P. Decker>: No, again, where the weather has been normal or in fact good, our seasonal business – so
the whole store has been performing, and then the things that tied more heavily to the consumer and outdoor garden,
that has been extremely strong where we have good weather. So I don't know yet if we would've taken any share there.
And then right now, April in the North and even now, a day like today with a lot of rain, again, we don't see great
consumer outside sales. But again, you don't know the relative performance at this point.
<Q - Brian Nagel>: Got it, that's helpful. And then the second question I have, and I guess bigger picture in nature. But
one of the questions I get a lot from our clients is here's Home Depot who's put up great numbers now for a while. How
much longer does this persist? And I know an analysis – you have talked about it at your analyst meetings and such is
just to look at the productivity of the store, particularly by category, so I guess maybe just a quick update there. As you
look around the store and relative to historic peak levels, if you will, where are still the biggest opportunities in the
categories to drive increased productivity from here?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: So I would say that as we look at the business, first of all, my starting comment would be
we're planning a $550 billion market all in now with the addition of Interline and playing in the MRO space for
multi-family hospitality and institutional, and we own less than 20% of that in total. So we think there's lots of
opportunity to grow. We have several initiatives underway, and I have both Ann-Marie and Mark Holifield are here, I'll
let them comment. But several initiatives underway to drive productivity as we move forward, and coordinated effort
between our supply chain and our store operations team.
<A - Mark Holifield>: Yes, we're very pleased with – this is Mark Holifield. We're very pleased with the Supply
Chain Sync initiative. We've got that rolled pretty much in the southern tier of RDCs, with a good deal of our dollar
flow on that. One of the things that's going along with Sync is the floor load process, where we're loading product onto
the floor where previously it was loaded on pallets, and that's driving tremendous productivity just filling trucks much
more full as they depart for stores. So still rolling that out, so still lots of opportunity there.
<A - Ann-Marie Campbell>: And in conjunction with that, there is tremendous opportunity in the back end of the
store. So as Mark talked about Project Sync, we also focus on getting this product to the shelf. And as we manage the
flow of product in the stores, we then really engineer the back end to create a better streamlined process to get the

product on the shelf much quicker as well, so a ton of opportunity there.
And in addition, we have talked about buying online deliver from store. We have also talked about buy online ship to
store. And all those are convenient experiences for the customer, and we want to make sure that we lean in and ensure
that we organize our labor around where the customer is going and create an efficient and effective process for them.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: And if I could jump in, there are sales productivity opportunities too. As Craig said, a huge
market to play, lots of room for growth. But if you think about it from peak to trough, we still haven't fully recovered
some of our categories. So when I look at productivity still to be recovered, special-order kitchens, millwork, some of
our building materials categories still have room to recover from the peak.
<A - Edward P. Decker>: The building material categories in lumber, millwork, those were still, as Carol said, off our
2006 peak as we exited last year, and it was nice to see those were some of our strongest departments in the first quarter
here in 2016. So it's nice to see larger project business underway.
<Q - Brian Nagel>: Thank you, very helpful.
Operator
Our next question comes from Peter Benedict with Robert Baird.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. In the past, you've spoken to, I think it's roughly
25% of your sales mix being in a bucket that you've considered at risk of online competition. Obviously, that's a big
topic right now. Is that still the right way to think about it? And can you give us any color maybe on how the products
in that bucket has performed relative to the rest of the box or how you've been merchandising against that bucket?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Yes, I would say in general, still a good way to think about it. If you think about those things
that carry the highest level of risk would be those that are small package, reasonably high value, easy-to-ship product.
So you think about categories like Power Tools, Faucets and so on. As Ted called out, we had a tremendous quarter as
it related to tool sales. Quite candidly, we're seeing both channels grow in these categories that represent that 25%.
We're staying very focused on driving great value for our customer every day.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Okay, good. That's helpful. And then, Carol, maybe just on leverage. Is there a scenario
where you would be comfortable revisiting that two times leverage guardrail? What would need to happen for you to
even consider something like that?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Peter, as you know, our targeted adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio is two. We're slightly under
that. We're at about 1.9 today. We like that two as a guardrail. It provides financial flexibility, but more importantly,
just – we can sleep at night because we don't have too much leverage at the company, and so we like it. Now, it's not
our goal of let that leverage ratio decline, and it will as we earn more. So as you've seen us in the past, as the leverage
point gets to a certain inflection point and if interest rates are attractive, so on and so forth, we will raise incremental
debt and use that debt to support our share repurchase program.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Okay, fair enough. Thanks so much.

And next we'll hear from Dan Binder with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - Daniel Thomas Binder>: Thank you. If we look at the comp store sales through the quarter, there was a little bit
of deceleration which I suspect was weather-related. I was just curious if you could comment on whether May has
picked back up or is seeing trends similar to April.

<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Yes. As I said earlier, one reason that we're confident with our ability to lift the sales for the
year is what we're seeing in May.
<Q - Daniel Thomas Binder>: Okay. Good to know. And then on the Pro business, I know you said it was above the
company average and there's somewhat of an estimate in there. But just curious, is the gap between the DIY and the
Pro business widening, stable or narrowing?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: It's not dramatically different. It was slightly stronger in the first quarter. I think we saw more
Outdoor Project business, which can have a tendency to be Pro related if you're doing things like concrete.
<Q - Daniel Thomas Binder>: And then lastly, on the overtime proposal that's out there being reviewed, can you just
comment on how Home Depot would be able to digest it if it becomes law?

possible to come. That's factored into our guidance.

And Jaime Katz with Morningstar, your line's open.
<Q - Jaime Katz>: Thanks. I'm curious about lending standards. You guys have mentioned them in the past and I'm
wondering if there have been any changes, particularly if you have them by any sort of demographic? There have been
a few articles out recently saying that millennials have had a more difficult time accessing the credit markets.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: You can look at it through two lenses. First is just, call it, consumer credit, which may come
through a bank card, or in our case, through a private label card. We see consumer credit asks being approved 71% of
the time. So that's a pretty good approval rate. Now, I'll tell you the FICO is pretty high. It's over 700. But that's a pretty
good approval rate. It also speaks to the type of customers who are shopping inside of our store. And the approval rates
for our Pro cards or Pro applicants, is about the same. It gets approved about 70% of the time.
Then you need to look at lending standards and for mortgages, and lending standards are changing ever so slowly. It's
like a glacier melting. And you can appreciate why, because financial institutions have higher capital ratios. It's very
hard to make a buck in this low interest rate environment. So you can understand why it's slow to move, but we've
factored that in as we think about where our business may go. And if there were to be easing on underwriting standards
for mortgages, that would be good news because the affordability index – if you can get a mortgage, the affordability
index is something like 170. That's awesome. So if you can get approved, you can afford it.
<Q - Jaime Katz>: Okay. And then can you guys offer any commentary on any lessons you may have learned so far
from Interline Brands or shared best practices you've adopted into the Home Depot model?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: I think lessons learned would be that our anticipation that we have a customer who has
common need across both businesses would be a clear learning. The desire for the customer, whether it's an Interline
customer to fill in and shop at the Home Depot and/or customers who are shopping in the Home Depot to have the
desire to buy through Interline is there. We're pleased with the start. Bill, I don't know if you have any other comments
to add?
<A - Bill Lennie>: Jaime, Bill Lennie. I think Craig's exactly right. We're encouraged by the customer feedback and
the advantages they see when we combined Interline and Home Depot. And then the second thing that we're pleased
with is the collaboration we're seeing within our outside sales organizations and our ability to join forces and sell across
the end markets.

And next we have Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Michael Baker>: Thanks. Just wanted two, maybe even three follow-ups. One, just to be clear, on the guidance,
are you raising the full-year guidance because of currency being less burdensome and what you saw on the first
quarter? Are you also changing and, I guess, raising the second, third or fourth quarter guidance? Or is all the increase
just because of what we saw on the first quarter and currency?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Mike, the increase is solely related to the outperformance we saw in the United States. The
reason that we are no longer providing a range is that the exchange rates that we used for our plan are now about the
same as the current spot rate. So no need to provide a range. But we're just rolling forward outperformance, except for
weather-driven demand. We're rolling over the rest of the outperformance.
<Q - Michael Baker>: Okay. So no real change in how you would've thought about the second, third and fourth
quarter?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: That's right.
<Q - Michael Baker>: Okay, thank you. Two others. One, Easter. So if I understand it, so Easter hurt March, helped
April. I guess that's because the store – people don't really shop on Easter, but I would've thought that would've been
outweighed by people shopping before Easter to do some outdoor projects. But I guess that's not the case? Easter hurts
March and helped April to shift? Did I understand that correctly?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: That's right. Easter is not a big selling day for the Home Depot.
<Q - Michael Baker>: Right. But again, the sales around Easter don't offset that, I suppose?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: No. No.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: No, they don't.
<A - Edward P. Decker>: You lose a weekend, effectively.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Because it's a weekend in spring.
<Q - Michael Baker>: Okay.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: But again, it doesn't impact the store.
<Q - Michael Baker>: Right. Understood. And then one last, this is maybe a bigger picture question, but it sounds like
you think some of the housing trends are favorable, and we agree with that. One thing, I think, you look at as an
important metric, and we agree again, is home price appreciation. But home prices are now pretty close to where they
were in 2006 if we think of that as the peak year. So do you think – how you think about that? Are we concerned that
there'll be less home price appreciation and then therefore, less of a driver to your business?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: I think the way we look at it, the important factor is, is when home values are positive, it's a
good thing for our business. Clearly, the customer needed to recover the value of their homes. We've seen that
recovery, obviously, take place and improve for a large portion of customers. But as long as home values stay positive,
it's a good thing. I mean, for years and years, home values grew, on average, in the low-single digit, 1%, 2%, 3%.
<Q - Michael Baker>: In your view, just so as we are now back towards peak, your view is that home price
appreciation can continue?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: We factor that into our longer-term forecast. And now this year we believe home prices will be
up around 5%. Important to note that it's not fully recovered even with that 5%. And it's certainly different in different
parts of the country. We think 5% this year, and then we think next year maybe 3%, the year on after that 2%. So it
continues, to Craig's point, because it's just ongoing home price appreciation.

Absolutely. Our last question for today come from Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates.
<Q - Dennis Patrick McGill>: Hi, good morning. Thank you. Just a couple of quick ones. Carol, on the cash flow, can
you just refresh how we should think about cash flow drop down for the year and working capital as we work through
the year?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Yes. So we think we'll generate around $10 billion of cash from the business this year. That
includes a slight improvement in working capital, principally in inventory turnover. We're planning to take our
inventory turnover up at by a tenth in 2016.
<Q - Dennis Patrick McGill>: Okay. And then the share transactions that's greater than 900, I think you've talked
about that as around 20% of late. Where did that peak out in the last cycle?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Where did it peak out in 2006?
<Q - Dennis Patrick McGill>: Yes. Just as a sign of sort of big-ticket share.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: I don't know. We're going to have to go look at it. I am not even sure we did that barbell
analysis back in 2006.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: No. I don't know that we did in 2006. I can tell you that for the last seven or eight, maybe
seven years, it's been pretty comparable to that. And I think the other factor to consider is when we look at 2006 and
look at kind of peak performance, in our own minds we're not sure what the peak really was because in 2006, we
actually had negative transactions. We were firing customers. And so we don't know that we actually – we assume we
didn't actually peak in 2006 the way we should have.
<Q - Dennis Patrick McGill>: Okay, that's fair. Thank you, guys.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Yes.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Yes.
