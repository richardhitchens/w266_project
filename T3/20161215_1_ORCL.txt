And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra.
Safra Ada Catz
Thanks, Ken. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm to focus on our non-GAAP results for the quarter. I'll then review
guidance for Q3 as well as give some direction on FY 2017 and turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their
comments.
Clearly, we are pleased with our results as both total revenue and earnings per share exceeded the midpoint of my
guidance. Our pivot to the cloud has been phenomenal. We continue to see accelerating growth rates in our cloud
business while our key competitors are slowing down. But more importantly, the increasing revenue from our cloud
business is starting to overtake our new software license business decline. Our Cloud revenue will be larger than our
new software license revenue next fiscal year when the transition will be largely complete.
While the investments we've made to transition our business to the cloud have limited our ability to expand earnings
per share near term, they've been important to ensure that Oracle remains the technology leader. With cloud overtaking
new software license revenue, we expect our business to once again exhibit the same pattern we delivered over the
previous decade as a license business, increasing revenue that results in EPS and cash flow that grow even faster. We
continue to use constant dollar growth rates on our quarterly calls so that we can have some measure of consistency
across the quarters as well as to reflect how we measure the business.
This quarter, the effects of currency movements were more than what I had included in my guidance, mostly because of
the strengthening U.S. dollar after recent elections in U.S. and Europe, resulting in a currency headwind of 1% of total
revenue, 2% in some revenue categories and $0.01 to EPS. The devaluation of the Egyptian currency last month also
negatively impacted EPS by a second penny.
None of this was in my guidance for the quarter. Cloud SaaS and PaaS revenue for the quarter was $912 million, up
89% from last year. You can also see the continuing acceleration of our cloud business in the SaaS and PaaS billings
and deferred revenue. The gross deferred revenue balance is now over $1.6 billion, up 51% in U.S. dollars and SaaS
and PaaS billings grew 39% in U.S. dollars this quarter. We've put the billings numbers up on our website for you to
see the detail as usual. When you add together Cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues and new software license revenue, they
grew 5% in constant currency.
And by the way, Database as a Service and database new software license revenue, together, also grew. These are
significant milestones in our transformation, where the combination of our Cloud and new software license businesses,
added together, are growing. As Cloud becomes an even larger percentage of the total, the growth will only accelerate
with earnings and cash flow following along. As our SaaS and PaaS business continues to scale and grow dramatically,
the gross margin continues to expand. Q2 gross margin for SaaS and PaaS was 61%, up from 43% last year, and I
expect to see further improvement in Q3 and Q4.
And from there, we'll be targeting 80%. Cloud infrastructure as a service revenue was $175 million, up 9% from last
year. The Q2 gross margin was 37%. Now that's lower than prior quarters as we are making the necessary investments
to scale out this business.
Now I want to spend a moment explaining it to you, because you're going to see some effects. What's happening with
the infrastructure as a service gross margin is similar to what we experienced with the SaaS and PaaS gross margin,
except that it's off a much smaller revenue base and thus the margin impact is more at the beginning.
To refresh for everyone, when we invested in our SaaS PaaS business in advance of the revenue scale out, the gross
margins declined 15 percentage points before bottoming at 40%. It's now up to 61%, and, as I just mentioned, will
climb to 80% over time.
Similarly, I expect the infrastructure as a service gross margin will decline further over the next few quarters as we
make investments in the business that hit our expenses immediately while the revenue is recognized over time. But for

modeling purposes, I would use 20% as a trough gross margin, probably doesn't need to go quite that low, but just for
modeling purposes you can aim there. After which I expect the gross margin will climb to minimally 40% as the
business scales, probably higher.
Total cloud revenue in the quarter was over $1 billion for the first time at nearly $1.1 billion, up 69% (sic) [64%] in
constant currency from last year. Total on-premise software revenues were $6.1 billion, with software updates and
product support revenues at $4.8 billion, up 3% from last year.
Attach and renewal rates remain at their usual high level as our installed base of customers continues to grow.
New software license revenues were slightly over $1.3 billion. Now that is down 19%, reflecting the continued
emphasis on and migration to cloud.
Total hardware including hardware support was down 9%, with hardware system products revenue of $497 million and
hardware support revenue of $517 million. We're proactive – and just so that you know, we are proactively evaluating
our expense infrastructure needed to support the on-premise hardware business in light of on-premise hardware revenue
declines and the new availability of IaaS for their customers.
For the company, total revenue for the quarter was $9.1 billion, up 2% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income
was $3.8 billion, up 3% from last year, and operating margin was 42%, up from 41% last year.
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 25.5%, considerably higher than last year's 20.4% which had been
favorably impacted by some one-time benefits. Now in view of possible changes to the U.S. corporate tax system,
normalization of our geographic earnings and other factors, the likelihood effects of favorable impacts to our tax rate
over time is higher, but obviously not certain.
Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.61 in U.S. dollars. The GAAP tax rate was 24.3%. The GAAP EPS was $0.48 in
U.S. dollars.
Operating cash flow over the last four quarters was $14.2 billion. Capital expenditure for Q2 was $757 million, with
cloud CapEx accounting for approximately 40% of the total, with the rest being real estate.
Free cash flow over the last four quarters was $12.6 billion, up 10% from last year. We now have approximately $58
billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately $4 billion.
The short-term deferred revenue balance is $7.4 billion, up 8% in constant currency. This quarter, we purchased nearly
13 million shares for a total of $500 million, which is less than prior quarters, due obviously to the use of our cash for
the acquisition of NetSuite. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased 172 million shares for a total of $6.7 billion,
and we've paid out dividends of $2.5 billion. And the Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15
per share.
Now to the guidance. I'm going to provide guidance for Q3, then some updated comments about the whole year. Given
recent currency movements, we expect to see continued volatility in exchange rates and significant currency
headwinds. Today again was a very significant day in currency, with the dollar strengthening.
I'm going to give you constant currency guidance, but if current exchange rates remain just about where they are right
now, we expect to see a currency headwind of at least 1% on revenue and at least $0.01 to EPS. All of my guidance
today is on a non-GAAP basis.
With that, my guidance is as follows. SaaS and PaaS revenue, including NetSuite, is expected to grow 82% to 86%.
Software and cloud revenue, including SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS, new software license, and software support is expected to
grow 4% to 6%. Total revenue is expected to grow 3% to 5%.
EPS is expected to be between $0.61 and $0.64 in constant currency. Now this assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 25.5%,
which is considerably higher than the 22.6% reported last year. As a reminder, last year's tax rate was lower, mostly
due to the catch-up of benefits related to the U.S. R&D tax credit. Of course, the Q3 tax rate could end up being
different.

Over the full year of FY 2017, I'm raising the outlook for FY 2017 SaaS and PaaS revenue growth from 67% to 80%
with NetSuite now added, and continued strengthening in our SaaS and PaaS business. I continue to expect SaaS and
PaaS gross margins will exit Q4 higher than the 61% reported today, as our cloud business continues to grow
dramatically.
Lastly, I expect our total CapEx spend for the year will be in the range of about $2 billion, with over half of it being
due to non-cloud real estate investments that we made this year that will not be repeating next year.
With that, I'll turn it over to Mark for his comments.
Mark V. Hurd
Thank you. As usual, I'm just going to give you a slew of numbers here and try to give you some context on the quarter.
Everything is year on year in CC [Constant Currency] unless I say otherwise.
Cloud bookings for the quarter, $377 million in USD; Q2 was the best non-Q4 we have ever had. I'll make a prediction
that Q3 has a chance to be our best-ever quarter, period. SaaS bookings were $217 million USD and PaaS infrastructure
bookings were $160 million in USD. Now just let me give you some numbers by pillar as it relates to our SaaS/PaaS
revenue. We were up 89%, more than 30% higher than Amazon, Salesforce, or Workday. ERP had 104% growth
quarter on quarter, eighth consecutive quarter with sequential growth greater than 50%.
HCM grew 131% again this quarter. That's four times the growth rate of Workday. CX, Customer Experience, grew
15% organically. Service was up 24%. Data as a service up, 71%. Database as a Service, up 700% and already at $100
million in quarterly revenue. PaaS was up 600% and overall SaaS PaaS grew 89%. SaaS PaaS billings grew 39% in
USD. SaaS PaaS deferred revenue 51% USD.
Now just some customer metrics. IDC recently released their SaaS market share estimates and Oracle is now the
number one market share leader in enterprise SaaS. In the quarter, we got almost 1,100 new SaaS customers, 1,082 to
be exact, and had 810 expansions. In CX we had 443 new customers, 517 expansions. In HCM we had 224 new
customers and 212 expansions. In ERP we had 532 new customers, and that does not include NetSuite. We got 91
expansions. Over half of the new ERP customers never had an Oracle app before they bought this quarter.
Our active base now 3,269 customers with 1,275 live over 10x greater than Workday. In total, we now have almost
13,000 customers in our SaaS active base and 25,000 if you actually include NetSuite.
Digital cloud is now nearly two-thirds of our new customer wins. This is a big deal for us, because it was 10 years
actually writing this code and it is now the bulk of our SaaS business. 348 go lives, best quarter ever. 2,116 customers
are now live on Fusion. We've got 2,225 new platform customers in the quarter, and our installed base now sits at
12,168. We got 2,148 infrastructure customers. They're buying standalone infrastructure services and together our
installed base of PaaS and infrastructure now sits at 21,219 customers. Now as a point of clarification, PaaS and
infrastructure customers are counted for each service that's used.
Now let me just give you names of a few customers in the quarter. I'm going to go through just a couple pillars. First in
ERP, so I'm giving you a list of ERP customers who purchased in the quarter: Canon, Deutsche Telekom, DICK'S
Sporting Goods, FedEx, Ferguson, Hasbro, Hill-Rom, Koch Industries, Noble Energy, Ricoh, Skanska, Texas
Instruments.
I'm going to give you a list of HCM customers in the quarter: Berkshire Hathaway, Cummins, Dubai Airport, Kaiser
Foundation Hospitals, NETGEAR, ON Semiconductor, Siemens, Skanska, Sonic Automotive, Tesco, The Hearst
Corporation.
It was a solid quarter for us. And lastly, let me just sort of describe where I think we are. We not only had strong
revenue and billings as well, but our Q2 billings were solid at 39%. Q3 has a chance to be our best quarter ever. Q2
revenue was fantastic at 89%, and we've clearly crossed the revenue chasm. We are clearly the fastest-growing cloud

company at scale.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry.
Lawrence J. Ellison
Thank you, Mark.
Historically, I've measured Oracle performance by comparing our technology and our market share to our two primary
competitors, SAP in applications and IBM in infrastructure and database. That changed as we moved to the cloud. In
the cloud, we measure Oracle against Salesforce.com in applications and Amazon Web Services in infrastructure and
database.
Our cloud applications goal is to be the world's largest and most profitable SaaS company. We are growing our cloud
business much faster than Salesforce.com, and we can beat them to the $10 billion mark, but it's going to be close. IDC
already recognizes Oracle as the number one in annual SaaS sales to large enterprises. Salesforce.com is number two.
We will book more than $2 billion in annual cloud sales this year, much more than Salesforce.com. We are catching up
to them, and we're catching them very quickly.
Our goal in infrastructure and database is to be number one running database workloads in the cloud on our
infrastructure as a service. The Oracle Database has a huge technical and market share lead over the Amazon Web
Services databases, Azure and Redshift. But much more importantly, the Oracle cloud infrastructure as a service runs
the Oracle Database workloads much faster, more reliably and at a significantly lower cost than the Oracle Database
running at Amazon's IaaS.
We are making a multi-year generational shift to the cloud, and we're well on our way to being number one in both
cloud applications and cloud database. And we're doing it with very little or no compromise to our earnings or our cash
flow.
With that, I'll open it up for questions.
Kenneth Bond
Holly, would you begin the Q&A, please?

Operator
Yes. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies.
<Q - John DiFucci>: Thank you. My question is for Mark. Mark, our field checks this quarter led us to believe that
cloud traction accelerated beyond what you had been doing, which was pretty good; very good. And we thought this
might have a negative effect on license, which sort of comes through in the increased decline in license. But with ARR
growth of 30%, I'm not sure – that doesn't seem to be indicative of increasing cloud traction. Can you help us resolve
this?
I mean, what we're hearing in the field and the numbers, what the numbers seem to indicate, is it as simple as 30%
ARR growth may not be the 42% of last quarter but it's still pretty good off such a large number, or is there something
else going on?
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: All right. Let me go into bigger than the math, to start with. Our pipeline is really big. Our wins
are pretty big – are quite big as well. Not – as I mentioned in my script, and I may have gone over it too fast. First of

all, I think we had a good quarter in ARR so these are the days when 30% growth, gee I wish it was higher, I like 30%
growth. That said, we can do a lot better, and what I said about Q3, so Q2 just to go back to that number is the best
non-Q4 we have ever had in terms of bookings. I think there's a chance and I'll repeat it again Q3 is the best quarter
we've ever had – we could ever have period.
That's how good I feel about our pipeline, how good I feel about our positions, deals that – I don't usually talk about
deals we've won in early Q3, but that's how strong our position is going into it. And my guess John is that's why you
hear what you hear from your field checks, the deals we've won. We may not have contracted it, put on a piece of paper
but we feel really strong about our position. Larry talked about the $2 billion for the full year, so that would be my
response, John.
<Q - John DiFucci>: And if I could, just to be clear, when you were talking right now, you're talking like because
there's a lot of terms like ARR, billings, bookings. And I'm going to stick with your ARR number because that's what
you guys when you first started talking about this. When you're talking about this could be the best quarter ever, you're
talking about what you've traditionally called the ARR which is new annual recurring revenue.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Yeah, John. You're right. We are passing a lot of different numbers to you. I think we're trying
to be very transparent with all the deferred numbers and the billings and so forth, but the comment I made directly
related to new and expansion ARR bookings. And that is in the end, a very good surrogate for how well we'll perform.
So I think the big number though back to it is the full year number that we've described. And so you may see some
things in the quarter that go up or down, but the full year $2 billion number is where we sit.
<Q - John DiFucci>: Great. That is very clear and very helpful. Thanks.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Thank you, John.
Operator
And our next question will come from the line of Mark Moerdler with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Mark L. Moerdler>: Thank you. Can you give, provide us more details and insight into NetSuite, its impact on
Q2 revenue margins et cetera and its impact going forward? I'd really appreciate it. Thanks.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: We got NetSuite in Q2, about as I said I think – as I thought I said but maybe I didn't mention
around November 7, so we didn't even have a full month. So it's around $50 million. It's basically a wash on all the
other lines, as you know, since we just got it.
It's revenue track is very similar to what it's been doing. However, as you know, NetSuite doesn't grow as fast as our
cloud business grows, nor is it as profitable. So over time, we're going to bring it to where we're doing, and we also
hope to accelerate it actually because our product line is so much broader, including EPM and things like that. So this
quarter I could refer to it as a wash. And as we own it over time we expect to be able to leverage it, but it doesn't grow
obviously as fast as our ERP business does.
<Q - Mark L. Moerdler>: Excellent. And if you could give us over time a little more color on that, that would be
great. I'd really appreciate it. Thank you.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Okay, I will.
Operator
And our next question will come from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Keith Eric Weiss>: Thank you, guys, for taking the question. You mentioned during the conference call that
Database and Database-as-a-Service together grew again. I think it's the second quarter in a row you made that

comment. One of the questions that I get a lot from clients and wanted to ask of you is are we seeing the positive
impacts of the 12c cycle? Is that already showing up in terms of options driving that number higher on the license side?
And is the Database-as-a-Service offering, is the new 12c offering driving people to the cloud offering as well, or is it
still really early days in terms of that cycle and this is just core database growth if you will.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: It's really early days. Actually, 12.2 is only available right now in our cloud and
Database-as-a-Service, so it really isn't available on-premises yet. So our policy is cloud-first, including the release of
our latest technologies. So again, we're very, very early on in terms of the 12.2 cycle and it impacting our database
licenses.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: So really all you're seeing is just the strength of our Database business. It's a very, very strong
business generally because it is by far the best and we've been gaining market share now really for years. And that just
continues because it meets the needs of so many customers.
<Q - Keith Eric Weiss>: If I could just have one follow up, albeit early days, you gave us an update a while ago on the
options and talking about some of these options being the most well adopted options that you've seen. Has that trend
continued? Are you continuing to see strong adoption of some of those new options on 12c?
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: I think, again, people are using these options in the cloud. I think they're very excited
about using them both in the cloud and on-premise. And I think it's going to have a positive impact, a very significant
impact on both our Database-as-a-Service and our on-prem license business.
<Q - Keith Eric Weiss>: Excellent. Thank you, guys.
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Kash Rangan>: Hey, guys, Happy Holidays, one question for Safra and one for Mark, if that's okay. A question
for you, Safra, with respect to your cloud transition, one of the things we keep looking for is gross profit growth rate.
And you've been able to show that two quarters in a row. I think for the first time we also saw op income growth rate.
Are you still confident that on an organic basis that you can continue to accelerate op income growth rate? And if so,
what will contribute to that?
And one quick one for Mark, if I could, can you comment on what the Accelerated Buying Experience program means
for the company's growth rate future? Thank you so much.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Okay. Obviously, I think what you're starting to see, we've got a bunch of things going on that
are all positive. We have revenue growth. We have operating income growth, and I think you're going to see that
actually accelerate. So as SaaS and PaaS really take off, this is going to show up. And I want to make sure I reiterate
from Financial Analyst Day. Once again, we are expecting double-digit earnings growth also in FY 2018. So this is –
you'll hear me say that many times, and you're starting to see the upturn.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Kash, I know you didn't ask me a question. I was the only one left out. That's okay. So I'm
going to chime in here and just say there are huge economies of scale in this business. So as we scale it, that's why it's
so important that we become number one in SaaS. There are just tremendous advantages of being number one. There
are huge economies of scale. It contributes enormously to our profitability in the business both in SaaS and being
number one in Database in the cloud.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: To your other question, Accelerated Buying Experience continues to progress. We launched it
really less than a year ago. This is our third quarter really doing it. We've got about now 70% of our transactions, not
necessarily our dollar volume going through. And our customers are just, to be very frank, it's very well received and
they're just happier. It's just easier to do business and to get a contract with Oracle now than it's ever been. And it's
great when customers are happier.

Our next target is really to focus around their overall experience in the cloud after the purchase. So ABE, or
Accelerated Buying Experience, really focused on the actual purchase and the contract. Our focus now is really after
that contract and between the contract signing and the renewal. And to that end, on December 1 I announced a group
inside Oracle called the Oracle Cloud Global Service and Support Group. And it really pulls together all the various
organizations around the company that have touched our cloud customers and brings them together into an
organizational unit focused solely on pleasing and delighting our customers and giving them the absolute best customer
experience they can possibly have. We want to become and define what the best cloud experience is in the industry for
our customers. So think of that as the follow-on to the Accelerated Buying Experience and we've announced that
effective December 1.
<Q - Kash Rangan>: Thanks, Safra, Mark, and Larry.

And now our next question will come from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Ross MacMillan>: Thanks a lot. I had one for Safra and then maybe one related for Larry. When we think about
CapEx this year guided to $2 billion, a bit less than half on cloud. So that billion run rate, is that the right level of
CapEx that we should be thinking about even beyond this year, or will it grow as the total cloud grows? And then
related to that, for Larry, is infrastructure-as-a-Service a necessity as opposed to platform-as-a-Service if you are going
to be able to migrate existing on-prem database workloads to the cloud? Thanks.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Okay, so two things are happening. As you grow in both IaaS and PaaS, you do get first an
investment period and then you really have economies of scale, which we should see. So it will not grow linearly at all.
So it will grow with depending on how successful we are, but it's growing up front, then it's going to slow down, get
used, and then grow as a smaller and smaller percentage. And that's what we are expecting.
As far as our capital expenditures this year, we obviously very much front-loaded both some of our cloud investment
and also our real estate investment, which will not be sort of the big chunk it is right – it was this year.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: And the question about infrastructure-as-a-Service, is it essential? The answer is yes. If
you want to move existing database workloads to the cloud and minimize the changes customers have to make as they
migrate, in other words, make it a graceful, easy lift and shift, we can configure our cloud network to match their
network. We can configure the servers to match their capacity of their servers, configure storage, deliver Exadata
service, do all of that with virtually no disruption to what they're doing. They press a button, move their database, move
their workflows, and it just runs pretty much like the way it ran. They don't have to retest the application. They can just
move it, and it will just run.
Then we absolutely need an infrastructure-as-a-Service in combination with our platform-as-a-Service, we need both of
them to do that gracefully. So it is an essential. We've been in this infrastructure as a business technology development
phase for a long time. We're rolling it out to customers. Again, early days, but it's being very, very well received. Of
course, the litmus test is can we do it better than Amazon? Can our infrastructure – big question, can Oracle's
infrastructure-as-a-Service differentiate itself from Amazon? Can we do it more gracefully, more reliably, less
expensively, more securely than Amazon can? And we think we can. And that's going to make us very, very
competitive.
<Q - Ross MacMillan>: Thank you very much.

<Q - Sarah Hindlian>: Great. Thank you so much for taking my question. Safra, this one's really for you. So one of
the big things we get asked about and would love some help on is as more and more customers are pivoting to Oracle
Cloud, you've still maintained this very high renewal rate on the maintenance stream. And I'd love to know a little bit
more about how we should be thinking about the maintenance, updates and support longer-term and the trajectory on
that line. Even as new licenses are declining, you're still selling licenses. So how should we be thinking about that
longer-term, Safra?
And then a real quick second one for Mark around the hardware business. We didn't spend a whole lot of time on that
today, would also love to hear how you're thinking about that business longer-term as well. Thank you, guys.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Okay. So you're right in that our renewal rates remain very high. However, as you know, we
don't renew 100% of our license updates and product support. And as the new software license number gets smaller and
smaller, it is true that at one point, software support will flatten out and actually go down. That's a ways out so far, and
we actually don't have any indication of that because we continue to sell quite a lot in new software licenses.
However, ultimately, we would be – it would be a – I know it's hard to imagine a good outcome, but it will mean that
we are getting an extremely large number in our SaaS PaaS number, one that actually is dwarfing not only new
software license, but new software license and any kind of decline in the software support number, such that the whole
software number, which is SaaS, PaaS, new software license and support, is all going up and actually accelerating.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: I think before I go into the hardware, our renewal rates in software for the quarter, we usually
just tell you they're about the same. To be very exact, they actually went up. So our cancellation rates were down in the
quarter. So we have a very strong renewal rate in our software business.
Now that said, we are actually in many cases trying to convert our customers to cloud. So just to be clear, that means
for us more money. That means for us more margin. So it is clearly our objective over time, let's take the Applications
business to migrate our on-prem Applications customers to our cloud applications, and as Larry mentioned, our
Database customers on-prem to our infrastructure and platform.
And we believe, as you all very well – most of you at least very well know the math, that means for us a larger
recurring revenue stream. And as our margins continue to climb, that means more earnings for us and we think a great
experience for our customers as well.
Hardware, really more of what we've talked about, sort of the reason we haven't talked about it much, we had a very
good Engineered Systems quarter. Again, Engineered Systems grew and in both bookings and revenue in the quarter.
That ecosystem continues to be very successful, very profitable for us. It does a great job for us. We had declines in
what you would think of as our traditional server business, and those declines offset the growth in Engineered Systems.
So it's really the tale of sort of two product lines, Engineered Systems growing, the traditional server product line
declining.
Now this is the last quarter, this being Q2, that you will see the declines because of the acquired GBU products. So we
bought a couple of – MICROS, for example, a couple of years ago, a year and a half ago. It had a bunch of third-party
products that we actually stopped, and that's actually hurt the growth rate of the hardware line. That begins to end as we
go into Q3. So those are sort of the three factors: the third-party products in our MICROS business, growth in
Engineered Systems and the decline of traditional server business.
<Q - Sarah Hindlian>: All right. Thank you. That was very helpful. I appreciate it.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Thank you.

Our next question will come from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James.
Company Name: Oracle
Company Ticker: ORCL US
Date: 2016-12-15

<Q - Michael Turits>: Good evening, everybody. This is a question that's mostly for Safra and for Mark on license.
New software license declined 19% constant currency. Does this mean that license declines could continue to steepen
going forward? And maybe I'll ask the second part of my question at the same time, which is Database as a business
overall grew. So if you could, talk to us about how Database license did within license overall.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: So let me at least get started with that. No, I actually am not expecting next quarter for it to
decline even at the 19% rate because the big decline has been on the applications side, as SaaS has really overtaken our
apps business. And as apps have gotten smaller, the base itself is small that when it declines it has a smaller impact on
our overall new software license. Now ultimately, at one point, you'll see the same happening in Database. But the
reality is you're not seeing it in Database at this time because our installed base of usage continues to increase at all
levels, on-premise and in the cloud simultaneously.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Once again, no one asked me a question, but I'll use this great opportunity to answer it
anyway. So let me be clear. So if you convert, if you move from the Oracle E-Business Suite on-premise and then you
take up Fusion ERP in the cloud, and we encourage you to do that. We want you to do that. You cancel your support
for the Oracle ERP on-premise, what we call the E-Business Suite, and you start paying us a monthly free for Fusion.
So not only does new license go down, but even support goes down when you make the shift, and we want you to do
that because we make a lot more money that way.
However, in Database, if you bring Database to Infrastructure-as-a-Service, you need to own a Database license. You
never cancel your Database license and support. That goes on forever. So as people migrate, let's say you take the
Oracle Database to Oracle Infrastructure-as-a-Service. You still pay your support. And if you need more, you buy
more, license more Database. Let's say you take the Oracle Database to Amazon. You need your Oracle Database and if
you need more of it, you got to buy more of it and license more of it, and you have to keep paying support. So they're
very different businesses. They are profiled very, very differently.
So as Safra said, a lot of the license decline is attributable to our Applications business, which the on-prem Application
business is getting smaller and smaller. The Database business, license business is growing. So these are very – both
these businesses will react very differently in the cloud. It's not an unlikely outcome that our Database license business
goes on forever and the associated support goes on forever, even though customers are running that Database now, not
on their own computers, but on our Infrastructure-as-a-Service or Amazon's Infrastructure-as-a-Service or Azure's
Infrastructure-as-a-Service. So you have to model these two businesses entirely differently.
<Q - Michael Turits>: Thanks, Larry. I didn't mean to leave you out. I appreciate the color.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: I know I'm getting old and that this is complicated stuff, and I realize you don't want to
wear me out during the call. So I appreciate your consideration.
<Q - Michael Turits>: Thanks. Thanks very much. Okay, guys. Thanks a lot.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Thank you.

And now our final question will come from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.
<Q - Raimo Lenschow>: Thanks for taking my question, and it's great to see your CTO so busy on the call. My
question is actually for Mark. Mark, can you talk a little bit about what you see in the different regions? You talked
about the products, but I just wanted to hear how you see the regional performance. If I look at the numbers, Asia was
very strong. U.S. and Europe moderated a little bit. Can you just talk what you see in terms of end demand there?
And then, Safra, did I hear you correctly that you talked about double-digit EPS growth in 2018? I just wanted to
clarify that.

<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Okay. By the way, just to be clear, to the CTO's earlier point, as it relates to apps and the
Applications business, we actually don't compensate our salespeople for Applications on-premise. So just to be clear, to
connect these dots in terms of how we actually operationalize the company, our salespeople in the Applications
ecosystem sell SaaS. So if they sell – we have small SWAT teams in what we would call our Oracle Direct
organization that really help our existing users buy incremental seats if they need to, to their existing on-premise
applications.
So I only say that to you because all of this is planful on our part. Our objective is to move to SaaS, to get as clear
about our direction with SaaS, and it's resulted in this leadership position in enterprise SaaS that we discussed earlier.
So this is all very planful on our part.
To your question about the regions, all of our regions – the region that had the toughest time in the quarter was Latin
America. And Latin America had been historically and still is one of our best regions in terms of our performance of
our team et cetera, but they're going through all of the things that you all know about in Brazil, some of the issues that
have cropped up now in Mexico. But now at the same time as Latin America has had a little bit of a tough time, they
are gaining significant market share in that market. So while the numbers in Latin America are more, perhaps, not as
good as we all would love, or have been in the past, their relative performance compared to their peers, is fantastic. So
I'm actually very proud of them in spite of the fact that the absolute dollar value let's say – save that, our Europe and
North America regions preformed roughly as I would've expected.
I continue to believe our European organization has done a tremendous job over the past several years. In addition,
they've done a tremendous move over to cloud. Their absolute bookings on an overall basis just taking license and
cloud combined grew, so very significant. I'm pleased with North America as well. They were roughly as we expected.
On the flip side, I would say Asia has been superb. I think Asia has done a nice turnaround. It wasn't a couple of years
ago we'd sit on a call and get questions about some of the performance in Asia. We weren't very happy with that. We
made some changes. And I think the performance in Asia on virtually every metric we see, I'm talking about hardware,
SaaS, PaaS, infrastructure and license has been very favorable. So I'm very pleased with the results in Asia.
Double-digit?
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Yes, sir. I wanted to just make sure you did hear me right. We are expecting to have
double-digit earnings growth next year.
<Q - Raimo Lenschow>: I'm looking forward to that.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: So are we.
<Q - Raimo Lenschow>: Thank you, looking forward to that.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Okay.
