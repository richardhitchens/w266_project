MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's fourth quarter 2015 earnings call. This call is
being recorded. Your lines will be muted for the duration of the call.
We will now go live to the presentation, please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan
Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead.
Marianne Lake
Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is available on
our website. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation.
Starting on page one, the firm reported net income of $5.4 billion, EPS of $1.32, and a return on tangible common
equity of 11% on $23.7 billion of revenue. Included in the result is legal expense of $400 million after tax for a range
of matters, and we continue to put some issues behind us. This is reflected in a reduction of more than $1 billion to our
reasonably possible loss estimate this quarter.
In addition, we recognized the benefit of a settlement reached of $300 million after tax, which related to monies owed
to Washington Mutual in connection with a failed savings and loan institution. We've shown this on the page as legal
related and the benefit is recorded in revenue in corporate.

Much like we saw in the third quarter, the overall company's performance benefited from diversification across our
businesses. We saw strong growth in consumer drivers on the back of improvement in the U.S. economy, in large part
generating core loan growth of 16% for the company.
Global markets remained challenged across a number of fronts, leading to lower client activity and lower inventory.
Against this backdrop, the CIB delivered solid performance across products. And in the quarter, we continued our trend
of strong balance sheet, capital, and expense discipline and exceeded targets.
Shifting to the full year's results, if you skip over page two, on page three, the firm earned record net income of $24.4
billion and record EPS of $6.00 a share, and a return on tangible common equity of 13.5% on revenue of nearly $97
billion. Revenue was down 1% or $1.3 billion, driven by non-core items, most notably, by business simplification in
the Investment Bank and also in private equity. Adjusted, our underlying businesses were up modestly.
We're very happy with our expense story for the year. We delivered adjusted expense of $56 billion, down $2.4 billion
and a two percentage point decrease in adjusted overhead ratio. And while we did have a modest benefit from the
strengthening dollar this year, we also self-funded incremental investments.
Credit performance was strong, in line with our expectations, with net charge-offs at $4.1 billion, with obviously the
biggest area of stress in wholesale being oil and gas, against which we built about $550 million of reserves this year,
including $124 million this quarter. And as the outlook for oil has weakened, we would expect to see some additional
reserve build in 2016, but prices would need to remain at this level for an extended period for them to be significant.
We also built $68 million of reserves in metals and mining, including $35 million this quarter. We're watching this
sector closely. And similarly, if commodity prices remain at current levels, we would expect some additional reserve
build but would not expect them to be significant.
Finally, net capital distributions for the year were approximately $11 billion, including dividends of $1.72 a share.
Turning to page four, starting on the top left, overall our average balance sheet is down $100 billion year on year and
our spot balance sheet down over $200 billion, with of course the biggest driver being the reduction of approximately
$200 billion of wholesale non-operating deposits, ultimately reflected in lower cash balances.
In addition, you can see notable reductions in all other balance sheet categories except for loans, which reflects the 16%
core loan growth we achieved. Some portion of the other wholesale balance reductions were purposeful and will be
sticky, particularly the decrease in short-term wholesale funding balances. The remainder resulted from volatile
markets and general deleveraging, driving risk off and lower inventory across products. As client demand for leverage
grows, we will likely put some of that balance sheet back to work.
Moving to the right, the story on deposits continues to be a very positive one, as we delivered some incremental
reductions in non-operating balances while consistently growing retail and operating deposits.
On the bottom left, overall NII was up about $300 million, driving a seven basis point improvement in NIM. The
increase in NII reflects a mix shift to loans but also includes gains on certain securities, and the impact of the rate move
in December on this quarter's NII was not significant.
Looking forward to the first quarter, expect firm NII and NIM to be flat to up slightly on higher rates and mix,
substantially offset by the absence of those security gains as well as normal seasonal day count. However, for the full
year, with the December rate hike alone, so in a rate-flat scenario, together with the loan growth that we have seen and
expect, we would expect to deliver about $2 billion of incremental NII.
Perhaps the highlight of this page on the bottom right is that based upon the actions we've taken throughout the course
of 2015, we believe that we have just reached the 3.5% Method 2 G-SIB bucket and that we are in or close to the 2%
Method 1 G-SIB bucket. So the task ahead is to solidify this position, which we'll talk more about at Investor Day.
Turning to page five, we're ending the year well ahead of our capital targets, with the firm's advanced fully phased-in
CET1 ratio at 11.6% and our standardized fully phased-in ratio at 11.7%. The improvement to both ratios was driven

by net capital generation along with an overall reduction in risk-weighted assets, with net loan growth being more than
offset by lower market risk, reductions in derivatives, as well as secured financing balances, and these deliver a more
meaningful reduction under the standardized approach. What was referenced in my earlier comments on redeploying
balance sheet, a portion of this reduction will likely reverse in the near future.
Firm and bank SLR were at 6.5% and 6.6%, respectively. Finally, we returned $2.6 billion of net capital to
shareholders this quarter, including $1 billion of net repurchases and common dividends of $0.44 a share.
Let's turn to page six and Consumer & Community Banking. The combined Consumer businesses generated $2.4
billion of net income on revenue of $11.2 billion and an ROE of 18% for the quarter. And full-year expense was down
by nearly $1 billion, or half of our commitment if you adjust for legal, and $150 million of incremental investments this
year. Going forward, we will look for opportunities to further reinvest.
You can see head count was down by 12,000 for the year and nearly 43,000 since 2012.
The fundamental business drivers remain strong. Year over year, average loans were up 11%, with core loans up 25%,
driven by mortgage but with strength across products. Average deposits were up 10%. We added nearly 600,000
households. And our active mobile customer base continues to grow, up 20% to roughly 23 million customers, the
largest of the major U.S. banks.
Moving to page seven, Consumer & Business Banking, CBB generated strong results for the quarter, with net income
of $968 million and an ROE of 32% on relatively flat revenue of $4.6 billion. Although NII was flat quarter on quarter,
it was down 5% year on year on spread compression, largely offset by that 10% deposit growth. And excluding an $85
million gain on the sale of a branch, non-interest revenue was down 3% seasonally and up 4% year on year, driven by
higher service fees and strong debit volume. We expect NIR to show normal seasonal declines in the first quarter.
Expense was down 3% year on year on lower head count from branch efficiency. And additionally, client assets were
up 2% and business banking average loan balances up 6%.
Next, Mortgage Banking on page eight, overall net income was $266 million. Originations in the quarter were $23
billion, down seasonally. And we continue to add high-quality loans to our balance sheet, $16 billion for the quarter
and totaling $70 billion for the full year. Total revenue of $1.7 billion increased 8% sequentially on strong loan growth
as well as on higher MSR risk management.
For the full year, our non-interest revenue was down relative to 2014 by $1.2 billion, broadly in line with our guidance.
And that downward trend will continue, as servicing balances continue to decline and as we expect production margins
will compress in a smaller market. We expect the decline in 2016 to be around $700 million.
Expense of $1.2 billion ticked up this quarter related to exiting the OCC's Consent Order, but it was down 10% year on
year as we continue to manage costs. Finally, on credit, net charge-offs of 13 basis points reflect the quality of the
portfolio.
Moving on to page nine, Card, Commerce Solutions & Auto, overall net income of $1.2 billion and ROE of 24%.
Revenue was $5 billion, up 10% year on year, driven principally by two non-recurring items. The first was a loss in the
prior year of over $200 million that related to non-core portfolio exits and a gain we saw this quarter of about $160
million on the IPO of Square. Adjusted, the revenue rate was 11.9%. And in terms of core performance, the business
drivers were strong, and growth offset the impact of co-brand renewals on non-interest revenues while driving growth
in NII.
Year over year, we saw growth of 12% in auto loan and lease balances, 6% in card sales volume, 3% in cars core loans,
as well as 12% and 14% in merchant processing volumes and transactions respectively.
Expense of $2.2 billion, flat quarter on quarter but up 4% year on year, reflected higher depreciation on auto lease
growth. And we expect expense to be relatively flat into the first quarter as we continue to invest.
While on Auto, 2015 set the record for new car sales, with strength in the fourth quarter continuing through December.
And we gained nearly 40 basis points of share year over year, with the strength of our manufacturing partnerships

driving growth.
Finally, on Credit, in Auto net charge-offs were 50 basis points. And while higher, it was still below our long-term
expectations. And in Card, the net charge-off rate was 242 basis points for the quarter, 251 basis points for the year.
And given our underwriting discipline, client selection, and the improving economy, we expect net charge-offs to stay
at these levels in 2016.
Now turning to page 10 and the Corporate & Investment Bank, CIB reported net income of $1.7 billion on revenue of
$7.1 billion and an ROE of 10%. In Investment Banking for the full year, we continued to rank number one in global
IB fees and number one in North America and EMEA. In M&A, we maintained our number two ranking and grew
wallet share by 50 basis points. In ECM, we ranked number one globally, up from number three last year. And in
DCM, we ranked number one across High-Yield, High-Grade, and Loans.
Banking revenue for the quarter of $1.5 billion was down 11%, driven by lower debt underwriting fees. It was another
outstanding performance in advisory fees, up 43% from the third quarter in a market that was down 12%, largely driven
by North America. Equity underwriting fees were down 4% in a market down 12%, with the U.S. remaining somewhat
slow but a resurgence of large transactions in Europe and Asia. And debt underwriting fees were down 43% from a
record last year, where we saw an unprecedented number of large fee events.
Treasury Services revenue was flat quarter on quarter but down 4% year on year on lower deposit spreads.
In Markets, a number of factors contributed to a quiet fourth quarter overall across products. Investor risk appetite was
significantly dampened by a series of market events, as clients retrenched and derisked early. With that backdrop, the
Markets businesses delivered $3.6 billion in revenue, in line with our expectation and normal seasonal trends, with
adjusted revenues down 16% sequentially and 1% year on year.
In Fixed Income, rates markets were up given U.S. and ECB monetary policy actions, offset by year on year declines in
currencies and emerging markets, as the strong dollar and emerging markets uncertainty themes persisted, as well as
the commodities on reduced hedging, and declines in credit on all those same themes plus a number of single named
corporate events.
Equities delivered solid results, flat excluding the exit of broker dealer services last year, with strong performance in
Europe being offset by lower deal flow in North America and Asia compared to a strong prior year.
With respect to the first quarter reflecting low levels of client activity, we were light risk going into the year-end and
inventory was low. And so far, our trading businesses are performing well. But as you know, it is early and difficult to
predict how the quarter will play out.
Securities Services revenue was $933 million, in line with guidance given the continued impact of lower emerging
markets on asset-based fees. For the first quarter, expect revenue to be approximately $900 million, which includes
seasonality.
On Credit, we saw a reserve build of $76 million, which included $63 million related to oil and gas. Finally, expense of
$4.4 billion was down 20% year on year, mainly driven by lower legal. The comp-to-revenue ratio was 26% for the
quarter and 30% for the full year.
Moving on to page 11 and the Commercial Bank, the Commercial Bank generated net income of $550 million on
revenue of $1.8 billion and an ROE of 15%. Revenue was up sequentially but relatively flat year on year, with NII up
3% on higher loan balances despite spread compression, offset by lower IB revenue from a strong quarter last year.
However, for the full year, it was a record for Investment Banking, with gross revenue of $2.2 billion, up 10% from
2014. Expense of $750 million included $50 million of impairments on leased corporate aircraft on the reassessment of
residual values. The remaining balance sheet value of this portfolio is modest.
We saw record average loan balances of $166 billion, up 14% year on year, with growth in commercial real estate of
17% exceeding the industry as we continue to invest in this business and gain share. In C&I, loans were up 11%,
largely driven by corporate client banking on the back of several large transactions.

Finally, credit performance of the portfolio does remain strong, with only four basis points of net charge-offs.
However, we did add $100 million to reserves, $60 million of which relates to oil and gas and $26 million for metals
and mining.
Moving on to page 12, Asset Management, Asset Management reported net income of $500 million, with a 27%
pre-tax margin and 21% ROE on revenue of $3 billion, down 5% year on year, driven by lower performance fees in
alternatives. Expense of $2.2 billion was also down 5% year on year, roughly equally explained by lower performance
fee-driven compensation as well as a benefit from refining the value of a held-for-sale asset.
Assets under management of $1.7 trillion and client assets of $2.4 trillion were down 1% and 2% year over year
respectively. We saw mixed flows in the fourth quarter, resulting in long-term net outflows of $9 billion, with solid
inflows in equities more than offset by weakness in fixed income and the loss of select mandates. However, we had
strong long-term investment performance with 80% of mutual fund AUM ranked in the first or second quartiles over
five years, which should be supportive of future flows. And for the full year, we had positive long-term inflows of $16
billion.
In Lending, we had record balances of $110 billion, up 7% year on year, driven by both mortgage as well as traditional
loans.
Turning to page 13 and Corporate, Treasury and CIO reported net income of $138 million for the quarter. Included in
this result, there's a pre-tax benefit of $178 million relating to certain securities held at a discount that were called at
par, and this was in our NII. Other corporate net income of $84 million included a net benefit of $60 million after tax
for the legal related matters we discussed earlier as well as a contribution to our foundation this quarter of $150 million
pre-tax.
Turning to page 14, I've given you some guidance throughout the presentation, and this page is for your reference.
Obviously, when we get to Investor Day, we will give you a comprehensive outlook for each of our businesses for the
year.
So in summary, a solid quarter and a record for the full year both in terms of net income and EPS, which even on
higher capital translates to a good return on tangible common equity of 13.5%. We exceeded our targets on expense
management, generating positive operating leverage and improving our adjusted overhead ratio by two percentage
points; delivered strong core loan growth of 16%; materially changed the mix of our deposit base, including growing
retail deposits at 10%; and made meaningful progress on our balance sheet, our G-SIB surcharge, and capital levels.
With that, operator, we'll take Q&A.
Q&A
Operator
Your first question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Good morning, Marianne.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Good morning.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: So I'm curious about whether or not you all have seen the stress we've seen in
some of the credit and equity markets and some of the volatility impacting M&A velocity, appetite amongst boards and
C-suites broadly in your conversations and throughout the IB.
<A - Marianne Lake>: So again, I would say that the pipeline coming into 2016 in M&A was good, solid, up, in fact.
Obviously, volatility can dampen the confidence of boards and CEOs. Dialogues are pretty active, and we think the
types of deals that we'll see in 2016 will look different. But I think in the first couple of weeks it's not been particularly
strong, and we do need to see some of the stability come back, I think, for us to really see that conversion start to pick

up.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: And just by different, is that a reference to size, or can you be a bit more specific
on what you mean?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Less mega deals, more midsized deals, more cross-border. It's a little different. Actually, more
deal count, less big mega deals could be very constructive for revenue, but we're likely to see it be a little bit different
in 2016. But honestly, the pipeline is good, and yes.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Okay; that's helpful.
<A - Marianne Lake>: North America will be a tough comp. It was very strong in 2015, but Europe could be very
constructive.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Terrific; helpful. And then you referenced energy prices staying this low would
lead to a significant reserve build you expect in your energy book. Can you maybe give a little bit more color around
that? How would you define significant? And how long would oil need to stay down here in order to see some of that
reserve action?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah. So the way we do our reserves, just for context because I think it's important, is
obviously the oil price outlook is important and instructive, and it's very clearly going to drive how we think about
probabilities of default and loss given default reserves of our customers. But I think it's also the case just for context to
know that it is very name-by-name specific. Specific conditions at clients matter greatly. And so when we do these
estimates, they are directionally correct and order of magnitude correct, but that's just the context.
Oil, we said last quarter if oil reached $30 a barrel, and here we are, and stayed there for call it 18 months, you could
expect to see reserve builds of up to $750 million, and that assessment hasn't fundamentally changed. So it is not the
current market expectation that oil will flat-line. It is the expectation right now that there will be a modest recovery.
Based upon that, we would expect to take some additional reserves but for them to be more modest, less significant.
But that's kind of the range if oil's at $30 and stays here for a long time, up to $750 million.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Hi. I wanted to follow up on the oil and gas question. It just seems as though $124 million in
additional provisions for oil and gas could be low, at least based on the one year forward prices for oil, which are still
in the $30s. And so my question is for Jamie. As you look back, how does the oil and gas situation today compare to
prior periods of stress? We have 2002, we had the TMT [Technology, Media, Telecom] meltdown. And when you were
at Bank One you reduced the lines of credit, you got ahead of that early. In 2007, you weren't exactly at the start but
then you adjusted and you said hey, this is a big issue. And now we have oil and gas, which could be another
industry-specific stress, and you're only taking additional provisions of $124 million. Is that going to be enough? And
one year from now, are you going to look back and say, whoops, we didn't get ahead of this enough?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: I think – first I'd say we try to be very conservative always, and so we're not trying to put up as
little as possible. You know me; I'd put up more if I could, but accounting rules dictate what you can do. And these are
baskets of – the real risk is in reducing wells; cash flows are down. Surprisingly, the cost of getting the oil out of the
ground has also dropped dramatically and probably much more than most of us would have expected. So if you take
these producing wells, you take the cash flow, you discount it at 8% or 9%, you lend against it, and so these are our
forecasts. And our energy book isn't that large relative to J.P. Morgan Chase. We're not worried about the big oil
companies. These are mostly the smaller ones that you're talking about these reserve increases on.
<A - Marianne Lake>: I also think, Mike...

<A - Jamie Dimon>: And the forward curve is – at the end of the year for 2016 I think it's like $41 or $42 or
something like that.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes, it's $40-ish. But hey, Mike, the other thing to know about the profile of reserves, three
things. The first is it's not linear. So just the oil price decline and the decline in the forward curves that we saw into
December and to the end of the year, that's the impact it had on our reserves. It's fallen significantly in the first two
quarters. That was not a knowable condition, and we can't reserve for that at the end of the year. That's why we said we
would expect to take some more reserve increases in the next couple of quarters. But again, it's a name-specific thing,
and lots of other conditions at clients matter, including their hedging, their cash flows, the level of security, all those
things.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And how do you use CDS to help protect yourself on that portfolio?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: We don't.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay; you don't. And then the last follow-up -- do you intend to keep lending to the oil and gas
companies as they run into problems? On the one hand, you have the risk of throwing good money after bad. On the
other hand, if you stop lending as much and you have the high-yield market retreating and you have private equity
firms retreating, maybe it becomes a liquidity crisis for some of the oil companies. So which is it? Do you lend more or
less to the oil and gas sector?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: The oil folks have been surprisingly resilient. And remember, these are asset-backed loans, so a
bankruptcy doesn't necessarily mean your loan is bad. So I'm going to be a little bit careful.
And it's also, Mike, a philosophical thing. A bank is supposed to be there for clients in good times and bad times. So it's
not a trading market when you try to support clients. So to the extent we can responsibly support clients, we're going to.
And if we lose a little bit more money because of it, so be it. And we've done that around the world. We did in 2007
and 2008 and 2009. We try to do it responsibly. If banks just completely pull out of markets every time something gets
volatile and scary, you'll be sinking companies left and right.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Stewart (sic) [Sanford] (28:45) Bernstein.
<Q - John E. McDonald>: Hi, good morning. Marianne, I was wondering if you could remind us where you are on
your expense reduction targets in the Consumer and the Investment Bank. And how does that translate to some
thoughts about the expected trajectory of total firm-wide expenses for this year?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah. So let me just deal with where we are against our targets. So the most notable targets
were $2 billion in the Consumer businesses in 2017 versus 2014 and $2.8 billion in the CIB in 2017 versus 2014.
You probably heard my comment. But to clarify, on an apples-to-apples basis, we're halfway through on Consumer.
We've done $1 billion this year. You don't see that 100% translate into the results partly because of legal expense,
which is not something that we particularly can predict and hopefully won't see that forever, also because we
intentionally decisioned in 2015, in the fourth quarter in particular or mostly, to increase our investments in the
Consumer businesses by $150 million. So we've achieved $1 billion. We chose to reinvest a portion of it. Another $1
billion we're on track for. We will potentially reinvest some of that too and broaden, and we will talk to you about the
basis for that at Investor Day.
On the $2.8 billion in the CIB, we're at $1.3 billion through at the end of the year, and we talked before about the fact
that the first $1.3 billion is largely on business simplification. We had the revenue decline. We need to have expense
decline, and we've worked hard to deliver that and we have. The next chunk has to do with technology and operations
and infrastructure and organization, and it's harder, and so we'll continue. We're still on track to deliver it, but it's going
to be a job through 2016 and into 2017.

<Q - John E. McDonald>: And how does that all net into an outlook for this year, if you're willing give us some
thoughts on that?
<A - Marianne Lake>: I can give you some thoughts that won't totally satisfy you, which is our core expenses will
continue to trend down on the back of delivering against them. But we will make investment decisions that we think are
good for the company, accretive for shareholders, that we'll re-spend some of that money. And so we'll give you that

Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.
<Q - Kenneth Michael Usdin>: Thanks, good morning. I was wondering if you could talk to us a little bit about the
benefits from rates as they come through. Obviously, your commentary that NII will be even flattish in the first quarter
adjusted for day count and even with some securities gains in the numbers this quarter presumes a nice helper from that
first move. You guys were really conservative on your deposit beta thoughts when you had talked about them
previously. I know probably you haven't seen much change yet. But how are you expecting the deposit payer to act?
And has there been any change to your modeling expectations about what might come through as we get through the
first couple of hikes?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So just on NII, yes, we are seeing embedded in that NII flat to up slightly, we are seeing a nice
lift associated with the rate hike in December across businesses as well as the continued benefit of the mix towards
loans in our balance sheet. But we were flattered in our NII this quarter by $178 million on securities gains in CIO, so
that's going to mean that the comparison is challenging. And then day count is obviously seasonal, so that's been the
dynamic. We are seeing the rate benefit. We do expect to see it, as I said in my remarks, for the full year.
Look, we think we are appropriately conservative on a deposit basis. It is not – it is way too early to have any idea
because virtually nothing has moved yet. And so our job and what we are doing is paying very close attention to the
competitive landscape. These deposits that we're talking about that have the high betas are valuable deposits with
valuable clients for us. And we want to be competitive and pay fair rates, but it's so early in the movie that we haven't
changed much in our modeling assumptions.
<Q - Kenneth Michael Usdin>: Okay. And my second question, if I can ask an ex-energy credit question, a lot of
concerns that we're going to get into some type of broader deterioration, which your numbers showed no signs of
heading towards. What are you looking for? Are you seeing any signals of ex-energy changes in either delinquencies or
watched trends? And are you still comfortable with that low $4 billions type of charge-off expectation that you guys
had talked about previously? Thanks.
<A - Marianne Lake>: So energy, metals, and mining, we're watching very closely industries that could have
knock-on effects like industrials and transportation, but we're not seeing anything broadly in our portfolio right now.
We're just watching very closely, which is why – obviously, you can take our reserve build number and you can say it's
almost essentially all made up of oil and gas and metals and mining. And behind the scenes, we've had upgrades and
downgrades of a number of other different companies across sectors, but nothing particularly thematic yet, but we're
watching.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: I would just point out that credit card, Commercial Bank, middle-market, large corporate credit is
as good as it's ever been. So obviously it's going to get a little bit worse. I wouldn't call it a cycle per se. if you have a
recession, we'll see a normal cyclical increase in all those losses. We're not forecasting a recession. We think that the
U.S. economy looks pretty good at this point.

Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI.
<Q - Glenn Paul Schorr>: Thank you. I think you talked about some of this, Marianne, in terms of the Method 2
G-SIB surcharge, now estimated at 3.5%. I'm just curious. I think if the numbers are right, you took down notionals,
and that there's about $3.4 trillion, $21 billion in Level 3 assets, $50 billion in non-op deposits. You said that you don't
want to be an outlier, so you're whittling that down. I'm curious of the driving force behind it, what kind of revenue
give-up there is in such a move like this because we like it and thoughts on the go-forward.
<A - Marianne Lake>: So look, we talked about achieving 4% last quarter I think. And per disclosure, we were quite
close to 3.5%. At that point, it becomes increasingly compelling to want to look at the margin for what you could do to
get within the bucket. And so that is what we did in the fourth quarter is spend time really focusing on getting to that
achievable boundary, which we thought at that point it was. And remember, it's not nothing in the year that we started
the year thinking we would exit $100 billion of non-operating deposits. And while there still could be some volatility in
that number, of course, we've almost doubled that or doubled that in fact. So we've got some wind to our backs in doing
it.
It's also the case that when you get the entire business and company attuned to the sense of urgency and desire to want
to be increasingly efficient in this way that at the margin there are 100 different things, little benefits accrue. So we're at
about 3.5%. We're just inside the 3.5% bucket as best we estimate it. It's not as much important whether we're basis
points or surcharge points below or above. It's much more what we do now to get safely in the bucket, and that's going
to still take work. So that's why we'll obviously talk to you more about this at Investor Day.
In terms of the give-up from an economic perspective, we wouldn't have done it at any cost. We have done it because
we think it is important to do because we think it's going to be constructive for the company and because the revenue
give-ups were not significant, but they weren't zero either. But to be able to reduce a constraint that is in one way or
another likely to bind us – or in multiple ways, in fact, likely to bind us, it was I think a very good trade.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: And it was done effectively client by client.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: To make sure we were trying to do the right things for our clients, not just jamming our balance
sheet down and hurting people.
<Q - Glenn Paul Schorr>: Fair enough. I just had one quick follow-up on Ken's last question. If two-thirds of the
economy is consumer-led, you look at all your early-stage delinquencies, like Ken said. And, Jamie, to your comments,
things look okay. I hate putting words in your mouth. But what do you think the disconnect then is between what's
going on in the markets versus what's going on in the trends in your business, both in terms of growth and
forward-looking credit looks?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: The U.S. economy has been chugging along at 2% to 2.5% growth for the better part of five
years now. In the last two years, it has created 5 million jobs. And when you look at the actual household formation, car
sales, wage, people working, it still looks okay. Corporate credit is quite good. Small business formation is not back to
where it was, but it's quite good. Household formation is going up. So obviously, market turmoil, we all look at it every
day, but I'm not sure most of the 143 million Americans look at it that much who have jobs.
You have a big change in the world out there. People are getting adjusted to China slowing down. When you have
commodity prices go down like that, there are big winners and losers. The oil companies are losers, consumers would
benefit. Brazil gets hurt, India benefits, South Korea benefits, Japan benefits. And those can cause turbulent waters.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous.
<Q - Brian D. Foran>: Hi. The disclosure on the oil and gas is really helpful, and I was wondering if you could just
walk through something similar on metals and mining. So you gave us the – I think you said $68 million of full-year
reserve build, and you gave us the not significant if things stay where they are. Can you give us the balance? And then
is there a comparable $500 million to $750 million stress test for oil and gas or stress case? Is there a comparable on
what is the stress case if broader commodities and metals and mining comes in worse?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Okay, so our total reserve on balance sheet for metals and mining, notwithstanding we built
$60-odd million this year is over $200 million, so the coverage ratio is pretty good. The exposure is about – I haven't
got the precise numbers in front of me, but probably about a third the size of our exposure to oil and gas, so about 2%
of our overall wholesale credit exposure. So considerably more modest, which is why if energy prices, general
commodities weakness, and stress stays where it is right now, even for an extended period, we would think that the
incremental results would be considerably more modest.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: And it's also that one is mostly name-by-name.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes, for sure.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: It's not big asset-based reserves. It's just they're big corporate credits name by name.
<A - Marianne Lake>: And for both oil and gas and metals and mining in our portfolio, our oil and gas is close to
60% investment-grade and metals and mining about half.
<Q - Brian D. Foran>: And then I guess staying with credit on home equities and the whole issue of free cash from
interest home rate amortizing, can you lay out how it's progressed relative to your expectations so far? And also,
remind us how big the allocation of the reserve is against that. And I guess not to lead the witness, but is that an area
where things are trending early days better than expected and could provide some buffer against maybe anything else
that happens on the C&I side?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So with respect to home equity recasts, remember the majority of the problematic home equity
underwriting was 2005 through 2008. So here we are at the beginning of 2016 with the pig still in the python. But we're
monitoring it closely and we have some recasts that have happened. Obviously, interest rates are low. Home price
appreciation, on the other hand, is up end, so there puts and takes. We've been monitoring it I would say at the margin
or more than at the margin. At early stage, it's coming in better than we had modeled. And remember, from an incurred
loss perspective, we would consider these recast risks to be largely incurred, so we've tried to reserve them to the best
of our ability. So we feel good about our reserves. I don't think we've disclosed them. But so far from a performance
perspective, I would say slightly better than our models, but we continue to monitor it because it's still relatively early.

years. The proposal is better than what had been – the ruling is better than what the proposal most recently had been. I
just wanted to get a sense from you as to how you can manage to this 2019 implementation timeframe. Are there things
set in motion already, or is this something that you would start from here? And if you could just give us some broad
strokes on how you think about overall impact, that would be helpful.
<A - Marianne Lake>: So obviously, you'll forgive me because we've been on the call since it came out. But yes, we
have been working on this for years. The problem with this particular rule is that, as you stated, based upon the four
QISs that were done, there were some I would characterize significant challenges with respect to the rules as written.
And we were expecting there to be a number of meaningful changes, and there have been, in many cases, meaningful
improvements. But it's very technical, and there have been a lot of changes. So we need to go through it to figure out
net-net everything, although it is clear that net-net, despite the fact that the stated intention of the committee wasn't
necessarily to increase market risk capital across the industry, it will be higher, but by how much it's really going to
need to be sifted through.
And for the same reason – for both those same reasons, I'm sorry, for the reason that the rule has not been stable and
there have been significant questions, many of which have been either addressed or partially addressed and many I
guess that have not, it would have been premature to have taken any actions in advance of figuring out where this has
landed. And as you know, the period to comply is three years, so it's more of a start from here to figure out how to
manage with this after we sifted through the details. So I wish I were able to give you a little bit more of a detailed
answer, but we're going to need to take the time to go through it.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Right; I totally understand that. And I guess my basic question is you can take action
as opposed to just deal with what the current decision would be for you. There are actions that you can take to reduce
the impact.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Well, there are always actions that we can take to reduce the impact. And so we have to think
about them in the context of our overall capital optimization program. And again, if some of the things that we hoped –
and honestly, I've been on call since it came out. So if some of the things that we hoped were going to be addressed
have not, they could have had or may have meaningful impact on specific types of activity, and we will have to react
accordingly. And yes, we will take actions if that's the right answer. I wish I could give you more details, but we just
need to go through it.

Our next question comes from the line of Steve Chubak with Nomura.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Good morning.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: So I had a couple questions on capital. The first relates to the RWA progress, which did
surprise positively in the year by about $50 billion ahead of expectations. And I was just hoping you could give a better
sense, Marianne, just given some of your prepared remarks, as to how much of that incremental $50 billion reduction
was a function of more proactive mitigation efforts maybe even tied to the G-SIB mitigation efforts that you guys had
talked about, which should presumably remain in the run rate versus balance sheet shrinkage that may be due to the risk
loss environment that we're experiencing today.
<A - Marianne Lake>: I would say that based upon our fourth quarter balance sheet, given that market risk was a
driver, given that balance sheet levels was a driver, particularly on standardized, we could give back on standardized as
much as 10 to 20 bps of capital of the 10.7% capital accretion.
But the bigger point on the RWA outlook is that we expect to be bound over the medium term by standardized, and
standardized is going to always have a neutral to upward pressure as we continue to grow these high-quality loans. So
even though the RWA being at the $1.5-ish trillion sooner than we expected is obviously good news, regardless of how

much that may in the short term revert, our job is going to be to continue to become more efficient to try and keep it
there just given the natural upward pressure of the standardized calculations. We can become more efficient in advance,
but we're unlikely to be bound by it in the medium term. So that's what we're focused on. So I wouldn't take the $1.5
trillion and read through that we'll be continuing to decline from here on standardized. We'll be continuing to work hard
to make sure that we can grow those loans that we love but that have [indiscernible] (47:05) risk rates under a
standardized basis.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Okay, understood, Marianne, that's very helpful. And then maybe just switching gears to the
G-SIB surcharge, clearly the progress surprised positively by getting down to 3.5%. I was just wondering how you
guys are thinking about establishing minimum capital targets. I recognize you'll likely lay that out at Investor Day. But
just want to get a better sense as to what methodology you're employing in terms of thinking about a management
buffer and all the different binding constraints that you have to manage to day to day in thinking about the
through-the-cycle target that you guys would like to manage to.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Okay, if I miss something, at the end remind me. So in terms of how we think about buffers
just really conceptually, the firm manages and the board has set for the firm a risk appetite. That risk appetite has a
number of features, and capital depletion in a stress environment is one of them. And so when we think about setting
buffers, we think about it just broadly in the context of allowing ourselves enough room to absorb losses that are within
our risk appetite and not have to take premature actions from a capital perspective. But having said that, our buffer has
been pretty consistent at the 50 basis point level for a reasonable period of time, and we'll update you on all of that at
Investor Day.
With respect to our targets, it's a little bit more complicated than minimum regulated capital because, as you say, we're
bound potentially by multiple constraints. And one of them may be CCAR plus – well, it is CCAR, I should say,
because, as you know, the first two quarters of this year our capital distribution plans have already been approved. We
haven't done CCAR, so this is not any kind of prediction, but it shouldn't surprise you to know that it's unlikely that we
will pay out 100% of our earnings in CCAR going forward. So we are on a path to continue to accrete capital, though
we would like to move up in our payout range. So given that we're still moving toward our 12% target, and we will
update you if any of that changes at Investor Day.
We're also, as you know, potentially going to understand whether or not the Fed changes any of the CCAR parameters
and whether that has an impact. So at the moment, the best we know is that we're going to continue to accrete capital,
albeit more slowly, as we hope to move up in the payout range, but we haven't done CCAR yet. And that's if the rules
don't change, so 12% it is for now.

Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Thanks. Marianne, if I can just clarify your NII comment from the very beginning of the
call, do I understand correctly that the $2 billion of incremental NII that you've cited is just a function of the repricing
dynamics as they move through your balance sheet, or is there also I guess a contribution from loan growth?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Both, so think about in a rate [ph] set (50:20) scenario, and you can pick whether you believe
the market, whether you think the market is – or whether you believe the FOMC dots, and I think it's going to be data
dependent, so we're not going to have a stated opinion on that. But because of the mix in our balance sheet in 2015 as
well as our expectation of continued loan growth, we would expect mix to contribute about half of that and the first 25
basis points about the next half because we are more sensitive to the front end of rates in the first 25 basis points, and
you can see that in our earnings-at-risk disclosures. So even if we see nothing else, obviously we believe and the
market believes that you're going to see a couple more hikes that would be on average another 25 basis points, and that
would be incremental NII again.

<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Great, thank you. And so I know we just touched on RWAs, but how do you suggest we
think about GAAP assets for this year?
<A - Marianne Lake>: I would say I would think about them in a somewhat similar directional way given that our
balance sheet ended below $2.4 trillion, a little bit of it market delivered, a lot of it purposeful. But we do intend to
continue to gather deposits and extend loans and portfolio loans as well. So while you will see some securities balance
declines and the like, I would say again net modest growth, up modest, and very lending-driven.

Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Hey, good morning. I just wanted to add a follow-up question on fixed income trading. I
think Dan Pinto has talked about benefits from higher rates. And so I guess number one, I wanted to see if you had any
thoughts on that. Have you seen any initial benefits to spreads in the FICC trading market with the first rate hike? And
in contrast, you had a couple of competitors announce or at least reported that they're cutting head count. That seems to
be a little bit in contrast to the expectation that fixed income could pick up with higher rates. So I think, if you could,
talk through your thoughts on fixed income. I do notice that you did mention 1Q is off and performing well, so maybe
that's part of it too. But if you can help on that, that would be great.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Okay. So in terms of the impact of rates, obviously there was a lot of monetary policy
confusion broadly in the fourth quarter. The ECB underwhelmed the Feds with [indiscernible] (52:39), so there was a
lot of confusion. But by the time the rate hike happened, it was obviously pretty well understood. We did see strong
activity or strong client activity relatively speaking on the back of that in the rates business, more so than necessarily
about spreads.
With respect to the fixed income business, we've always been very disciplined about how we think about starting levels
and expenses in that business. We've managed it very carefully. The compensation has come down across the trading
businesses. And it wouldn't surprise you that some of that – a lot of that has been in fixed income. And our business is
at scale and productive.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: All right. So you still feel pretty comfortable with your outlook that things could improve in
market share gain potential as competitors pull back?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: You've seen in fixed income – look, we have a very good fixed income operation globally around
the world. Rates themselves don't filter through FICC trading directly. I think what Daniel was talking about is if you
have healthy economies and confident investors, you have more volume and things like that. We do see a little bit of
repricing taking place in prime broker, repo, conduit, and some of those things run through FICC. So that is going to
take place as the world adjusts to all the new capital requirements. And obviously, there's a lot of seasonality in the
business, which we've experienced for the last decade.

<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Hi. If we look at credit spreads in the bond market, even ex-energy, they've
widened considerably. And I'm wondering if this has resulted in wholesale credit being repriced at all. I realize the
bond market doesn't set bank loan pricing, but just wondering if you've been able to reprice some of the wholesale
customers or expect being able to do so.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: We've seen no real repricing in loans on the balance sheet. We have seen a little bit of people
getting other revenues to make up for their credit exposure.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Think about the bank loans as being relationship loans that need to be thought in the context of
the relationship that everybody is...
<A - Jamie Dimon>: They barely repriced in 2008 and 2009. Banks were continuing to lend at the existing price, but
that was – these are long-term relationships. The bank's loan margins did not reprice like the markets do.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: I guess I wonder why, like we saw pricing in the debt markets come in
considerably over the last several years. C&I pricing came in. I realize it might take some time, but I would think
there's the opportunity for at least some repricing around the edges, no?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: We haven't seen it.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Also, it's very, very competitive. Everybody has been chasing these loans, and so that's a factor
too. So we haven't seen it yet.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: And then remember, middle-market lending, if I remember correctly, if you look at it by client,
60% of the revenues are not loan related. So clients, they also know what their relationship is with the bank. And while
we need to make a good return on capital, capital applied to the client is only partially loan related. And that capital on
its own doesn't earn an adequate return. Simple lending on its own is generally not an adequate return business.

pricing in prime brokerage and repo because of the capital requirements requiring you guys to raise prices, can you
expand upon that? Do you see it growing where you could get even better pricing going forward because of less
competition? Can you give just more color there?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: I think a better way to look at it is that people see – in certain of our businesses, and I mentioned
those and there are some other ones, capital has been deployed, people have adjusted to the new rules, and you've seen
pricing go up. Whether it goes up a lot, I wouldn't count on it going up a lot more from there. The markets are going to
be competitive at that point. But use of the balance sheet, the costs have gone up, not loans, but most of the other stuff.
<A - Marianne Lake>: And remember, we think about our prime brokerage business going hand in glove with
equities.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: That's correct, Marianne.
<A - Marianne Lake>: And so while the repricing is helpful and at the margin everybody is going to continue to
always observe their pricing, we've built out our platform internationally. Europe we are seeing strong demand for us.
In fact, in Asia we're adding clients. We've got the wind to our backs. So it's an important business for our clients.
You're right, there are a lot of people potentially not going to be as aggressive, and if we can take share we certainly
will.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Great. And then the follow-up question is obviously the FASB is coming out this quarter with
a new loan loss reserve methodology, the current expected credit loss versus what we're using today, obviously, the
incurred loss model, and there's going to be a true-up for everybody. Have you guys given any thought that when this

goes into place when you may take that true-up, assuming that you have to implement it by 2019 or something like
that? Would you do it much before that, or can you give us some thoughts on your thinking about what's going to
happen?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Obviously, we expect any transition adjustment to go through equity. If we are able to adopt it
early, we might do that. I'm not aware that we are. So we'll have to follow up with you about that.

Your last question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Hey, guys, thank you very much. We know they implemented a new disclosure form in the
mortgage banking space, TRID [TILA RESPA Integrated Disclosure]. Did that have any – you guys had very good
mortgage banking results. Did that have any impact whatsoever on your operations in the Mortgage Bank?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes. Obviously, I think if you add up TRID plus other servicing rules, print them out, put them
on the floor and stand them next to me, they're a foot taller, so they are very complicated. There's a lot of operational
complexity to complying, and we're working very hard at doing that.
I will say in the quarter we did as part of being cautious about making sure that we're complying, our cycle times were
a couple of days, a few days worsened. And so volumes, our origination volumes are a little lower than we would have
otherwise seen, not a lot, and that's just timing and it's just days, but not really from a financial results perspective
because of the way we recognize revenue. So I would call it a little bit of teething problems across the industry, by the
way, not just us, nothing significant. We are going to get the work finished. And so it's tough, but it is what it is.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: And then a follow-up question on your portfolio. You look like you grew your residential loans
by about $11 billion. Last quarter you said it was a mix between agency and jumbo. If a big chunk of it's agency, can
you give us your thoughts on portfolio, that agency product?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes, so it's about 60% jumbo, 40% agency or conventional conforming, and it's a best
execution decision. So when we look at the better economics between selling or portfolio-ing the mortgage, we'll
generally choose the better economics. But we also prefer the annuity nature of the NII, the lower servicing risk, and
the better capital efficiency. So it has been the case over the course of the last several quarters that it has been the best
execution to portfolio these mortgages, and actually they are generating a nice return on equity.

You do have a follow-up question from John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - John E. McDonald>: Hi, one quick follow-up, Marianne. You've had some pretty big tax gains the last couple
quarters, running below 30% on your tax rate. At some point, do you pull forward future benefits and run with a higher
tax rate in the future?
<A - Marianne Lake>: We have had pretty big tax gains over the course of the last – most notably over the last
quarter, over the course of the last couple of years. Most of those related to the call it 2003 through 2008 tax periods
when we were going through the financial crisis. And so some of the matters were more complex, and we took
appropriate reserving decisions on that.
There are many less of those very complicated matters ahead of us, and so we wouldn't expect to see the same size of
tax benefit going forward as we've seen in the past, but we had some this quarter. We'll have a few. And generally
speaking, they are – because of the nature of the reserving for tax, generally speaking we take a conservative approach.
And they're biased to the positive, but it could be much more much more plus or minus zero at this point.
<Q - John E. McDonald>: So what's your natural tax rate if you don't have those? Is it around 30%, or is it closer to...

You have another follow-up question from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Hi, Brian.
<Q - Brian D. Foran>: I was wondering if I just could sneak in on credit cards. Do you think the competitive
environment has hit a plateau? And on co-brands, are there any kind of large upcoming repricing events? And is there
any bigger than a breadbox sizing you can give on Marriott?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So do I think it's plateaued? I think it remains incredibly competitive, particularly in cards
generally and particularly in the co-brand space, so plateaued at a very competitive level, I suppose. But in terms of –
I'm not going to talk about any specific names actually, Brian, in terms of the potential for repricing. It's an important
part of our business, and we're going to defend our business.
<Q - Brian D. Foran>: Thank you very much.

Your next question is a follow-up question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Hi, Gerard.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Thank you. Hi, Marianne. If the regulators lift the dividend payout ratio in this year's CCAR
to 40%, would you guys consider lifting your dividend payout ratio to something closer to that?
<A - Marianne Lake>: It's a board decision, and so neither have we received that guidance from the regulators nor
have we done CCAR and had that discussion yet with the board. But we have generally said that the board likes to have
the flexibility to increase dividends over time, and we have had our dividends most recently at or close to that soft cap.
So we would love that capacity, and I would imagine that over time it may be used, but again, it is a board decision, not
a management decision.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Thank you, and then just one last follow-up. On the G-SIB buffer, obviously you guys have
done an incredible job in bringing it down to where it is today. When do you expect the regulators to put you into that
bucket, assuming you guys are obviously looking at the same types of numbers?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So we do everything pro forma. So first of all, I would say the following. Right now my
understanding – and if I'm wrong, forgive me – is that it's your spot balance sheet two years prior that would drive your
G-SIB two years forward. But the reality, if you ask my opinion, given that we're going to be reporting quarterly going
forward and because of the likelihood that G-SIB may or may not feature into CCAR, I think it's going to be less
important necessarily what you are at any moment in time but where you are projecting to be or stay. So I suspect that
we will get the benefit potentially of this, not today. We have it in our – we just closed our balance sheet. But I think
that it's going to need to be a little bit more dynamic going forward as it gets potentially introduced into stress tests.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Great, thank you.
<A - Marianne Lake>: But I don't know that.
