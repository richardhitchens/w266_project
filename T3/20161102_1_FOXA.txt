Lachlan Keith Murdoch
Thank you, Reed, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to have delivered a strong quarter from both top and
bottom line earnings. The progress we've made against our earnings objectives is broad-based, representing
improvements across business segments and geographies. It reflects operational momentum across our businesses
driven by our focus on creative excellence and by our efforts to enhance the consumer experience whilst better
monetizing our content.
A number of key factors contributed to a 17% year-on-year EBITDA growth from a 7% increase in revenue. Our
Filmed segment more than doubled its quarterly earnings contribution thanks to key film releases as well as the sale of
some television SVOD rights. Summer releases Independence Day: Resurgence and X-Men: Apocalypse were key
contributors. Our recently released Tim Burton film, Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children, had a strong
opening, which will primarily benefit the current December quarter.
Under the leadership of Stacey Snider, the film studio has bolstered its team by attracting key senior executive talent
spanning marketing, international distribution, business affairs and licensing, and together, they are well-focused on
charting the studio's future course. In the short term, there's a lot to do. Our forward slate is strong with Why Him?,
Assassin's Creed, Jackie, Hidden Figures and Logan, all released in the balance of this fiscal year. It's a diverse and
high-quality slate that we have solid expectations of.
Our Cable Network's earnings improvement was driven by 10% revenue growth on solid gains in both affiliate and
advertising revenues, both domestically and internationally. Of course, Fox News has never been stronger amidst an
intense election season. It just marked its 59th consecutive quarter as the number one in cable news and just finished
October as the number-one network in both prime time and all day across all of cable. Last month also marked the first
time a Fox News anchor moderated a general election presidential debate. We have to give a shout-out to Chris
Wallace's superb debate performance, which notably received kudos on both sides of the aisle.
Overall in the cable world and of particular note, we added overall domestic pay TV subscribers this past quarter. We're
particularly excited by all the new DMVP services that are emerging in the marketplace. Hulu is executing against its
development plan and is on track to launch its new DMVPD service early next year, as we have discussed previously.
Our major brands are included in every DMVPD service that has emerged, with affiliate fees that are absolutely on par
with the per sub affiliate fees we get from traditional pay TV distributors.
Importantly, the strategic focus we put on our brands, across our leadership in entertainment, news and sports, positions
us well for the transition to IP delivery. We have a product focus that is as intense as it is unique, and we're seeing the
benefits of all our efforts and investments in that area. Fundamentally, breakout content is what drives up the value of
our brands. This is at the center of our growth strategy.
A review of the business highlights underscores our momentum in this regard, and I'll turn it over now to John and
James to provide more details.
John P. Nallen
Thank you, Lachlan, and good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased with the strong financial results we reported
for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, highlighted by double-digit gains in both EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share.
First quarter revenues increased 7% to $6.5 billion, led by double-digit revenue growth at the Cable Network segment
and solid increases at the Filmed segment. Total segment EBITDA was $1.79 billion, a 17% increase from the prior
year, reflecting strong growth from the Filmed and Cable segments. This quarter's results include an approximate $40
million negative impact from foreign currency rates and absent this impact, our overall EBITDA growth rate would be
nearly 20%.

From a bottom-line perspective, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $827
million or $0.44 per share. Excluding the net income effects in both years of other net and of equity earnings
adjustments from Sky and the Endemol Shine group, adjusted EPS was $0.51 this quarter, which is a 34% increase over
the comparable $0.38 reported a year ago. Now while our tax rate in the quarter was below 30%, we expect the
effective tax rate for the full year to be closer to the low- to mid-30% range.
With that, I'll provide some added comments on the performance at our operating segments, starting with the Cable
Networks where total segment EBITDA of $1.38 billion was up 6% on 10% revenue growth. Overall, Cable segment
expenses increased 12%, but excluding the impact of the consolidation of NatGeo Partners, they were up 8%. Domestic
Cable Network revenues increased 10% with affiliate fee growth of 8% and 6% advertising increases. The affiliate fee
increase primarily reflects higher average rates across all of our domestic brands as well as subscriber additions at some
of our still-expanding networks.
First quarter advertising revenue growth was driven by the ratings strength at Fox News and also reflects a
2-percentage-point benefit from the consolidation of the NatGeo businesses we acquired last November. EBITDA at
our domestic channels increased 9% over the prior year, reflecting the revenue growth, partially offset by higher
baseball costs at the RSNs, higher entertainment programming costs at the FX channels, and the inclusion of the
expenses related to the acquired National Geographic businesses.
First quarter reported international Cable revenues grew 9%, driven by an 8%% increase in reported affiliate revenues,
which were up 16% on a local currency basis. Reported advertising revenues increased 6% over the prior year on local
currency growth of 11% led by STAR in India. International channel EBITDA contributions on a reported basis
decreased 7%, but excluding the effects of foreign exchange primarily from Latin America, would have increased by
6%. As expected, international channel expenses increased, largely reflecting, higher sports costs from our broadcast of
the Summer Olympics in both India and Latin America during the quarter.
At our Television segment, EBITDA was $191 million versus the $196 million reported in the prior year. This slight
year-over-year decline is primarily due to lower advertising revenues largely from the absence of the prior-year
broadcast of both the Emmys and the FIFA Women's World Cup final as well as a market shift of advertising dollars
towards the Summer Olympics. The advertising revenue declines were largely offset by continued retransmission
consent revenue growth and higher content revenues led by Hulu.
At the Filmed segment, EBITDA of $311 million was more than double the amount we reported in the prior year. The
current quarter results were driven by the S5 licensing of Homeland, lower theatrical releasing costs as well as higher
profits from this year's summer film releases, including Independence Day: Resurgence as compared to last year's slate,
which included the release of Fantastic Four.
Shifting over to capital management, during the quarter we repurchased approximately $410 million in Fox A shares
reducing total shares outstanding compared to a year ago by 10%. We now have approximately $3.2 billion remaining
on our overall repurchase authorizations.
And with that, let me turn it over to James.
James Rupert Murdoch
Thanks very much, John. Good afternoon, everyone. So as you've heard, the fiscal year has started well. So I'd just like
to spend a minute on some highlights and then some things to focus on going forward. First I want to reiterate that our
strategy to focus on big brands that matter for customers and investment on screen that clearly differentiates and earns
attention and a program of work to make our programming and products more available not less, is paying dividends.
Furthermore, the changes we've made to the organization are delivering a leaner and more capable company and the
team continues to move at a very fast pace.
Creatively, the business is in good health. FX set a new industry record for basic cable wins at the Emmys this year and
our original series American Horror Story: Roanoke launched as the highest rated cable TV series and our new series,

Atlanta, ranks number two in comedies behind only South Park. National Geographic's new programming strategy is
just now kicking in with the November 14 premiere of its first global event series, MARS, which begins its new
premium programming push.
And on the broadcast television side, we've got real traction at the start of the new season with a number of new series,
including Lethal Weapon, Pitch, The Exorcist and Son of Zorn. Currently network entertainment advertising is pacing
ahead of last year after a summer that saw a lot of demand absorbed by the Olympics broadcast on NBC. As a
television studio, we are excited that we have three of the top four scripted series on broadcast television today with
Empire, This Is Us and Modern Family.
FOX Sports 1 recently marked its third anniversary in its highest viewership ever. In fact, the last two weeks marked its
most watched and highest rated weeks in the network's history, beating ESPN around the clock for the first time ever.
In addition to the strength in live events, FS1's focus on building its pre- and post-game programming is paying
dividends and the studio shows from Skip and Shannon to The Herd, Garbage Time in FOX Sports Live are surging
and hitting ratings highs. As for broadcast sports, the World Series has delivered the largest live baseball audience in
over a decade, generating a huge amount of interest from advertisers and pricing accordingly.
We are also pleased with how well Fox is doing with its NFL programming. While there's a lot of noise about declining
NFL ratings, Fox's game day viewership on Sunday is holding up well and is within four percentage points of last year.
Meanwhile our NFL Game of the Week continues to be television's highest rated and most-watched show in any day
part, averaging over 25 million viewers. And from an advertising perspective, we continue a strong pace over where we
were last year at this time with year-to-year NFL ad pricing increases in the high single digits. Our regional sports
networks continue to excel. We had a great baseball season with five of our RSNs ranking number one in their markets
amongst all broadcast and cable on game nights.
STAR India's advertising revenues returned to double digit year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis, and we
continue to see exceptional growth of our mobile video platform, hotstar. Between June and October, average watch
time doubled on the platform, and minutes viewed is currently more than double all the mainstream competitors
combined and more than 10x the watch time of Netflix which launched in India earlier this year.
Our Fox and National Geographic brands are also showing strong growth in almost every region. On a global ex U.S.
basis, revenue growth was in the teens on a constant currency basis. The Sky business, our largest affiliate, is also
making great strides as the strength and breadth of the platform continues to drive accelerated growth both in
subscribers but also in the tremendous content business that comprises so much of the company's portfolio.
In closing, it's an exciting time for us. As we look across the business, we feel good about where we are. We'll turn it
over to questions now, and we're happy to be as helpful as we can be. Reed?
H. Reed Nolte
Thank you, James. And now, operator, we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Michael Nathanson with
MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael B. Nathanson>: Thanks. I have one for the three of you and then one quickly and John following up.
For the three, Lachlan, you definitely called out that there was acceleration in subs this quarter which is a break from
the trend we've seen. Can you spend some more time talking about which networks drove the beat? Was there also an
improvement in mature networks? And how sustainable is this trend?

<A - Lachlan Keith Murdoch>: Great. Thanks, Michael. So, I think there's two important points to call out here. And
that is, as I mentioned we had a net growth in subs, a lot of this is actually – with FXM and FS2 sort of spinning down
into broader bundles, right? So adding subscribers by being part of their broader bundles, and I should add also this
happened with our FOX Business channel as well. In addition to that, obviously the emerging growth of some of the
over-the-top platforms and our distribution on all of the new DMVPDs helped us grow subs in the quarter.
<Q - Michael B. Nathanson>: Okay. Let me ask John, you made a point in the last call saying you expect the affiliate
fee growth to be backend weighted in this fiscal year, but already this quarter you accelerated from where you were just
with the quarter before. So can you update us on, is there more to come? Or was this more front loaded than you
thought this year?
<A - John P. Nallen>: I think still the back end weighted point stands just because of renewals that we have coming in
the back half of the year. And, look, it was nice to get subscriber additions during the quarter, some expected, some less
expected given the comments Lachlan just made about the emerging DMVPDs, and it's great to see the traction that
they're getting there.
<Q - Michael B. Nathanson>: Thanks.
<A - H. Reed Nolte>: Thank you, Michael. Operator, the next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Mitchelson with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Doug Mitchelson>: Thanks so much. I think for James and Lachlan, I'd just love if you could talk about your
latest view on the need for scale in media and your appetite for M&A given the backdrop of the AT&T, Time Warner
merger announcement. And then for John, this might be relatively minor, but just as we think about the December
quarter, the World Series going seven games, if you could give us any sense of how that might impact numbers, I'd
appreciate it.
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: It's James. Hi, Doug. Thanks. So in terms of scale – look, I think as we've often said,
this is an industry and a business that thrives on scale, but at the same time, scale for scale's sake is not something that
we think should be pursued. We really like the business mix that we have. We've really simplified the operating model
over the last number of years and invested in these big scale brands that really operate at the top of their games I think
all over the world. And we feel pretty good about that, and our focus remains execution and operating the business as
best we can and growing it as fast as we can.
So there's no heightened appetite for any inorganic activities apropos the recent activity, and I would say, as I said I
think the last quarter, we really try to be very, very disciplined about this. We have a very high hurdle in terms of how
we think about investment and how we think about doing things. We've clearly passed on a lot of opportunities that we
thought were – the price was just not going to deliver the value for shareholders that we think we want to deliver.
So I don't think there's really any change there with respect to our own posture. I would say though that our business is
growing really well and this investment in these brands, this investment in the content of programming, this investment
in the capabilities around the business from a user experience perspective and a monetization perspective, are really
getting traction, so we feel good about the business mix and the assets that we're operating and are involved in.
<A - Lachlan Keith Murdoch>: And just to your question, Doug, on World Series, look, we've all been around this
enough to have been through four-game sweeps and the disappointment you get there, but to get seven-game World
Series with the, I think the nation really focused on tonight's game is, it's a good benefit for us, so while I'm not getting
into numbers, it's a positive certainly.
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: We just need lots of pitching changes and that the ads are – get all the ads in.

Operator
Thank you. We'll go to the line of Rich Greenfield representing BTI. Please go ahead.
<Q - Rich Greenfield>: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. First off, just AT&T I think, Randall, when he was on
stage at the Wall Street Journal conference, him and Jeff announced that Fox was part of the DirecTV Now bundle. A,
is that accurate or did they jump the gun, and is a $35 tier without RSNs something you're okay with or is that a
non-starter, given that I think you have entry-level bundling on Sling or one of the Sling packages, and I think Hulu, the
RSNs are in the entry-level package. So just wondering how you think about that, and then I have a strategic follow-up.
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: So, Rich, thanks. It's, look, I think all I'll say is, we certainly anticipate to be part of –
for our major brands to be part of all of these emerging DMVPDs or all the major ones anyway, and beyond that I
really don't want to go into any particular commercial relationship until they're, sort of, it's more out there. But we
certainly anticipate the inclusion of these brands, and that's why we've been investing in these brands and it's why we've
really adopted the strategy we have around these brands and matter for customers. And I think, seeing the early growth
now in these new DMVPD entrants that we see in this quarter, we really think it's an exciting moment of growth over
the next number of years as this downstream competition really increases with lower barriers to entry for these players,
and at price points I think that you make a difference for customers.
To your second question around those price points and the inclusion of different brands, all of our MVPD contracts
have certain provisions for penetration rates, for packaging, et cetera, so there is an amount of flexibility that our
partners have, but we would certainly expect all of our brands to be available to the customers of those DMVPDs, but
much of the packaging is really to come. Well, yeah, and you leave the packaging absolutely up to the DMVPDs
themselves and of the pricing, how they choose to price and differentiate themselves with their customers. I think the
key thing for us is that we're monetizing our content in exactly the same way as we are with the traditional MVPDs, so
we're not out-of-pocket regardless of how they package or choose to package.
<Q - Rich Greenfield>: And then just strategically, Bob Iger made a comment recently that despite all of their great
content and even with their ownership of Hulu, which he actually didn't talk to, that he may need more of a direct
access to the consumer. I was just wondering, how do you all think about that issue of, obviously you have Sky in the
UK that you've – or the Sky platforms across Europe, but how do you think about that issue as you think about the
U.S.? Is Hulu enough or do you need more direct access in the U.S.?
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Well, I think it's certainly clear that the user experience is kind of a dimension of
competition that is really important. And we look at, you mentioned Sky is across Europe and what the business there
has been able to do with creating a user experience that's really second to none, I think, globally, but also our affiliate
Hulu being able to do that here.
I would say that multi-platform viewing, if I look at our entertainment network for example, on Hulu and our
owned-and-operated apps on an authenticated basis, are almost 20% of our prime time viewing now, and we think
that's a really encouraging start. So it's not just to say that direct-to-consumer or user experience means you have to be
an independently priced sort of offering out there, it's also something through the authentication process and through
new partners like these DMVPDs where we can do quite a lot.

One of the most exciting things is ad innovation, so having that closer relationship with customers or working with
partners like the DMVPDs and Hulu going forward, where we can innovate in terms of advertising, we can reduce
loads, we have more, much more capability there. We think it's a real positive for the business. So I don't think you
have to necessarily say that an independently priced ala carte or otherwise kind of direct-to-consumer offering is
necessary. But where it's appropriate and where we think we can do something really interesting, we will, for example
in India with Hotstar which is growing gangbusters, we really saw an opportunity in mobile video to do something
around the content that we create there. And that's been a great success and we think it's going to be a huge platform
going forward.
So I think it's a mix depending on the region. But there's no question the user experience is really important in terms of
how people discover our programming, how they interact with it and then how we can monetize it in the best way
possible.
<A - H. Reed Nolte>: Thank you, Rich.
<Q - Rich Greenfield>: Thank you so much.
<A - H. Reed Nolte>: Operator can we have the next question, please?
Operator
Thank you we'll go to Jessica Reif Cohen with BofA Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jessica Jean Reif Cohen>: Thank you. I'd actually like to follow up on that topic, so what steps are you taking
specifically to kind of drive this targeted advertising across all platforms? So I mean obviously AT&T and Time
Warner talked a lot about that on their platform, but that's only one and you just mentioned Hulu. So what can you do
to really drive addressable advertising across all platforms? And I guess also on the advertising side, can you just
comment on current what market conditions, what you're seeing into fiscal Q2?
<A - Lachlan Keith Murdoch>: Sure. With respect to ad innovation across the piece, clearly we work with a number
of partners, our distributors and downstream distributors. And to be very candid with you, we'd like to work more
closely with them. Some of that's been challenging, in terms of actually getting targeted advertising, dynamic ad
insertion, all of those things; access to data can be challenging. We monetize streams, for example, on our owned and
operated apps where we have some ability to target and we can actually put new ad products in place at a much, much
higher rate than we do on cable VOD services. And that's something that I think the MVPDs have to address, and I
think we've put a better user experience together there.
So I think those things will level up as competition increases, but also across the board from Hulu to the apps to some
of our third-party distributors, as well as these DMVPDs emerging, the opportunity for ad innovation is much, much
greater than in the legacy infrastructure that's there. So we think that's really exciting.
<A - Lachlan Keith Murdoch>: And then, Jessica, in terms of the future advertising pacing and scatter pricing,
obviously, through this quarter and now that we're getting past the Olympics effect and the comparison with the
Emmys revenue last year, as John mentioned, and the FIFA Women's World Cup revenue, we're seeing a more
normalized pattern.
Having said that, we are disappointed with the level of political spending that obviously we've seen or that we would
have expected. But having said that, pacing is up in the low-to-mid single-digits and scatter pricing is conservative, up
between 20% and 30% and with significant enough inventory that it's making an impact.
<Q - Jessica Jean Reif Cohen>: And then just one last thing, you mentioned the asset mix that you have is focused on
strong brands, but with the weakness in the pound, are you rethinking potentially buying in the balance of Sky?
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Look, I think as every quarter, we talk about this with you guys, and I would just say
that the Sky business is a great business. It's growing really well. The integration of the three Skys has been successful,

Thank you. We'll go to Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - Todd Juenger>: Hi. Thanks. I wanted to take your temperature on a couple of major sports rights deals that are
coming up, and then a quick one for John, which seems to be the norm here. I wanted to explore the Indian Premier
League in India, I believe that currently is Sony controlled. I think that comes up at the end of next year. Looks like
people are saying, according to press, Amazon might be interested. I'm sure you guys are interested. Would love to
know how that factors into your thinking about the targets for STAR India EBITDA growth and how aggressive you
would need to be or not be for that guy?
And then similarly, in the States on the MMA contract rights, which are coming up. That's a cornerstone of FOX Sports
1. How are you thinking about what you would do with or without that and how aggressive you need to bid there?
Then the quick one for John I guess would just be, could you just help us in a situation where you are in a dispute with
a big traditional distributor about – actually a litigated dispute about the rate card for your networks, how are you
accruing that affiliate fee revenue? Are you accruing it at the rate that you believe you should be paid? Or at the rate
that your counterparty believes you should be paid? Thanks.
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Todd, it's James here. So, first of all to say on the IPL I think it's well known that it's
very unclear when those rights will come to market. There's been a delay in that process, but I would say, look, with
respect to the Indian business, we obviously look at different rights packages as they come up. We've really grown the
breadth of that business in terms of sports with our BCCI domestic cricket contract as well as the growth in Kabaddi
and the Indian Super League. So it's really a broad-based business there, and new rights that come up we always will
have a look at. There's nothing at this point that I can see in the outcomes of those things that would deter us from the
medium-term targets that we've laid out for profit growth at STAR, which we're pacing towards pretty well. So we feel
confident about that.
And then with respect to the UFC and also I'd say with any rights package as well, you make choices about these
things, and it's really fundamentally about value. I think at FOX Sports 1 we've really tried to broaden the overall rights
package as well, the rights offering to customers and the live events offering to customers, and we would look at any
renewal or new rights packages coming onto FOX Sports 1 from a perspective of value and the perspective of what we
think it really can continue to bring to customers.
The UFC has been a great partner for us, and we've got a little ways to run on that. That's really not until fiscal 2019 the
impact would be, and we'll take it as it comes. And then just on the other question, we booked the fees on the contract
rates. And we have a contract with Charter, and we're booking the fees at that level.
<A - Lachlan Keith Murdoch>: Yeah.
<A - H. Reed Nolte>: Thank you, Todd. Operator, at this time, we basically have time for one more question.
Operator
Thank you. Our final question then will come from the line of Ben Swinburne representing Morgan Stanley. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Benjamin Daniel Swinburne>: Thank you. I just want to focus on the domestic cable networks. It's obviously a
highlight this quarter. Anything besides the subscriber improvement that drove the acceleration in revenue growth? I
think you went from the mid-6%s last quarter to 8%. And, John, I just want to confirm your saying that is set to

accelerate again in the second half of the fiscal year as you go through some more renewals?
And then just wanted to come back to Fox News, maybe for James. A lot of changes in management there, including I
believe your Head of Affiliate Sales, which has been a big driver of growth for the company over time. What are your
thoughts on strategy for driving rate on Fox News going forward? Are you still bullish that there's upside there? And
any change in strategy from the management change on that front would be helpful. Thanks.
<A - Lachlan Keith Murdoch>: So first on the first part of the first question, in this quarter there'd be no renewals at a
higher pricing. So the drive in affiliate revenue is really from volume as opposed to pricing.
<A - John P. Nallen>: So as you look at it, Ben, sequentially, which is 6% to 8%, that's all volume. The pricing for our
brands was the same Q4 as it is in Q1.
<A - Lachlan Keith Murdoch>: But we do have significant renewals coming up in the near future. James, do you
want to talk to the...
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Yeah, and then on the Fox News side, look, I think there's absolutely growth there in
affiliate fees. The channel is as strong as it's ever been and just completed another quarter of leadership and record
viewing. Obviously we expect the ratings and stuff like that to come up after the election. That usually happens and
then it comes back. But we feel that the product has an enormous amount of value to customers, and that's been
reflected in its ability to and our ability to continually grow those affiliate fees.
And we do have some renewals in the near term on Fox News that are pretty old contracts, so leveling up to the market,
and merely leveling up to the market creates growth opportunities there. So there's no real change in strategy there. And
from time to time certainly there are leadership changes and other things like that on the affiliate side as well, but
nothing that would change the basic trajectory and course that we're on.
<Q - Benjamin Daniel Swinburne>: Great. Thank you.
H. Reed Nolte
At this time we'd like to conclude the call, and thank you, everybody, for joining us today.
James Rupert Murdoch
