everyone the opportunity to participate. You may ask further questions by reinserting yourself into the queue as time
permits.
Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.
Gregory J. Hayes
Okay. Thank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. You guys all saw in the press release another good quarter in
what is a still challenging macro environment. I never get tired of talking to good results, but I do get tired of

discussing this challenging macro environment. The good news is that we have businesses that are built to deliver in
good times as well as tough times.
So Q3 2016 adjusted EPS was $1.76, that's up 5% year over year and $14.4 billion dollars of sales, and that includes
5% of organic sales growth. That's driven by the aerospace units. So year-to-date adjusted EPS is up 6% with 3%
organic sales growth.
With three strong quarters behind us, we're going to raise the bottom end of the 2016 EPS outlook range by $0.10,
that's on top of the $0.15 we raised the bottom end last quarter. We now expect adjusted EPS of $6.55 to $6.60. We're
also raising the low end of our organic growth outlook, and we now expect organic growth to be 2% to 3% rather than
the 1% to 3% previously. We continue to expect full year sales of about $57 billion to $58 billion.
We'll end 2016 at the high end of the EPS range that we had originally provided in December with solid organic
growth, and importantly, we remain on track to our 2020 goals.
Once again, had solid cash flow in the quarter while continuing to invest in the aerospace ramp to support future
growth. Overall free cash flow was 108% of net income, with strong cash generation at each of our business units.
These results demonstrate the positive impact from our focus on the key priorities we laid out earlier this year: flawless
execution, structural cost reduction, disciplined capital allocation, and of course, innovation. And there's no better
example of innovation than our Geared Turbofan Engine. The GTF is performing exceptionally well on the field. We
now have eight operators flying 22 GTF-powered aircraft across the globe.
As of last week, the GTF engines have flown over 30,000 revenue hours and more than 20,000 takeoff and landings.
The GTF is experiencing 99.9% dispatch reliability on the Airbus A320neo. That's extraordinary performance for a
new engine that is meeting and, in some cases, exceeding all of its key performance targets.
VivaAerobus, which a low-cost operator from Mexico, recently took delivery of their first GTF-powered aircraft. And
the final leg on the delivery flight was over 9.5 hours, the longest flight by an A320 in history, which was made
possible by an 18% reduction in fuel burn for the aircraft. That is truly remarkable performance.
The good news, of course, is the customers are excited about the engine. Our order book now stands at over 8,400
engines, positioning us for top and bottom-line growth for years to come. The issue, of course, has been that our
deliveries have been slower than what we had planned. The good news is we know how to fix this. We're aggressively
adding capacity, we're improving yields and perfecting processes.
We also continue to make good progress at Otis. Our China new equipment orders and units were up 2% in the third
quarter and 3% year-to-date. This is in the face of an overall market, which is down more than 5%. I would remind you
though, the pricing pressure remains intense, so despite unit orders being up, new equipment orders on a sales basis in
China were actually down 10% in the quarter. A tough market right now, but we remain focused on increasing our
installed base and converting those units into our service portfolio, which will deliver recurring revenue for decades to
come.
We're also starting to see the impact from the strategies that Philippe discussed in March. We're increasing our sales
force, which is helping us on the new equipment side. We're addressing product gaps through higher engineering
spend. And we're leveraging the scale of Otis to reduce cost and deliver better service to our customers. But as always,
more to do with Otis and across UTC.
We also continue to focus on cost control. Nowhere is this more evident than our overall SG&A rate, which at 9.7% of
sales remains the lowest in the peer group. On the capital allocation front, we just completed the $6 billion accelerated
share repurchase program that we launched last November. We continue to believe UTX is trading significantly below
its intrinsic value, and we're buying back shares beyond the ASR. It's an example of our disciplined capital deployment
strategy. We remain on track to return $22 billion dollars in cash to shareowners from 2015 through 2017. While big
acquisitions make headlines, we believe that our disciplined approach to capital redeployment will consistently grow
shareowner value for the long term.

Okay. Let's pivot to organic sales growth. This is on slide 2. Before I talk specifics, let me just briefly talk about how
the world looks from our perspective. In summary, no major change in trends that we've seen from the second quarter
and largely in line what we had planned for the year. While the U.S. economic indicators remain mixed, we continue to
see strength in most of our U.S. end markets.
In Europe, we have seen a slowdown in construction activity in the U.K., we think as a result of the Brexit vote, but the
rest of Europe appears to be improving slowly, more than compensating for the slowdown in the U.K.
Middle East projects remain under pressure as you would expect, but Asia excluding China continues to see robust
growth.
Our commercial businesses saw strong growth in the Americas driven by Otis, which was up 9%, which is consistent
with first half performance. Sales at CCS were also up, and that was driven primarily by continued strength in the
residential HVAC business. In Europe and the Middle East, sales were down slightly, largely from the commercial
HVAC business in the Middle East, which was down almost 25%.
For Asia, overall sales were down 3%, and of course, that was driven by Otis new equipment sales in China.
Aerospace markets remain resilient. The airlines are now into their 6th consecutive year of profitability, and traffic
growth remains ahead of long-term trends, and airframers continue to have years of backlog, particularly for the new,
more fuel-efficient aircraft in the narrow-body space, where we have great content.
In the third quarter, our aero OEM businesses, both commercial and military, saw very good growth, although that's
partially due to an easier compare from the challenges we had last year with the new logistics center startup. At Pratt &
Whitney, both military and commercial aftermarkets were strong in the quarter.
With that, let me turn it over to Akhil to take you through the details.
Akhil Johri
Thanks, Greg. Before I start, just a quick note. I'd like to welcome Carroll Lane as the new Head of Investor Relations
at UTC. Carroll joins us from Pratt, where he was most recently a vice president at the large commercial engine
aftermarket business. Paul Lundstrom has decided to pursue an opportunity as the CFO of a public company on the
West Coast, and we thank him for his many years of service at UTC.
Moving to slide 3, total reported sales of $14.4 billion were up 4% versus the prior year and included 5% organic
growth, offset by 1 point of FX headwind. Adjusted EPS of $1.76 was up 5%. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $1.74, up
8% and included $0.02 of restructuring and other significant items.
As you have seen in our press release tables, included in the $0.02 is the provision for ongoing customer contract
negotiations at Pratt, largely offset by a benefit from the conclusion of a tax settlement. As Greg mentioned, we had
another strong quarter of free cash flow, which was 108% of net income. Year-to-date, free cash flow to net income is a
solid 86%. As we have said before, due to continuing investments in the aero ramp, we will likely be towards the lower
end of the 90% to 100% free cash flow to net income guidance range for the full year.
We have high confidence in our increased EPS guidance of $6.55 to $6.60. With three quarters of strong performance
behind us, we have narrowed the earnings range for our business units. Collectively, Otis, CCS and UTC Aerospace
Systems should generate around $40 million higher earnings at the new midpoint, and we expect an additional $20
million benefit from corporate expenses and eliminations from what we were thinking before. These high expectations
will be offset by Pratt & Whitney, where we expect full-year earnings to be between $1.715 billion and a $1.775
billion. The reduction in Pratt expectations was largely driven by higher E&D spend and lower margins on legacy
engine fleet management contracts. This was partially offset by contribution from higher commercial transaction
aftermarket and lower net negative engine margin.

We are still in the middle of our planning process for 2017 and will give specific guidance later. However, there are
two points I'd like you to understand. First, even with some recent improvements at current discount rates, pension
looks to be a headwind of around $200 million in 2017; about half of that at Pratt. Second, as we more than double the
GTF deliveries in 2017, we anticipate negative engine margin to increase by over $300 million year-over-year from
approximately $650 million in 2016. We anticipate an additional $100 million of negative engine margin headwind in
2018 and continue to expect negative engine margin to level off at roughly $1 billion level at Pratt large commercial
engines.
But this is all part of the near-term investment necessary to return Pratt & Whitney to a leadership position in the
commercial engine narrow-body segment. The offsets to negative engine margins through 2020 are still intact. E&D
will come down. Pratt Canada and military engine business will grow. And net commercial aftermarket will increase.
However, these offsets are unlikely to be a significant factor in 2017. As a result, Pratt earnings will decline next year.
We are actively looking to reduce our pension exposure. You saw earlier this month that we took a couple of measures
to reduce our liabilities by approximately $2 billion or 6%. These moves will generate significant economic savings
and reduce our exposure going forward. Due to these actions, however, we will take a noncash settlement charge in the
range of $400 million to $530 million in the fourth quarter.
We should also see the benefit of lower share count in 2017 net of higher interest expense and CCS should deliver solid
earnings growth even in the face of slow macro environment and the absence of commodities tailwind. However,
net-net, it is difficult to see earnings growth at UTC level in 2017.
As we have consistently said, our aerospace units have captured significantly higher content on new platforms, which
results in higher-than-normal E&D upfront and low to negative margins on original equipment deliveries. But we also
know this content will generate very profitable aftermarket over time, and cost reduction will improve margins on new
products sequentially year-after-year. In other words, this short-term pain will deliver very attractive returns over the
long term.
With that, let me go through the business unit results for a very solid third quarter. Turning to Otis on slide 4, I'll be
speaking to the segments at constant currency as we usually do. And as a reminder, there is an appendix on slide 12
with additional segment data as a reference. In the quarter, Otis sales were $3 billion, flat to prior year at constant
currency. Profit at $594 million was down 9% at constant currency. Contributions from higher service volume,
improved productivity and lower commodity costs were more than offset by continuing price pressure in China and
EMEA, additional E&D investments, and the absence of prior-year favorable mark-to-market foreign exchange
adjustments.
Foreign exchange translation was a 1-point headwind to sales and earnings. New equipment sales were down 2%
driven by a 13% decline in China. We continue to see strong growth in North America with new corporate sales up
21%, and this is on top of over 40% growth in Q3 of 2015.
Service sales were up 3%, with continued solid growth in modernization and repair, while maintenance sales were up
slightly.
New equipment orders were up 2% in the quarter and up 8% outside of China. Orders in EMEA were up over 20%
with broad-based growth. In Asia outside of China, new equipment orders were up double digits while orders in North
America were up slightly, even off a very tough compare. Remember that last year in Q3, we had the Hudson Yards
order, the largest private real estate development ever in the U.S. So, with three quarters behind us, we feel comfortable
raising the bottom end of Otis profit guidance and now expect profit to be down $150 million to $175 million at actual
FX, up from the already increased guidance of down $150 million to $200 million.
On slide 5, Climate, Controls & Security sales were up 4% at constant currency, all due to acquisitions. Profits were up
7% at constant currency. FX translation was a 1-point headwind to sales and earnings. Organic sales at CCS were flat
this quarter, primarily due to the continuing weakness in transport refrigeration. That was down 8% year over year.
North America Residential HVAC, as Greg said, was up mid-single digit.

CCS delivered solid profit growth from lower commodity costs, restructuring savings and other productivity initiatives.
Operating margin expanded by 40 basis points. This quarter represented the 18th consecutive quarter of year-over-year
operating profit growth at CCS.
Total equipment orders at CCS were flat, an improvement from the trend we saw in the first half. The transport
refrigeration equipment market continues to be under pressure from low freight rates and a declining North America
truck trailer refrigeration market after several years of robust growth. Global commercial HVAC equipment orders
were down low single digit, driven by the Middle East, which was down about 40%. However, we saw strong growth
in the Americas, where commercial HVAC equipment orders were up 10% on top of high-single-digit growth the prior
year.
Residential HVAC continued to be robust with equipment orders up 11%. For the full year, we now expect organic
sales to be flat at CCS. However, we are increasing the bottom end of the profit range and expect to deliver operating
profit growth of $125 million to $150 million, up from the $100 million to $150 million at actual FX previously.
Turning to aerospace on slide 6, Pratt & Whitney sales of $3.7 billion were up 13% organically. This was partially
driven by a year-over-year increase in large engine deliveries. As you'll recall, we experienced delays in engine
deliveries in Q3 of last year due to the startup challenges we experienced at the new logistic center.
Throughout the third quarter, Pratt has delivered 76 GTF engines across all platforms. We continue to expect to deliver
approximately 150 engines this year. Pratt also saw strong aftermarket growth in both commercial and military.
Commercial aftermarket was up 11% despite a 5-point headwind from the absence of last year's favorable customer
contract settlements. Military aftermarket saw growth across all the engine models.
Pratt & Whitney operating profit at $414 million was down 6%. Pratt benefited from higher commercial and military
aftermarket as well as favorable pension and FX. These tailwinds were more than offset by lower Pratt Canada OE
drop-through, additional ramp-related costs, higher E&D expenses and a $0.04 headwind from the absence of last
year's contract settlements. For the full year, based on the factors I described before, we now expect operating profit to
be down $125 million to $150 million at Pratt & Whitney, revised from the prior guidance of down $50 million to $100
million.
At Aerospace Systems, on slide 7, operating profit increased 4% on 6% organic sales growth in the quarter. Sales
growth was led by commercial original equipment which was up 17%, off of an easy compare and accelerating growth
on next generation platforms. Commercial aftermarket volumes were up 2%. As you may recall, last year's sales
included a customer contract closeout. Excluding that benefit, commercial aftermarket sales were up 6%.
The military business was down 6%. The low-teens decline in military aftermarket was driven by the completion of
C-5 nacelle retrofit program that we have talked about before. This happened at the end of the first quarter. Military OE
sales were impacted by lower legacy programs.
Operating profit growth was driven by drop-through on higher commercial aftermarket sales, continued cost reduction
progress, pension tailwind and approximately $0.02 from the gain of the sale of a non-core asset. This was partially
offset by lower military volumes and the absence of prior year's contract adjustments and license agreements. With
solid year-to-date execution, we have raised the low end of the Aerospace Systems' operating profit range. We now
expect full-year operating profit to be flat to down $25 million from the prior expectations of flat to down $50 million.
With that, let me turn it back to Greg.
Gregory J. Hayes
Okay. Thank you. Thanks, Akhil. So overall, very good performance in the quarter and a strong year so far. And while
we're addressing some near-term challenges with the GTF production ramp up, our Pratt Canada and Pratt Military
businesses continue to perform well.

We've also seen solid performance out of our UTC Aerospace Systems business, Otis and CCS; all of these guys
picking up the slack. In the end, balance still works at UTC. I'm very confident about our updated guidance of $6.55 to
$6.60 as well as UTC's long-term outlook. We've got a growing aero backlog and we continue to invest in all of our
businesses. And the entire organization remains focused on our four key priorities: flawless execution, innovation for
growth, structural cost reduction and disciplined capital allocation.
We've got a great portfolio of four franchises with global scale and resilient business models. And all these businesses
are supported by solid market fundamentals, growing revenue passenger miles, continued urbanization and a
middle-class expansion globally. All of these things position UTC to deliver earnings growth well into the future and to
create significant shareowner value.
With that, let me go ahead and open up the call for questions. Karen?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question for today comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Good morning, Nigel.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: The color on the OE losses at Pratt is very helpful. A topic comes up a lot with investors is the
market is not doing a very good job of valuing these initial losses. The billion dollars is probably carrying a negative
value right now. So, I know you've addressed this in the past, Greg, but how long are you prepared to carry this kind of
multiple given that the market can't value the Pratt losses? It doesn't seem to do a very good job valuing its losses. I
mean, how long are you prepared to suffer a discount before you think about maybe something structural on the
portfolio?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Well, let's not go there quite so quickly, Nigel. Let me say, look, the negative engine margin
is not a new issue with Pratt & Whitney. We've been talking about this kind of billion-dollar peak of negative engine
margin in 2018. And clearly, next year will be the biggest challenge as production ramps up significantly, even from
this year's level. So, as Akhil said, there's about $300 million of additional negative engine margin out there.
I think once we start delivering at a regular cadence on the GTF, people will start to understand that the GTF really will
deliver long-term value. And I think today, there's a lot of show-me out there, and quite frankly, we haven't performed
this year as well as I would've liked to have seen in terms of deliveries, but it's going to get fixed and it's going to be
fixed this quarter. It's going to get better next year and continue to get better.
And so, I think, I'm not going to worry so much about the multiple. People will eventually understand that the GTF
truly is game-changing technology. And if you talk to the customers, what you're going to see is they love this engine.
They love the take-off power. They love the noise. And it's environmentally friendly. All the things that we set out to
do with this engine are on track.
As far as portfolio, look, we will always look at what's best for the shareowners over the long term. I would tell you
right now, keeping the businesses together makes a lot of sense in terms of supporting some of these losses on the
aerospace side with some of the – the goodness out of the commercial is certainly helpful. But portfolio is always
something we look at. Right now, we're focused on continuing to buy back shares. It's the right thing to do. We're
trading significantly below intrinsic value as I'm sure you guys know. So a little frustrating, but its okay. It's a
long-term story here.
<A - Akhil Johri>: We have $22 billion that we're returning to shareholders over three years, Nigel. I think that clearly
says a lot about us putting our money where our mouth is and believing fully in the intrinsic value of the company. $16
billion of share buyback over three years, that's a lot for a company our size.

<Q - Nigel Coe>: Yeah. Absolutely. And the point I was trying to make was the – some of the parts' discounts is the
widest that we see across our coverage. So, it's more of a friendly question than anything else.
<A - Akhil Johri>: It just means a lots more opportunity for growth at UTX, right? That's what it says.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Absolutely.
<A - Akhil Johri>: That sooner or later, the market catches up with reality.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Let's hope so. But the math you just gave, Akhil, and this is my last question, how does that change
under IFRS 15, the new revenue accounting standards?
<A - Akhil Johri>: Well, I think the change – there will be a little bit of impact from that as we go through the
adoption of the new revenue standard. The biggest impact would probably be in the form of – as you know, we are
doing excess over average over a contract value of the engines, which means there is a little bit of the cost which is
being put on the balance sheet, that will probably get flushed out on 1/1/18. Beyond that, we don't expect a huge
amount of change because our accounting, as we have discussed before, on negative engine margin does not change
under the new rules. We also have a little bit of adjustment from the POC adoption of the – the percentage of
completion as opposed to completed contracts. We'll give you an update on all that as we go through the next year and
come up with more precise numbers.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, there will be some E&D that might get capitalized as well. I would just say, there's
generally – there's not going to be a big, big impact from the rev rec standard. Although there will be a lot of work to
do, not a huge impact. And we'll lay all that out when we put the K out early next year.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. I'll leave it there. Thank you very much, guys.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Thanks, Nigel.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Barclays.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Hey. Good morning, gentlemen.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hey, Carter.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: A quick clarification on something you said Akhil and a question. The first on the – I think
you said lower margins on legacy fleet management contracts. Did you – do you lower the profit rates on a particular
program due to experience on the overhaul costs or any of that? I just wanted to clarify that. And then I wondered if
you could help us a little bit with the EBIT bridge at Pratt in terms of – it looks like there's probably $100 million, $150
million of kind of holistic GTF year-over-year headwind there. How much of that would you say is real negative engine
margin versus maybe sort of extra cost that we might call one-time versus E&D? Any color you can give us there?
<A - Akhil Johri>: Sure. So two separate questions. On the second one first, the bridge for full-year guidance for Pratt
is as follows: The changes that we made to the latest guidance had two elements of good news.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Oh, no, I was talking about the quarter.
<A - Akhil Johri>: Oh, just for the quarter? Okay. So there also, there is a couple of pieces, things moving. We had
good news in the form of higher commercial aftermarket. So that was about $70 million year-over-year, which was
offset partly about $50 million from the contract settlements that we had last year, so net benefit in commercial
aftermarket of about $20 million. We had good news on pension and FX. That's about $60 million year-over-year, good
news. So that's together, $80 million. And then on the negative side, E&D was up about $30 million, and then Pratt
Canada and the GTF startup costs were about $80 million. So that's the net math, Carter, to explain the quarter.

<Q - Carter Copeland>: Okay. And on the booking rates on the legacy FMPs?
<A - Akhil Johri>: So on the FMPs, the change is essentially with regard to our V2500 engine program, and that's the
good news that we are seeing on the transactional side. To some extent, its being driven by the service bulletin that had
come out, which was on the hub deck we had talked about before. That unfortunately has a negative impact on our – on
the engines under fleet management program. So it's just the other side of the good news that we are seeing on
transaction spares, and that's basically what is being deflected in the full-year guidance.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Okay. Thanks guys.
<A - Akhil Johri>: So, slight reduction there. Not much.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned from Bernstein.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Good morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hey, Doug.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: You're talking about delivering 350 to 400 of your Turbofans next year. Can you talk a
little about the approach you're taking to improve the yield and speed the blade production process? And how do you
expect the cadence of the deliveries to move as you address the fan blade production issues?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hey, Doug, it's a great question, and it's probably the key to fourth quarter, as well as the key
to next year, is to improve fan blade production. Let me just put it in perspective for you. At the beginning of the year,
the total lead time on a fan blade was about 100 days to 105 days, that is from the time we would start it to the time we
got it all the way through the test process, it was taking more than three months. And frankly, our first pass test yield,
that is from the number of units or fan blades that were coming out of the end of the process that were acceptable, was
about 30%. Today, that 100 days to 105 days is down to 55 days with lead time. So that has been a big, big benefit to us
in terms of throughput in the factories.
We've also seen first pass test yield going up to about 75%. We're continuing to automate. We're continuing to improve
the processes out in Lansing. The team has done a great job. This is a brand new, as you guys know, it's a titanium
aluminum fan blade, never been used before. We'll get there.
I think two things to keep in mind is we're going to get significant additional capacity. One of our partners, IHI, will be
coming online here in November with additional capacity. They'll start delivering fan blades at full rate production, we
think, in January.
We're also standing up a brand new factory about four miles away from the current factory in Lansing, which will be
mostly automated processes. That will start in full rate production in April. So between the process improvements, the
yield improvements, the lead time reductions and the additional capacity, you're going to see step changes in fan blade
deliveries early through the first half of next year.
And just, again, to put this in perspective, this is a – the first time that anyone has ever built one of these ti-aluminum
blades, and it was a learning process more difficult than what we had anticipated. But if I go back to 1994, for those of
you that have been following the company for a long time, you will remember we had the same issue when we built the
hollow titanium fan blade for the PW4000. And we had the same yield issues. We had the same producibility issues.
And today, it's not an issue at all. We stamp them out, I wouldn't say on a regular basis, but we still make them much
more efficiently than we initially did, and it will be the same on this fan blade. So confident we're going to get there.
We're on top of this. We're following production yields on a, I hate to say this, a daily basis, but we're following it. And
I'm encouraged by the progress the Pratt team has made.

<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: And then earlier, about a month ago, you had said that you had five critical parts that you
were concerned about in the supply chain. When you look at those, are those things that when the blade issue is
resolved, would you expect those to have any additional impact on delivery timing?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: So we have line of sight to complete engine builds for this year, well beyond the 150. The
pacing item this year is going to be fan blades. There is a couple of other critical parts that we continue to work with
the suppliers on, where we have seen yields improving. We've seen added capacity, and we're out adding additional
capacity to try and make up some of the slack. So I would think we have the right processes in place in the supply chain
to ensure we've got all those parts. It's one of these things where as long as there's no surprises at a supplier, we're
going to be just fine. But as you know, we've also put in place, a strategy where we have no single point of failure in
the supply chain. So we've got two key suppliers for each of the key parts of the GTF.
I also talked about we have added capacity. We're perfecting processes. We also brought back Shane Eddy, who'll be
leading the operations at Pratt. Shane joins us from GE, but more recently, he was at Sikorsky as Head of Operations.
So I think Shane and the whole team over at Pratt will get their arms around this, and we're highly confident in the
outlook for next year.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Thanks, Doug.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Andrew Krill>: Good morning. This is Andrew Krill on for Deane. I just wanted to ask what impact you guys are
expecting from the recently passed Montreal Protocol amendment in relation to refrigerants. And, for example, like any
products redesigns that could happen as a result of this and when they might go to market? Thanks.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, Andrew, I think it's – we have been obviously working with the regulatory authorities
on the changes required by the Montreal Protocol. We are in the process of redesigning several of the systems. I think
the good news is we're actually ahead of the curve on our commercial refrigeration systems, on our transport
refrigeration systems. We actually offer a CO2 based coolant solution, which has got a zero-goal global warming
potential. So we're on top of this.
I think the one issue that you've got with this additional or some of these new refrigerants will be cost, which is always
a challenge in terms of trying to pass that on. But from a design standpoint, from a market standpoint, I would say that
the team – and we just completed a technology review with the Carrier folks a couple of weeks ago – they are on top of
this from what needs to be done from a regulatory standpoint.
<Q - Andrew Krill>: Okay. Got it. Thank you. And just as my quick follow-up, do you – can you update on the
contingency that's in the guidance? I think as of last quarter, you guys sized it at $75 million?
<A - Akhil Johri>: Now that we've raised the bottom end of the range by $0.10, Andrew, the contingency is about $25
million essentially because the business units' net-net are about the same.
<Q - Andrew Krill>: All right. Great. Thank you.

<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Yes. Thank you very much. So Akhil indicated the large uptick in Pratt's new engine loss
next year and kind of reiterated – you've made this point, Greg, of the challenging EBIT outlook. But a two-part
question, A, with the lower share count and other factors, do you foresee any EPS growth next year with those pluses
offsetting the challenges to EBIT? And secondly, given it looks like you're going to have much less uptick in GTF
losses in 2018, should we also anticipate a much stronger snap back in 2018?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Let me start, and I'll let Akhil bail me out at the end. Right now, as we look at Pratt, we want
to be very specific. There's $300 million of additional negative engine margin on top of probably $100 million or half
of that pension headwind that Akhil mentioned. So a $400 million headwind. It's just hard to see even with better after
market next year and better military, hard to see how Pratt's going to grow earnings. So we actually expect them to be
down.
E&D, I think, is the other challenge at Pratt, where we had expected it to be down next year. With the timing of all
these programs moving to the left a little bit, we're continuing to see pressure on E&D. So that's one of the offsets that
we're just not going to see until probably 2018 and 2019 is E&D.
As far as overall UTC, again, this is – we're not quite ready to give guidance. As you can imagine, we're still going
through the detail of the plans from all of the units and there's a lot of moving pieces. Clearly, we're going to get a
benefit from share buyback, but it's probably not going to offset the negative margin, the negative engine margin and
the big pension headwind that we have. And I think that's why as we look at it today, it's hard to paint a picture where
we can see earnings growth at UTC next year.
<A - Akhil Johri>: Right. And my comment, Cai, was about EPS, not so much just about segment EBIT, because
obviously, with the pension of $200 million, the negative engine margin Greg talked about, keep in mind, the interest
expense will be higher next year by about $100 million as well just based on the fact that we need to be in the market to
borrow money to fund the share buyback. So even the share buyback will be a significant benefit year-over-year. In
terms of lower share count, we will lose some of that through higher interest expense.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: And then the second part of the question, 2018?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: My crystal ball gets really cloudy beyond about six months. I would tell you, Cai, we're on
track for what we laid out for the 2020 goals, which would show profitability starting to improve in 2018 and 2019.
And as you know, the first aftermarket or first big overhauls on the GTF around 2020. So this – we expect earnings
growth to pick up in 2018. I'm not going to give you a number here, but clearly, with the Aerospace ramp continuing,
there's going to be some challenges, negative engine margin and the mix at UTAS, but those things should be overcome
by lower E&D and higher aftermarket, as well as growth on the commercial side.
Keep in mind, on the Otis side, we're also going to be investing for the next couple of years. Philippe has laid out a plan
to restore some growth to Otis' top-line growth. That's going to require some investment in the sales force. It's going to
require some significant investment in E&D to refresh the product line. And from a systems standpoint, we need to
spend money on these digital initiatives. So there is going to be headwind next year beyond just what we've laid out.
All of those things would start to pay off in 2018 and 2019. So again, not trying to surprise anybody with a 2017
outlook, but we are on track to exactly what we talked about back in March about the 2020 outlook.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Thank you.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Thanks, Cai.

<Q - Jeffrey Todd Sprague>: If I could throw a two-parter out there also. Just back to GTF, just a little bit of pause on
my part, just thinking about only $100 million delta in the headwind in 2018 relative to 2017, given the further volume
ramp that you have. So if you could address that, must be around learning curve and other things, but anything you
could provide there? And I was also just wondering if you could give us a little bit of color on working capital and cash
flow into next year. It sounds look you might be building engines in front of fan blade deliveries, et cetera. Just
wondering if that puts any inordinate pressure on the cash flows.
<A - Akhil Johri>: Great questions, Jeff. So on the first one, the math for 2018 is there is growth in the negative
engine margin on GTFs, clearly, but that they will benefit from us coming down the cost curve. But the fact which you
may not be thinking is that the CEO engines or the V2500s will be coming down significantly from 2017 to 2018, as
will be the GP7000s. And both of those carry negative engine margin as well. So while GTF will grow, the others will
come down. And that's not something that's happening in 2017 as much. So that's the other fact which will keep the
incremental GTF negative engine – incremental negative engine margin at Pratt within the $100 million range.
<Q - Jeffrey Todd Sprague>: Thank you.
<A - Akhil Johri>: On the second question on working capital, again, I think we've been very clear about this. There is
probably a year or two years more as we ramp up, as we take the engine productions up at Pratt net-net. There is going
to be demand on inventories. We will continue to see some improvement as the supply chain stabilizes and inventory
turns, but in absolute dollars, there will be some demand on that as there will be demand on CapEx for another year or
two years, where we will probably spend significantly ahead of our depreciation. But after that, we start to feel we're
back to the 100% of net income or more.
The fundamental thing, Jeff, to keep in mind is that each and every one of our business units has the structure to deliver
100% or more free cash flow to net income. It's just this temporary phase of significant investment we are making to
meet production requirements coming up, and that's keeping some pressure on it. Otherwise, we are in very good
shape. I mean 90% are closed there about this year, about 100% last year in face of these investments is not a bad
number.
<Q - Jeffrey Todd Sprague>: No, indeed. Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel from Jefferies.
<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: Thank you very much. I'll try the same two-part. One on North American Residential, you
had very solid numbers. Could you talk about some of the characteristics and what you think you in terms of is driving
the market and the sustainability of that demand?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: You had a second part too, Howard, or are we just...
<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: Oh, yeah, the second part – and the second part. Yeah, thanks. Greg, it's a little bit more
structural cost reduction that you're talking about. And could you – you talked about it philosophically, could you
provide some other examples of it and how you think about that?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah. Sure. Well, let me start out with the North American Residential, obviously, it was a
good year. It's interesting, the weather was very hot throughout the summer, and yet, we really didn't see much traction
in Residential until September when the dealers were forced to restock inventory. So it was a good quarter, but I think
there's still some concern out there about the legs lefts in the housing market. As we look at it, household formation
continues to be very, very strong at about 1.2 million a year. That's going to grow. If you think about 1.2 million
housing starts, 20%, 25% of the Resi business is for new construction, and I think that should remain on track.
I think more importantly, it's the aging of the installed business out there that is going to really drive growth. There's
over 100 million split systems installed in the U.S., the average life is somewhere between 10 years and 15 years,

depending upon where you live and how much you use the equipment. And that is, again, the big increases that we saw
back in the early 2004/2005 when we were selling – the market was 7.5 million units a year. Those units are
approaching the end of their useful life. So I think we should continue to see well above GDP growth in Resi for a
couple of more years here. So I'm not at all discouraged there. I think it's just – it's a really – a very good place. We've
got great products, very high efficiencies systems, and there is a big push, I think, to continue to gain share there.
As far as the structural cost reduction, Howard, there's always things to do. I think Dave Gitlin and the team down at
the Aerospace Systems business in Charlotte have been focused on it. Yeah, I'm reminded, since we acquired Goodrich
back in 2012, four years ago, we've realized about 600 million of synergies. We've closed more than 30 factories. There
are still more factory consolidations to come.
I think there's also structural cost opportunities in the aftermarket down at the Aerospace Systems business. We have a
very large number of overhaul repair shops around the world. I think Dave's working on opportunities there. So more to
do at Aerospace Systems. Clearly, Bob McDonough and team are looking at ways to continue to reduce cost in the very
competitive markets that we are. Probably no more big plank closings there, but still executing on what they've got out
there already.
And the same is true on Otis. There's – I think they consolidated their engineering footprint to three major engineering
centers from over 15 today. That will help reduce structural costs. We're also focusing on trying to consolidate the
service supply chain. We've got over 60,000 suppliers in Otis service network. And there's a huge opportunity there to
reduce costs structurally.
So the one place I'm not going to be reducing structure is probably Pratt over the next couple of years. They've done a
heck of a job over the last six years or seven years taking overhead costs out. Their SG&A is like 5%. So right now, for
Pratt, it's about probably adding capacity. But we're going to continue to look for ways to take costs out everywhere,
from the corporate office, to the aftermarket, to the supply chain.
<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: Thank you very much, Greg.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Thanks, Howard.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Noah.
<A - Akhil Johri>: Morning
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Could you guys provide a little bit more detail on what you saw in the aerospace aftermarket in
the quarter? It seems like the discussion around airline inventory pulling and used parts sales that had been headwinds
has kind of faded. Curious if that's actually faded in your business. And any ability to sort of speak to what the growth
rates were excluding anything you'd consider to be kind of non-reoccurring, whether it's provisioning or year-over-year
comps or anything like that?
<A - Akhil Johri>: Sure, Noah. So I think the reported numbers would say UTAS commercial aftermarket grew by
about 2%. But we had the benefit of four points from last year's contract closeouts. So I think the trend rate would be
about 6%, which seems more in line with the normal world. We have always said that the long-term growth rate for
commercial aftermarket in the UTC Aerospace Systems business should be mid-single digit, and this quarter felt like
that. There was some benefits in provisioning that we saw with some new programs coming in, but that's in the range of
a point or so. So I think I would say a very normal type of a quarter. The trends seem reasonably okay and good.
Obviously, for the full year, we are expecting low-single-digit growth at UTAS, and we still feel comfortable with that.

On the Pratt side, a lot of the growth has been coming on the V2500 engine. As we have talked about before, there are
two factors driving it, one is the service bulletin, but more importantly, it is about time now that the first overhauls for
the V2500 select five engines start to come in. We have seen the average age of a V2500 at about eight years, and 50%
of those engines had not come for overhaul, so they are starting to come into the shops now, which is helping on the
commercial aftermarket there. I think overall, I would say it's sort of a normal, what you would expect kind of a trend
in commercial aftermarket.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Okay. Thank you.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Hey, guys. Good morning.
<A - Akhil Johri>: Good morning, Steve.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: So it basically sounds like Pratt is essentially down $400 million kind of full stop. And I
guess if that's the case, and you have a little bit of extra pension going against you, will you guys kind of do your
normal contingency and stuff like that? I mean, why wouldn't the high end of – it's kind of – with that profile, it's kind
of tough to get to even a high end of the range in EPS that's above flat. I'm just trying – it just seems like there's the
magnitude of headwinds now is you know pretty dramatic to overcome even at the high end of range.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Well, let's start with Pratt, Steve. And again, not to be more specific than we already have
been, there is $400 million of headwind, but there will be growth in some of the other parts of the business to offset
some of that for – at Pratt specifically. So we're not just going to mail in Pratt and say they're going to be down $400
million to start. We've got work to do there, and we'll continue to work through the end of the year to make sure we've
wrung out every penny we can in terms of their forecast for next year.
The other headwind, the pension headwind is real, but it's real today. We'll have to see where rates are at the end of the
year. It moves us around a lot, as you can imagine. Obviously, this pension transaction that we did earlier this quarter is
just our way to start trying to reduce that big liability that we got out there. We've got $1.7 billion off the books. But as
I say, there's more to come there. I think we're going to continue to look for ways to immunize the plan to try to avoid
some of the pressure that the interest rates put on us.
And interest rates is not just pension. It's all the other long-term liabilities also and costs. So we've got a long way to go
on the plan. Clearly, we're going to see – we should see growth at CCS. We're pushing, obviously, the Aerospace
Systems business to grow. They're going to have pension headwind though as well. And Otis, again, probably a tough
year next year as we continue to invest in E&D and systems and all that, but we'll see. We're going to get benefits out
of share count. We'll see. I think there's just a lot of moving pieces yet.
<A - Akhil Johri>: And, Steve, we generally have this specific discussion later in the year, and we will still have that.
We are in the middle of our planning process right now. So I won't necessarily make a comment on where the high end
of the range would be, but I can tell you that definitely, we would like to have a contingency because I think that plays
well for us. Bad things do happen in the year, and we just want to make sure we don't surprise the investors in any way.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: No, no. I think that's smart, too, obviously. I'm just kind of like adding up all these –
you've kind of highlighted $700 million of – or $0.70 of kind of year-over-year headwinds, and it just doesn't seem like
there's a lot of good guys out there. So just wanted to make sure that I was kind of not missing any kind of major good
guy moving parts. What was the revenue adjustment at Pratt & Whitney in the quarter? Some contract – customer
contract adjustments or something?

<A - Akhil Johri>: It's also part of that ongoing customer contract negotiations, Steve. So that's pretty normal for us to
see that, where the sales adjustment comes as part of the collaboration accounting that happens on the risk revenue
sharing partners.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Okay. And then one last question. Just what's the delivery forecast for GTF next year?
Units?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: So, I won't give you a specific number. I will tell you that we expect more than double. So
probably north of 300 units, 350 units.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hey, Myles.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Hey, I was wondering if I could follow up on Pratt for a second. So the implied
margin rebound in the fourth quarter, a couple hundred basis points plus given you'll be delivering more GTFs. Just
kind of what's giving you confidence that you can get out of the 11s you've been putting up for the last few?
<A - Akhil Johri>: Well, I think you're right about the negative engine margin. I'm not sure how you are calculating
the fourth quarter margin rate.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Down low-single digits – I'm sorry, up low-single digits for sales?
<A - Akhil Johri>: Yeah.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Okay. And then fourth quarter implied, $470 million of EBIT?
<A - Akhil Johri>: Right. Right.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Okay.
<A - Akhil Johri>: There is – yeah, we can talk more offline, Myles, on that one, but I think there is – I mean, I – you
know the factors which are going to impact Pratt in the fourth quarter. The negative engine margin is one. We don't see
E&D coming down that much in the fourth quarter. There is obviously some benefit at Pratt Canada. We continue to
see FX good news, pension good news. Net-net, the math would get you to the fourth quarter number, which is easy to
calculate now.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: All right. And then the only other one, Akhil, a clarification on the pension. So $200
million of a headwind, is that a headwind net of the $150 million that pension was supposed to decline in 2017, so it's
only a...
<A - Akhil Johri>: Right. No, it is net, Myles. It was supposed to decline by $100 million, not $150 million. I think we
talked about that before. So this is the net because just the discount rate change in U.K. and U.S. is pretty significant, as
you know, right? It's not just U.S., the U.K. has seen significant reduction in discount rates as well, and we have a
pretty significant pension liability in U.K. markets as well. So it's a combination of that. The $200 million is the net
number based on discount rates today. As Greg said, that can change again depending on what happens with the Fed
and what happens on December 31.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Great. Thank you.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Strauss from UBS.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Akhil Johri>: Hi, David.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Good morning, Akhil. I was looking for a bit of an update at Otis on the price actions you've
taken, where you think we are, how more there is to go, and what impact, Greg, you think you've seen on market share
as a result. Thanks.
<A - Akhil Johri>: So in terms of market share, the key thing, David, there is – the biggest market, as you know, is
China. We see China has about 50% of the new equipment market still. In terms of units, it's even larger. And there –
based on the data that we have talked about for the three quarters, our unit orders have been up 3%, where we firmly
believe the market has been down 5% or more. So clearly, we're seeing some benefits in the market share on – in the
China business.
I would say even though the data is not quite there from industry overall, but given the strength we have been seeing in
our orders in Americas, we have been doing extremely well there, and I would venture that we are gaining significant
share in Americas. And then in Europe, the order rates of up 21% this quarter would suggest that, again, we are
probably doing better than market. So net-net, the initiatives that Philippe has laid out, particularly on the new
equipment side, are starting to show up this year.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: And just to follow up, in terms of further price actions, how much more do you think there is
to go, I guess, thinking about 2017 relative to 2016?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, I think pricing has been very, very difficult for the last couple of years in China.
We've been talking about that. We actually started to see some stability here in the third quarter on pricing as the
market continues to be relatively robust, especially in the Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities.
Pricing is an issue really across the Otis portfolio, but is obviously most acute in China. U.S., I think we get – we're
doing a little bit better. Pricing in Europe continues to be tough, and I think we continue to lose a little bit of pricing on
the service portfolio every quarter.
So the key for us and for Otis to turn this around is to make sure we get that service stickiness so we see the
cancellation rates come down, and we also improve the productivity of the field workforce. So there's a lot to do at
Otis. It's not just about pricing. There are some structural things we need to do, but I think Philippe and team are on the
right track.
<A - Akhil Johri>: And keep in mind, David, that the China team for Otis particularly is very good at taking costs out
from the supply chain as well. While we see pricing pressure every year, they've also been able to extract cost
reductions from supply chain. So they will continue to do that. They continue to push productivity in the factories there,
and they will offset at least part of the pricing pressure that we have seen.
Q3 pricing was not any worse than what we had seen year-to-date, so it seems to be stabilizing a little bit. Still much
higher than what we saw last year, but down 7% to 9% as opposed to the 4% to 5% that we used to see before.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Got it. Thanks for the color.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Thanks.

Thank you. And our final question for today comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse.
<Q - Julian Mitchell>: Thanks a lot for squeezing me in. I guess one of my questions would be around Aerospace
Systems. You gave a lot of color obviously on Pratt, the commercial OE headwind there for next year. How are you
thinking about Aero Systems, particularly around the nacelle side?
<A - Akhil Johri>: So I think great question, Julian. We've got – we've always said that for Aerospace Systems, the
adverse mix would be the most – the biggest headwind in 2017. It starts to become better from 2018 onwards. But the
UTAS team is also working very aggressively on cost reductions. You can see it from this year's performance, they're
doing extremely well with regard to the plan that they [ph] briefly (58:37) laid out. They're very much on track with it.
And I think the same thing will hold for next year.
They will be offsetting a large part of this adverse mix issue that they have with the changeover from legacy platforms
to the new generation aircraft with the sort of lower margin products replacing high margin legacy products. But we do
expect UTAS to do very well in terms of being able to offset a large part of that mix in 2017.
<Q - Julian Mitchell>: Thank you. And then just my last one as I know it's running late. It's just around Otis again.
The implied guidance for Q4, you've got much less of a decline in EBIT than what you've seen so far this year. Is that
just a result of the easy comp because the margin last Q4 was so weak? Or do you feel that you're getting sort of around
the bulk of headwinds now on E&D and re-investment in that business?
<A - Akhil Johri>: No. I think it's more of what you said first, which is easier comps in fourth quarter. If you
remember, this quarter, we had the negative adverse impact of the FX mark-to-market adjustments. Last year in fourth
quarter, it had gone the other way. So therefore, we get some easier compares, which are relatively easy to forecast, and
that's why we feel comfortable with the Otis guidance for the year.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: And I think just to add just a bit of color there, Julian, the fact is these fixes that we're talking
about at Otis, this is nothing you're going to see come through in the P&L right away. I mean even if we improve on
the new equipment side, we will put those – it takes us 18 months to install the elevators. We give free service for a
year. You're really talking two years to three years out before you really start to see big traction on the new equipment
side.
Service and productivity would be a little bit faster. But again, we're making more investments than we're seeing on the
productivity side initially. So a little bit of patience on the Otis side I think, but on the right track.
Gregory J. Hayes
All right. I want to thank everybody for listening in today. I appreciate that. As always, Akhil and the Investor
Relations team will be available all day to answer your calls. I'd ask that you go easy on our new guy, Caroll Lane, as
he comes up to speed, but I'm sure he's looking forward to meeting with each and every one of you. So thank you very
much, and have a wonderful day. Take care.
