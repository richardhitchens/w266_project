MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning and welcome to Johnson & Johnson's First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Participants will be
able to listen-only until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This call is being recorded. If anyone has
any objections, you may disconnect at this time. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to
Johnson & Johnson. You may begin.
Louise Mehrotra
Good morning and welcome. I'm Louise Mehrotra, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson, and it
is my pleasure this morning to review our business results for the first quarter of 2015. Joining me on the call today is
Dominic Caruso, Vice President-Finance and Chief Financial Officer.
A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast accessible through the
Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson web site at investor.jnj.com.
I'll begin by briefly reviewing first quarter for the corporation and for our three business segments. Then Dominic will
provide some additional commentary on the business, review the income statement and provide guidance for 2015. We
will then open the call to your questions. We expect the call to last approximately one hour.
Included with the press release that was issued earlier this morning is the schedule of sales for key products and/or
businesses to facilitate updating your models. These schedules are available on the Johnson & Johnson website as is the
press release.
Please note we will be using a presentation to complement today's commentary. The presentation is also available on
our web site. Before we begin, let me remind you that some of the statements made during this review are or may be
considered forward-looking statements. The 10-K for the fiscal year 2014 and the company's subsequent filings

identify certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any
forward-looking statements made today.
The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future
events or developments. Our SEC filings including the 10-K are available through the company and on our website.
During the review, non-GAAP financial measures are used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business
performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered replacements for and should be read
together with GAAP results. Tables reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available
in the schedules accompanying the press release and on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson
website.
Please note, our 2015 sales schedules breakout sales for both IMBRUVICA and INVOKANA/INVOKAMET. To assist
in updating your models, we have also provided the quarterly splits for 2014 for those products on the sales schedule by
product.
Now, I would like to review our results for the first quarter of 2015. Worldwide sales to customers were $17.4 billion
for the first quarter of 2015, down 4.1% versus the first quarter of 2014.
On an operational basis, sales were up 3.1% and currency had a negative impact of 7.2%. In the U.S., sales were up
5.9%. In regions outside the U.S., our operational growth was 0.8%, while the effective currency exchange rates
negatively impacted our reported results by 13.2%.
On an operational basis, the Western Hemisphere excluding the U.S. grew by 9.9%, while Europe grew 0.3% and
Asia-Pacific, Africa declined 3%. Growth in the U.S. and Japan was negatively impacted by hepatitis C competition,
while growth in all regions was impacted by divestitures, the most significant one being Ortho Clinical Diagnostics.
Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying operational growth was 5.7% worldwide, 9.1%
the U.S. and 3% outside the U.S.
Turning now to earnings, net earnings were $4.3 billion and earnings per share were $1.53 versus $1.64 a year-ago. As
referenced in the table reconciling non-GAAP measures, 2015 first quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude
after-tax amortization expense of $226 million and a net gain of $128 million for after-tax special items. Dominic will
discuss special items in his remarks.
Excluding amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the current quarter were
$4.4 billion, and diluted earnings per share were $1.56, representing decreases of 5.9% and 4.3% respectively as
compared to the same period in 2014.
Currency translation significantly impacted net earnings. On an operational basis, adjusted net earnings grew 3.7%.
Turning now to business segment highlights, please note, percentages quoted represent operational sales change in
comparison to the first quarter of 2014, unless otherwise stated and therefore excludes the currency translation impact.
I will begin with the Consumer segment. Worldwide Consumer segment sales of $3.4 billion increased 3.4% with U.S.
sales up 3.8%, while outside the U.S. sales grew 3.1%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures,
underlying operational growth was 4.7% worldwide, 5.1% the U.S. and 4.5% outside the U.S.
Growth was driven by OTC worldwide, skin care as well as oral care and women's health outside the U.S. OTC sales
growth was driven by analgesics, upper-respiratory products outside the U.S., as well as new products and relaunches
in digestive health, anti-smoking aids, and Rogaine. In the U.S., adult analgesic market share was approximately 12%,
up from approximately 11% a year-ago, while U.S. pediatrics' share was nearly 43%, up from nearly 38% a year-ago.
In skin care, seasonal inventory build and strong market growth drove results for NEUTROGENA and AVEENO. New
product launches and successful marketing campaigns drove the results for LISTERINE in oral care and women's
health products outside the U.S.

Moving now to Pharmaceutical segment, worldwide sales of $7.7 billion increased 10.2% with U.S. sales up 16.9% and
sales outside the U.S. up 3.7%, driven by both strong sales of new products as well as core growth products. New
competitors in hepatitis C significantly impacted sales this quarter. Excluding sales of our hepatitis C products,
OLYSIO and INCIVO, underlying Pharmaceutical growth worldwide, U.S. and outside the U.S. was approximately
13%, 24% and 3% respectively. U.S. results included a positive adjustment for gross to net including managed
Medicaid rebates.
Significant contributors to growth were immunology products, STELARA and SIMPONI/SIMPONI ARIA as well as
INVOKANA/INVOKAMET, XARELTO, IMBRUVICA, ZYTIGA, CONCERTA, and INVEGA SUSTENNA or
XEPLION. The results for immunology were driven by strong double-digit market growth complemented by increased
market share for STELARA and combined SIMPONI/SIMPONI ARIA.
Regarding REMICADE export and international sales, as a reminder, the company made certain supply chain changes
resulting in sales to distributors previously recorded as U.S. export sales being recorded as international sales.
Combined international and export sales for REMICADE in the first quarter of 2015 were down approximately 2%.
Strong growth in Canada was offset by lower sales to our distributors, reflecting the weakening of the euro and the loss
of exclusivity in Europe, partially offset by an inventory build.
INVOKANA/INVOKAMET sales were up nearly 40% on a sequential basis. In the U.S., INVOKANA/INVOKAMET
achieved 4.9% TRx within the defined market of type 2 diabetes excluding insulin and metformin, up from 4.2% in the
fourth quarter of 2014.
TRx with endocrinologists grew to 11.8% for the quarter and 4.3% in primary care, up 1.5% and 0.7% respectively on
a sequential basis. INVOKANA/INVOKAMET remains the category leader in new-to-brand share with
endocrinologists at nearly 18% at the end of the quarter.
XARELTO sales were up 38% and total prescription share or TRx for the first quarter in the U.S. anti-coagulant market
grew to 15%, up over 3 points from year-ago. TRx in primary care reached 12% and in cardiology 23.8%, up on a
sequential basis. XARELTO is broadly reimbursed with over 90% of commercial and Medicare Part D patients covered
at the lowest copay for a branded product. Strong patient uptake with new indications, approvals, and demonstrated
efficacy drove results for IMBRUVICA, both in the U.S. and outside the U.S., primarily Europe with launches in
Germany, France, and the U.K.
Strong growth of the combined metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer or mCRPC market at 12.5% drove the
results for ZYTIGA in the U.S. ZYTIGA share was approximately 30.3% of that market, down approximately 1.2
points on a sequential basis due to increased competition.
During the quarter, the FDA approved a label update for ZYTIGA plus prednisone, noting significantly prolonged
median overall survival compared to placebo plus prednisone in chemo naive men with mCRPC. Continued strong
market uptick and additional country launches drove the strong results outside the U.S. ZYTIGA is approved in more
than 95 countries.
CONCERTA growth was primarily due to a therapeutic equivalence reclassification of generic competitors. INVEGA
SUSTENNA or XEPLION achieved strong results in all regions due primarily to increased market share.
I'll now review the Medical Devices segment results. Worldwide Medical Devices segment sales of $6.3 billion
decreased 4.6%. U.S. sales declined 6.1%, while sales outside the U.S. declined 3.3%. Ortho Clinical Diagnostics was
divested mid-year 2014. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying operational growth was
1.3% worldwide, with the U.S. up 1.1% and growth of 1.5% outside the U.S.
Growth was driven by Orthopedics, Cardiovascular Care, Surgical Care, and Diabetes Care, partially offset by lower
sales in Vision Care. Competitive pricing dynamics and buying patterns negatively impacted growth for Vision Care.
Orthopedics sales growth was driven by ORTHOVISC and MONOVISC in sports medicine as well as trauma, hips and
knees, partially offset by competitive and pricing challenges in the U.S. in spine.

Trauma growth of 3% worldwide was driven by 7% growth outside the U.S. due to strong volume growth including a
tender. Hips growth of 3% worldwide was driven by strong volume growth partially offset by continued pricing
pressure.
Primary stem platform sales were a major contributor to the results. Knees worldwide increased 1% with the U.S. up
2% due to strong sales of ATTUNE, partially offset by pricing pressure. Outside the U.S., knees were down 1% with
growth in Asia-Pacific and Latin America offset by lower sales in Europe. Slowing elective procedure volume
primarily in the U.K. contributed to the soft sales in Europe.
Cardiovascular growth was driven by a 12% worldwide increase in our electrophysiology business due to strong sales
of the THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH Catheter. Surgical Care growth was driven by strong suture growth and the
success of new products in the ECHELON FLEX family, partially offset by lower sales in women's health. Results for
Diabetes Care were driven by Animas' strong double-digit growth with the successful launch of Vibe in the U.S. and
expanded pediatric indications outside the U.S.
That concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson's first quarter of 2015. It is now my pleasure to turn the
call over to Dominic Caruso. Dominic?
Dominic J. Caruso
Thanks, Louise, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased with our strong start to 2015 and I believe we're
well-positioned for continued growth in this dynamic healthcare environment. At Johnson & Johnson, we continue to
make very good progress on our near-term priorities, as well as our long-term growth drivers, which we discussed
during our January call.
I'll take the next few minutes to highlight some key developments we've made to advance our business as well as some
key points regarding our results for the quarter and then I'll provide some updates to our guidance for you to consider in
refining your models for 2015.
During the quarter, we had several key developments across our business. We received new approvals for
IMBRUVICA, PREZCOBIX, and VELCADE in our Pharmaceutical business and also added a new anti-thrombin
antibody to our early-stage development pipeline through the acquisition of XO1 Limited, which we announced last
month.
We also continued expanding our efforts to combat major global public health challenges through collaborations with
government organizations and others in the industry to search for new solutions to stem the threats posed by dementia
and Ebola. A much more in-depth review of the outstanding work that our Pharmaceutical business is doing will be
provided at our upcoming Pharmaceutical Business Review meeting on May 20, which will take place in New
Brunswick, New Jersey.
In Medical Devices, in line with our priority to accelerate growth through innovation, we announced in March a
definitive agreement to collaborate with Google Life Sciences to advance development of a surgical robotics program,
which we see as an important step in our commitment to advancing surgical care around the world.
Finally, we continued making disciplined decisions regarding the management of our enterprise portfolio and
completed our divestiture of the U.S. licensing rights for NUCYNTA in April. We announced a binding offer from
Cardinal Health to acquire our Cordis business, which we expect to close in the latter part of the year.
Please now turn to the consolidated statement of earnings. We are very pleased with the strong start to the year as
reflected in our first quarter results. While overall sales results were impacted by currency headwinds, our operational
sales growth was 3.1% and our operational sales growth excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures was a
strong 5.7%. Competition in the hepatitis C market negatively impacted that growth by a full percentage point. You
may recall that this same analysis for 2014 resulted in underlying operational growth of 5%. So we're very pleased to
see our underlying operational growth accelerating and very healthy.

Now, if you'll please direct your attention to the box section of the schedule, you will see we have provided our
earnings adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items. In the quarter, our adjusted earnings per
share of $1.56 exceeded the mean of the analysts' estimates as published by First Call. The decline in adjusted EPS of
4.3% versus the prior year was entirely due to the negative impact of movements in currency rates in the translation of
our results, particularly the weakening of the euro compared to prior year. This resulted in a negative impact to EPS in
the quarter of approximately $0.13 per share. EPS on a constant currency basis was $1.69 or up 3.7% over the prior
year. This is slightly higher than our operational sales growth rate of 3.1%.
As referenced in the table of non-GAAP measures, the 2015 first quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude
intangible asset amortization expense and special items, which consisted primarily of the following. Intangible asset
amortization expense was approximately $200 million, net litigation gains were approximately $250 million, and we
had an increase in the accrual for the DePuy ASR hip program of approximately $100 million.
Now, let's take a few moments to talk about the other items on the statement of earnings. Cost of goods sold increased
30 basis points. This is mostly due to currency impacts. Selling, marketing, and administrative expenses were 27.9% of
sales or 70 basis points lower as compared to the first quarter of 2014 due to good cost management.
Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was 10.9% and it was higher than the prior year as
we continue to make important investments for the future. Overall, our pre-tax operating margin when excluding
special items and intangible amortization expense was 32.6% or 50 basis points lower than the prior year, primarily due
to such R&D investments.
Interest expense net of interest income was similar to last year. And other income and expense was a net gain of $348
million in the quarter compared to a net charge of $86 million in the same period last year. Excluding special items that
are reflected in this line item, other income and expense was a net gain of $91 million compared to a net gain of $50
million in the prior-year period.
Now, excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 21.5% compared to 20.8% in the same period last year. This
effective tax rate is higher than our previous guidance as it does not yet reflect the benefit of the R&D tax credit as that
legislation has not yet been passed.
Now, I will provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2015. At the end of the quarter,
we had approximately $12 billion of net cash, which consist of approximately $31 billion of cash and marketable
securities and approximately $19 billion of debt. I'm also pleased to report that we have made significant progress and
nearly completed our share repurchase program, which will offset the ongoing impact of the Ortho Clinical Diagnostic
divestiture we did last year.
For purposes of your models and assuming no major acquisitions or other major uses of cash, I suggest you consider
modeling net interest expense between $450 million and $550 million. This is unchanged from our prior guidance.
Regarding other income and expense, as a reminder, this is the account where we record royalty income as well as
gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments by our Development Corporation, divestitures, asset
sales and write-offs.
We would be comfortable with your models for 2015, reflecting net other income and expense, excluding special items
as a gain, ranging from approximately $2 billion to $2.1 billion, which includes the gain from the divestiture of our
U.S. rights to the NUCYNTA pain medicine, which we announced, closed in early second quarter. And we've updated
our guidance now to reflect the anticipated gain on the pending divestiture of the Cordis business.
As we noted in January, we expect to use the increase in other income to compensate for the anticipated decrease in
income from OLYSIO in 2015 as compared to 2014, while continuing to invest in our core business and opportunities
for future growth. We firmly believe that continued portfolio decisions are an important process and enable us to focus
our resources on the highest growth opportunities.
With the anticipated Cordis gain, we will be able to mitigate some of the impact of strong foreign currency headwinds
this year. The increase in guidance for other income and expense will flow directly through to increase operational

earnings versus our prior guidance.
And now a word on taxes. Our guidance for 2015 anticipates that the R&D tax credit will be renewed by Congress,
although that has not happened. We, therefore, will be comfortable with your models reflecting an effective tax rate for
2015, excluding special items of approximately 21% to 22%. This is higher than our previous guidance reflecting
changes in the mix of our earnings. If the R&D tax credit is not approved, it would negatively impact the tax rate by
approximately 0.5% for 2015.
Now, turning to sales and earnings, our sales and earnings guidance for 2015 takes into account several assumptions
and key factors that I would like to highlight, which may not be fully reflected in your models. Consistent with our
previous guidance for sales, our assumption for PROCRIT is that there will not be biosimilar competition in 2015. We
also do not anticipate generic competition this year for RISPERDAL CONSTA or INVEGA SUSTENNA, but we are
expecting a generic entrant for INVEGA in 2015. As expected, we have seen additional biosimilar competition for
REMICADE in Europe, following the patent expiration in many countries in February.
As we've done for several years, our guidance will be based first on a constant currency basis, reflecting our results
from operations. This is the way we manage our business and we believe this provides a good understanding of the
underlying performance of our business. We will also provide an estimate of our sales and EPS results for 2015 with
the impact that current exchange rates could have on the translation of those results.
Consistent with our previous guidance we would be comfortable with your models reflecting an operational sales
increase on a constant currency basis of between 1% and 2% for the year. This would result in sales for 2015 on a
constant currency basis of approximately $75 billion to $76 billion.
Additionally, by way of comparison to how we described our sales results in 2014, our operational sales growth for
2015 excluding the impact of all acquisitions and divestitures as well the impact of hepatitis C would be approximately
6%, a higher level of growth than the comparable 5% for 2014, which we noted earlier.
As of last week, the euro was lower by approximately 17% as compared to 2014 average levels and the dollar had
strengthened recently versus virtually all major currencies. And though we are not predicting the impact of currency
movements to give you an idea of the potential impact on sales, if currency exchange rates were to remain where they
were as of last week for the balance of the year, our sales growth rate would decrease by nearly 7%, reflecting the
weakening of the euro and other major currencies against the U.S. dollar.
Now, turning to earnings. A significant factor impacting our earnings guidance for 2015 is the impact of currency
movements on transactions, which although hedged is still somewhat negative incrementally versus the prior year. We
expect transaction currency impacts to be negative to our gross profit by approximately 60 basis points to 70 basis
points in 2015 as compared to 2014.
Consistent with the reporting practices by the majority of our competitors as we explained last quarter, we now exclude
intangible amortization expense in addition to special items when providing our adjusted earnings guidance and actual
results.
Accordingly, we would be comfortable with adjusted EPS guidance in a range between $6.64 to $6.79 per share on a
constant currency basis, reflecting an operational or constant currency growth rate of 4% to 6%. This is higher than our
previous guidance by $0.10 per share, reflecting some operational improvements and the higher other income and
expense I noted earlier partially offset by a higher tax rate.
Again, we are not predicting the impact of currency movements but to give you an idea of the potential impact on EPS,
if currency exchange rates for all of 2015 were to remain where they were as of last week then our reported earnings
per share would be negatively impacted by approximately $0.60 per share, which is a higher negative impact of
approximately $0.18 per share than we provided in our January guidance.
Therefore, our reported adjusted EPS range will range from $6.04 to $6.19 per share, primarily due to the increased
headwind of currency on EPS of $0.18 per share, which is partially offset by our improved operating performance of
approximately $0.10 per share. At this stage in the year we would be comfortable with your models reflecting the

midpoint of this range.
So in summary, as you update your models for the guidance that I just provided, I would like to make a few key points.
Although operational sales growth is expected to range between 1% and 2%, we are pleased to note that when
excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and the impact of hepatitis C products, our operational sales
growth at the midpoint of our guidance is approximately 6% for the full-year 2015 as compared to 5% for all of 2014.
We expect that the higher level of other income in our guidance for 2015 will mitigate the lower level of income from
OLYSIO in 2015 as compared to 2014 and allow for continued investment in the business, particularly in research and
development as we continue to build our pipeline and now with the inclusion of the gain from the Cordis divestiture,
we were able to offset some currency headwinds to earnings as well.
With regard to earnings on a constant currency basis, our guidance on an operational EPS growth is strong and in the
range between 4% and 6%.
In closing, we're very pleased with our strong results for the first quarter of the year and we're pleased with what we see
for the full year, namely strong underlying sales growth, solid operational earnings per share, and the benefits of
decisive portfolio actions, enabling us to fund investments and future growth opportunities, and also help us mitigate
some of the currency headwinds.
Now, I'd like to turn things back to Louise for the Q&A portion of the meeting. Louise?
Louise Mehrotra
Thank you, Dominic. And Andrea, could please provide the instructions for the Q&A session?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Good morning, Mike.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Hey, Mike.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Good morning. Thanks guys for taking the question. So Dominic, the first question,
you're probably going to have is, the FX headwind obviously has gotten worse over the course of the last few months
and you reflected that in the guidance. You're helping manage through 2015 with the gains from NUCYNTA and
Cordis, but that won't help you for 2016. So we're long ways away from there but obviously the question is, can you
grow earnings in 2016 after the gains you'll be taking in 2015, assuming the dollar holds at least?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Sure. Well, Mike, it's a good question and let's assume that that dollar holds and there isn't
further currency headwinds. Yes, we did purposely offset some of the OLYSIO income we saw in 2014 with now this
benefit from the divestitures that we talked about and are very transparent about in 2015. I would say with a business of
our size, $70 billion to $75 billion in sales, we actively manage our portfolio and we would expect that we would
continue to do so and as we talked about before, look at the businesses that we expect to not be in and make the right
portfolio choices and take decisive actions and that will further enable us to refocus our resources in the right area. So I
think, although I can't predict the level of other income we would have in 2016, I wouldn't expect it to drop off so
dramatically.
And secondly, as I mentioned, our sales growth is accelerating, our business is being managed well by all of our
business leaders around the world, so I would expect continued sales growth and increased profitability from those
sales as we move forward. So more to come and we'll obviously keep you posted throughout the year.

<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Okay. Let me ask you two kind of balance sheet capital allocation questions and one,
you and I discussed just a few weeks ago on our call, but I know a lot of you like questions on the back of the press
reports on Pharmacyclics and AbbVie's acquisition there and J&J's potential involvement. So I won't ask you to
comment on J&J's involvement, but can you talk about the company's thinking about larger M&A, particularly in the
Pharmaceutical space but really across the portfolio, the appetite for larger M&A at this point?
And then second, I'd be interested in your comment on the back of the GE activity on Friday. As you're aware, GE as
part of its move to slim down to being more of a pure industrial company to offset some of that dilution and announced
that they were going to repatriate $36 billion in cash that was sitting outside the U.S. to fund the stock buyback. That
doesn't help your discussions with Washington about getting a holiday or a more meaningfully change in the tax laws
to allow you guys to access that cash. So with GE being this very high-profile U.S. multinational repatriating all this
cash, does it change your thinking at all about how you're managing your cash balance, all of which sits outside the
U.S.? Thanks.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Okay, Mike. There was a lot there. So let me start with the first half which was about I
think the appetite for large acquisitions, and I won't comment on rumors or speculation about our involvement in
Pharmacyclics. I think just to take a step back, our capital allocation policy remains the same and we have for a long
time emphasized dividends as the first use of our capital and we believe that's the most enduring return to shareholders
and we've demonstrated that over now 52 consecutive years of increase in the dividend.
And then if it was up to me and others in our business, we'd invest all the remaining free cash flow and value creating
acquisitions, whether they were large or small. I think the key point here is, is the transaction value creating regardless
of its size. So our appetite doesn't really change in terms of whether or not an acquisition is large or small. Our view of
acquisitions as being value creating has to do with the disciplined approach we take to evaluate an acquisition and
whether it's large or small we're not going to overpay for an asset.
Typically, large acquisitions are difficult to generate value from, because they're either overvalued by the market or
significant premiums required or the asset is already substantially mature enough where you can't add much to it. But I
would not necessarily read into any of our discussions or actions as being necessarily adverse or favorable towards any
size, particular size of transaction. It is true that over long periods of time, the majority of our transactions have been
below $1 billion actually, but we've done as you know with the Synthes transaction important strategic moves that are
significant in the $20 billion range. So hopefully that provides you some insight there.
On the repatriation question, we're still firm believers that the ultimate conclusion here is a much more competitive
corporate tax system in the U.S. I can't speak for what GE did, but it does not alter our view that it's currently
uneconomical to repatriate those earnings at such a high corporate tax burden and we'd much rather see our government
move in a direction of lowering that tax burden for corporations getting that cash back to the U.S. and invested more
appropriately without the burden of this extra tax bite. But I can't comment on why or whether we would do something
similar as to what GE did.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Okay. Thanks, Dominic. It's very helpful.

Your next question comes from Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Vamil K. Divan>: Yeah. Thanks so much for taking the question. Just a couple on the Pharma side here. One,
you mentioned [indiscernible] (33:54) guidance and how you're thinking about 2015 with PROCRIT and other
products, just any thoughts on biosimilar REMICADE in the U.S. and is that in anyway factored into your thinking for
the rest of this year? And on the oncology side, one area we hear a lot of focus on from a lot of companies is
immuno-oncology and I'm just wondering if you could share any thoughts, I know you have your Pharma business
review day coming up in a little bit here, but any thoughts you could share ahead of that as you kind of get ready for

some of these big oncology meetings, your focus on getting more involved on the immuno-oncology side? Thanks.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Sure, Vamil. Our guidance for 2015 does not assume any biosimilar competition in the
U.S. We remain confident in the strength of our patents. And obviously, we're pursuing all available avenues to protect
our intellectual property, but we're not expecting biosimilar competition 2015 in the guidance that I provided.
In terms of oncology and immuno-oncology in particular, our teams have done very, very good work here in the next
generation of immuno-oncology, and I think it's best to save any further comments to the experts and you'll hear from
them and see them in action on May 20. I encourage you all to hear what they have to say. I think you'll find it very
exciting.

Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Larry.
<Q - Larry Biegelsen>: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I hope you can hear me okay. I'm on a cell
phone.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Yeah we can, Larry.
<Q - Larry Biegelsen>: Great. Let me start off with, first, it was good to see the acceleration in the Consumer
segment; I think it was about 4.7% organic growth. Dominic can you talk about how sustainable that is?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Sure, Larry. Well, thanks for pointing it out. We're very pleased with the Consumer
business' progress over the last several years actually. And now we're seeing that progress result in higher sales levels
for a couple of reasons. I think overall the market is healthier in consumer spending is what we see. We also have made
important innovations in the consumer healthcare, particularly in skin care and we see skin care doing really well and
we continue to invest behind it.
And then finally, we've made great progress in the OTC business in terms of resolving and remediating the issues
around the consent decree. We're complete with all of those particular actions, although we still need to wait for final
FDA certification, but now that allows us to more freely ship product from those plants, we can do so on a consistent
basis and we're happy to see that once those products hit the shelves they go quickly. We're happy to see that we're able
to replenish the shelves on a more consistent basis. So we believe Consumer is off to a great start in 2015 and we're
expecting a more continued positive results from the business going forward.
<Q - Larry Biegelsen>: Thanks, Dominic. On the Q4 call you said you expected Consumer and Devices to both
accelerate in 2015. As you noted, we saw Consumer accelerated in the first quarter but we didn't see Devices
accelerate. So do you still expect Devices to accelerate in 2015 and if so, what drives that? Thanks for taking the
questions.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Yeah. Thanks, Larry. Thanks for the question. Well, let's take a minute to just put the
Medical Device results for the quarter in perspective, of course, negatively impacted by divestitures and as we said,
about 1.3% growth without that. But underlying that, there is a few issues there that I think it's important to point out.
One is, we exited the women's health business recently. We also have seen the negative impact of the price reset in the
Vision Care business so that's a drag quite frankly year-over-year. And also the continued headwinds we faced in our
Diabetes business as to pricing.
When you exclude those factors and you sort of normalize for what's really happening the underlying business, it's
growing at approximately 3% or about equal to the market. Now, going forward, the Medical Device business as we
described last year in the Medical Device Day has a number of new product launches, 30 new products that we're

expecting to launch by 2016. Some of them have already begun to launch, so we're very optimistic about the fact that
the Medical Device business will return to growth, especially once we lap some of these comparisons and also we see
the benefits of the new products that we're launching. So we're very excited about the future.

Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Morning, Jami.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Good morning. A couple of questions for you, Dominic. Just back on the REMICADE biosimilar
potential, can you just update us on what's happening with the patent? Because the last we saw, the U.S. PTO issued a
rejection on your September 2018 composition of matter patent. And just if you can remind us what the appeals process
looks like, could Celltrion launch at risk since you lost the patent, the composition of matter? And just how does that
work? And then more importantly, do you have other long-dated patents around REMICADE that you can assert using
the 351(k) pathway?
And then my second question relates to utilization. I think in the last quarter or two, you talked about two straight
quarters of improved U.S. utilization. Are you seeing that continue into the first quarter?
And then last question and apologies for the nitpickiness of this but I'm just trying to understand my math. You had
talked about an additional $500 million in one-time gains from sales. That to me looks like $0.14 but you talked about
$0.10 combined with – which was a combination of the one-time gain plus operational benefits. So just curious what
I'm missing. Thanks very much.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Okay. Okay, Jami. Thanks for the questions. So let me start with...
<Q - Jami Rubin>: I'm sorry. There're too many, but I had to get them all in.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: That's okay. Well, you got them all in. I'll try my best to answer them all and we'll take
them in the same order. So the REMICADE biosimilar patent situation is what you asked about, so let me just give you
a perspective on that. Yes, it's true that the U.S. Patent Office has issued what is referred to as a final rejection, but
under the process in the U.S. Patent Office the word final is not exactly what a layman or I would consider as final.
So there are a number of steps that can still occur after that final rejection and in fact one of those steps includes our
response to that final rejection, which we filed just yesterday. Then that filing then is reviewed by the Patent Office, so
we would expect to hear back from them in the next 30 days to 60 days. And depending on that response, we then have
another avenue of appeal, which if the current position of the Patent Office remains the same, we have another appeal
process which could take another 12 months or so to prosecute with the Patent Office. And then after that, even if there
is an adverse ruling after that, there's another decision to the Court of Appeals in the Federal Circuit Court that we
could appeal for, which would take another 12 months to 18 months.
So first of all, as I said earlier, we're very confident in the strength of our patents and we intend to pursue all the
available avenues for appeal and we're doing so, including our response just yesterday to what was previously
described by you as the final, but it's not final as I've just described.
On whether Celltrion will launch at risk, it's a question for them. I really can't comment on what they might do.
And then in terms of utilization, we have seen an uptick in utilization in this first quarter, a continued trend of although
slight increases but nonetheless positive increases in overall hospital admissions, surgical procedures, doctor visits, et

cetera. So that's encouraging. We continue to see now trends of now three consecutive quarters of positive trends in
healthcare utilization.
And then finally, on your math as you were trying to do and let me try to help everyone on that, because I think it
would be a common question. So we talked about the increase in other income and expense. Because of the tax rates
applied to those particular items in that line item, let's call that roughly about $0.12 of earnings and minus – sorry, let's
call that about $0.12 of earnings on a pre-tax basis. The tax rate going up is primarily due to the fact that those items
have a higher U.S. tax burden, so our tax rate went up as a result, let's call that $0.07 negative. So now you're up to
$0.05. And we said we increased our operational earnings by $0.10. So that's $0.05 I just described and another $0.05
just due to the continued good management and overall progress we're making in the business overall for the $0.10 that
I've just described earlier. So hopefully that's helpful.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Yes. Thank you very much.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: You're welcome.

Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Morning, Glenn.
<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: Good morning, guys. I wanted to start with a question on spine. Louise, in your prepared
remarks you talked about, I believe, it was in the U.S. the competition and pricing challenge for the negative U.S. spine
number in the quarter. Can you talk to us about what the challenges you're facing? Is it from the smaller players taking
share? And can you describe to us the pricing pressure and how that compared to the first – to the fourth quarter. Then I
had a follow-up on robotics.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Okay. So going forward because we have some movement between price and mix when a
new product goes up annualizes itself, I'm going to start giving people only price and mix on the U.S. price changes,
okay? So in the first quarter we had a 5% decline price and mix in the U.S. in spine and that compared to about 4% in
the fourth quarter of 2014. And regarding the competitive, there is new products coming out with our competition and
as Dominic mentioned, we have a number of new products coming from ourselves as well. So it's just more of a timing
we expect it to pick up throughout the year.
<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: And just as a follow up, the pricing got a little worse for you guys here in the first quarter.
Do you have any commentary why that may have happened? Is it just more about your mix and new product cadence?
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: It's a lot to do with the mix, Glenn, yes.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: I think generally, Glenn, price has been negative in this marketplace in Orthopedics now
for several quarters and we're just seeing that trend continue and we just saw it recently as well.
<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: Okay. And just on the competition side like I said, you can look at two-thirds to the market
and it's you and Medtronic. So is the pressure really coming from that other one-third some of the younger upstart
companies?
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: I'm going to just going to take a look at the share data and then I will – if you have another
question go ahead and ask, and I'll just take a look at the share and see where it's going.
<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: And then I just wanted to follow up on your robotics commentary. So you recently
announced a collaboration with Google. Can you talk about the timing of when you may have a robot that could enter
the market? Is this two years or three years out, longer or shorter? Any commentary on the timeframe would be helpful.

<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Yeah. Sure, Glenn. Well, so one thing I would say, this is a continuation of what we
discussed at the MD&D Business Review Day a year ago. So we had mentioned that we were working on our own
robotics program internally. We've now obviously partnered with Google to gain their expertise in technology and
visualization and in robotics. And I think that's going to provide us some acceleration to the plans we were already
anticipating.
We're already in the market for robotics in terms of our particular – in terms of particular procedures where our Ethicon
products are used at the end of the robot, at the actual procedure end of the robot. So we'll continue to do that. We
would expect this collaboration would take I would say several years for us to come to market with the new type of
robotic surgery that we think will dramatically revolutionize surgery. So I think it'll take some time to do that but we're
accelerating our efforts there and I'd say it's a couple of years away.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Okay. Glenn, I just checked it. It is the smaller players that appear to be taking share.

Your next question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Morning, David.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Good morning. Just, Dominic, one quick nit for you and then a couple of Pharmaceutical
questions as well. Just so we see a step-up in gross margins, Dominic, into the first quarter from the fourth quarter, we
didn't see that in this particular quarter. Was there anything driving that in particular?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Yeah, David, I'd mentioned in my prepared remarks that the main issue with gross margin
this quarter versus last year and also versus the fourth quarter I should have said, has to do with currency impacts. So
it's just even though we hedge most of our manufacturing foreign currency commitments, they do roll over from
year-to-year and quarter-to-quarter. So this particular quarter I could sort of reflect on it and say it's essentially all
currency impacts.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Okay. Very helpful. And then two quick questions on Pharma. The first is on REMICADE
outside the U.S. There was a little bit of softness. It wasn't clear from the prepared remarks whether that reflected
inventory issues or some stocking element or increasing competition. And then secondarily, in INVOKANA, a very
strong number. Two elements I wanted to get your views on. The first is it does appear in some of the data
INVOKANA is beginning to accelerate its share relative to certain specific competitors and the second question was
just given these increasing concerns on DPP-4 drug class, could we see a positive class effect and are you expecting
one for the SGLT2s? Thank you.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Yeah. Well, with REMICADE O.U.S. as Louise mentioned, we saw, these are shipments
that we make to our partner Merck for their territories outside the U.S. And as you know many of those territories we
have seen the loss of exclusivity, so biosimilars have entered those markets. So the primary reason is basically lower
shipments to our partner as they plan for the balance of the year. Anything else you could add to that Louise?
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Yeah. So if you'll recall, about a year-ago, we made some changes to our supply chain, which
caused some of the export sales recorded in the U.S. to be actually recorded in the international. So you really have to
add those two together to get a clear picture of what's going on there. If you take a look at them together it's down about
2%. We had very strong sales in Canada and then that was offset by the distributor sales being down due to the

weakening of the euro and also market pressures because of the biosimilars and they did have an inventory build with
our distributors. So there is a number of confounding factors that are going on there. So you really need to take a look
at it in total.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: And then with INVOKANA, we're very pleased obviously with the performance of
INVOKANA and with INVOKAMET in particular, because as you know, many patients take these SGLT2s in
combination with metformin, so that product is doing well. Whether or not this is a class effect for SGLT2s, I think we
have a particular benefit and strong SGLT2 and the benefit that we have here is of course the lower HbA1c levels,
lower weight gain, et cetera, so the product is getting very, very good acceptance and it's now exceeding all the other
SGLT2s that have recently come to the market by significant margins and gaining market share despite increased
competition.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: So our commercial payers, we have about 75% coverage at Tier-2 and the Part D we have
about 85% coverage at the Tier-2, which is the lowest tier for our brand. And so we're doing very, very well in the
reimbursement front, and we're gaining share in all the categories. You know the endo share sequentially it's 11.8% in
the first quarter and that's up from 10.3%, so nice growth there and even more impressive is the primary care going
from 3.6% to 4.3% and primary care is about 60% of that market, so it's really impressive result.

Thank you. Your next question comes from Rick Wise with Stifel.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Good morning, Rick.
<Q - Rick A. Wise>: Good morning, Dominic. Hi, Louise. How are you doing? Let me start off, Dominic with
Surgical Care and specialty surgery, specifically. Both businesses have been pretty flat for a few quarters here. It's not
so surprising in maybe in Surgical Care but specialty surgery. Can you – you're saying volumes are picking up but yet
we're not seeing it here. Is this lagging or its been accelerated, competitive issues? Just give us some more color if you
could. Thank you.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Okay. So within the specialty surgery area, we have a number of businesses put in there. But
if you take a look at the core businesses of biologics and energy, biologics is up 7% worldwide, energy is up 4%
worldwide and if you look at the O.U.S. for biologics it's 11% and O.U.S. is up 5%. So Acclarent's in there, which is
causing some depression of the numbers. Mentor is in there as well, but Mentor is doing well. So – but if you really
take a look at the two cores, we're doing very well.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Yeah, I think that's well said, Louise. Biosurgicals in particular is doing very, very well and
energy is with the launch of new products is gaining momentum. I think we'll see it in future quarters quite frankly as
these products have just recently launched, but there is some noise in the other segments. But the overall core business
is doing very well, Rick.
<Q - Rick A. Wise>: Okay. And turning to Diabetes, you highlighted that Animas had strong double-digit growth. Is
this all Vibe and moving past the negative price cuts and just – and maybe talk – and if you could give a little more
color again on Vibe, the rollout where you are, and you highlighted the three-day wearable patch as a possibility.
Where does that stand? Thanks.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Sure. Well, Rick, it is primarily due to the Vibe business. So Vibe was launched O.U.S. last
year and continue to pick up a lot of volume, did extremely well in O.U.S. and was just launched in the U.S. recently.
And we're seeing some very, very good uptick on Vibe and we're very, very pleased by that new insulin pump. It's

doing very, very well, taking share and growing and with what we saw happening O.U.S. certainly bodes well for the
uptick of that product in the U.S.
In terms of the wearable patch pump, that's probably a couple of years out still. Obviously, we need to scale up
manufacturing, complete some additional work on that. A few of us were just there recently visiting our Diabetes
business and all plans are in shape there. They're moving forward with all the manufacturing that needs to be done, so
we're very excited that'll come to market, but it's probably not before 2016, I would say.
<Q - Rick A. Wise>: Okay. Just a quick follow up on the Vibe. Do you think you're taking share or you converting
existing customers or is this taking competitive share?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Yeah. From what we saw, the data we saw shows us that we are taking competitive share
from the major player in the marketplace.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: With the very strong growth rates we had, we'd have to be taking share. Next question,
please?

Thank you. Your next question comes from Josh Jennings with Cowen & Company.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Good morning, Josh.
<Q - Josh T. Jennings>: Hi, good morning. Thanks so much for taking the question. I just wanted to start, Dominic, if
you would just on the strategy behind the Cordis divestiture. It seemed like it was an underperforming unit but just
throughout last year, some of your commentary, and Alex's seemed that you were looking to get bigger in cardiology
not smaller. Can you give us just a little bit more color on that acquisition and also just your outlook for the cardiology
spaces and your comfort level of having a relatively stand-alone Biosense Webster division?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Yeah. Well, it's a great question, Josh. We've been very consistent with our approach to
divestitures and Alex has said many times, if we're not neither number one or number two in the market or we don't see
a pathway to being number one or number two in the market through technology and the appropriate amount of
investment, or for example if it's not otherwise complementary to our business, then it should be a candidate for
divestiture.
So as you pointed out, we obviously did not divest the Biosense Webster piece of the Cordis business. That's a very,
very promising business. It's doing extremely well – new innovations coming to market, et cetera. So we're pleased
with being in the cardiovascular device space where innovation is rewarded and where there is significant unmet need
that we can actually address. The main reason for exiting the Cordis business is it generally has become, from our
vantage point, a commodity business and it would be in our view better managed in the hands of others and I think
Cardinal is going to do just a great job with that business.
<Q - Josh T. Jennings>: Thanks for that. And then just a follow up on operating margin in the quarter, only 50-basis
point hit year-over-year despite the OLYSIO headwind and FX. Can you help us think about sort of apples-to-apples
ex-HCV in terms of the operating margin performance and then how we should think about operating margins
year-over-year, 2015 over 2014? Thanks a lot.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Well, the first quarter, there was some impact for OLYSIO, but obviously OLYSIO grew
throughout 2014, so we'll see that operating margin decline more pronounced in the future quarters obviously, and
that's all in our guidance. The guidance we provided shows that. I mean, we didn't give you a specific operating margin,
but you work through the P&L as you update your models, you'll see that the pre-tax operating profit margin is
probably going to go down about 150 basis points, and that's primarily 120 basis points due to the OLYSIO, net
OLYSIO, because remember, we invested some of those gains last year. And that of course is what I referred to earlier
that we're offsetting with the decisions that we've made about the portfolio. We think these are the right decisions to
make at the right time. They also come at a time where we can offset this decline in operating margin. Hopefully that's

clear now Josh.
<Q - Josh T. Jennings>: Thanks so much.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Yeah, thank you. And we'll take one more question.
Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jayson Bedford with Raymond James.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Morning, Jayson.
<Q - Jayson T. Bedford>: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple of quick ones. On Consumer
in terms of the consent decree, the third-party has left the facilities. You're now waiting for the FDA. When it's
officially listed, can you give us an idea as to the potential impact on the business if any and specifically as it relates to
margins, which still look like they're down in the low-double digits?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Sure, Jason. Well, it is true that we've completed our work and we have an outside party
that sort of verifies what we completed and prepares their report, and then the FDA has to come in and certify. But even
after the FDA certifies, remember that we still will operate under the consent decree for a five-year period, that's what
the law requires.
Now, during that five-year period, we'll continue to make improvements et cetera. And I would say, generally
speaking, the Consumer business has done a very nice job mapping out the fact that gross margins and overall margins
in that business should improve over time, while at the same time we're investing behind the products that we're
launching. So I would say we'll see continued improvements in margins. I wouldn't view them as dramatic in the
short-term, but continued steady progress and improvements in that business which we're pleased with.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Thank you very much. So some final comments from Dominic?
Dominic J. Caruso
Okay. Thanks, everyone, and thanks, Louise. So as I noted earlier, we're very pleased with our strong start to 2015.
And I would just like to take a moment and recognize and thank all of our associates around the world for their
extraordinary achievements and dedication to the success of Johnson & Johnson, and thank you all for your time this
morning.
I look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year. And finally just a reminder that we will be
conducting a review for the investment community of our Pharmaceutical business on May 20 in New Brunswick, and
I obviously look forward to seeing you all there. So have a great day. Thank you.
Operator
