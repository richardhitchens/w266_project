Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Time Warner's Third Quarter Earnings Call. This morning we
issued two press releases; one detailing our results for the third quarter and one updating our 2016 full year business
outlook.
Before we begin, there are two items I need to cover. First, refer to certain non-GAAP measures – GAAP measures
setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial
measures are included in the earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website
at www.timewarner.com/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in
the business outlook release that is available on our website.
Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements which are based on management's current
expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various

factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent Annual Report on
Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Time Warner is under no obligation and in fact expressly
disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future
events, or otherwise.
I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Bewkes, Time Warner's Chairman and CEO, who will be followed by Howard Averill,
Time Warner's CFO. After their prepared remarks, our Divisional CEOs, John Martin, Richard Plepler, and Kevin
Tsujihara, and our General Counsel, Paul Cappuccio, will join us for our Q&A session.
Jeff?
Jeff L. Bewkes
Thanks, Jessica. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for listening in. As you know, on October 22 we announced our
agreement to be acquired by AT&T for $107.50 per share of Time Warner, and that will be half in cash and half in
AT&T stock. That represents a premium of more than 35% over our trading price on October 19. This transaction is an
excellent outcome for our shareholders and it's an excellent opportunity to drive long-term value into the future. We
believe combining with AT&T is the natural next step in the evolution of our business and it's one that allows us to
significantly accelerate our most important strategy. We believe that putting these complementary businesses together
will drive innovation and accelerate the transition of the ecosystem to more and better choices for consumers. We
anticipate the transaction will close by the end of 2017, if not sooner.
Turning to our results, we had another strong quarter and we remain on track to exceed our original outlook. We've
delivered these results while making investments to capitalize on the growing consumption of video across both
traditional and new platforms all over the world, which we're confident positions us for continued industry-leading
growth over the long-term.
In the quarter, our revenues grew 9% to $7.2 billion and adjusted operating income increased 12% to $2.1 billion, and
we saw growth at all our divisions. Adjusted EPS grew to $1.83 a share and we also returned over $1 billion to
shareholders in share repurchases and dividends. Echoing what we've seen not only through this year but also for the
past several years, our performance was propelled this quarter by creative excellence from across every one of our
divisions. We're in an environment where leading brands with distinctive content that engages audiences stands apart.
It's also an environment of unprecedented consumer choice and control. And as was outlined for you before, we're
committed not just to being home to the world's best content, but to generating new revenue streams by leading
evolution of how and where content is consumed and experienced. This is where we see enormous opportunity from
joining forces with AT&T, because it brings us closer to consumers and allows us to go where they're going. And that
is increasingly mobile, it's increasingly multi-platform, increasingly on demand, and it's increasingly through new
services and packages via direct consumer relationships over broadband.
As you've all heard from Randall Stephenson at AT&T, we're really focused on the growth opportunities of this
combination. We think we can innovate new services and forms of content and experiences faster and better together,
and that will benefit not just us, but all our business partners and consumers all over the world. If you look at our third
quarter, the strength and breadth of our premium content was underscored at this year's primetime Emmy awards,
where HBO, again, took home more awards than any other network for the fifteenth consecutive year. All told, across
our networks and studio, Time Warner's divisions won 40 Emmys. That's more than any other company.
More recently, we've just seen the powerful return of the D.C. entertainment-based TV slate on the CW and CNN's
continued standout performance in the final stretch of the election race. And the thrilling start to HBO's newest original
series, Westworld, produced by Warner Bros. More than 13 million viewers have tuned in to the premier episodes of
Westworld so far and that exceeds the first episodes of Game of Thrones and True Detective.
In film, Warner had a terrific quarter led by the latest DC installment, Suicide Squad. And Clint Eastwood's Sully.
Sully is our sixth release this year to do over $100 million in domestic box.

Now at the same time, we continue to make progress on our initiatives to develop new revenue streams outside the
traditional TV ecosystem. iStreamPlanet, which Turner acquired a majority stake in last year, demonstrated that power
when it used its technology to make the live streaming of the real Olympics a reality for NBC. And Turner just debuted
its first direct-to-consumer offering in the U.S., FilmStruck, that's an arthouse film SVOD service.
Over at Warners, our SVOD partnership with Tencent – Tencent video VIP continues to exhibit tremendous subscriber
growth and it's currently the second-largest SVOD service in China.
And HBO continues to make progress in its streaming strategy both here and around the world. HBO NOW is building
momentum, while HBO's OTT business in the Nordics is showing accelerating growth. And we're on track to launch in
more international territories before the end of the year.
These are just early examples of the kinds of vibrant new services and capabilities we're working on, and we plan to
accelerate these as part of AT&T.
Now let me spend a little time highlighting what each of our divisions accomplished in the past quarter. At Turner,
we've been investing in our leading portfolio of entertainment, news, sports and kids to make these brands even more
engaging and essential to audiences. And those investments are driving real momentum across its businesses.
During the third quarter, Turner had three of the top six ad-supported cable networks in primetime among adults 18 to
49, namely, Adult Swim, TBS and TNT. And Adult Swim was the number-one ad-supported cable network in total day
among adults 18 to 34 for the 34th consecutive quarter.
At TBS and TNT, we're very encouraged by the brand refresh that's underway and the distinctive programming that
we've been rolling out. At TBS, Full Frontal with Samantha Bee has already overtaken the Daily Show in just its first
season, and Sam has emerged as a distinctive voice this election, which is saying something, given some of the voices
this election.
And on Monday, we debuted People of Earth, a Warner's production, and we'll follow that with Search Party
premiering November 21.
Over at TNT, the refresh is at an earlier stage, but we're excited about Good Behavior, starring Michelle Dockery of
Downton Abbey fame. And that premiers on November 15.
And we have a very strong pipeline of originals for 2017. We also announced this quarter that TBS and TNT have
reached a deal with Disney to be the cable home for the entire cannon of Star Wars movies and a similar deal with
Warner Brothers for its DC theatrical titles, and that's adding to an already strong movie lineup that also includes
Disney's Marvel movies and the Hunger Games franchise. This aligns perfectly with the younger audiences these
brands are drawing.
Let's all turn to CNN, which continues to win over audiences with its mixture of indispensable news and election
coverage along with innovative original series.
CNN was number-one news network among adults 18 to 49 in primetime for the fourth consecutive quarter, and CNN
had its most-watched quarter in eight years among total viewers and among adults 25 to 54. And CNN's coverage of the
second U.S. Presidential debate, co-hosted by our own Anderson Cooper, was its most-watched general election debate
ever, making CNN one-number one among all cable networks for that night.
And CNN Digital continued its streak as the number-one news destination, outpacing all news and information
competitors with more mobile unique visitors, more multi-platform views, more video starts and more video minutes
than any other news outlet.
Let's turn to HBO, which continues to raise the bar and define the word premium for our industry. As I mentioned, its
22 primetime Emmy awards were the most of any network for the 15th consecutive year, and they included
Outstanding Drama Series for Game of Thrones, Outstanding Comedy Series for Veep, Outstanding Variety Talk
Series for Last Week Tonight with John Oliver. In fact, Game of Thrones received 12 awards and has now earned 38

Emmys, more than any single scripted series in television history.
Never one to rest on its laurels, HBO is aggressively expanding its content as well. In addition to Westworld, it recently
introduced Insecure, High Maintenance, Divorce and the new nightly newscast from Vice.
What you're seeing at HBO is our ongoing strategy to provide consumers with a steady flow of the very best content in
order to drive demand across both traditional distributors and with HBO NOW.
Speaking of NOW, we remain very pleased with its progress, and in late September, we further expanded its reach with
the announcement that HBO NOW along with HBO and Cinemax are now available on Sony's PlayStation platforms.
Looking at Warner Bros. strong performance during the quarter, it underscores its global leadership position in the
production of film and television, and it remains on track for another record year. Our theatrical business is setting the
pace with a number of standout performers over the last few months, including the Conjuring 2, Central Intelligence,
the Legend of Tarzan and Lights Out. But our blockbuster for the quarter, of course, was Suicide Squad, which not only
had the biggest August opening ever but has gone on to generate nearly $750 million in worldwide box office. And
that's just the most recent example of how we're tapping the growing potential of our DC entertainment IP. We've only
just begun our ambitious slate for DC theatrical. Next year's much-anticipated releases include Wonder Woman and
Justice League as well as Lego Batman, a fun feature that builds on the franchise we started with 2014's hit, The Lego
Movie.
We also have an unprecedented 10 television series airing this season based on DC characters, with DC's TV business
now generating more than $1 billion a year in revenue, going up. And I want to highlight the excitement we're seeing
for these iconic brands digitally in consumer products and even in print. Our DC Super Hero Girls partnership with
Mattel has action figures flying off the shelves. And since May, DC has shipped a record 18 million comic books based
on the new Rebirth series concept that was spearheaded by Geoff Johns the renowned comic book writer – he knows
how to pronounce it – who's also actively helping shape our DC films.
In the near-term, we're very excited about Fantastic Beasts, a brand-new story based in the Wizarding World of Harry
Potter, that we think will be a global hit, not just at the box office but in consumer products and across all platforms. Jo
Rowling has already written a script for the second film that's set for release on November 16, 2018 and the third will
follow in 2020. And as Jo herself recently announced, the story's so rich that she now plans to tell it in five films,
giving fans even more to look forward to.
Warner's great franchises like DC, the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, Looney Tunes, Hanna-Barbera are also the
driving force behind our consumer products business, which is also enjoying a record year. As we continue to roll at
our franchise films and develop more kids content as part of the kids venture between Warner and Turner, we think this
business can be an important growth driver going forward.
You can see we're heading into the fourth quarter with a lot of momentum and, as I said up front, we positioned
ourselves to benefit from the growing opportunities we see worldwide for the best video content. We're moving
aggressively to strengthen our position within the traditional ecosystem while also building new revenue streams
outside of it.
As we look at the fourth quarter of 2016 and beyond, we remain very confident about our ability to continue to execute
on our plans, and we're even more excited about what we can accomplish given the combination with AT&T and what
that will enable us to do as one company, uniquely focused on delivering great content and a great consumer experience
across platforms.
Thanks for listening. Let me turn it over to Howard.
Howard M. Averill
Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on
our website. Starting with consolidated results, we had another great quarter with growth across all of our businesses,

fueled by the positive trends we've seen throughout the year and we feel very good about how we're positioned to close
out 2016 and as we head into 2017.
In the third quarter, revenues were up 9% and adjusted operating income grew a very strong 12% to a quarterly record
of $2.1 billion. Margins expanded about 100 basis points in the quarter despite continuing investments across the
company in content and digital initiatives. That was partly due to limiting growth in SG&A to the low single digits.
Adjusted EPS was up 46% to $1.83 and included a $0.28 net tax benefit related to a tax accounting method change.
Excluding the tax benefit, adjusted EPS would've increased a healthy 24% to $1.55, as we benefited from great
operating results, a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding as a result of our share repurchase program.
During the third quarter, we repurchased over $700 million of our shares and paid $315 million in dividends. And
year-to-date, we've returned nearly $3.3 billion to shareholders.
So we're very pleased with our strong operational performance so far this year, and when combined with the tax
benefit, we raised our outlook for 2016 adjusted EPS to $5.73 to $5.83, or $5.45 to $5.55 when excluding the $0.28 tax
benefit I just mentioned. I'll touch more on our outlook throughout my presentation.
Now turning to the segment highlights, I'll start at Turner, where our revenue trends remain robust and translated into
solid double-digit growth in adjusted operating income. Subscription revenues increased 12% in the quarter, and that
included 100 basis points of FX headwinds. Domestic subscription revenues grew 15% as we continued to benefit from
the rate increases we achieved during our affiliate renewal cycle. That puts us right on track to deliver the growth for
the year we've discussed with you, and we expect another year of solid double-digit growth in 2017.
International subscription revenue was up in the low-single digits, and that included a more than five percentage point
drag from FX.
Advertising revenue was up 2%, in-line with our expectations coming into the quarter, and that included about 100
basis points of negative impact from FX. Domestic advertising increased in the low-single digits led by solid
double-digit growth across our linear and digital news properties. That was somewhat balanced by the impact of our
decision to air significantly less original programming at our domestic entertainment networks in part to avoid
competing with the Olympics. International advertising was essentially flat in the quarter, but up high-single digits
when excluding an eight percentage point FX drag.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect total advertising revenue growth to be approximately flat. The scatter
market remains healthy, with pricing at our domestic entertainment networks pacing up double-digits over the upfront.
At the same time, we faced very difficult comparisons to last year's record Major League Baseball playoff performance
and we aired three fewer playoff games this year. We'll also have fewer hours of original programming as the content
refresh at TNT will accelerate more in 2017. And based on current rates, we expect FX to have a similar impact as in
the third quarter.
Moving on, content and other revenues were up 33% in the quarter. That reflects higher international licensing
revenues as we're seeing healthy demand for our original programming abroad.
Adjusted operating income was up 12% in the quarter, and margins expanded 140 basis points. That was despite higher
programming costs which increased 5%, mainly reflecting CNN's election coverage.
So Turner is executing really well and is on-track to deliver another year of strong growth in adjusted operating
income. And we think the investments we're making in great content as part of the TNT and TBS rebrands as well as
the new capabilities and businesses position Turner to carry this momentum into 2017 and beyond.
Turning now to HBO, where we continue to invest in the business and lay the groundwork for accelerating revenue
trends over the next few years. Consistent with the first half of the year, domestic subscription revenue grew in the
mid-single digits. We continue to see a sequential increase in the contribution from HBO NOW as we benefit from the
strong subscriber growth so far this year. On the other hand, similar to the last couple of years, we continue to
experience headwinds related to subscriber mix.

Looking ahead, we expect HBO subscription revenue growth to accelerate in the fourth quarter and in 2017. We're
currently in the midst of our affiliate renewals, so the timing of when deals close and their implementation will
determine the pace of the acceleration.
Content and other revenues were down slightly in the quarter. Last year's quarter included the domestic licensing of a
library series and that was mostly offset by increased international licensing revenue as the global demand for our
original programming remains robust.
Across HBO's international networks including unconsolidated JVs, revenues once again were up double-digits when
excluding FX, and that primarily reflects continued positive trends in LATAM and the Nordics.
Adjusted operating income was up 2% in the quarter, as programming cost increased mid-teens. That reflected
investments in new original series like The Night Of and Vice Principals as well as the timing of theatrical
availabilities.
Overall, we're very pleased with the performance of HBO's programming lineup and excited about the strong pipeline
of new series slated for the next few years, and we're confident the investments we're making in the business and the
robust consumer demand for premium content around the world will contribute to significant growth in the years to
come.
Moving on to Warner Bros., where despite difficult comparisons in TV and video games, we delivered strong results
with revenue up 7% and adjusted operating income increasing 12%. Warner's theatrical business led the way with
revenues growing a robust 45% as we benefit from the great box office performance of our film slate. That included
our most recent franchise release, Suicide Squad, which has grossed close to $750 million at the global box office. The
diversity of our slate was also on display this quarter with the success of Sully, The Legend of Tarzan, and the most
recent release in our very profitable horror slate, Lights Out.
In television, we faced difficult licensing comparisons due to the syndication of 2 Broke Girls and Person of Interest in
last year's quarter. However, TV revenues only declined modestly as Warner's benefited from increased production
with the start of the new TV season, including Warner's continued expansion in cable with shows like Westworld on
HBO and Animal Kingdom on TNT.
Across theatrical and TV, home entertainment revenues were flat in the quarter. Digital trends remain encouraging,
though, with EFT revenue up 25%, and we expect improved revenue trends as our strong theatrical slate continues to
move into the home entertainment window over the next few quarters.
So Warner Bros. has great momentum and is on pace for another record year in adjusted operating income. And the
initial success of this year's franchise movies gives us even more confidence in the exciting franchise-led slate we have
for the next several years. So combined with the attractive growth opportunities in TV and games, Warners is
well-positioned to continue delivering solid financial results over the long-term.
Turning to the next slide, free cash flow totaled $3.3 billion through the third quarter. That's up 15% from a year ago,
largely due to the growth in adjusted operating income. Year-to-date, working capital has improved due to the CME
refinancing payment we received in the second quarter. So we remain on track for another year of very healthy free
cash flow in 2016.
Now looking at our balance sheet, we ended the third quarter with $22 billion of net debt. Looking forward as we move
through the approval process for the AT&T transaction, we expect to continue to pay our regular quarterly dividend.
However, we have discontinued repurchasing our stock. We've done about $750 million year-to-date in M&A, largely
related to the investment in Hulu in August.
Our net leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was just above our target leverage ratio of 2.75 times, and we expect to
end the year slightly below that target as a result of discontinuing share repurchases.
With that, let's move onto the final slide which looks at our outlook for 2016. We're very pleased with how we're
operating across the company and with our solid financial performance year-to-date, and that's reflected in our outlook

for adjusted EPS for 2016, which we increased to $5.73 to $5.83, or $5.45 to $5.55 when excluding the $0.28 tax
benefit we recognized this quarter. The midpoint of that range implies mid-teens growth in adjusted EPS, putting us on
track for our eighth consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth.
Looking at the fourth quarter, we expect Warners to be the primary growth driver, led by its strong theatrical slate,
including the first installment in the Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them franchise. Meanwhile, we continue to
invest significantly in programming across our networks. HBO already premiered four new original programs in the
fourth quarter, and at Turner our new NBA contract at TNT kicks in. CNN will continue to have elevated costs related
to its election coverage. So we expect programming cost at both HBO and Turner to be up double digits in the fourth
quarter when excluding last year's programming charges.
In addition, we anticipate our effective tax rate will be in the low 30% range and we expect that to be a sustainable
level going forward.
Overall, we have great operating momentum across our businesses and we think the investments we're making both
inside and outside the traditional TV ecosystem we're very well-positioned to continue this momentum and deliver
strong financial results for many years to come.
With that, I'll turn it back to Jessica to start the Q&A.
Jessica L. Holscott
Thanks, Howard. Before I turn the call over to Q&A, I wanted to add that we'd like to focus the Q&A on the third
quarter results and operating performance, as there are some limits on the type of questions we can answer regarding
the pending merger with AT&T.
Operator, can you please open up the line for our first question?
Q&A
Operator
Yes, thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
Our first question today comes from the line of Michael Morris of Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your
questions.
<Q - Michael Morris>: Thank you. Good morning. I do have one merger question and then one operating question.
There's some concern that an FCC review could be challenging, and so my question is do you expect ownership of any
of the assets that you have broadcast licenses or your CW stake or Hulu would result in an FCC review? And do you
think you, you know, would you consider divesting any assets as part of the process?
And then I have a second question.
<A - Jeff L. Bewkes>: All right, I'm going to pass it to Paul, our General Counsel. Go ahead, Paul.
<A - Paul T. Cappuccio>: Hey, Mike. Thank you. As you pointed out, what the FCC does is they review and approve
the transfer of licenses. We have one broadcast license, and that's for an independent local TV station that's managed
not by us but by a third-party. And we have a fair number of what we would call operational licenses, many of which
are not different from what any company in America has. We're currently in the process of reviewing sort of which, if
any, of these licenses will need to be transferred to AT&T in connection with the transaction or which could be
relinquished. And the result of that inventory will dictate what's required at the FCC. We'll say what AT&T said, which
is we'll do whatever the law requires.

But I think the point is, you know, we have a number of licenses that are essentially operational and we're looking at in
fact whether those need to be transferred over to AT&T.
<Q - Michael Morris>: That's helpful. Thank you.
And then secondly, can you help us think a little bit, help us a little bit with the longer-term domestic affiliate growth at
Turner? I mean, the 15% is very impressive. We know that you've had industry-leading growth with the renewals
you've done, but can you help us with how much of that is kind of step-ups as you've moved some of the agreements to
kind of market rate? And maybe how we should think about escalators and growth going forward beyond 2016?
Thanks.
<A - Jeff L. Bewkes>: John, you do it.
<A - John K. Martin>: Thanks, Mike. It's John. Listen, I think we're delivering the type of results this year that we
predicted a number of years ago based on the renewal cycle that we were coming up and the deals that we were
successfully executing. So really pleased to be able to report subscriber revenue growth domestically in the mid-teens,
which is a pretty extraordinary growth rate off of an already high base.
And we expect to have a very strong subscriber revenue growth year next year as well, which we've highlighted and
signaled, and I still think we're very, very much on-track for that.
We haven't given any specific guidance beyond that, but I would tell you, we continue to believe that the strength of the
Turner networks and our position within the ad-supported cable market is going to be able to garner fair value, and
we're going to do everything we can to continue to extract fair value for the value that we think that our networks are
bringing to both distributors and consumers.
<Q - Michael Morris>: Great. Thanks, John.
<A - Jessica L. Holscott>: Thanks, Mike. I think we're ready for the next question, operator.

The next question comes from the line of Omar Sheikh with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Omar Sheikh>: Thank you. Just got a couple; one for Jeff, one for Howard, if I could. Jeff, in your prepared
remarks, you talked a lot about the creative performance of all the business units in the company. I just wonder whether
you could let us know how you think you can ensure that creative culture is preserved and enhanced under AT&T's
ownership, because that's I think a sort of quite a big focus for a lot of investors?
And then secondly, Howard, on the guidance, I wondered if you could just let us know – obviously excluding the $0.28
tax benefit, since the beginning of this year, you've raised guidance by $0.15. Could you just tell us what that increase
would have been if you'd excluded all the FX impacts?
<A - Jeff L. Bewkes>: Hi. I'll start on the first one. First of all, I'm not going anywhere, and we'll be here through the
closing and into quite a period of transition after that, and then Randall and I will figure out what's the best way to go
over the long run.
The same is true of our division heads and all of our top execs, so whether it's John, Kevin and Richard and all the
teams they lead. And then think of our creative partners, not just our programming development execs inside the
company, but all of our very, very important – most of the creative input comes from outside the company in
partnership with us.
That's the essence of Time Warner, and if you listen to Randall, and I've talked to him and all his top management for
quite some time now, they are very understanding of the need to keep this company excelling and growing, and it
doesn't just mean the ongoing momentum of all of our execs and the Time Warner people, it means continuing to be the
leading place which we think we are at Warner, at Turner, and at HBO for creative partners outside the company who

know that if you come here, we not only have a culture to make the best out of your project, but we have the resources
and the distribution ability, and now with AT&T, an enhanced ability to innovate, bring them new forms and an even
stronger platform to fuel all these innovations.
You're looking at a new world of more mobile products, more short-form products, virtual reality; all kinds of exciting
developments. That's why we're doing this merger, and that's why creative partners are going to find us an even more
attractive place to come in the future.
<A - Howard M. Averill>: Hey, Omar. This is Howard. So in terms of excluding FX, the $0.15 guidance increase that
we've done so far this year would actually be about the same. We haven't really seen much change since the start of the
year where we had estimated about a $0.15 FX impact on the year, and that's actually about where we are. So not much
impact.
<Q - Omar Sheikh>: Okay. Great. Thank you.

Thank you. The next question is from Doug Mitchelson with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.
<Q - Doug Mitchelson>: Oh, thanks so much. So for Jeff, my question is not about AT&T, but rather other companies.
Were there any other companies this year that showed interest in acquiring Time Warner?
And on HBO, any update you're willing to give us on the OTT subscriber levels in the U.S. and overseas at this point?
And if not, any change in gross add momentum or churn trends? Any enhanced knowledge that you can share with us
would be helpful. Thank you.
<A - Jeff L. Bewkes>: Look, I'll start with I think your question about other companies. Let's focus on AT&T. The
transaction here that we're putting together, the two of us, delivers significant value and competencies going forward to
our shareholders. It's a quite a unique opportunity, and it came about after numerous conversations that we had in the
normal course of our business. They are our strongest distribution partner.
We've been evolving a lot of business initiatives ourselves, and so is DirecTV and AT&T. So we basically saw that this
was a fairly unique complementary way to take all the initiatives that certainly on our side we were doing, and
accelerating them, and making them stronger. And we figured that together we could drive more innovation.
And the key to having innovative things adopted is consumers finding a better value, whether that's more choice,
whether it's better pricing on their packages, whether it's more effective and less intrusive advertising. That's what will
determine success. We think this combination of companies is not only going to bring us that, but we think it's going to
help a lot of other companies in the industry to evolve faster and bring better results to consumers.
<A - Richard L. Plepler>: Doug, it's Richard. On your OTT question, we couldn't be more pleased or enthusiastic
about what we're seeing this year. We've seen substantial growth with HBO NOW. We expect that to continue of
course across all of our digital distribution, including HBO GO.
And I would add to that that each quarter, we're learning more and more from the data that we're getting about how to
refine our market – marketing, how to improve our efficiencies, how to target better, how to affect churn, and all that is
progressing month-by-month. So we're very optimistic by the numbers that we're seeing and we expect them to
continue to grow.
<Q - Doug Mitchelson>: Thank you, Jeff and Richard.

The next question is from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead with your questions.
<Q - Michael B. Nathanson>: Thanks. I have one for John and one for Richard. John, first for you. Howard said
growth in affiliate fees this quarter was 15%, which is better than the previous quarter. Was there anything unique
about what drove this quarter? Have subs stabilized for you or gotten any better? So what made it a little bit better than
second quarter growth?
<A - John K. Martin>: Hi, Michael. Thanks. It's John. I mean, listen, any given quarter is going to be affected a little
bit up or down based on true-ups and audit adjustments and things like that, and so I wouldn't look too closely into
sequential quarterly figures.
I mean, I think we'll guide it on an annual basis. That's how we plan for the year. And at the risk of repeating what
Howard said or what I said just before, we're going to come in right about where we expected to be, which I'm really
pleased with. And the subscriber trends in the United States for us in our networks are continuing to pace at about the
same rate of change as they have been for a number of quarters now.
<Q - Michael B. Nathanson>: Okay. And then for Richard, now that you've I believe got your deal done with
DirecTV earlier in September, are you still confident that you're going to see high-single digit affiliate growth at HBO?
And when would be the earliest point at which we will start seeing that high-single digit growth?
<A - Richard L. Plepler>: Yeah, Mike, first of all, we've actually completed a couple of deals with our large
distributors this year, and we think they create tremendous opportunities for us, not only beginning in the fourth
quarter, but into 2017 and beyond to accelerate sub revenue growth. And what's obvious about them is the acquiring
company's penetration is in certain cases 50% above the acquired company's penetration, and we look forward over
time to driving that not only to the acquiring company's penetration but beyond. And the joint marketing and packaging
opportunities that are built into those deals, we're very comfortable are going to drive that upside for us.
So it will begin in the fourth quarter, but begin to kick-in next year and beyond. So we're very optimistic about the
deals, and we think they're going to speak volumes about sub revenue growth going forward.
<Q - Michael B. Nathanson>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Jessica L. Holscott>: Thanks, Michael. Ready for the next question.
Operator
Yes. That's coming from the line of Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Alexia S. Quadrani>: Hi. Thank you. My question is on Turner. You're so into your new strategy which includes
a significant increase in original programming, a reduction in ad loads in some of your networks. Are you seeing the
economic returns you had hoped for, or is it still too early to tell?
And then just a follow-on. You mentioned that sub trends, you know, pace of change about the same as previous
quarters, with the expected rollout of DTC now shortly, and Hulu Live sort of around the corner. Would you expect
that rate of decline to accelerate in your view?
<A - John K. Martin>: I'll take the second one first. The answer is no. I mean, because we're also at the very, very
early stages of some new entrants coming in, the virtual folks. And so as a result of that, I – you know, we're planning
for similar trends going forward, although we hope that we'll be pleasantly surprised.
With regard to the strategy that we really started to employ a number of years ago, honestly, I couldn't be more pleased
with how things are progressing, because if you look at what we've been able to do at TBS this year, which was really
its rebrand year, having four of the top new comedies on cable, all of those shows being renewed for a second season,

having a great show from Warner Brothers, Animal Kingdom on TNT which we've renewed for a second season, the
continued dominance at Adult Swim and a significant ramp in original programming pace there, and obviously CNN is
just killing it this year, and it's going to have a great year next year.
And in terms of advertising, we're still in the very early stages of essentially nothing short of reinventing the ad model
for TV. But the early, early examples that we've done, because we have done limited commercials in some of the new
originals, is we are seeing some really positive results. We're seeing – because of TVs unparalleled reach and
engagement, we're seeing advertiser response has been extremely positive. We're seeing improved ratings because
there's less dislocation going into the advertising pod and coming out. And we've seen higher consumer satisfaction and
higher brand recall. So still very early days but very, very, very encouraging and I think we're moving in the right
direction, and quite pleased to see that the industry is sort of galvanizing around this idea.
<Q - Alexia S. Quadrani>: Thank you.
<A - Jessica L. Holscott>: Great. Thanks, Alexia. Operator, I think we're ready for the next question.
Operator
Yes. That'll be coming from the line of Richard Greenfield with BTIG. Please go ahead with your questions.
<Q - Rich Greenfield>: Hi. I have a couple of questions, but first just on the business side. Richard, you recently
spoke at an industry conference and I think you indicated that the new AT&T DirecTV deal that you had signed
enables far more flexible or unique packaging than you've had in the past. And I think you even talked about how HBO
NOW could be bundled in with wireless-only bundles, and this was even before the AT&T transaction was announced.
Just wondering, how do you think about those opportunities of what you've laid out in the new AT&T deal on the
programming side or packaging side? And how that impacts your sub revenue growth going forward? And then I have
a question on the deal for after.
<A - Richard L. Plepler>: Thanks, Rich. Well obviously everything I said at -- I think you're referring to the Wall
Street Journal conference, holds. We're obviously very excited by the deal. We think it allows us to sell across all
platforms; wireless, broadband, satellite, expands our reach into the consumer base. AT&T is very excited by the deal,
and obviously when we're under one roof, we expect those opportunities to only grow and expand which, by the way,
will be the case for all content providers, not just us.
<Q - Rich Greenfield>: But do you really envision them saying, hey, if you want AT&T Wireless and you're a
high-end subscriber to AT&T Wireless, it's going to come bundled with HBO NOW? Like, is that what you see as the
future for HBO packaging?
<A - Richard L. Plepler>: I think – listen, we're going to stay with the deal that we have which is turbocharging HBO
across all of their platforms. They understand they have their data, we have our data, that HBO drives consumer use
across all of their different platforms. That's why we did the deal together. That's why it's a good deal for them and a
good deal for us. I don't think the merger has any impact on that one way or the other. And everything that they're
going to do with us, I punctuate, they can do with any other content providers as well.
<Q - Rich Greenfield>: Sure. And then just a follow-up on the transaction. You mentioned that the FCC only governs
license transfers. I just want it to be crystal clear that if the FCC chose to get involved and chose to deny or block those
license transfers, are there ways for AT&T to continue to operate Time Warner's businesses without the license
transfers? Meaning they don't block – the FCC doesn't block transactions. They simply block license transfers. So are
there alternatives if the FCC tried to use the license transfer process to disrupt your transaction?
<A - Jeff L. Bewkes>: Paul, why don't you start?
<A - Paul T. Cappuccio>: Hey, Rich. It's Paul. You're correct to identify that the FCC reviews license transfers, is
what they do. If a license transfer isn't required to AT&T, it won't be required to AT&T. And obviously, as you said,
the jurisdiction of the FCC is if you need a license transfer to AT&T, and we're currently – as we said, we're currently

looking at whether any of them need to be or whether they're not needed. I think the point we pointed out is there aren't
like what we would call material licenses that are the bedrock of our business that AT&T would need to operate our
business.
So think of a walkie-talkie. Does AT&T need a walkie-talkie license that CNN holds in order to own CNN? Now you
could think of other things like earth stations that are little more complicated in an analysis. But I think the point is, and
again we don't want to get crosswise with the FCC or anything because we're looking at what's required. And we'll do
what the law requires, of course. But we don't have things that are material to the actual content of the business that
AT&T would need in operating our assets.
<Q - Rich Greenfield>: Thank you very much.
<A - Jessica L. Holscott>: Thanks, Rich. Operator, we're ready for the next question.
Operator
Yes. That will be coming from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Benjamin Daniel Swinburne>: Thanks. Good morning. Just back on HBO. Howard, you mentioned mix shift
being a headwind this year, and Richard mentioned you've already done some renewals. I'm just trying to understand, if
we continue to see mix shift, which I think is largely AT&T moving its sub base from U-verse to Direct, but feel free to
correct that assumption, is there any way to think about how big that headwind is as we head into the fourth quarter?
You called out acceleration, but we just saw the business decelerate. So I'm trying to understand sort of the puts and
takes around those moving pieces with HBO.
And then – at least I would expect AT&T's mix shift to continue well into next year. It's sort of in their best interest.
And then just on Turner, John, can you talk about the NBA, the new NBA contract, both the revenue opportunities
from new games – additional games, other content you got, as well as the timing of the expense increases? I'd imagine
it's weighted towards the playoffs next year, but maybe just any color you can give us on sort of how that flows through
would be helpful.
<A - Howard M. Averill>: Hey, Ben. It's Howard. So in terms of the sub mix, you know, as I mentioned, we did see
the headwind in the quarter. And we did see a little bit of softness at some distributors. Those recently involved in
M&A have had an impact, but we don't see any material change in terms of the trend on that as we look forward.
And we see, you know, what Richard described, some of those new deals and the fact that they'll be kicking in, that's
going to have an impact that will – will exceed that as we look forward, particularly as we get into 2017.
<Q - Benjamin Daniel Swinburne>: Got it.
<A - John K. Martin>: Hey, Ben. It's John. Listen, with regards to the NBA, the fourth quarter, as I think Howard
alluded to in his remarks, will be the first quarter that we'll begin to recognize the step-up in license fees. And it's one
of the reasons why our programming costs will accelerate in the fourth quarter.
Just to take a half a step back, though, we've been saying for a number of years that at Turner our goal and our full
expectation is to be able to manage our overall programming cost growth to be no higher than high-single digits over a
multi-year period. It's been lower than that over the last several years. Next year, principally because of the NBA rights
renewal, we expect programming costs to accelerate, and will likely be double-digits. But that's not going to be a
sustainable trend. They'll moderate then after that.
And I think, yes, the way that the rights fees work, there will be a disproportionate amount recognized in the latter part
of the season.
With regard to revenue opportunities, this deal is giving us more games. We are launching a Monday Night franchise as
a result of that. We have more digital rights. We're working really collaboratively with the NBA to try to dramatically

accelerate the digital part of the business and digital profits as we continue to see more and more consumption
happening on NBA Digital.
So we – and by the way, just in the current environment, we're very pleased with how the season has started with what
ratings look like, and inventory has been extremely tight and there's been huge demand for our NBA property. So I feel
really good about advertising going into next year.
<Q - Benjamin Daniel Swinburne>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Jessica L. Holscott>: Thanks, Ben. I think we have time for two more questions. So operator, can you queue up
the next one?
Operator
Yes. The next question will be coming from the line of Anthony DiClemente with Nomura.
<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Thanks very much, and good morning. First for John or Jeff, you started down the road
of addressable advertising at Turner. When you combine Turner's digital ad sales efforts with the subscriber and credit
card data that AT&T has, what is that addressable advertising opportunity look like? Does that accelerate it? And how
does it allow you potentially to compete with Facebook and Google in digital?
And then a question back to HBO just around long-term investment levels. You guys talked about investing
significantly in HBO, programming costs being up double-digits next quarter. Netflix is going to spend over $5 billion
this year, Amazon probably over $3.5 billion. I think HBO is on-track to spend roughly $2.2 billion this year, correct
me if I'm wrong. But what's the right level of programming investment for HBO over the next couple of years? Do you
need to ramp that spend more quickly? And how would the merger change that trajectory, if at all?
And then, sorry, just a quick follow-up on the merger. Maybe this is for Paul. I have a question about the reverse
termination fee, the $500 million. There are some investors who think that relative to the deal value and given the
regulatory risk here that the fee seems low. So I just want to understand how the Time Warner team got comfortable
with that level for the fee. Thanks very much.
<A - Jeff L. Bewkes>: A lot of questions. Paul, why don't you start with the – let me start with the regulatory fee, and
Paul, you might want to add to it.
We're focused basically – both the sides, AT&T and us, want to get this done which is going to help accelerate both our
businesses. We think the combined company it's going to have the competition spurring advantages and more choice.
So if you read the deal, what you should focus on is that AT&T and we who have made very significant commitments
to meet the conditions necessary if there are regulatory hurdles to close the deal. That's what we're focused on. We
don't think it's very important what the size of the fee is, but Paul, do you want to add anything to that?
<A - Paul T. Cappuccio>: Well no, I think that's right. I think the importance is, is that both sides signed up to really
strong efforts to get this through and are committed to it. We also believe that this is a deal that is, in our view, plainly
pro-competitive. It's not a concentration of anything. It's a vertical deal where there's competition at both levels of that
vertical deal so there are no possible, in our view, vertical foreclosure arguments. So we feel very good about the deal
being pro-competitive. We feel very good about what we've both signed up to do to get it through. And therefore, it
was of significantly less importance to us what this hypothetical fee was.
<A - Jeff L. Bewkes>: So let me jump from that into your question on advertising and competition. And, John, you'll
want to bring real facts to it. But remember what you've got as a result of this is you're going to have more competition
on the subscriber offering side. You'll have more packages and more, essentially distribution alternatives for
consumers, and you're already seeing some new packages and even more affordable price points that are beginning to
come out of this. So that's one on the subscriber side.

If you go to advertising, it's very important and, John, you can fill in more. But we're developing some innovative
products already at Turner that focus on data analytics, targeting and return on investment for clients, so they can really
value and measure what they're doing and what the results are.
If you combine the unparalleled region engagement of television with more ability in direct platform in terms – whether
it's mobile, whether it's broadband-delivered, that can really give you a step up in the efficiency of advertising and the
value of advertising. That has tremendous benefits for consumers because it can shift cost from subscription payment to
advertising payment. It has great benefits for advertisers because it gives them more effective advertising. And it gives
them more competition in advertising. I think we've all seen, and you all know this, an increase in concentration in
digital advertising in just a couple of companies. And it's basically good for the market, consumers and advertising
clients, if we have a broader number of competitors in the ad business, particularly the digital ad business. So, John,
you want to add any specifics on Turner?
<A - John K. Martin>: No. I don't think I could add anything to that.
<A - Richard L. Plepler>: Anthony, it's Richard. You asked about spend. Look, what we're trying to do is we're trying
to curate the best content for the best value and make it as available to as many consumers as possible in as many ways
as possible. So if you look at our split, first of all, this gets obscured a lot. We have four Hollywood movies studios
which make up over 70% of viewing, 68% of on-demand viewing. It's a huge part of our offering. And if you continue
to look at the usage, it goes up 92% for, example of HBO subscribers watch a movie at least once a month. When you
then migrate over to original programming, I've said this before, it's absolutely true, more isn't better, only better is
better. We're not trying to just spend money. We're trying to spend money thoughtfully to differentiate high-quality
programming and build more consumers and build more [ph] addicts (55:30) across our subscriber base.
I like to think that our track record is pretty good at doing that over the last decade, and I think if you look out at our
programming lineup going forward, you'll see that we have every confidence that we're going to continue to do that. So
I like our mix, I like our investments, and I think what we're putting together in terms of a value proposition is
extraordinary.
<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Thank you very much.
<A - Jessica L. Holscott>: Thanks, Anthony. I think we have – we have time for one more question, operator.
Operator
Thank you. That's coming from the line of Vasily Karasyov with CLSA. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Vasily Karasyov>: Thank you. Good morning. One quick question on your Hulu stake. What happens to the
Hulu stake and your carriage agreements in light of the AT&T news? And then on TV Everywhere, Jeff, you've been a
proponent and a supporter of that for a long time. What happens, do you think, to TV Everywhere aspect of video
distribution when virtual bundles come out and hopefully gain traction? Do you think that that sort of attempt to
improve the consumer experience is behind us now, and we all are hoping for virtual bundles?
<A - Jeff L. Bewkes>: Yeah. Let me do Hulu and then that. Thanks for the question. So on Hulu, no change. We have
a passive 10% investment. We don't think the merger here changes anything. So that's generally true of all our deals
with all the other distribution packages and so forth.
On TV Everywhere, let's – if I could remember what that is, that's about more VOD and it's about better interfaces. And
what we've had is we've had a kind of, I think we all know this. We've had not as fast an adoption by all the distribution
platforms of full VOD offerings across all networks, good interface to find the network, easy authentication. This will
help speed that up and it'll make yet another platform and interface available to all networks and therefore give a
national offering for consumers increasing. I think it'll basically spur everybody, other networks, other distributors, to
offer more VOD and better interfaces. And that's good for everybody.
