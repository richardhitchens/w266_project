Inge G. Thulin
Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us again. We had an opportunity to see many of
you last month at the Investor Day when we laid out 3M's new 5-year plan. We also updated you on the 3M playbook
and how it is being executed across our enterprise to deliver efficient growth, both today and into the future.
In the first quarter, the 3M team continued to execute our playbook and delivered another strong operational
performance. We increased margins more than a full percent point and improved our cash flow generation by 20%
year-over-year. At the same time, we continued to invest in the business, including opening a new world class
laboratory in the United States, while also returning cash to our shareholders.
Looking at the numbers, we posted first quarter earnings of $2.05 per share, which is an increase of 11%
year-over-year. Please note that this includes a $0.10 earnings benefit related to a new accounting standard that 3M
adapted in the first quarter, and Nick will provide more details during his comments. Adjusting for this impact, we
delivered Q1 earnings of $1.95 per share.
Company-wide, organic growth was down slightly at minus 1%. Three of our business groups grew organically in the
quarter led by Healthcare at 6% with strong organic growth across all its businesses. Our Consumer business, which is
the home to some of 3M's most iconic brands, also delivered a good quarter of organic growth. I'm very pleased that
our two domestic-driven businesses, Healthcare and Consumer, continue to do well and are off to a very good start in
2016.
Safety and Graphics also posted solid organic growth with particular strength in Commercial Solutions and Personal
Safety. Organic growth in our Industrial business was down low single digits which was similar to last quarter. And as
expected, Electronics and Energy declined low double digits. Electronics and Energy continue to be impacted by
softness in the consumer electronics markets which we expect to persist through the first half of the year.
Acquisitions net of divestitures added two percentage points to first quarter sales while foreign exchange reduced sales
by 3%. As a result, our company total sales was $7.4 billion, down 2% year-on-year. Our ability to consistently deliver
premium margins remains a hallmark of 3M and it's an important element of our focus on driving efficient growth.
In the first quarter, we posted margins of 24%, up more than a full percentage point versus last year. Without the
impact from last year's fourth-quarter restructuring, we have expanded margins year-over-year for 10 consecutive
quarters. Also in the quarter, we returned nearly $2 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
This includes an 8% increase in our first quarter dividend which marks 3M's 58th consecutive year of dividend
increases. All in all, we had a good start to the year with results that were in line with our expectations.
Please turn to slide four. In addition to a strong financial performance in the quarter, we also made good progress on
our three key levers, starting with portfolio management. After strategic review of our Health Information Systems
business, we decided that we could create the greatest value by retaining and further invest in that business. In fact, we
plan to accelerate the investment across our entire global Healthcare business in research and development, Health
economics, and compensation capabilities to build strength-on-strength in both developed and developing markets.
In February, we sold the Polyfoam business, which was a small non-core segment within our Industrial business group.
Earlier, I mentioned ongoing softness in the Electronics markets. As you know, over the last few years, we have
consolidated a number of businesses within Electronics and Energy which has made us more relevant to our customers,
more agile and more efficient.
Today, we are announcing further actions to build upon that work. This action will reduce 250 positions worldwide
with a majority of reductions on the Electronics side of the business and result in an estimated Q2 charge of $20
million. This will further position Electronics and Energy for long term success and going forward, this business will
continue to stay close to customers, advance its technology capabilities and increase productivity.

Investing in innovation is the second lever, and in the first quarter, we invested nearly $500 million dollars in Research
and Development. Research and Development supports organic growth and premium returns, and as you recall, we
continue to step up investments in R&D from 5.5% of sales closer to 6%.
In March, we also opened our new laboratory in the United States, which many of you had opportunity to see at our
Investor Day. It will house 750 of scientists who will leverage our 46 technology platforms to create unique
cutting-edge solutions for customers.
Finally, in the first quarter, we continued to march forward with business transformation, which is our third level. We
had a successful ERP deployment in Germany and remain focused on executing the rollout plan across West Europe.
Business transformation which starts and ends with our customers is important for our future, especially as it relates to
efficient growth. We expect these efforts to result in a $500 million to $700 million in annual operational savings by
2020 and another $500 million dollars in working capital improvements.
Overall, as I look at the quarter, we continued to execute the 3M playbook and deliver the strong performance, in terms
of both financial results and building our enterprise for the future.
With that, I will turn the call over to Nick who will take you through the details. Nick?
Nicholas C. Gangestad
Thanks, Inge, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on slide five with a recap of our first quarter sales change. Organic
local currency sales declined 0.8% in the first quarter, with volumes down 1.7%, partially offset by a 0.9% increase in
selling prices. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, added 1.6% to sales. This impact includes the acquisitions of Capital
Safety, Membrana, and Ivera Medical, along with the divestitures of Library Systems, Polyfoam and the license plate
converting business in France. Finally, foreign currency translation reduced sales by 3%.
In U.S. dollars, total sales declined 2.2% versus the first quarter of 2015. In the United States, organic growth was up
0.3%, with strong performances in our domestic-oriented businesses, namely Healthcare and Consumer. Industrial
production in the U.S. declined 1.3% in Q1, which impacted growth in parts of our Industrial business. Organic growth
in Asia-Pacific was down 5.6%. Three of five business groups posted positive growth in the region, again led by
Healthcare and Consumer.
Soft end market demand and excess channel inventories in consumer electronics resulted in a double-digit organic
growth decline in Electronics and Energy. Within Asia-Pacific, organic growth was down 4% in China/Hong Kong,
and declined 8% in Japan. Excluding our Electronics business, Japan and China/Hong Kong were both flat.
Moving to EMEA, organic growth increased 1.7%. West Europe was up slightly, and the combination of Central East
Europe and Middle East/Africa was up high single-digits. Finally, organic growth in Latin America Canada increased
4.2%. Mexico again had a strong quarter, with 10% organic growth, and Brazil also posted positive organic growth of
2%.
Please turn to slide six for the first quarter P&L highlights. First quarter sales were $7.4 billion. Operating income
increased more than 3% to $1.8 billion, and earnings rose 10.8% to $2.05 per share. As Inge mentioned, we had another
strong margin performance in the first quarter, up 130 basis points to 24.1%.
Let's take a closer look at the first quarter margin improvement. The combination of lower raw materials and higher
selling prices added 110 basis points to first quarter margins. We continue to benefit from both lower commodity prices
and from our global sourcing teams' ongoing efforts to reduce costs. Lower pension and OPEB expense increased
margins by 100 basis points. Productivity gains related to last year's fourth-quarter restructuring contributed 40 basis
points to margins. Strategic investments reduced margins 10 basis points, as we began to take actions on our
manufacturing footprint and increased growth investments.
Foreign currency, net of hedge gains, brought margins down another 10 basis points, and first year acquisitions reduced
margins by 20 basis points. The year-on-year decline in organic volume reduced margins by 30 basis points. And

finally, utilization and other was a net 50 basis point headwind to margins. This included the impact of lower asset
utilization, particularly in our Electronics and Industrial businesses, which was partially offset by divestiture gains in
the quarter.
Also, we continue to increase investments across the business to drive growth and strengthen our competitiveness
going forward. All in, we have started the year on a positive note with respect to margins, and continue to expect
approximately 150 basis points of margin improvement for the full year, which reflects our focus on delivering efficient
growth.
Let's now turn to slide seven for a closer look at earnings per share. As stated earlier, earnings for the first quarter were
$2.05 per share, an increase of 10.8%. Margin expansion, net of organic sales declines, contributed $0.04 to earnings in
the quarter. First year acquisitions and divestitures added $0.07 to earnings per share. This result was driven by solid
performances from Membrana, Capital Safety, and Ivera, along with divestiture gains in the quarter.
Foreign currency impacts, net of hedging, reduced pre-tax earnings by $48 million, or the equivalent of $0.05 a share.
Higher balance sheet leverage led to an increase in net interest expense year-on-year, reducing per share earnings by
$0.02. The first quarter tax rate was 26.8%, versus 29.5% in the comparable quarter, which increased Q1 earnings by
$0.07 per share. The lower Q1 tax rate includes the adoption of a new FASB accounting standard which I'll walk
through in a moment. Finally, average diluted shares outstanding declined by 4% year-on-year, which added $0.09 to
first quarter earnings per share.
Please turn to slide eight. On March 30 of this year, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an accounting
standards update related to employee share-based payments. This new standard changes the recording of additional tax
savings or charges when employees realize benefits from stock-based compensation. The additional tax impact is a
result of the change in the value of stock-based compensation from the time it is granted to an employee to the time it is
realized by the employee. Previously, these additional tax impacts were recognized in the equity section on the balance
sheet. Going forward, they will be recognized on the income statement.
All U.S. public companies are required to adopt the new accounting standard no later than the 2017 fiscal year. We
chose to adopt this new standard in the first quarter of 2016, which created a first quarter tax benefit of $0.10 per share,
net of tax cost related to global cash optimization actions.
For the full year, we expect no impact to our tax rate and earnings per share guidance, as additional actions we chose to
implement to further optimize our global cash position will increase our tax expense in the last three quarters of the
year.
Let's now turn to our first quarter cash flow performance on slide nine. Overall, we posted another solid cash flow
performance in Q1. Free cash flow conversion was 74%, up eight percentage points versus same period last year. As a
reminder, Q1 is typically our lowest conversion rate of the year. We generated $1.3 billion of operating cash flow in the
quarter, a $180 million increase versus Q1 in 2015.
The primary drivers of the increase were improved inventories and accounts receivable, along with lower cash taxes.
Capital expenditures were $314 million as we continued to invest in the business to drive efficient growth. For the full
year, we expect CapEx investments in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion.
The strength of our business model allows us to invest in growth and also return cash to shareholders. As you heard
earlier, we increased our first quarter per share dividend by 8%, which increased our payout to $672 million in the
quarter. In addition to dividends, we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through gross share repurchases.
Let's now review our first quarter performance on a business-by-business basis. Please go to slide 10. Our Industrial
business group posted quarterly sales of $2.6 billion. First quarter organic growth in our Industrial business was down
1.9% with mid-single digit declines in the U.S. and Asia-Pacific. As mentioned earlier, the U.S. industrial production
index was down 1.3% in the first quarter, which impacted parts of our Industrial business.
Our Advanced Materials business declined low double-digits impacted by ongoing weakness in the Oil and Gas end
market. Conversely, our Automotive OEM business grew high single digits continuing its strong track record of

outpacing global car and light truck builds. We also posted positive organic growth in our Automotive Aftermarket
business in the quarter. The acquisition of Membrana, net of the Polyfoam divestiture, added 1.9% to Industrial sales
growth. We are pleased with the smooth integration of Membrana into 3M and the business continues to exceed its
financial performance objectives. Industrial increased its margins 150 basis points to 23.9%, posting operating income
of $617 million.
Please turn to slide 11. First quarter sales in Safety and Graphics were up 2.4% organically to $1.4 billion. Commercial
Solutions delivered solid organic growth with particular strength in Latin America and the U.S. Personal Safety, one of
our heartland businesses, also had a good quarter of organic growth led by EMEA and Asia-Pacific. Our Roofing
Granuals business also posted strong growth in the quarter. Acquisitions net of divestitures added 4.5 percentage points
to sales growth in the quarter. This results includes Capital Safety, along with the impact from the divestitures of
Library Systems and the license plate converting business in France.
Geographically, organic growth in Safety and Graphics was broad-based paced by a mid-single digit increase in
Asia-Pacific. Operating income for the business was $345 million and operating margins were a solid 24.5%.
Please turn to slide 12. Our Healthcare business delivered an outstanding quarter from top to bottom. The business
generated sales of $1.4 billion and led our company's organic growth at 6.2%. Growth was broad-based, with all
businesses and geographic areas up mid-single digits or greater year-on-year. Health Information Systems and Food
Safety both posted strong double digit growth in the quarter. And our Medical Consumables and Oral Care businesses
each delivered solid mid-single digit growth in Q1.
The Ivera Medical acquisition added 90 basis points to first quarter sales growth year-on-year. This business is
performing well and exceeding its financial performance objectives. Our Healthcare business delivered 13% organic
growth in developing markets in the quarter. With particular strength in China/Hong Kong, Mexico and Russia.
Operating income was $455 million, up 12% versus last year's first quarter, and margins were strong at 32.9%.
As you can see from this quarter's results, our Healthcare business continued its track record of strong performance.
And as Inge mentioned, we are increasing investments across the business to drive efficient growth into the future.
Next, let's cover Electronics and Energy on slide 13. First quarter sales in Electronics and Energy were $1.1 billion,
down 11.7% organically, and in line with what we communicated at our March Investor Day. On the Electronics side
of the business, organic sales were down 18%. The decline was due to a combination of factors including soft end
market demand, elevated channel inventory and a challenging year-on-year comparison. Our team remains focused on
increasing relevance with customers and driving spec-in wins to deliver organic growth as the industry improves.
Our Energy related businesses were down 1% organically with growth in electrical markets being offset by declines in
telcom as well as renewable energy. As a reminder, in last year's Q4, we took portfolio actions within the renewable
Energy business. These actions negatively impacted Q1 organic growth but have improved profitability in this
business.
Within Electrical markets, our ACCR overhead conductor business posted strong double digit growth. On a geographic
basis, organic growth was down double digits in Asia-Pacific where our Electronics business is concentrated. First
quarter operating income for Electronics and Energy was $208 million with margins of 18.2%, down 330 basis points,
largely volume related. Looking toward the full-year, we now expect Electronics and Energy to decline organically in
the low to mid-single digit range. As Inge mentioned, we are taking actions in the second quarter to further position the
business for long term success.
I'll finish with our Consumer business on slide 14. Consumer had another solid quarter with sales of $1 billion and
organic growth increasing 2.8% year-on-year. Sales grew organically in three of our four businesses led by Home
Improvement and Consumer Healthcare. Across the bottom of this slide, you see just a few of the market leading
brands that are powering our consumer portfolio. Within the Home Improvement business, our Command damage-free
mounting products posted strong double digit growth as accelerated investments continue to pay off. Scotch blue
painter's tape and Filtrete filters also delivered strong growth in the quarter.

Our Consumer Healthcare business posted solid first quarter organic growth, as the growing trend of active lifestyles
continued to drive strong demand for our Ace and Futuro braces and support products. Geographically, organic growth
was paced by Asia-Pacific, driven by double digit growth in China/Hong Kong along with solid mid-single digit
growth in the U.S. Operating income was $238 million with operating margins of 22.7%, both similar to last year's first
quarter.
On slide 15, we are reaffirming our 2016 planning estimates. We estimate earnings in the range of $8.10 to $8.45 per
share, an increase of 7% to 11% year-over-year. Organic growth is expected to be up 1% to 3% with acquisitions net of
divestitures adding 1% to sales. We estimate that foreign currency translation will reduce sales by 1% to 3%. Finally,
our tax rate is still expected to be 29.5% to 30.5% with free cash flow conversion in the range of 95% to 105%.
With that, I thank you for your attention and we will now take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with
your question.
<Q - Joseph Alfred Ritchie>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Joe.
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Good morning, Joe.
<Q - Joseph Alfred Ritchie>: Maybe just starting off on Electronics since that seemed to be like the biggest, I guess,
surprise in the quarter, or at least from our perspective. Can you talk a little bit about your expectations and the cadence
for the remainder of the year, particular in light of some of the commentary regarding slower smartphone shipments?
That's kind of the nearer term question, and the longer term question is, maybe we can talk about this in the context of
your portfolio. Inge, you've done a lot to restructure your portfolio since you took over. Just curious whether this is a
business you're going to continue to re-evaluate as we move forward?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Well, good morning, Joe. Well, first of all, it was a little bit – the slowest business for us in the
quarter – but not much of a surprise if you go back and think about our Investor Day when we talked about it in terms
of what we expected for the first quarter. Now, the Electronic part was down 18% which was – I would say is all based
on weak or near-term demand in terms of Consumer Electronics. So, from that perspective, not a surprise for us, but I
think as we look out for the next quarter, we have to expect in the second quarter mid-to-high single growth down and I
think for the year, low-to-mid single. So I think that's how we have to think about the business group.
And I would say that in terms of the portfolio, this is a very, very good business for us because we have all the
components in order for us to be competitive in this marketplace. And we have worked on that business in order to be
more relevant now for four years. And as you can see here in this quarter, we take some more actions in order to line up
our business model versus what is required in that business.
So I will say, first of all, all businesses, portfolio management is an ongoing process. We look upon that the whole
time. But the fundamentals for us to be in this business is very, very good and very, very strong. It's just that we have to
adjust as we go and on the fly. And I think that is what we are doing here again. But for me, and for us, it is more near
term weaker demand in Consumer Electronics as we speak.
<Q - Joseph Alfred Ritchie>: Okay. Fair enough. And maybe my second question and turning it to the Healthcare
group where you saw accelerating organic growth, the margin's now approaching 33%. Maybe talk a little bit about the
expectations for that business now. Have they been ratcheted up at all as we progress through the year? Should we start
thinking about this business as being a 32% to 33% type margin business moving forward?

<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Well, first of all, you were correct relative to the performance of Healthcare over many, many
years, right? This is a very good business for us and very solid fundamentals. And I think it's very much based on the
value creation for both providers and the patients in that market. We will – you saw this quarter again – very solid
organic local currency growth, margin expansion; and it is broad-based, it's both in developed and developing markets,
and it's in all businesses. And we will now continue to accelerate that investment as we move ahead.
So, it's not only Health Information systems that we decided to keep in our portfolio. We will invest in all the
businesses and as I laid out, it is around research and development. It's about health economics, and it's about
commercialization capabilities. Those three things in the combination is very, very powerful for us. And think about it
as well, in terms of developed versus developing. Our position is very strong in the developed world, and we continue
to take market share and we penetrate even deeper there.
In developing, the field start to open up for us, because key opinion leaders are recommending our protocols, including
our products around the world. So, we have a very strong position there, and you can think about this in terms of, our
fastest growing business with the highest margin, we are pleased with the margins, but we are not – we will accelerate
the investment there, to get growth up even further.
<Q - Joseph Alfred Ritchie>: Okay, great. Thanks, Inge.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions.
<Q - Julian Mitchell>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Julian.
<Q - Julian Mitchell>: Good morning. Just a question firstly on Industrial and Safety and Graphics, if you seen any
change in demand trend as you went through the quarter, in China and in developed markets?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Julian, good morning. For both China and in U.S. and in Europe, as the quarter went
on, we saw no discernible change in the trends. It was a pretty consistent performance throughout the quarter.
<Q - Julian Mitchell>: Got it. Thank you very much.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Just a comment on China. We saw, again, both Consumer and Healthcare with very solid
growth in China in this quarter. So that's, again, a good indication relative to what is happening in those markets, as
they are kind of expanding their businesses, specifically in China – they are not shifting, but they're expanding into
more domestic driven businesses – and we saw terrific growth, both in Consumer and Healthcare, in China.
<Q - Julian Mitchell>: Thanks. And then, just my second one would be on Electronics and Energy, if you're seeing
any price pressure there, or it's all just volume declines? And also, you talked about some portfolio changes recently.
Should we expect, therefore, that the Energy-related business could grow this year, actually, within that segment?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Julian, first on the price front. We haven't seen any change in the trajectory on pricing.
It's been pretty flat, as it was last year and into this year. No real changes on the pricing – selling price environment that
we're seeing on the Electronics side. In regards to portfolio movement actions, as I said, on the Energy side, we took a
portfolio action within our renewable energy business in the fourth quarter, which is having a negative impact on our
first quarter organic growth. That negative impact will continue throughout all four quarters of 2016, and it's
incorporated into our guidance for the total business and the company.
<Q - Julian Mitchell>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Thanks, and good morning, all.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Steven.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Could you maybe just talk a little bit about the pricing/raw material dynamic, in terms of
how that's – it's still huge, even though it is diminishing. What are your expectations for that going forward? And as
part of that, how much of that pricing was currency related this quarter?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Good morning, Steve. For the first quarter, the combination of price/raw materials, that
benefited our margin by 110 basis points. The vast majority of that coming from lower raw material prices. And on the
raw materials side, we are continuing to expect our tailwinds, driven by lower commodity prices, and with a heavier
weighting to the first half of the year than the second half.
Regarding selling prices, we have traditionally been able to achieve about 30 basis points of underlying price growth
when we strip out FX. We continue to see that as our capability, and we project that we'll be at that type of core price
growth in our company for the year. If I look at the price growth that we had in the first quarter of 90 basis points, all of
that came in our international operations, and the majority of that 90 basis points was in response to our pricing actions
in response to FX movements – the majority of that 90 basis points coming from FX reaction.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay. That is helpful. And then, in terms of the M&A that you've done, Capital Safety,
et cetera, what was the organic growth of those businesses? What were they achieving from an organic basis?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: On an organic basis? Well, first of all, I'll just level set the facts here, that – what
they're adding to 3M's total growth. Our total acquisitions before divestitures added 2.1% to 3M's growth, and our
divestitures reduced 3M's revenue by 50 basis points. So we had a net 160 basis points growth. Underlying that, within
our Capital Safety business organically, we continue to see strong revenue performance across the board for that
business, with the exception of the oil and gas market that the Capital Safety market serves. In our Membrana business,
that business continues to perform well, but from an organic basis, we typically start measuring the organic once we've
lapped ourselves 12 months after we acquire it, Steve.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: No, no. I know. I'm just looking for what the actual – what they're running at organically,
so that, when they do lap 12 months, which should be in the third quarter, how much it's going to add? That is what I'm
trying to get to.
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Low single digits would be our best estimate right now.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay. Fantastic. And if I could, just one last – given you guys are holding the 1% to 3%,
what are you actually taking up, since Electronics and Energy are down?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: We are not changing our guidance at this point in time.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Right. So there must be some other business that is higher, I guess?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah, correct.
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Yes, Steve, we continue to see our other four businesses solidly in the range that we
laid out in December, and they will help propel our company to the guidance we put out of 1% to 3%.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Fantastic. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: Hi. Good morning, guys.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Scott.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: Can you give us a sense – you talked about China a little bit – but can you walk around the
world and just talk about what is getting better or what's getting worse out there, geographically?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: I don't think, since we met at the Investor Day, that there have been any big changes in the
marketplaces, with maybe one slight exception, which is Europe/Middle/East Africa. I think that honestly was a little
bit of a surprise that we saw slightly better growth there than we had expected. I think that's the change from a material
perspective if you like, that have changed. That or on the positive side, because I think we have to look for positive
sides, is in Latin America, we continue very good growth in Mexico.
We were positive in Brazil as well. So I think Brazil then, by definition, is one country, I think, that is something that
we could see a change in. But more than that, I don't see any change. Central East Europe is doing well. West Europe
was, actually as I said, a slight surprise. Nothing changed in Asia. Nothing changed for us in United States either. So I
think it was very solid and no ups or downs in terms of – I think specifically – no negative that came at us as I see it.
There was some slight positives if you like.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: Okay. And I know this is hard to dial down to this kind of detail, but when you think about
the 150 basis points full year guide on margins, how much of that are you thinking is price/cost?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Price/raw materials, Scott, for the year, we have been expecting that to be 50 basis
points and we still see ourselves lining up closely with that.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: Okay. And just a quick one. Is your price now fully caught up to currency dislocations in
EM?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Yeah, going forward with where the dollar is right now, I think the majority of our
price increases due to FX are behind us, especially if the dollar stays where it is.

<Q - John G. Inch>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, John.
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Good morning, John.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Good morning, guys. Hey, Inge, your history of being able to raise pricing 30 basis points a year
may not help you much if these raw costs – metals, gas, oil – keep climbing the way they do. You put up very
impressive margins. I'm just – what's your playbook for offsetting a potential margin squeeze, if you could draw on
history and your own thoughts towards being able to raise pricing more than you have in your history to offset some of
these cost increases that seem to be about to hit us all?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Yeah, John, I'll take that one. The 30 basis points is when we look over a long period
of time of what our capability has been and it's been fairly sustainable. In times of commodity price increases, that
tends to go up slightly. In times of commodity price declines, that tends to go down. But it's a fairly constant within
3M.

To answer your question, John, I'd like to take you back to our Investor Day. As we look to the next few years of where
we'll be driving our efficient growth and potential for margin expansion, we're really driving many of our initiatives to
be able to do that. Our initiatives around business transformation, one of our key levers; actions we are taking with our
footprint to better optimize our efficiency and effectiveness of our manufacturing supply chain. That I see as the heart
of what we'll be doing in the coming years to continue our ability to grow efficiently, and part of that involves margin
expansion.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Okay. So you basically, Nick, are saying that it's highly probable you're going to get behind on
raw cost versus price increases, but there's just ample productivity within 3M and you're taking more restructuring
obviously in E&E, that you feel good about just being able to offset it? Is that kind of a...
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Yeah, I'm not – I think – I'm not ready to say, and I don't think it would be accurate to
say that we see ourselves flipping over to the negative on the price raws. But it has been a noticeable benefit to us for
the last two plus years. We're not planning for it to be as positive for us as it has been and we're relying more on other
productivity initiatives to fuel our efficiency and our growth.
<Q - John G. Inch>: That's fair. I'm just trying to get ahead of this. Second question is really on your own guidance
had – if I'm not mistaken – assumed the economy generally, loosely defined, I guess the Industrial economy was going
to meaningfully pick up in the second half. Your Industrial and E&E numbers are not showing that. Parker's numbers –
they're actually – their orders are worse. There is a very mixed reporting season in terms of the economy cadence,
right? China is good but I'm talking North America and other points. Inge, are you still holding to the fact that you
think numbers can get better in the second half? I realize you've got a lot of margin embedded, so I'm not so worried
about your numbers. I just want your commentary around your thoughts over the U.S. industrial economy.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah, we do. I think that we look upon our total portfolio, right? As I said earlier, this change
we see is the weak or near-term demand in Consumer Electronics, and maybe that will persist a little bit longer than we
thought. So if you take that as a given, that is the change I would say. But we see in Industrial that that model is still
working for us and we are sticking to the plan as we go for the year, and three of the other businesses will compensate
for what I will say a delay of the growth rate coming in the second part for Electronics part of our business.
So there is no change there and I don't see that change coming either, to be honest. I'm not seeing that as of yet. I see it
as a slight strength actually coming both for Safety and Graphics, Consumer and Healthcare. And Industrial stay very
much as we laid out, as we met the last time, and then it looked like there will be a little bit longer persistent in the
Consumer Electronic part as we thought just two months ago.
<Q - John G. Inch>: That's fair. In other words, Industrial flat and the other businesses are doing a little bit better.
Hey, one last thing. Nick, this accounting change you say you're basically going to offset with, I'm assuming, cash
repatriation of which you pay taxes. Does that like – can you give a sense of how that is going to break out over the
next three quarters? And if you don't do that, have you actually given yourself somewhat favorably a $0.10 tailwind?
Well, I guess it's the accounting change, but does the accounting change create a $0.10 tailwind heading into 2017
because you may not repatriate or whatever next year, so, that's just how the math works?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: John, a couple of points on that. As far as the actions we're taking to optimize our
global cash position, I don't want you to think of it as a one-time event. This is a continuation of ongoing efforts we do
in our company to efficiently and effectively manage our cash positions. And as you look at our balance sheet, our
amount of our global cash has been declining. And we are always looking for how we can move cash to improve our
efficiency and effectiveness as well as reduce the risk in holding that cash.
It's been an ongoing effort. We're going to continue to do it. It did give us an opportunity to take some actions in
repatriation, John, as part of that. In terms of setting up another $0.10 tailwind into 2017, I think that'd be going too far.
I think it continues to position us well for 2017, but I wouldn't think of it all as a tailwind going into 2017.
<Q - John G. Inch>: But is the $0.10 equally spread then over the next three quarters in your tax line, Nick?

<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Yes, John, it is. Over the next three quarters, we expect to average approximately a
31% tax rate. But as you know, and as you look at our results, there is fluctuation. Some quarters will be higher and
some lower, but over the next three quarters averaging around 31%.

Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz of Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Andrew Kaplowitz>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Andrew.
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Good morning, Andy.
<Q - Andrew Kaplowitz>: So if you look at your breakdown of price and you look at the U.S. pricing, you didn't get
any price in the U.S. this quarter. You got 0.6% last quarter and you've averaged that usual 30 to 50 basis points over
the last year and the U.S. Are you seeing any more competition in the U.S.? Is there any more of an issue in any
particular segment in the U.S.? Did something change that it might get tougher to get your usual 30 to 50 basis points in
the U.S.?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Yeah, Andy, I'll take that one. We're not seeing a big change. There are certain parts of
our business in the U.S. where we continue to face good competition and we react with price, but I would call those
pockets, not widespread. Sometimes with pricing, in particular in the U.S., we saw actions to capture more market
share and adjust pricing, and that's part of what is leading to that 0% that we posted in price in the U.S. for the first
quarter.
<Q - Andrew Kaplowitz>: Nick, do you think you could still average that 30 to 50 as you go over the next year?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Of underlying price capability?
<Q - Andrew Kaplowitz>: Yeah, in the U.S.
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: We still see the 30 basis points as a good reflection of our underlying capability there.
<Q - Andrew Kaplowitz>: Got it. And Inge, if I could ask you again about Safety and Graphics, it picked up nicely in
1Q in terms of growth versus 4Q, but we know you had a very difficult comp in 4Q. So, did you actually see a pickup
in Personal Safety or was it mostly just easier comps working their magic? And how do we look at this business going
forward?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah, no, we saw a pickup in Personal Safety. So, I think you have to look upon it in a couple
of ways. First of all, if you think about your position in the market, when you add an acquisition like Capital Safety,
you are strengthening your position big time in that whole Personal Safety space.
So I would say that, in my view, this is only the beginning of something big that will come for us. Because our
relevance in that whole Personal Safety segmentation has increased very, very much. And so I would say there is clear
evidence – was that we moved our positions forward and that we – so it's not based on easier comp only. That was an
easier comp but we can also see we start to take better positions, both for respirators and for non-fall protection.
<Q - Andrew Kaplowitz>: Inge, maybe it's better market share even than better market. Is that fair?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Sorry?
<Q - Andrew Kaplowitz>: Is it better market share, than improved market? Is that fair?

our other product portfolio is going with that. So we are becoming much stronger in that position totally. That – our

Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Deane Dray>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Deane.
<Q - Deane Dray>: For Nick, seeing that the dollar is now beginning to be less of a headwind for you guys, would you
consider changing or ramping back your hedging plans? I recall you had moved from a 12 month to a 24 month
hedging. Maybe that is not as required at this stage? Had you given that some thought?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Yeah, Deane, thanks for the question. Our – the short answer is, no. But a little longer
answer is, our hedging philosophy is meant to help us reduce some of our volatility and allow time for the businesses to
adjust to a sustained change in currencies. It's not to eliminate all the risks, and our objective there, we use oftentimes
natural hedges and when we can't do that, then we use financial hedges to offset some of that risk.
Our strategy of using hedging, and we hedge approximately 50% of that exposure; most currencies out one year and
then a few selected currencies out a second and third year. That philosophy isn't changing. We are going to continue to
do that and it really lines up with our philosophy of how we think about hedging over time to help take some of that
risk and give our businesses time to react.
<Q - Deane Dray>: Okay. That's helpful. And Nick, were there divestiture gains in the quarter?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Yes, there were. We divested of our Polyfoam business during the first quarter, and of
the $0.07 related to M&A, approximately one-half of that $0.07 was coming from gains on divestitures.
<Q - Deane Dray>: Got it. And then for the charge expected in the second quarter, that is all head count related. The
payback on that, what is the expected payback on that charge?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: We expect that charge to pay for itself by the end of this year.
<Q - Deane Dray>: And do you contemplate other actions in Electronics over the near term?

<Q - Nigel Coe>: Just a quick follow-up on – yeah, hi – just a quick follow on the $0.03, Nick, from gains. Where did
that land? Was that in the segments?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Nigel, the Polyfoam business is in our Industrial business, and that resulted in about
half, approximately, approaching half of, the $0.07 benefit that we saw for the total company. By the way, it was also
part of the overall guidance – when we guided for the year – that we expected $0.10 of benefits from M&A. The sale of
our Polyfoam business was included in that estimate.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. That's very clear. Thanks. And then, it seems a bit churlish to pick on Consumer margins, just
given the overall strength in margins, but they were down 20 bps and, given the tailwinds from pension and raws, it
does look – and I see this higher [ph] advertising and whatever (56:20), what – is there mix there? Is there pricing? Can
you maybe add a bit more color on Consumer margins this quarter?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Nigel, the primary thing you're seeing there is that we continue to see good
opportunities in our Consumer business, and we're investing for continued growth. So, it's some key investments that
we're choosing to make now that we think will propel this into even stronger position in the future.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. And then, I know you're not in the business of giving quarterly guidance, but your comments
around 1Q back in January were very helpful in getting our models rebalanced. I'm just wondering if maybe you could
add some color on 2Q, how you see organic sales developing in 2Q?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Yeah, for the second quarter, we do see organic growth being slightly better than what
we saw in Q1, for the total company. And we're also continuing to estimate that the second half is going to be stronger
than the first half. In particular, in Electronics and Energy, we're expecting that second-quarter organic growth is going
to be a decline in the mid to high single digits. So, it will go from approximately a 12% decline in the first quarter to a
mid-to-high single digit decline in the second quarter. And then for the year, we're expecting Electronics and Energy to
be down low-to-mid single digits.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks.

<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Good morning, Jeff.
<Q - Jeffrey T. Sprague>: Good morning. Just a couple of really quick ones. Just on tax planning, Nick, obviously
you've had an aspiration to drive your tax rate down. My sense is a lot of that has been the [indiscernible] (58:17) other
thing. But is there anything in what the Treasury recently pronounced that kind of thwarts your ambitions to bring the
tax rate down over the next couple of years?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Jeff, no, the recent actions being taken there do not thwart our efforts to bring us to a
27% tax rate by 2020. We're continuing to evaluate those proposals and the impact they could have on 3M, but we don't
contemplate that they would have a material impact on us at this time.
<Q - Jeffrey T. Sprague>: And then just a quick one on Healthcare. Was R&D actually up in the quarter? I ask that, in
that R&D was actually down overall for the company. So the comments about increased investment, is that more about
ambition and outlook for the rest of the year, or is R&D actually moving up in Healthcare in the first quarter?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: First of all, when we say we will accelerate our investments in terms of both R&D, health
economics, and commercialization, that is when we move forward. Our intent on the company level, in order to

Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan of UBS. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Hey, Inge, Healthcare and Consumer are two businesses you've been trying to grow
more in developing markets from their historic position. You highlighted both the growth and developing markets for
both in this quarter. I'm just wondering if you feel like you're reaching some kind of a tipping point there? Or maybe
just a little bit of what you're seeing going on there?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Tipping point in terms of more growth coming?
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: In terms of more developing market traction for Consumer and Healthcare?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah. Yeah, I think both are strengthening their positions, and the way we should think about
this is, in terms of the acceleration of growth, by definition, will go faster in Healthcare than in Consumer. And the
reason for that is, everything you have to do around brand equity in Consumer take a little bit longer time. So, when
you compare the two of them, we will see a faster acceleration for Healthcare versus Consumer. But both of them are
growing very, very well.
And I will not say that, in terms of outcome, yeah, we see both of them coming stronger now than versus a year ago,
but we have been on these for quite some time. And it's often realization of change of brand equity position for
Consumer, and then it's a question about the money availability for Healthcare. So our solutions are very advanced, and
is very much driven based on health economics. And as countries get bigger budgets, they can spend more into
Healthcare, they are shifting from less advanced solution to solutions like 3M can provide.
So, that's what we believe, that both Healthcare and Consumer has a great future for us in that part of the world. And as
you look upon our mix, those are also two of our businesses that – the mix in the portfolio – we have less penetration
and less sales in developing versus developed markets for those two businesses. So the future look good. It's up to us
now to execute and do that as fast as possible.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay, great. And just maybe some comments on what the M&A pipeline looks like,
and should we expect anything of size this year?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: It looks good. All business groups have a good pipeline. We are constantly looking into that. I
will say that, when you think about what we have done, the last year that you saw we did fewer, but more sizeable
versus the past, and they are strategically relative to our portfolio. That is what you should expect from 3M going
forward.

<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Steve.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: So thanks for the revenue color on the second quarter there. I guess the moving parts
kind of sequentially with tax going up obviously and then you have the charge which is going to flow through
Electronics and Energy. So, normal seasonality would get you to something in kind of the $2.10 to $2.15 range. I
would assume that these items bring you perhaps a little bit lower than that, given what you pulled into the first quarter.
Is that kind of the right way to think about it? And then, just the margin – year-over-year margin – I guess another way
to ask the question would be, what are the major differences in the year-over-year margin bridge given that utilization
and others should probably still be with you. You have the extra restructuring. Just maybe a little bit of color on the
bottom line dynamics to help size us for the second quarter?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Okay. So for the second quarter – Steve, I've shared much about the second quarter
already, I'd say – about what we're expecting for total growth in Electronics and Energy. You noted the charge we're
taking in Electronics and Energy business. I think the only other thing on the margin I'll point out is Corporate and
Unallocated. I have guided that we expect that to be between $150 million and $200 million for the year, first quarter
right in line with that. As we look at the seasonality – we expect of Corporate and Unallocated for the year – we think
that will stay right in that range. I do see Q2 as the highest quarter for our expense we'll be incurring in Corporate and
Unallocated, and then moderating going into Q3 and Q4.
In regards to margin, for Q2, as I look to Q2 and for the total year, Steve, FX and raw materials are a couple of things
that are a little better than how we started the year thinking. And I see those partially offsetting what we're seeing from
lower utilization of our Electronics and Industrial assets in the first half of the year.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Okay. So year-over-year, a little bit of a better lift on margins in the second quarter is
what you're saying?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: As I look at our total guidance for the year, we expect margins up about 150 basis
points. We were at 130 in the first quarter. As I look across the whole year, fourth quarter is, Steve, where we expect
the most margin expansion, where we had the restructuring charge in fourth quarter of last year. The second and third
quarter I would put below the mean for the year for margin expansion.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Below the mean for the year. Okay. I got it. So can you get to – I mean, I think I'm kind
of walking these moving parts down. I mean, it seems like there's something roughly around $2? Is that kind of the
right area for you guys?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Yeah, Steve, we give guidance for the year. $8.10 to $8.45 is the right guidance for the
year. I'm not going to try to guide the EPS for the quarter.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Okay. I had to try. Thanks a lot.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Thank you, Steve.

Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Laurence Alexander>: Good morning.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Laurence.
<Q - Laurence Alexander>: I guess two longer-term questions on the Electronics and Energy segment. Are you happy
with the prospects for accelerating growth through better R&D the same way as you expressed on Healthcare? And

then related to that, as you look at the longer term strategic options for those businesses, are your options constrained
by the degree to which your R&D backbone across the business is integrated, so that you don't want certain IP to exit
the company that might affect the other segments?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Well, let's start with the first question. And in a way, they are maybe related, right. So you're
talking about research and development investment into that business and so forth. The advantage in that business is if
you think about the Electronics, very much of that is spec-ins. So we work direct with our customers in order to make
sure we find solutions for them. That's actually a very powerful model if you think about it. So we have two processes
in the company. One called Idea to Innovation, I-to-I, which is more for consumables, and then you have customer
inspired innovation that which is a model where you work direct with one specific customer. So if that is in Aerospace,
that is in Automotive, if that's Consumer Electronics, or wherever that is, it's right into one specific customer.
The strength of that model is that you know exactly the outcome of that model. You don't work on something that is
broad-based from the market perspective that eventually will take place. You know it will take place in this
customer-inspired innovation. And if you don't come to a solution, you kill it very early. So, I'm very confident in that
model. And that is why that is a very good business for 3M because we can provide through our technology platforms,
multiple solutions that will generate better and more competitive products for our customers. So also to that, is very
confident in the research and development into that model. And we can adjust, of course, based on what they are
requiring. So that's an important element on the Electronics side.
On the Energy side, it's a model like we are using in normal Industrial production or in Consumer, et cetera, where you
have a big market space that you need to serve and where you use or get the input from customer panels, et cetera. So,
the business is always built on research and development, and that is the heartbeat of 3M. That is also why we are able
to generate very good returns to our investors because we are not commoditized. We don't work with those customers
in order to replace something that is already in their devices today. We try to move it to the next level together with
them. That is the power of it.
<Q - Laurence Alexander>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Thank you.
Operator
That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Inge
Thulin for some closing comments.
Inge G. Thulin
To wrap up, we had a strong start to the year, highlighted by good earnings, margins and cash flow. Going forward, we
will continue to execute the 3M playbook to drive efficient growth and create even greater value for customers and
shareholders.
Thank you for joining us and we look forward to talking to you very soon. Have a great day.
