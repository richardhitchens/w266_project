Thanks, Dexter, and good morning. In 2014, we delivered solid results even as we faced headwinds in the broader
environment. We made good progress on our transformation agenda, especially in our supply chain and in overheads.
Of course, we also announced our coffee joint venture, which we expect to close later this year.
As we enter 2015, we'll continue to focus on what we can control, reducing costs, pricing to protect profitability and
driving power brands and innovation platforms in key markets. In addition, we're taking some specific actions to exit
lower-margin revenues to improve our mix.
Overall, I'm quite confident in our ability to execute our plans, achieve our strategic objectives and continue to deliver
solid returns to our shareholders.
Turning to the specifics for 2014, we generated strong earnings growth and margin expansion in a challenging
environment by driving record net productivity and aggressively reducing overheads. On the top-line, we delivered
organic net revenue consistent with our latest outlook as we raised prices to recover higher input costs and protect
profitability while continuing to invest in our growth platforms.
Specifically, for the full year, organic net revenue was up 2.4%. Adjusted operating income margin increased 80 basis
points to 12.9%. That was in line with our guidance of about 13%, despite absorbing a 50 basis point headwind from
the timing of mark-to-market accounting.
Adjusted EPS was $1.76 for the year, up 23% on a constant currency basis. And the source of this growth was high
quality, driven mostly by operating gains. In light of a still challenging macroeconomic environment, consumer
confidence and spending weakened in many of our key markets, while competition among food retailers was intense,
especially in Europe. We faced significantly higher prices for key commodities like cocoa and coffee. And this
inflation was magnified by local currency devaluation, especially late in the year. In response, we quickly priced across
our portfolio to offset the input cost inflation and to protect profitability. As a result, pricing was the key driver of our
revenue, contributing 4.5 percentage points for the year.
Looking more closely at the sources of growth last year, emerging markets were up 7% with Brazil, Russia and India
all increasing double digits. Developed markets were down modestly. This reflected the temporary effects of
pricing-related customer disputes in Europe that we talked about last quarter as well as increased trade investments in
North America.
Let's take a more detailed look at full year top-line results in each of our regions. Latin America grew 15%, driven by
pricing gains, especially in the inflationary economies of Venezuela and Argentina. Brazil was up double digits,
including solid growth in all of our categories. EEMEA grew 6.5%, driven by higher pricing and modest growth in
vol/mix. Russia increased double digits. Vol/mix continued to improve, contributing more than a third of our growth
there.
I'm very pleased with the performance of our team in Russia who have consistently delivered strong results over the
past couple of years. However, given the recent currency devaluation and deteriorating macroeconomic situation, we
expect growth and profitability in Russia to be somewhat more challenging in 2015. I'd also like to acknowledge our
team in Ukraine who delivered organic revenue that was essentially flat despite operating in a most difficult
environment.
Continuing with our region performance, Asia Pacific declined 2.8%, as higher pricing was more than offset by lower
vol/mix. China was down mid-single digits for the full year due to the continued softness in biscuits, but we're now
beginning to see some signs of recovery.
India delivered another year of double-digit growth. But industry-wide price increases in chocolate tempered category
growth in the fourth quarter. In the near term, we expect this trend to continue until consumers adapt to the new pricing
levels. North America was up nearly 1% for the year, reflecting slower growth in biscuits as the category softened as
well as increased competition in the fourth quarter especially in crackers. We've stepped up our brand and trade

investments accordingly. And we're pleased to see signs of category recovery in the recent biscuit data. We expect
growth to accelerate in early 2015.
In Europe, organic revenue was down 1% for the year. While pricing was up nearly 1.5 points, vol/mix fell as a result
of a number of factors including: lower category growth, as consumer demand softened in the weaker macro
environment; pricing-related elasticity; and pricing-related customer disruptions, especially in France. Finally, in
Europe, after more than a year of headwinds, coffee turned into a tailwind in the fourth quarter, contributing over 2
points of growth as we priced to offset higher green costs.
Turning now to our categories. For the full year, snacks grew just under 4%, and our global categories grew about
3.5%. Importantly, growth rates softened somewhat in the back half, and we anticipate this trend will continue in 2015.
Biscuits remained the strongest of our snacks categories, up about 5% worldwide. And while the reset of our China
business held our revenue growth below that of the total category, we made good progress on our biscuits portfolio.
Oreo led the way. Globally it grew high single digits and exceeded $2.5 billion in sales, driven by new product
innovations such as Oreo Thins in China as well as new package formats such as family size in the U.S. After its first
full year in Brazil, Oreo has already achieved more than a 2.5 share, while in Europe it continued to grow at a
double-digit rate up more than 25%.
Like Oreo, our belVita Breakfast Biscuits platform also grew strongly, up nearly 30% topping $650 million in global
revenues. Innovation here also played a key role. Our new soft baked line drove over 50% growth for belVita in the
U.S., while belVita Crunchy which we launched last spring in several European markets is off to a good start. In
chocolate, the impact of higher prices to offset rising cocoa and dairy costs and the effect of weakening emerging
market currencies tempered global category growth to below 4%.
As we've discussed in prior earnings calls, our decision to increase prices globally resulted in soft volume and share
performance as some competitors either lagged, predominantly in emerging markets, or did not price at all, as was the
case in parts of Europe. We believe that all of our competitors will eventually raise prices given that they're facing the
same input cost pressures we are. Ultimately, as the price dislocation moderates, innovation is key to regaining
momentum in the chocolate category, and we've built solid platforms to accomplish that.
For example, we continued to expand Marvellous Creations, our chunky chocolate filled with fun things like candy
pieces and jelly beans, and we've expanded that into new markets like Canada and Russia, driving incremental growth.
We also recently launched Cadbury Glow, a new premium gifting chocolate brand in India, Singapore and Hong Kong.
Initial results have been strong, already reaching 13% of the Indian chocolate gifting segment last quarter.
Finally, the gum and candy category grew about 2% for the year. Our revenue was down about 3% due to the
implementation of a sugar tax in Mexico where we have an 80 share, government restrictions on gum imports in
Venezuela, and the customer disputes in France. However, we grew or held share in four of our top six gum markets,
including the U.S., Japan, Brazil and China, driven by improved price pack architecture and a focus on freshness. China
is now the second largest gum market in the world, and our growth continued to be robust, up nearly 50% last year,
benefiting from the launch of Stride bottles and Stride layers.
So as you can see, we're taking the necessary steps to ensure the long-term health of our business. We're pricing to
protect profitability and aggressively reducing costs, so that we can continue to invest in our franchises to drive
sustainable top tier returns for our shareholders.
With that, let me turn it over to Brian.
Brian T. Gladden
Thanks, Irene. Good morning, everyone. Over the next few slides starting with slide 7, I'll walk you through our 2014
margin and EPS progress as well as our outlook for 2015. Adjusted gross margin decreased 60 basis points to 36.8%
with 50 points of the decline attributable to the timing of the mark-to-market accounting for commodity and currency
hedges.

Over the course of the year, we successfully executed pricing of $1.6 billion. While this high level of pricing was
enough to fully offset significant commodity and currency related cost inflation on a dollar basis, it wasn't enough to
offset the impact of inflation on our margin percentage.
We were able to essentially maintain gross margins excluding the mark-to-market impact, by delivering 2.8% net
productivity, totaling more than $600 million. That's a record for the company and a testament to the strong work
delivered by our integrated supply chain team.
As Irene noted, our adjusted OI margin increased 80 basis points to 12.9%, in line with our guidance of approximately
13%. Excluding the 50 basis point mark-to-market impact, our underlying margin improvement was actually 130 basis
points. Lower overheads drove more than half of this improvement as we aggressively reduced expenses by leveraging
zero based budgeting and other cost saving tools.
In addition, we expanded margins by driving efficiencies in the nonworking elements of our media spend, including
significantly consolidating suppliers. We also reduced production costs as we shifted more advertising to digital outlets.
To be clear, we maintained our working media support and increased our overall A&C spending on our Power Brands
and innovation platforms. As we move through 2015, securing additional cost reductions will be a key focus and an
important backstop to our plan.
Looking at performance by region, you'll see that developed markets drove much of the margin expansion. In North
America, adjusted OI margin increased 140 basis points despite absorbing the start-up costs of our newest greenfield
biscuit plant in Salinas, Mexico. We'll begin to realize the margin benefits from that plant as we ramp up production
later in the year.
In Europe, adjusted OI margin expanded 170 basis points as our overhead reduction and supply chain reinvention
programs continued to pay dividends. Also worth mentioning is the impact of Latin America, where margins grew 200
basis points. Our cost programs drove about half of this margin improvement, while the other half related to one-time
items.
Turning to earnings per share on slide 10. Operating gains were the primary driver of our EPS growth. Adjusted EPS
for the full year was $1.76, up 23% on a constant currency basis. Operating gains, excluding mark-to-market,
accounted for $0.26 of this improvement. Our debt refinancing delivered $0.08 of EPS growth, and our lower share
count contributed another $0.08. Even after accounting for the $0.14 negative impact of currency translation, adjusted
EPS was up more than 14% for the year.
Cash flow has been another area of strong performance. Over the past two years, we delivered $4.8 billion of free cash
flow, excluding items. That's nearly 30% higher than our two-year guidance of $3.7 billion.
Strong improvement in working capital has been the primary driver. We've shortened our cash conversion cycle by 10
days, which comes on top of a 13-day improvement in the prior year. With our strong cash performance, we were able
to return $2.9 billion in cash to shareholders last year. We repurchased $1.9 billion of shares, which is at the upper end
of our $1 billion to $2 billion annual target. We also raised our dividend by 7% for a total payout of $1 billion.
Turning to slide 12. I'm not going to cover this slide in detail, but it's safe to say that the external operating environment
continues to be challenging and volatile, whether it's slow GDP growth, weak consumer demand or a difficult retailer
environment. And given our strong global footprint, an uncontrollable variable like the strengthening in the U.S. dollar
is especially challenging. Of course, there are a number of positive factors that will partially offset these headwinds
both in 2015 and over the long term, including the continuing trend towards increased snacking and on-the-go
consumer dynamics.
Within this challenging environment, we're focusing on what we can control and executing our transformation agenda.
With respect to our portfolio, as Irene mentioned, we continue to expect the coffee deal to close this year. On a much
smaller scale, we anticipate closing and integrating our recent acquisition of the Kinh Do snacks business in Vietnam
later this year.

We're also working to improve our revenue mix by moving away from some low-margin revenue. Specifically, we've
made deliberate decisions to exit non-strategic and margin-dilutive revenue, which will temper our organic revenue
growth by about 100 basis points this year. Examples of these decisions include; exiting certain customers in Europe
who've chosen not to accept our price increases, discontinuing certain low-margin products that were sold under
short-term trademark licenses from Kraft Foods Group and pruning some SKUs so we can simplify our supply chain
and focus our investments on our growth platforms.
2015 is also a year of continued intense focus on cost in both our supply chain and overheads as we progress towards
our margin expansion goals. We'll also continue to invest in our Power Brands and routes to market for future growth.
We're excited by the longer-term prospects of accelerated growth, faster decision-making and cost savings as we shift
to a category-led model in all of our regions.
So let's talk about how all this translates to our outlook for 2015. We expect organic revenue to grow at least 2%. As
mentioned earlier, we see overall category growth rates remaining consistent with or even somewhat below 2014. That
is, we anticipate our global categories will grow at least 3% in aggregate. In 2015, we expect to continue to prioritize
margin improvements, which will impact our net revenue growth and market share. Now although it's not part of
organic growth, I'd like to provide some perspective on the potential impact of foreign currency translation on our
revenue.
Based on January 30 spot rates, we estimate currency would be about a 11 percentage point headwind to our revenue
growth. Obviously that's a big number, but remember that 80% of our revenue is based in markets where the currencies
are not tied to the strengthening U.S. dollar. So while we anticipate our reported revenue will decline due to the
significant currency translation impact, we expect to deliver solid organic growth in a challenging macroeconomic
environment.
Let me now turn to our margin outlook. In 2015, we expect to deliver adjusted OI margin of approximately 14%,
another significant step towards our margin goal of 15% to 16% in 2016. The continued execution of both our supply
chain re-invention and overhead reduction initiatives will be key drivers of the margin expansion. We expect the
savings from these programs to build throughout the year.
Moving on to EPS. We expect adjusted EPS to grow double-digits on a constant currency basis, which would be our
third year in a row of double digit EPS growth. Organic revenue growth and OI margin expansion will be the main
drivers. In addition, we expect our adjusted interest expense to be about $825 million given our current weighted
average interest rate of about 4.5% plus other financing costs. We expect our adjusted tax rate to be in the high teens
for 2015, slightly higher than the 16% we saw in 2014. And finally we expect to repurchase between $1 billion and $2
billion of shares.
Let me point out again that our EPS guidance is on a constant currency basis, but since currency will be such a big
headwind in our GAAP reported results at the end of the year, I'd like to provide a bit of detail on that now. As I
mentioned previously, 80% of our revenue is derived from currencies not tied to the U.S. dollar. This exposure to
growth markets is typically a strength of our business model, and I believe it will be over the long-term. However, most
of these currencies have been devaluing versus the dollar over the last few months, resulting in a significant currency
translation headwind.
On slide 17, you can see the potential impact. We estimate adjusted EPS would be approximately $0.30 lower than our
constant currency results based on January 30 spot rates. While we do business in many currencies, the lion's share of
the headwind comes from the euro, the British pound, the Russian ruble and the Brazilian real.
So to summarize our 2015 outlook, we expect organic net revenue to be at least 2%, including a 1 point headwind from
our strategic decisions to exit low margin revenue. We anticipate adjusted OI margin of approximately 14% and double
digit growth in adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis. Please note that since we don't have a precise closing date
for the coffee deal, our 2015 outlook includes the full year results for the coffee business. We'll update our 2015
outlook for the impact of the coffee divestiture as we get more clarity on the closing date.

So to wrap up, in 2014, we delivered strong earnings growth and margin expansion despite the challenging consumer
and retail environment. While we expect the environment to remain difficult in 2015, we'll continue to prioritize margin
improvements while delivering modest revenue growth, focus on executing the cost reduction initiatives under our
control, and make the necessary foundational investments in our brands, innovation platforms, routes to market, and
supply chain to stage the portfolio for the future.
We remain confident in our ability to execute our transformation agenda so that we're well positioned to deliver
sustainable profitable growth and generate top tier shareholder returns now and over the long-term.
With that, let's open it up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Chris Growe of Stifel.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi. Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Hey, Chris.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi. Just if I could ask two questions of you, Irene. First off will be, as you've seen the
softer growth in the developed markets and particular in North America and Europe, does that have any – is that having
any effect on your margin outlook for those businesses? It looks like you've got a pretty strong margin still built in here
in 2015, but is this slower growth rate have any effect on your future margin projections, if I could ask that?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: No. I actually think without a doubt we are making some near term prioritization in both of
those geographies for margin. But I feel quite comfortable that with the guidance that we're giving to you, that we've
made some reasonable expectations about where we expect the revenue to fall out. There's no question in Europe, in
particular, we are experiencing some short-term headwinds as consumers and customers adapt to the new prices. I
expect that that will improve as the year progresses in both Europe and in North America, as I mentioned, we certainly
are experiencing some category slowdown. We're taking a number of actions to improve that, both from the marketing
as well as some trade investments, and we're starting to see the benefits of those investments. So net-net, I'm quite
confident that we will deliver the revenue that we need in both of those geographies consistent with the margin
expectations that we've set.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. And then just if I could ask one other question on ZBB and the implementation
of that program, I'm just curious if you can give us the kind of experience for 2014, and then perhaps the progress you
made against overhead, in particular, with that program in 2014?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah, Chris, it's Brian. There was really the start-up this year of ZBB, but as you look at the
overhead reductions, 90 basis point improvement year-over-year, it really was a big contributor. So, a lot of focus on
key categories of cost and indirect spending where we changed policies, moved to best practices that we learned in that
process. And as we've built the plans for 2015, we really did use a ZBB-based process to build the operating plans. So I
would say we're still in the early days. It'll be a big contributor as we look at 2015 and into 2016 using that tool. But
good progress so far.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. Thanks for the update.

<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Hi.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Hey, Andrew.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Two questions from me. First off, as we think about the margin cadence as we go through 2015,
you've said that it'll be stronger in the back half. Trying to get a sense of how the first half, you expect it to play out?
Do we see year-over-year margin improvement just at a slower pace in the first half? Or are there certain things that
challenge margins in the first half that makes, the two half have to be even stronger to get to that about 14% for the full
year? Just trying to get a sense of how realistic that is and what you've kind of built in, in terms of visibility.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah. The goals that we're providing are for the full year. I would tell you as we look at
some really critical drivers, supply chain improvements, the overhead reductions, even the pricing, frankly, these are
dynamics that will cause margins to accelerate through the year. Those benefits are more back-end loaded, just given
the execution and as we work through, for instance, the start-up of the Mexico plant. That will drive benefits
significantly higher in the second half than in the first half. So, not getting into specifics around quarterly trajectory or
margin targets by quarter, but it will be more back-end loaded.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Okay. And then you mentioned – I think as you've mentioned before, 2015 is a year of sort of
maximum change for the organization. You've got the coffee JV, implementing ZBB in a bigger way, the category-led
model in Europe, the ongoing issues around Western Europe and retailers and pricing and such. So, again, trying to get
a sense – 2014 obviously shows a lot of progress towards your two-year margin goal, and I'm trying to get a sense of –
are you giving, is the organization giving itself enough cover, if you will, for certain things that are inevitably likely to
go awry just during the course of the year with all these big changes that you've got?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah. Look, I think we as a team spent a lot of time on building the plan. As you point out,
clearly some pieces moving around as you think about the year. But this is a reasonable plan that I think we've worked
hard to build confidence and backstops around this commitment. So, there is clearly some pieces moving around. It's a
relatively volatile environment. But, as I said, there's things that we can control and we're working extra hard on those
things to make sure we have offsets and backstops to allow us to deliver this commitment.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Thanks very much.
Operator
Your next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Hey. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Hi.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Hey, Bryan.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: I wanted to ask a follow up, I guess, to Andrew's question. And it's just – I guess if you go
through the – assuming the 14% margin goal for 2015, I guess two questions. One, in terms of FX effect on operating
profit, the spread – there's been a bit of a spread between the effect on revenues and operating profit. Should we expect
that to continue in 2015?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: I think similar dynamics will continue to play out. As you think about transactional
exposures, clearly we work hard through hedging programs as well as our efforts on pricing and cost reductions in the
regions to drive consistency of execution there. It is a volatile environment. We have a hedge program that's designed
to provide some cushion, allow us to get prices in place. But we feel like that's what we've been doing, and we'll
continue to execute that.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Okay. And then just assuming that there's some modest spread, if you kind of back into a
current – what the 14% margin implies currency neutral, it's like a mid teens currency neutral EBIT growth against a

2% organic sales growth. So I guess the question is just in that bridge, which is, I guess, roughly about $700 million of
currency neutral profit growth, how much of it is hard savings versus things that might be variable depending upon, I
don't know, mix or volume leverage or those types of things? Just trying to get a sense for how much of that margin
target is really tied to some fixed savings versus things that might be variable?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah. Not really going to parse that in detail. I would tell you that it's a – this is a supply
chain reinvention, ZBB overhead reduction driven plan. That's what you saw in 2014 and I think that's what you'll
continue to see in 2015.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Yeah, I just want to build on that, Bryan. We are very focused on what we can control in
this environment. And so, we have high confidence that the commitments we're giving to you are some things that we
have a clear line of sight to. And we've built our revenue, we think, in a reasonable fashion given the realities of the
market. And we've got clear visibility to the programming that will drive the margin expansion. So net-net it is a
challenging environment, but we are very focused on making sure that we've got in hand what we can control to drive
our commitments.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: If the $500 million of annual COGS productivity that you outlined last year at CAGNY still
part of the plan or is that changed?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Well, that productivity in 2014 was actually closer to $600 million. It was a record for the
company at 2.8%. And I would tell you given all the activities around supply chain that will continue to accelerate.
That's a big part of what we're focused on.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: All right. That's very helpful. Thank you.

Your next question comes from David Driscoll of Citi Research.
<Q - David Cristopher Driscoll>: Great. Thank you, and good morning.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: David.
<Q - David Cristopher Driscoll>: Irene, if Mondelez grew organic revenues 2.4% in 2014, can you just go back over
why you would expect 3% net organic growth in 2015? So I'm just looking at that chart and excluding the 1 point that
you'll take out from things you want to discontinue, the underlying number is 3% and that's an acceleration over the
2.4%. But I think what everybody hears on this call is just how difficult these Emerging Markets are and even some
difficulties in your developed markets, Europe for instance, why did it accelerate?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Well, if you think about it, David, we saw an acceleration even in the course of last year.
We took pricing early in the year. As we shared with you, we led pricing in all of our categories. And so the impact of
that pricing plays out differently in each of the regions and differently over the course of time. And so, the good news
is, in many of our Emerging Markets we've now seen those price gaps start to narrow. As I mentioned, Europe remains
particularly in chocolate one of the regions where those gaps are still bigger than we'd like them to be. But the reason
for the acceleration in the underlying growth is simply that as consumers adjust to these higher price points, as our
customers particularly in Europe, reflect these higher price points, we expect that the market will be in – it will move
into more of a position of equilibrium.
<Q - David Cristopher Driscoll>: And then following up on your European chocolate questions, when we get our
Nielsen data, the 12-week numbers show double digit declines in Mondelez's European chocolate volumes. You
mentioned a little bit of this in your prepared script, but can you talk more detail about what's going on right there?
Why aren't these competitors following? And it's been going on now for like six months. So I'm a little concerned that
you might be forced to retract your pricing either through a list or promotional event. Can you just talk about some of
those issues and what you see happening in 2015?

<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Yeah. No, again, it's – there's no question that our gaps in Europe are wider than we'd like
them to be. I do believe it's a question of timing. And so, again, we feel quite confident with the programming that
we've got. We're starting to see some good recovery to more of a normal state in a number of our key markets. And
we're going to stay the course. We've got very strong brands, and we believe that they have the pricing power and we
just need to take some time for the gaps to narrow a little bit and for the competition to catch up. But, we're quite
confident that, given that they're facing the very same cost headwinds that we are, that the market will get back into
more equilibrium in the foreseeable future. But, again, it's one of the reasons that we're suggesting that our profile will
improve as the year progresses.

Your next question comes from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan.
<Q - Kenneth B. Goldman>: Hi. Thanks for the question. So you're guiding to double digit EPS growth ex currency,
which is where you usually guide, but still leaves a pretty wide range of possibilities. And when you talk about a 14%
approximate EBIT margin, one of the questions I'm getting is, does that mean it could possibly range between 13.5%
and 14.5%? So if possible, even if just on a qualitative level, could you help narrow those ranges down a little bit, both
in terms of, I guess, organic EPS and reported EBIT margin?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Look, I think it's – what you're suggesting is wider than we would expect. The reality is
there's – it's a volatile environment, and we want to be a little bit careful and give ourselves a little bit of room here. But
those are sort of the numbers that I think we meant to say, and you can interpret them how you like.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: But again...
<Q - Kenneth B. Goldman>: Okay.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: We know what about 14% looks like, and we know what a double digit growth rate is. So
you can trust us that we're not kidding.
<Q - Kenneth B. Goldman>: No, I appreciate that. You can understand from our perspective, though, why it's just
tougher to model. But I understand where you're coming from. And then, Brian, at last year's CAGNY, Dave said we
should model about a 20% tax rate for the next three to five years, then mid-20%s after that. I realize you're guiding to
a high teen tax rate for 2015. But just longer term, is that outlook in general still reasonable for us to use in your view,
as we look ahead?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah. Look, I think over the midterm, the next couple years, 20% is a good number to the
extent we're somewhat below that for 2015. It's sort of acknowledging some expected discretes and some things that we
know about in 2015. But 20% is about the right rate for the next two to three years.
<Q - Kenneth B. Goldman>: And then you would agree that it maybe jumps up by a few percentage points after that?
<A - Dexter Congbalay>: Creep up.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: That's likely right, yeah. I wouldn't say jump, probably creeps up after that.
<Q - Kenneth B. Goldman>: Okay. Great. Thanks very much.

Your next question comes from Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Matthew.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Hey, Matthew.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Hi. Thanks. Brian, I guess first, one of the sources of cost savings in 2014 was a focus
on A&C efficiency and reductions in nonworking media. And just wondering is this a source of savings that you think
can be a continued tailwind this year? And then in a broader sense, including working advertising, can you give us an
idea of how you expect A&C to trend in 2015?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah. Look, I think the team's done a really good job in managing the spend. We made some
great progress in driving productivity in the spend around nonworking, consolidating media counts and reducing the
spending and driving productivity, and then moving more to digital. So all of these elements I think gave us some
flexibility to take the spend down a bit, but also to continue to get value from the spend. We actually increased our
spending on A&C around our Power Brands last year. And we're able to reduce spending in other parts that allowed us
to actually get some good momentum there. So I think you'll see us continue to focus the spend in the right places, and
as we see progress throughout the year, we'd like to see that increase actually. So, good progress in terms of getting
productivity and allowing us to spend those dollars on real working media.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay. Great. Thanks, Brian. And, Irene, could you elaborate a little bit on your
comments earlier on the sales outlook in North America? You talked about trade programs you have in place and a
re-acceleration, and we've seen this start to become more visible in scanner data as well. So is your optimism really a
function of improved share trends in an environment that's still highly competitive and challenging, or are you seeing a
moderation in the competitive intensity within your categories overall?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Actually our share performance has actually been quite strong, and we expect that to
continue. What actually is encouraging, we're starting to see the category recover a little bit. So, we've had an
incredible run in North America, particularly on our biscuit business, we've been growing 4% to 5% well in excess of
the category trends over the last couple of years. As we saw in the back half of last year, we started to see a slowdown,
and we're just basically going to continue to push the levers that had been so successful for us. We have the strong
innovation plan. We're continuing to leverage our DSD muscle and we believe that those together we started to see
some recovery. You're seeing it in the numbers as well. And we believe that that will continue into 2015.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay. Great. Thank you both.

Your next question comes from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse.
<Q - Robert B. Moskow>: Hi. Thank you. I was hoping like others on the call to get a little more color on the behavior
of your competition in Europe. Is most of your competition and share losses coming at the expense of multinationals
who have not raised price yet in chocolate? Or is it local players who are staying low? And then especially in the UK,
the UK numbers were really weak in fourth quarter. I thought some of it was tough comps from a year ago. But that
struck me as the market where you really do have the most pricing power and I want to know if there's anything you
can say specifically about the UK being the same or different from the other European markets?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Yeah. I will say the UK was different. We saw one of our competitors, Mars in particular
promoting quite aggressively and I'm pleased to say that we have responded to those actions and we're feeling
comfortable that we're going to start to see a trajectory change there. The reality is that a number of our multinational
competitors have just lagged a little bit in their pricing response and that's put some pressure on the business. But once
again it's one of the reasons we have protected our working A&C so carefully. It's one of the reasons we have really
focused very much on looking market-by-market to ensure that we've got the right programming and we have great

confidence that we will start to see that trajectory improve. But, again, it isn't necessarily going to happen overnight
which is why we see the back half to -- it will build over the course of the year and the back half will be stronger.
<Q - Robert B. Moskow>: Irene, how are you determining which markets you want to respond to, to competitive
activities and which you don't? It sounds like you responded to Mars in the UK. You responded to the biscuit
competition in the U.S. What goes into that decision-making?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Well, a big focus is really which of the markets that matter most? And as we look at the
world, we think about which are our key markets and our focus remains particularly in a time when we want to make
sure that our spending is having the greatest impact. We are focusing it disproportionately on our Power Brands and on
those key markets that matter. And you'll see us do that in each of our core categories.

Your next question comes from Alexia Howard of Bernstein.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Hey, Alexia.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Hey, Alexia.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: Okay. Can we focus in, to begin with, on SG&A cost savings? As I remember when you
set out the original 300 basis points of margin improvement goal over three years, most of that was COGS. I thought
about 250 basis points of COGS and only the remaining 50 was SG&A. It seems that you've gone a lot further along on
SG&A cost savings in 2014. Are those coming through better than expected? And what's the key driver of that? And
then I have a follow up.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah. I think when you look at cost reduction programs and ZBB as a methodology,
overheads are easier to get at. They're quicker to realize benefits and we've done things like changing policies and
tightening down controls on spending and key categories of spend. Those things are not depended on capital projects to
improve a plant as you would have in a COGS focused effort. So that's really the driver. I think we're -- as you look at
2014, probably slightly ahead of expectations from what we were driving on overheads. And I think there's more to do
there. It's clearly going to continue to be a contributor to the margin improvement. And I think you'll see that in the
2015 results as well.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: But, again, if you think about...
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: Thanks. Very helpful.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: [indiscernible] (45:10) of the 300 points, it was disproportionately in our developed markets
and I think you're seeing that strong performance play through in the margin progression in 2014 that you see in North
America and in Europe. So we're very much on track to deliver the targets that we laid out.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: Great. And then a quick follow up. I know that the focus is not particularly on the top line
at the moment, but on innovation, where are you on new products as a percent of sales? Where do you expect that to
get to over time? Has it come down in the last couple of years as your focus has played much more onto the margin
front? Thank you, and I'll pass it on.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Yeah. The innovation is still the lifeblood of our business. We remain very focused on that,
Alexia. And it was about 13% -- it contributed about 13% of -- it was about 13% of our revenue. And we expect to see
that we will continue to perform in that range, which we're quite comfortable with. It's one of the reasons that our
Power Brands grew about 4% last year, and we're quite comfortable that we've got a pipeline for 2015 that will
basically drive the underlying growth that we've laid out in our commitments.

Your next question comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jason M. English>: Hey. Good morning, folks.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Hey, Jason.
<Q - Jason M. English>: Thank you for taking the question. I guess I'll start on a topic that's been vetted a couple of
times in the call, and that's the European pricing environment, chocolate price gaps, et cetera. I think I'm missing
something here, because I think about the cost structure for a European-based chocolate company, I've got to be
looking at cocoa prices that aren't really up very much, dairy prices that are down meaningfully, sweetener prices that
are down meaningfully. All in, from my vantage point, it looks like the COGS basket is actually deflationary. So what
am I missing in that cost picture?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Well, Jason, if you look at the most recent costs, your point is correct. But if you look over
the course of the year, there's no question these costs are all still up year-over-year, and that's really what we've been
responding to. So the facts are that the market basket of inputs for our chocolate business are among the highest, and
they were a key part of -- key reason for -- contributor to the $1.6 billion of pricing that we took this past year. So it is
still a headwind for us. We are taking the necessary steps to start by protecting profitability and making sure that we are
pricing to recover those costs. We're supporting our Power Brands in particular with the necessary spending to help to
mitigate the impact. And I'm quite confident that, as the market adapts to these new price points, both from an absolute
elasticity standpoint as well as from a price gap standpoint as competitors take pricing actions, I'm quite confident that
we'll see the market recover.
<Q - Jason M. English>: All right. So if spot prices hold, you probably don't see competitive price reaction in that
environment. But what you lose on top-line you probably more than make up for on the bottom line if the spot holds? Is
that a fair characterization?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: No, I would say that even with the recent deflation, there's still a net -- there's a need to
catch up to some of the earlier cost increases, and that's just undeniable.
<Q - Jason M. English>: Okay. Last question, then I'll pass it on. Brian, for you. I like the free cash flow chart you
showed, but obviously it's a bit fictitious to pretend that we don't have the restructuring cost. I think if we look at cost
restructuring this past year, with both CapEx and cash from ops, it was around $1 billion. So can you just give us the
forward on how that cash leakage looks over the next two years? And I think based on the comments in the release,
what you said before, most if not all of that goes away in fiscal 2017. But can you just walk us through that detail?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah. I think what I would focus on is the underlying working capital progress is actually
really good. And we wanted to talk about that. We'll talk more about it at CAGNY. I would say 2015 will be the high
year in terms of cash used for restructuring and CapEx related to the program. So in 2016 it'll begin to decline and then,
as you say, 2017 it'll be relatively small. So I think the underlying cash flow performance when you look at operating
cash flow and free cash flow for the business, we're working hard to improve that. And as these -- the costs related to
the restructuring, as they go away, it's a pretty powerful cash flow story.
<Q - Jason M. English>: And I'm sorry if I missed this. Did you give CapEx guidance for 2015? And if not, can you?
<A - Dexter Congbalay>: We'll talk about it...
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: I think we'll provide that at CAGNY.
<Q - Jason M. English>: Okay. All right. Thanks.

Your next question comes from John Baumgartner of Wells Fargo.
<Q - John J. Baumgartner>: Good morning. Thanks for the question. Just wanted to ask about the operating margins
across your developing markets in totality. I think your initial longer-term vision was to hold margins more or less
steady over time, then you had a big step down in 2013 with the pressures in China and in Venezuela. You had some
recovery this last year, but you're still about 200 basis points below 2012's levels. So, how are you thinking about the
ability to get back to that 2012 level? Is it practical? Or has anything more structural changed in terms of reinvestment
needs or the categories? Just your thoughts there.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: No, we still feel comfortable that over the reasonable horizon, John, we will be able to get
our Emerging Markets margins up to peer levels. As you saw, we had a very strong year in LA. We're making progress
in Europe. In EEMEA it doesn't show as well because of this tremendous impact that pricing had on our overall
business. And AP remains a place, a little bit of a construction site for us as we see our China business recovering over
time. So we will see those margins improve. A lot of the focus of our ZBB activities are designed to address overhead
opportunities in those markets, and they will also benefit from some of the supply chain work that we're doing,
particularly as we add more efficient lines with our capacity expansion. So, we will see those margins come up in the
very short-term. Because the currency has been so volatile in those Emerging Markets, it's been a significant headwind
in those geographies.
<Q - John J. Baumgartner>: Then, Irene, just a follow-up. In terms of the dislocation in Russia and your plans for
the, I guess, the new facility there, has that changed your plan at all? Or is that still the green light?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Well, as we've told you, we are making an investment there. We are still investing in the
[ph] Shell (52:06) building in Siberia and we'll continue to monitor that situation to make sure that we're – that our
assets are appropriately protected. As I said on the call, I'm quite pleased with the performance of our team. They've
done a very good job, even in the face of some of the sanctions. But certainly as we think about making additional
investments, we want to continue to keep our ear to the ground.

Your next question comes from Eric Katzman of Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Eric Richard Katzman>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Hey, Eric.
<Q - Eric Richard Katzman>: I guess a couple of questions if I could. Brian, I'm a little confused. So you've got
roughly included in dollar terms, let's call it flattish earnings per share; your sales are going to be down, if the forecast
is correct, about 9%. Your tax rate is a headwind. So you're obviously implying pretty strong operating margins. Is the
14% -- does that include or exclude currency?
<A - Dexter Congbalay>: Includes.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: It includes currency.
<A - Dexter Congbalay>: As a percentage.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yes, as a percent.
<Q - Eric Richard Katzman>: Yeah. But you're including currency; that's like a – okay. And then, kind of more, I
guess – I was just really surprised, like Latin America margins at 20% in the quarter; EU margins at very high levels. I
think you mentioned there was a one-time benefit to LatAm. But maybe you could explain a little bit more as to why

those margins were just so high, given challenging fundamentals and I assume some currency headwinds even in the
quarter.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah. I think specifically for LatAm we talked about, about half of the improvement is
driven by cost actions. The other half is a one-time benefit related to VAT accruals in the region. That contributed
about 20 basis points in the fourth quarter. But the reality is there's underlying improvement in cost structure. The
pricing is working. We're improving margins.
<Q - Eric Richard Katzman>: Okay. Any commentary on the European margins being so high?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: No. I mean, again, as we've said, as we think about our margin opportunity as an enterprise,
the two biggest opportunities lay in our developed markets and I'm very pleased with the progress that we've made in
Europe on basically all aspects of the P&L. So I think we're well positioned.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah. It's, I mean, driven by improvements in lower SG&A and better gross margins. So it's
the right things.
<A - Dexter Congbalay>: Yeah.
<Q - Eric Richard Katzman>: Okay. And then – thank you for that – and then, as a – just kind of thinking, like, at
least, in the fourth quarter, right, volume mix was down in every segment, and yet your – and your market share,
although this is an annual number, you lost market share in a majority of the business. I'm looking on slide 6. I mean,
that's in dollar terms. But, I guess, I'm not really sure how to judge, Irene, kind of organic top line performance. Price is
now such a function of trying to offset the currency devaluations. If I look at vol/mix, it's down, your share is down;
and your A&P (sic) [A&C] (56:05) budget is being cut. So kind of how do I think about that? I thought the goal was to
gain share even with the categories struggling.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: So let me take those in a couple of pieces, Eric. There's no question that our long-term
algorithm assumes a balance of volume, mix and pricing. And in the short term, there's no question that we are leaning
disproportionately on pricing, given the enormous increases that we are seeing in both our commodity increases as well
as in the impact of the currency devaluation. So it's been – it was about 4.5 points of our 2.4 points of revenue growth.
So it was a significant impact which says that vol/mix was a negative. And there's no question. As I've talked about it a
couple of times on the call, that in the short term, the $1.6 billion of pricing that we took has had an impact in the
marketplace. We are monitoring that very carefully. We are thoughtful about which markets and which categories we
are monitoring and protecting. And the end in mind is to get ourselves back on to a trajectory over the long term where
we grow at or above the rates of our category growth.
But in the near term, the single biggest opportunity for us to ensure that we have adequate money to invest in our
franchises is to make sure that we're pricing to protect our margins in the face of escalating costs. So there's nothing
about the numbers that's inconsistent with the approach that we're taking. Over the long term, we would expect to see
our businesses growing at or above the rates of our categories. But in the near term, while costs are as volatile as they
are, we want to make sure that we are protecting our profitability and that has a short-term dislocation impact.
<Q - Eric Richard Katzman>: Okay. Thanks for that. I'll pass it on.
<A - Dexter Congbalay>: Hey, Eric. Regarding – it's Dexter, sorry. Regarding A&C, you said that we're cutting A&C.
I think Brian mentioned a few minutes ago, we actually increased our spending on our Power Brands and the reduction
in our A&C from a percentage standpoint is largely driven through gaining efficiencies and shifting a little bit more
towards digital. So I don't know what you were listening to earlier, but that's what Brian said a few minutes ago.
<Q - Eric Richard Katzman>: Well, I understand that, but your – I guess as a, obviously, a very brand-oriented
company long term, advertising and promotion as a percentage of your – or A&C as a percentage of sales, historically,
that's been a very good measure of brand equity and brand health. You didn't even mention it anywhere. I mean, there's
no comment as to what A&C spending is in the press release.

<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Eric, it was down a little bit on a percentage of revenue. We've increased our spending on
our Power Brands. Okay?
<Q - Eric Richard Katzman>: Okay. All right. Thank you.

We have time for one more question. Your final question comes from David Palmer of RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: Thank you. Good morning. Just a quick one on coffee. You said that's included in your 2%
organic growth. Does it feel like coffee will be less of a drag and perhaps significantly so this year than in 2014?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Simple answer is yes. I think as you saw in the fourth quarter, it contributed about 2 points
to our overall growth. We had a strong fourth quarter. We are well staged for this year as we set up the JV. And as we
said, we're confident that the deal will close some time this year.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: And second, just if you were to summarize the emerging market demand expectations,
excluding currency, how do you expect overall revenue and profit trends in the emerging markets to compare to 2014?
I asked partly because you've highlighted some cross-currents, like Russia perhaps getting worse and China perhaps
getting better. Thanks.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: No. I mean, emerging markets continue to be an important source of our growth. So we
expect to see some recovery as – again, as the markets adjust to the pricing levels, as we close our price gaps, and as we
continue to invest in the franchises. So we have great hopes for our emerging markets in aggregate. I did call out Russia
because I would suggest, given the events there, we would expect to see a somewhat different trend there next year in
2015 than we had last year. But long-term we continue to feel quite bullish about Russia and the rest of our emerging
markets. But, I mean, if you look at our performance in India and Brazil and China is starting to come back, they will
be a critical piece of our performance in 2015.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: Thank you.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Thanks, David.
