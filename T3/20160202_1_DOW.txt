The agenda for today's call is on slide five. I will now turn the call over to Howard.
Howard I. Ungerleider
Thank you, Neal, and welcome back to Investor Relations. Good morning, everyone. Turning to slide six, our results
this quarter and in 2015 reflected the benefits of our continued disciplined approach to execute on our priorities. Dow
delivered its 13th consecutive quarter of operating EPS and EBITDA margin growth. Operating earnings per share
increased 9% to $0.93 per share. Volume increased 4%, which represents the ninth consecutive quarter of
year-over-year growth. This includes 5% growth in our emerging regions, led by greater China, which was up 10%.
Operating EBITDA was $2.4 billion. Excluding the impact of divestitures, operating EBITDA rose more than $100
million versus the same quarter last year. Operating EBITDA margins expanded across all segments to 20.9%, the
highest quarterly result since the first quarter of 2005. During the quarter we also returned $2.7 billion to shareholders
through dividends and share repurchases with the closing of our Dow Chlorine Products transaction serving as a
significant driver of improvements to our capital structure. We've included a full lookback on the greater than $4.8
billion in consideration for the transaction in the appendix. And finally, at the very end of December, Dow received
$1.5 billion in pre-tax proceeds through the sale of its direct ownership interest in MEGlobal to EQUATE.
Moving to our full year results, Dow reported operating EPS of $3.47 a share, a 12% increase year-over-year. We
achieved operating EBITDA of $9.6 billion, a new high. Operating EBITDA margins expanded more than 360 basis
points to 19.7%, representing the highest level in more than a decade, with gains reported in all operating segments,
reflecting our continued discipline in price volume management. Operating return on capital increased to 12.1%,
marking three consecutive years of expansion. We delivered $7.5 billion of cash flow from operations in the year, $1
billion increase compared to last year, and on an operating basis this represents a third consecutive year of record cash
flow from operations.
We also continued to return significant cash to our shareholders. In 2015, we returned $4.6 billion through paid
dividends and share repurchases and we recently announced another increase to our quarterly dividend to a new historic
high. Additionally, during the year, we announced a series of portfolio management milestones, which brought our total
pre-tax value from portfolio actions since 2013 to more than $13.5 billion, coming in well ahead of both our committed
target and timeline.

Moving on to our dashboard of key financial performance metrics on slide seven, these highlights reflect our consistent
track record of delivering earnings growth, margin expansion, and strong cash flow. As a reminder, our financial
priorities include delivering 3% above the cost of capital, driving 10% EPS growth over the long term, maintaining a
capital structure that provides financial flexibility, and continuing to increasingly reward our owners. And as you see
here, we've made significant progress against each one. In the fourth quarter, we reduced our net debt to cap to 24.8%,
from 37.3% in the year-ago period and well below our 10-year average of 35.9%.
Net debt to operating EBITDA declined to 0.9x versus 1.5x in the same quarter last year, and year-over-year, total cash
and cash equivalents have increased by $2.9 billion. Further, we returned $2.7 billion to shareholders through paid
dividends and share repurchases, with $1.5 billion related in the equity redemption from the Dow Chlorine Products
transaction and an additional $700 million of stock buybacks in the quarter. We exited the year with operating return on
capital of 12.1%, an increase of 130 basis points versus the prior year.
Now let's turn to our segment results starting on slide nine. Ag Sciences reported sales of $1.6 billion in the fourth
quarter, down from $1.9 billion in the year-ago period, impacted by continued lower crop commodity prices, high
channel inventories, and ongoing currency headwinds. Operating EBITDA for the segment was essentially flat
year-over-year, as headwinds from pricing and the divestiture of AgroFresh were offset by the sale of non-strategic
product lines and disciplined productivity actions we drove throughout 2015. Here, we were among the first movers in
the industry to take swift action and reduce our cost structure in response to market headwinds.
During the year, sales of our new Crop Protection products grew 6% and we gained corn market share in the Americas.
Looking ahead to 2016, soft commodity prices are expected to continue, with the overall market projected to be down
3% to 5%. In this environment, we're focused on continuing to differentiate ourselves with new products as well as
continued self-help actions to deliver performance that continues to outpace that of our competitors.
Consumer Solutions on slide 10 achieved an all-time quarterly operating EBITDA record of $296 million. This reflects
continued demand in the automotive and semiconductor sectors. Collectively, the businesses in this segment drove cost
reductions in line with productivity initiatives and realized margin expansion from demand for innovative
customer-focused solutions. Dow Automotive Systems had another strong quarter, led by demand for our science and
engineering capabilities that improve fuel efficiency, safety, and acoustic performance. In this business, we're
leveraging our technology capabilities to outpace the industry. For example, in North America, we continue to make
solid progress with electric vehicle manufacturers, where our content per vehicle averages 3 times that of non-electric
vehicles.
In Consumer Care, volume gains in Asia and EMEAI more than offset a transition in the Americas from powder-based
detergent solutions to capsules. We also saw double-digit volume growth in target pharmaceutical and personal care
markets and took action to respond to the weaker industrial markets by closing a less competitive cellulosic facility in
West Virginia.
Dow Electronic Materials expanded EBITDA once again, as semiconductor and growth technologies grew faster than
the industry, driven by our technology differentiation that lowered the cost of ownership for advanced nodes. Looking
ahead, we see margin improving in our display business, driven by our core knowledge and our strength in LED
backlight films.
Turning to slide 11, Infrastructure Solutions reported fourth quarter sales of $1.7 billion, down from the year-ago
period as volume gains in nearly all businesses were more than offset by price pressures from low raw material costs
and currency headwinds. Dow Building & Construction drove margin expansion through strength in construction
chemical markets and our FR-63 licensing efforts. Dow Coating Materials grew volume, led by industrial coatings.
Looking ahead, we expect growth in our coatings business to outpace the market due to the commercial launch of 5
new vinyl acrylic binders.
Performance Monomers remains in an ongoing global trough and we are taking several actions: shutting down 20% of
our Deer Park acrylate capacity to reduce our merchant exposure; optimizing our turnaround and structural costs; and
continuing to explore co-producer supply agreements.

In Energy & Water Solutions, our industry leading reverse osmosis business saw double-digit growth driven by strong
demand. During the quarter, our new RO membrane plant in Saudi Arabia also came on-line, and will serve the
growing need for water in the Middle East. Based on the market penetration and customer acceptance of our product,
we expect to reach capacity on this asset very quickly.
Turning to Performance Materials & Chemicals, fourth quarter sales were down on a year-over-year basis, driven
primarily by the impact of the split off of Dow Chlorine Products and other divestitures, as well as significant price and
currency headwinds.
Industrial Solutions reported a volume decline, as growth in ethylene glycol sales was more than offset by weakness in
the energy sector, along with a change in long-term supply arrangement. Our price volume management kept EBITDA
flat in our core business, but that was offset by weakness in MEG pricing, as well as increased Sadara expenses as the
site continues to progress start up of the new production units, which drove down equity earnings.
We reported another strong quarter in Polyurethanes as a result of self-help measures and a shift to a more specialized
Systems House sales approach, which achieved double-digit sales growth. Additionally, our new polyols facility in
Thailand drove share gains and double-digit volume increases in Asia.
Moving to slide 13, our Performance Plastics segment delivered a fourth quarter operating EBITDA record of $1.3
billion, driven by steady demand in all businesses and margin expansion in most geographic areas.
Dow Packaging and Specialty Plastics sold a quarterly record polyethylene volume, led primarily by double-digit gains
in Asia and strong demand for Dow's innovative packaging solutions. In early December, the first polyethylene units
began production at our Sadara joint venture, and first shipments have already been received by our customers.
Dow Elastomers reported double-digit growth in North America on continued customer demand for Dow products in
the transportation and infrastructure sectors. Our INFUSE elastomers, which are sold into higher end footwear, saw
strong volumes in the quarter. Additionally, an increase in consumer preference for SUVs resulted in higher per vehicle
elastomer demand. Dow Electrical and Telecommunications saw double-digit operating EBITDA growth as well. This
quarter's business performance continues to be underpinned by ongoing progress in our integration and feedstock
flexibility. For example, Dow Europe produced almost half of its ethylene in 2015 from LPG, and we increased our
European LPG cracking capability to over 60%. Some additional details on this topic are also in the appendix.
Turning to slide 14, let me briefly cover our modeling guidance for the quarter and for 2016. On a year-over-year basis
in 2016, we will have earnings catalysts from a full year of PDH impact, and we have two positive drivers that will
contribute to the back half of the year: the Dow Corning transaction and our enhancements to ethane cracking
capabilities in Louisiana.
In the spirit of continuous improvement, we will make further progress on our productivity initiatives that build on the
$345 million of savings we delivered in 2015 by targeting an additional and incremental $300 million in 2016. We also
see pension expense providing an approximately $250 million tailwind as well. We do see several headwinds, namely,
continued pressure from currency, the loss of earnings due to divestitures and soft Ag fundamentals from continued
lower crop prices and higher channel inventories. Specifically, in the first quarter, we see demand fundamentals that
continue to favor volume expansion in our targeted sectors. This will be tempered by higher turnaround activity on a
sequential basis, as well as lost earnings from our recent portfolio management actions.
Finally, we will continue to drive our $5 billion share repurchase program forward. We expect to deliver $2 billion of
share repurchases this year, as our purchasing window likely opens up following the shareholder vote for the
Dow-DuPont transaction.
With that, I'll turn it over to Andrew.

Thank you, Howard. If you look at slide 16, you'll see that 2015, in every regard, was a transformative year for Dow.
We delivered record results amidst an ever-challenging macro environment, with 13 consecutive quarters of earnings
growth and margin expansion. In addition to the financial highlights that Howard just reviewed, we made further
progress on our productivity goals through harmonizing our work processes, streamlining functional business support,
and optimizing our asset footprint.
We committed to achieve $300 million in 2015 and, in fact, we over-delivered on this goal with $345 million realized.
We completed the first full year operating on Dow's new 'one instance' IT platform. This world-class system
represented the single-largest implementation of SAP, and that is already delivering significant streamlining benefits
while also enabling sharper business and geographic insights.
We're delivering on our significant growth project milestones, celebrating first polyethylene product shipped from our
Sadara joint venture and starting up the world's largest on-purpose propylene facility, which is making smooth and
steady progress towards full rates. And importantly, in a year with these significant operational projects coming online,
we delivered our best ever EH&S performance.
And last, but certainly not least, 2015 was a truly transformative year on the strategic front. We drove major actions on
our joint ventures, with the sale of our direct ownership interest in MEGlobal to EQUATE, the step acquisition of
Univation Technologies, and the announced restructuring of the ownership of Dow Corning's silicones business. We
split off Dow Chlorine Products and released further value through our transactions of the AgroFresh, sodium
borohydride, and ANGUS businesses. And of course in December, we announced the signing of a historic transaction
with DuPont and the intent to create three focused industry leaders in agriculture, materials science and specialty
products, releasing tremendous value for our owners. I'll have more to say about our progress here in just a moment.
We turn to slide 17 in summary. 2015 represents the culmination of actions we have taken over a three-year period to
increase cash flow generation, drive self-help measures, enhance the quality of our portfolio, capture growth for the
future and increasingly reward our shareholders. 2015 will go down as the most significant year in Dow's storied
history and quarter 4 the exclamation mark on the year. This direction was set by the thorough review the Dow board
and executive team launched in 2013 to identify clear actions to unlock additional value for our shareholders. As part of
that review, we set very focused goals, including: to grow EPS by 10% per year over the long term, to enhance our
traditional EVA focus, to continue to reduce our debt, and to go narrower and deeper in key end markets and divest
non-core businesses, including Dow's exit in chlorine, our original foundational product, all with a relentless focus on
shareholder value creation and long-term growth.
We have made significant progress against this strategic road map, and these actions have delivered impressive
financial results and returns to our owners over that three-year period, including $22 billion in cash flow from
operations, ROC improvement of 450 basis points from 7.6% to 12.1%, more than $8 billion reduction in net debt, and,
most importantly, $12 billion distributed through share repurchases and paid dividends.
Turning to slide 18, these results are also underpinned by our intense focus on driving an EVA culture and performance
using a best owner mindset as our key lens and taking actions on multiple fronts, lowering our working capital and
asset base through our multi-year productivity actions, most recently our Dow 10.0 streamlining program, and our
aforementioned world class IT capabilities; driving synergies through our corporate base, further leveraging our
functional expertise across the enterprise to increase sales, optimizing purchasing, and driving a lean corporate center
and regional hubs, capturing growth where growth exists by cross-selling opportunities, maximizing our operating
leverage and improving our sales mix. As a result, over these past three years, our EVA improvement has been
significant, placing us in the 95th percentile relative to our peers.
Turning to slide 19, to keep this momentum going and build on the performance and portfolio actions of the past three
years, we put in place clear earnings growth drivers that are delivering now and will ramp up in the near future. Our
multi-year productivity push is already delivering bottom line results. Our mantra is one of continuous improvement.
We did it in 2015. And we will continue with that same mindset into this year, making even more progress towards our
goal of $1billion in savings over three years, with 2017 being year three.

We're pleased we exceeded our $300 million productivity target, with a $345 million of savings we delivered in 2015,
and in 2016, we have targeted to save an additional and incremental greater than $300 million. In fact, we're increasing
our head count reduction target, as part of this program, by approximately 500 roles, bringing the total program head
count reduction to 2,200 roles that will be eliminated. Thus far, we have reduced just over 1,200 roles.
Our strategic investments, including our U.S. Gulf Coast and Sadara projects, will significantly enhance our go forward
earnings profile. These projects are based on strong underlying fundamentals. They deliver bottom line benefits in all
scenarios because of their low cost position and value-add products. We are pleased with the start-up of these growth
facilities and we expect several additional units to come online, both on the U.S. Gulf Coast and in Saudi Arabia in
2016.
Another earnings driver comes from our restructuring on the ownership of Dow Corning, which we expect to close in
the middle of this year. This transaction expected to yield more than $1 billion in additional annual EBITDA at full run
rate synergies. Just all these drivers alone approach $4 billion of EBITDA contribution on a run rate basis. And, of
course, it's important to remember that we have additional levers in place that will benefit our portfolio depending on
how market forces develop through the year. From a cash flow and future earnings potential view, these drivers are
indeed powerful. They all bolster our growth profile, expand the potential to serve our customers, and release
significant value for our shareholders. I will now review our 2016 market outlook and priorities for the year. So turning
to slide 21.
We will continue to see growth in the 3 key markets in which our materials businesses compete: Packaging,
Transportation, and Construction. All consumer-driven and innovation-based. These 3 markets have carried the
strength that we saw at the end of 2015 into the first month of 2016. The global economy continues to be volatile, and
we see that trend persisting for the near term. However, we also see strong demand from consumers in the U.S., as well
as in China, and that plays well to our consumer-driven portfolio, technologies, and narrower and deeper market focus.
From a macro perspective, we are in and expect to continue to be in oversupplied energy and agriculture markets. We
see low energy prices being a net benefit to the consumer. We do not sell energy. What we produce and sell continues
to see tight and tightening supply/demand dynamics. Our differentiated solutions allow us to drive demand and capture
value.
And turning to the geographies, North America is expected to remain strong. Demand in Europe will continue to
improve. And Latin America will have mixed returns across the region. We also expect continued growth in China,
driven by demand for our consumer-targeted solutions.
And finally, in this volatile macro environment, expect us to control what we can control. Expect us to improve our
productivity. Expect us to control cost. And expect us to deliver the growth projects we have in place.
Turning to slide 22 and looking ahead, 2016 is primed to be another big year for Dow, and our teams are squarely
aligned around three clear priorities. Priority 1, deliver our 2016 plan despite these volatile macro conditions. Here, you
can expect us to continue controlling the things we can control. Driving our productivity initiatives, realizing the
benefits of our commercialized innovation, and executing ongoing price volume discipline. We will continue to reduce
costs and expand margins. Two, close the Dow Corning transaction by mid-year, and deliver the related synergies.
And, three, move swiftly through the key stage gates of the Dow-DuPont transaction, close MergeCo, realize synergies
on an accelerated basis, and prep the intended spins.
The makeup of the teams and the timeline for the transaction is available in more detail in the appendix. These are the
same slides DuPont provided during their earnings call last week. I reiterate Ed's comments that he made during the
call. We are working on an accelerated timeframe to close the merger and deliver the synergies and the intended spins.
The synergy estimates of $3 billion cost and $1 billion growth are indeed a floor, not a ceiling. In sum, you should
expect in 2016 the same resolute focus our Dow team has demonstrated over these past several years.
And speaking of our Dow team, we also announced this morning that Jim Fitterling has been appointed to the position
of President and Chief Operating Officer of Dow. Since the announced merger with DuPont, Jim has been and will
continue to work closely alongside me in running Dow's operations. He will play a key role in supporting me to drive

the successful completion of the merger and unleashing the full value of the three intended subsequent independent
companies. His appointment is extremely well deserved and a reflection of his abilities and our commitment to our
company over his 30-plus year career.
Now, we anticipate that the entire process to close the merger and set the companies up to be spun will take about a
year and a half all-told. I look forward to working with Jim and also with Howard Ungerleider in the office of the CEO
over that time period to bring an entire process to a successful conclusion and enable a successful leadership handover
to coordinate with my own planned transition out of the company, which will occur when we are set up to be spun off
but no later than the end of Q2 2017.
We will continue to drive our strategic agenda and the transformational steps we're undertaking. We will deliver further
productivity gains and cost reductions. We will innovate and add value for our customers, and we will drive enhanced
returns for our shareholders. And we will deliver this exciting new phase of growth manifested in the creation of
Dow-DuPont and its three destination companies.
And with that, Neal, let's turn to Q&A.
Neal Sheorey
Thank you, Andrew. Now, we will move on to your questions. First, however, I would like to remind you that my
comments regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures apply to both our prepared
remarks and the following Q&A. Levi, would you please explain the Q&A procedure?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We ask that you please limit yourself to one question. [Operator Instructions]
And we'll take our first question from Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Congratulations to go around. Of course, Mr. Fitterling, congrats. Mr. Broodo, congrats. Neal,
I don't think I should congratulate you because IR in this day and age is kind of a thankless function, but welcome back
into the role. Hey, Andrew, obviously...
<A - Howard I. Ungerleider>: Nothing for Howard?
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: And of course, Howard, congratulations on you being you.
<A - Howard I. Ungerleider>: Okay, good.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Andrew, obviously, very impressive results; volumes really jumping off the page here, and
especially in Asia and China. Can you expand upon that? And I know that your commentary was rather upbeat on
China, as well. What exactly is going on for you guys there?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Well, look, I'll give you – thank you, Frank, for the all kind of congratulations commentary.
I think this is an exciting time at Dow, and the question you're asking is an indicator of it. We've positioned our product
mix, now, for about a decade to be technology driven, waiting for China to move to quality products, not quantity
products. So rather than selling commodities and they reprocessing them for exports, which is the China engine of
yesteryear, the China engine of today and tomorrow suits our product profile that we've been working a decade to put
in place. The Shanghai R&D center that you visited is a good example of that. So we have the right products for
China's current needs. Jim, did you want to add anything?
<A - James R. Fitterling>: I'd say in Plastics, obviously, the higher end of the market for food packaging, what we're
doing in Polyurethanes, with structures going into automotive and appliances has been big. Electronic materials, we've

seen a shift to more production into China, so that benefited us as well. And we continue to focus on all of our
value-add products moving into the market; so double-digit growth in China. And even though automotive is a little bit
slower in China, we're still very, very strong in automotive. Our Elastomers business as well as our automotive bonding
business has been quite exceptional.

And we'll take our next question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Thank you, good morning.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Morning.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Andrew, Howard, and Jim, lots of moving parts in 2016. Can you grow EBITDA in 2016?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Howard?
<A - Howard I. Ungerleider>: David, good morning. You know we don't give earnings guidance. What we try to do
with the modeling guidance is talk you through some of the moving parts. I mean, we certainly have the potential to
grow our EBITDA when you look at all the tailwinds, whether it's the volume growth that we expect to continue;
whether it's the productivity self-help, which is another $300 million on top of the $345 million that we delivered; the
lower pension expense between $200 million and $300 million. But I would just caution you to look at all the
headwinds as well. We've got some headwinds, but clearly PDH, as well, coming on is a tailwind. And Sadara will be a
tailwind in Performance Plastics, but it will be a headwind in Performance Materials & Chemicals through the year as
that – the units in PMC continue to get closer to start up in 2016.

And we'll take our next question from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.
<Q - Jeffrey J. Zekauskas>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Good morning.
<Q - Jeffrey J. Zekauskas>: Hi. In your previous corporate filings, you said that your Texas LHC-9 cracker would
come on in the first half of 2017. And sort of the chatter in Houston is that that cracker is running a year late in coming
on-stream. Is it still on schedule, or is it running late?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: So Jeff, I'll give it to Jim to answer.
<A - James R. Fitterling>: Jeff, that cracker is on schedule to start up in the second quarter of 2017. And when you
take a look at the progress that we've made vis-à-vis the other competitors that we call are in the first wave of
production, it's right on time.

<Q - Hassan I. Ahmed>: Just wanted to sort of follow on from the earlier question. You guys are saying that your
cracker is on-stream – coming on-line on time and the like. If I take a look at the 15 or so cracker announcements that
have happened in the U.S., it seems that only 3 have started construction, right? But yet there seems to be this

perception that there's going to be this flood of capacity coming on-stream in 2017. Could you broadly give us your
view of supply/demand and, more specifically, of what we should expect ex-Dow in terms of cracker delays?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yeah, I'll get Jim to handle that one as well, Hassan.
<A - James R. Fitterling>: Yeah, Hassan, what I would say – we've said since the beginning of this, and our long-term
experience in the ethylene business is this: half of what's announced is in play, and half of that might come on, on the
timeframe that was committed to. So when you look at what's in the first wave today, the things that we know, we
know that Braskem-IDESA has started up, experiencing a few problems, but it's started up. You've got three big
players, ourselves, CP Chem and Exxon that are coming, and a small crack with OxyChem. That is our view as the first
wave of capacity that's coming on. That is quite a bit ahead of anybody else, and those were the first ones out of the
ground and are going to continue to be the ones you see in the first wave.
When the second wave comes is anybody's guess at this point. Some people are saying 2018. I think it might even slide
into 2019 or 2020. And given the financial conditions there and given things that are going on with construction labor, I
think that would be a realistic expectation. I don't expect a tidal wave of new capacity coming on. We're well
positioned as a first mover in this. In fact, I think we're going to be up before the rest.

And we'll go to our next question from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Vincent Stephen Andrews>: Thanks. And good morning, everyone. Just wondering if you can give us an update
on the Enlist approval from China, and I'm also kind of wondering whether you think the delay has anything to do with
ChemChina's interest in acquiring western assets.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yeah, just the back end of that, look, there's no question China has been very much after
GMO technology for a long time, Vincent. And it's not surprising that ChemChina is interested in Syngenta. That is a
long held rumor and if indeed the announcement this morning that they are close, there's no shocker there. I don't think
there's a correlation, but go ahead Howard on the Enlist approval.
<A - Howard I. Ungerleider>: No, I don't really have anything new to add. I mean, we're continuing to try to work
with the Chinese authorities and the Ministry of Agriculture. We're giving them as much technical information as
they're asking for. And we're very confident in the chemistry and what it – efficacy for the farming value chain.
<A - Neal Sheorey>: Operator, do we have another question?
Operator
Yes. We'll go next to Steve Byrne with Bank of America.
<Q - Stephen Byrne>: Yes, thank you. How much of that double-digit volume growth in Performance Plastics was a
reflection of perhaps inventory destocking in the year-ago quarter when you had falling oil? Or, conversely, did you
have more inventory destocking in the fourth quarter with another leg down of oil? Just curious about your outlook for
operating rates in these next couple of quarters.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Jim?
<A - James R. Fitterling>: Steve, thanks for the question. I don't think there was any massive destocking that
happened in the quarter. We saw strong demand through the quarter and we saw a strong December. We moved
product in almost every region of the country. I'd say a little bit soft maybe in Latin America for the fourth quarter. And
we see January as starting at a solid pace. So, I don't think it's a destocking. On our own particular situation, we end up
with record low inventories at the end of the year. But last December was also a strong December.

And we'll go next to Peter Butler with Glenn Hill Investment.
<Q - Peter E. Butler>: Yeah, Good morning, good morning.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Morning.
<Q - Peter E. Butler>: Wall Street analysts are again talking of back-end loaded years for their favorite economy
sensitive stocks. I'm wondering how much visibility does Dow have, do you have, on the second half and next year?
How much confidence do you have in your internal projections?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Let's start with the market side of that question, and then we'll get to our own, Peter.
Look, I think every industrial company, every company out there is not giving any sort of firmness on any of these
years in front of us. That's not new news. I think 2016, 2017, even with an election year here in front of us in the United
States, the macros are very difficult to predict. What we are seeing, though, is very strong trend lines, which we said in
our call, which I think gives us a strong views towards our ability to grow earnings, is this notion that the consumer is
active in the United States, and the consumer is becoming increasingly active in China, and that actually there's the
beginnings of good spending in Europe. We do believe low energy price, low oil prices are seeping into the economy,
and that's creating a stimulus that actually is of the right kind. And I think if that stimulus continues to be what it is,
short of major tectonic events geopolitically, I think the confidence in the real economy will emerge continually from
the consumer. And, frankly, that is what we're seeing in our results. We're seeing it in our product mix, which we've
been working hard to position to be B2B to C. And I think Jim talked about Packaging and Plastics, and I could say the
same about anything, Elastomers, our water business, our automotive business. We're seeing strong demand in
construction chemicals in Western Europe. I think it takes away this notion of back loading. It takes this notion of 13
quarters in a row continuing their trend. And that then speaks to the other side of it. Most of our scenario plan these
days, we don't actually say, this is the condition. It's going to be 2.5% GDP, and then go from there. None of us do that.
We bracket it, and then we pivot self-help appropriately. And if we have to go down further in cost, based on
productivity actions, because markets don't manifest themselves, we take out more costs. And having an IT platform
that's leveraged, we can do that pretty quick. We can move the cost structure with demand and price volume manage.
And that's what you've seen from us.
So, look, I think we have confidence in our machine continuing to deliver and generate this cash.

And we'll go next to Aleksey Yefremov with Nomura Securities.
<Q - Aleksey Yefremov>: Good morning. Thank you. I was wondering if you could elaborate on Dow Corning's
performance and the outlook for silicones and polysilicon business, given that you're about to buy out your partner
there.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Howard?
<A - Howard I. Ungerleider>: Yeah, sure, Aleksey. Good morning. Overall, when you look at our equity earnings for
Dow Corning in the quarter, on a reported basis, they're actually up year-on-year. If you strip out some of the certain
items, there was a one-time gain that they had in the fourth quarter of last year that didn't recur. And then there was
some lumpiness in the polycrystalline silicon side of the house. But the silicon platform has historically grown at 1.5
times to 2 times GDP. They're in attractive high growth markets that are clearly aligned with the markets that we had
said we want to go narrow and deeper in. Whether that's construction, whether that's automotive, whether that's
packaging, home and personal care, or even electronics. And so, we're very excited about the silicones platform and the
intent with the transaction on the polysilicon side is to have no economic change in ownership that will remain a JV
between Dow Corning and Shin-Etsu.

[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Arun Viswanathan>: Good morning. Thank you. I had a couple questions – I guess I could ask them as one
question. Looks like you guys really hit an inflection point on volume growth in many of your businesses. Should we
expect that to continue? And, similarly, on the margin side, you've now hit a new level of margin. So just to Andrew's
point that you're able to adjust the cost structure going forward, is all of this kind of Dow specific or dependent on the
market, or again, are we to expect that these levels should continue on the volume and margin side? Thank you.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Jim, you want to take that?
<A - James R. Fitterling>: Yeah. I'd say, Arun, the team has been very, very focused and aligned in all the businesses,
and I think you're starting to see that come through in the consecutive quarters of results. If I went through every one of
these segments, the team knows what markets we're going after. They are well armed with new innovative products
from our pipeline that are helping them to pick up market share, and so it's not just moving products with the
commodity part of the cycle. They're very targeted on which geographies we want to grow in. If we'd started the
quarter, we would have thought maybe fourth quarter would have been more dominated by emerging markets and less
– and more by developed markets instead of emerging markets, and what we saw was we saw strong performance in
both.
And so I think what you're seeing here is the culmination of just a lot of intense focus since about the middle of 2012
around our top-line growth. And when you think top-line growth for us, you should really focus on the volume right
now, because what's happened with oil prices, the thing that shows through in revenue, oil price and currency. What
you see on volume is sustainable.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Don Carson with Susquehanna financial.
<Q - Don Carson>: Just a couple questions on Ag. What was the underlying performance in Ag? You talked about an
asset sale, and I know you had an asset sale last year. And with the headwinds in South America and 3% to 4%
declines, can you grow EBITDA in Ag next year with the cost cuts that you're making?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Howard?
<A - Howard I. Ungerleider>: Yeah, Don, good morning. So the first question on the underlying operating earnings –
so, look, on average, the Ag – our Ag businesses, Dow AgroSciences, sells between three and five molecules a year on
the crop protection side of the house. This is in line with the strategic intent where if we see products that are on the tail
end of the life cycle where we can't add significant value from our science and technology platform, so we did sell a
couple of molecules in the fourth quarter. They were in the range of $50 million to $75 million of EBITDA
contribution, so you need to back that out of the segment, but otherwise, that was real productivity that really drove
that. You remember, we were one of the first, if not the first, Ag player to do a restructuring, and that was part of our
announcement earlier in 2015.
To your question of whether we can grow EBITDA in 2016, that's going to be a very tough slog on an operating basis
even with productivity considering that high channel inventories, low crop prices and just lower overall demand.
Remember, we're forecasting we see the market to decline between 3% and 5%. So it's going to be tough. Our focus is
to continue to deliver the innovations, continue to deliver the growth on the crop protection side and the new products
on the seed side, and continue to drive productivity to outpace the competition; and that's our focus.

And we'll go to our next question from Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein.
<Q - Jonas Oxgaard>: Morning, guys.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Morning.
<Q - Jonas Oxgaard>: Morning. I was also curious about that volume in Performance Plastics. With your cost
position, I kind of assumed that you guys would be selling full out regardless of end market demand. So can you talk
me a little bit through where that volume is coming from? You talk about reliability improvement on end market
demand. I'm assuming someone must also be selling ethylene to Olin now that they're a separate company?
<A - James R. Fitterling>: I think – okay, Andrew...
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Go ahead, Jim.
<A - James R. Fitterling>: It's a good question. I think if you look at our Performance Plastics segment, you also have
to bear in mind that we have capacities that have come in there on the Elastomers business, which is a high value, high
margin business which has much more resilience in pricing, and also a lot targeted towards automotive and other
consumer goods and high end manufacturing. When you look at plastics business per se, a very large part of it is
predominantly food and specialty packaging, and that business has continued to grow strong around the world.
Obviously, we have some plastics that go into the commodities segments and that continue to be strong as well.
You'll see a little bit of sales that are going into ethylene to the Olin deal, but that isn't going to be material to the
numbers that are in front of you. And the other thing you see on the revenue line is that revenue looks down pretty
dramatically, but when you peel back the byproduct sales off the crackers, which are hydrocarbon and energy type of
byproducts that have moved with oil more on a one to one relationship, plastics has held up really well based on
volume demand in the end markets, and we think that's going to continue.

And we'll take our next question from James Sheehan with SunTrust Robinson-Humphrey.
<Q - Jim M. Sheehan>: Thanks. Could you talk about the impacts you see on polyethylene prices from new capacity
coming on in 2016?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Go ahead, Jim.
<A - James R. Fitterling>: Yeah, so as I said, we ended 2015 with record low inventories and very, very strong sales,
record production out of our manufacturing assets and product continuing to shift to higher volumes. In 2016, most of
the new capacity that's talked about is scheduled to come on at the end of 2016, and our view is a lot of that's going to
slide maybe into the next year. Also, bear in mind that you have a big turnaround season in the Q2 here in the Gulf
Coast, which we think will have an impact, and we have Sadara coming up in the first quarter. So I think net-net we're
poised to take advantage of that situation. And when the new capacity does come in the second half, we think the
market will be geared to absorb it. At a 2.5% GDP rate, supply and demand is in balance for 2016.

make a guess at what the ultimate earnings contribution from Sadara will be, and what year you would kind of expect
to get to that point?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Howard?
<A - Howard I. Ungerleider>: Yeah, hey, Brian, good morning. So, I mean, I mentioned earlier, I think, in the Q&A
that when you look at 2016 specifically on the Performance Plastics side, you're looking at a $50 million plus or minus
tailwind, because those assets have already started; so we got first product out in December. The mixed feed cracker is
going to be coming up and another couple of polyethylene units throughout 2016. But in PMC, Performance Materials
& Chemicals, you're looking at about a $100 million to $200 million headwind because they're in the really steep part
of the S curve as their assets are being built and finalized in 2016, and we've got some capacity for PMC not coming on
until really the back half of the year.
We still have a view that our long-term average is $500 million split between equity earnings and the commission
structure that we're going to get as we are marketing the product for Sadara outside of the Middle East zone. That's a
long-term average and that is after the whole complex has started up, so that would start to hit those numbers in the
post-2018, 2019 timeframe. We still feel really good about the project overall.
Operator
And our next question comes from Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Christopher S. Parkinson>: Perfect. Thank you very much. Granted, it's still in the early stages, but on a
preliminary basis, where do you believe your largest long-term opportunities are for your Ag business post merging
with Pioneer? Is it more product focused within either chemicals or seed, or are there more themes within specific
geographies? And also, have you heard any preliminary feedback from your R&D team and/or field associates which
you particularly find interesting or incremental from your original analysis?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Thank you for that great question. All I can say, Chris, is that the last several weeks of team
discussions have just amplified and magnified the original pre-announcement of the merger work that was done by the
teams. We had over 4,000 man hours of combination work in the Ag teams. The two Ag teams were on fire in terms of
complementarity. I mean, the absolute hand-in-glove combination of what we have now seen, Jim and Howard and I
have done a trip out to Des Moines to Johnson, and seen the pioneer capability up close and personal. It's first class. It
has incredible technology. Not just, of course, in trade delivery mechanisms, but it's automated. It's technology-rich. It's
got capabilities on the climatic side. And what the Dow chemistry brings and the Dow traits bring, especially the
combination of traits that we can bring on herbicides and insecticides, is a winning hand. And as you know, we are the
next series of traits coming out in the marketplace.
So, everyone has always said that this is the greatest combination you could put in the sector and everything we've seen
since the announcement and the work we've done has just doubled down and tripled down. We cannot be more excited.
And Indianapolis and Dow AgroScience, we were down there and the people there were excited. Because the property
has always been a property we have talked about, in terms of where its destination might be. It's no secret that Dow
never saw itself as the natural owner long-term, but the combination, waiting for it to come the way it did, was a
winning hand.
So, we'll have a lot more to say. There are some holes in the repertoire that we'll have to address, but I can't wait until
the merger occurs and this company is set up for them to identify how they're going to grow with this complementarity.

<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Thank you, and good morning. Andrew, in your price declines of 19% overall, how much was the
effects and how much was local price declines? And then across your product chains, where are you seeing the most
price declines and where do you think you have pricing power? Thank you.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: I'll let Jim take that, P.J.
<A - James R. Fitterling>: Yeah, P.J., good question.
In the fourth quarter, specifically, we had a gain over hydrocarbons and energy costs of about $240 million, and then
we had some currency headwinds, which were the local price declines that you talked about. But net, we were up $65
million in the quarter. And for the year, we had gains of $1.1 billion, and net-out – about $800 million of currency, or
$300 million of margin expansion. So I hope that gives you a rough idea. Howard?
<A - Howard I. Ungerleider>: Yeah, P.J., just to give you some specific data. At the enterprise level, local price
versus the same quarter last year was down 14%. If you look at that on an EBITDA or an EPS impact, well, it was
$0.11 roughly on the EPS line, and just north of $160 million on the EBITDA line versus same quarter last year, in
terms of impact on currency.

And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Sheorey, at this time, we'll turn the conference back to
you for any additional or closing remarks.
Neal Sheorey
Thanks, Levi.
Andrew, before we close the call, would you like to make any final comments?
Andrew N. Liveris
Yeah, I think I said it in my opening script. I can't be prouder of the Dow team. 2015 was the year that we pivoted to
our future. We have demonstrated 13 quarters in a row. 9 quarters of earnings beat. We had a revenue beat in the
quarter. It was an exclamation mark. That's the result. Howard and Jim and I, working hand-in-glove with our team, our
business leaders, have put in place the enterprise of the future. Yet, if you look at the transformative deals that we put
in place for that future, whether it be the Kuwait pivot, whether it be the chlorine close, whether it be the AgroFresh
sale, whether it be, of course, the Dow Corning restructuring and, ultimately, the Dow-DuPont merger to create these
three great companies, you can't put a quarter like that together or a year like that together, unless you have a
[indiscernible] (54:00) team aligned to shareholder value, focused on margins, focused on costs, focused on
productivity, and growing that top line based on quality share.
I am very proud of Jim and Howard working closely with me. Jim, congratulations on your next step here. Howard and
Jim and I are very committed to keep delivering for you as shareholders. Just keep watching this space. Our headlines
will only be about performance, and we can't wait until we get to the merger, and then the three spins that we'll create.
Thank you, Neal.
Neal Sheorey
Thank you, Andrew. And thank you, everyone, for your questions. As always, we appreciate your interest in The Dow
