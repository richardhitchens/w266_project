MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Kathleen McCabe
Good morning, this is Kathleen McCabe, Head of Investor Relations. Welcome to our Second Quarter Earnings Call.
Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements which reflect management's current estimates or beliefs
and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially.
The presentation may also include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please see our SEC filings, including this
quarter's earnings release and financial supplement at www.morganstanley.com for a reconciliation of such non-GAAP
measures to the comparable GAAP figures and for a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties that may affect the
future results of Morgan Stanley. This presentation, which is copyrighted by Morgan Stanley and may not be

I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman.
James Patrick Gorman
Thank you, Kathleen. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The second quarter was very solid across
our businesses. We grew earnings year-over-year 34%, excluding DVA and the prior-year quarter net discrete tax
benefit, and as a result, delivered an ROE ex-DVA of 9.1% for the quarter. We also continued to execute on our
strategic plan and deliver on our stated goals. Once again, equities was a notable highlight, driven by strength in cash,
derivatives, and prime brokerage across the globe.
Banking was strong. We finished the quarter ranked number one in global IPOs, and number two in announced M&A.
In particular, we delivered strong performance in fixed income underwriting. The pipeline remains healthy.

In Fixed Income & Commodities, we continued to deliver improving results. Our fixed strategy remains unchanged,
and we continued to execute on our strategic plan to reshape Fixed Income & Commodities into a more focused
business. We have reduced balance sheet, risk weighted assets, and expenses, while maintaining a client focus
consistent with our strategy. We believe the recent two-notch upgrade and some of the developments in the competitive
landscape may give rise to additional opportunity.
In Wealth Management, we remain on plan and delivered a 23% margin. Consistent with our strategy, we also
completed the final stage of deposit on-boarding and now have close to $140 billion of deposits. We continue to deploy
those deposits as part of our bank lending strategy, an important component of our future performance and growth.
Finally, in Investment Management, we delivered a strong quarter that benefited particularly from investment gains in
Merchant Banking and Real Estate Investing. As recent market volatility, particularly given by – driven by events in
Greece and China has demonstrated, the near-term landscape can change quickly. This kind of short-term volatility
does not change our long-term strategy. While trading performance can, of course, vary meaningfully in the near term,
the stability of our fee-based businesses gives us comfort that a large portion of our business offers us a more
predictable outlook.
Furthermore, given our business mix, we're overweight the U.S. and benefit from the real and sustainable recovery that
is taking place. This balance positions us to continue to deliver for our clients and our shareholders.
With that, let me now turn the call over to Jon to discuss the quarter in detail.
Jonathan Pruzan
Thanks, James. Good morning, everyone. I will review our quarterly financial performance and business results and
then James and I will be happy to take your questions. Before I discuss the individual businesses, I will first make a few
comments on our overall performance.
Revenues were $9.7 billion in the second quarter, or $9.6 billion excluding DVA. Revenues are up nicely this quarter,
13% versus second quarter 2014, or 12% excluding DVA. Against that revenue backdrop, we were able to keep
expenses well managed, up 5% year-over-year, demonstrating operating leverage in our business.
The efficiency ratio was 72% in the second quarter, and we remain very focused on expense management, both in
terms of comp and non-comp expenses. Our effective tax rate was approximately 33% this quarter, due to our
geographic mix of earnings and given that, we would guide to you an effective tax rate of 32% for the rest of the 2015.
ROE was 9.9%, or 9.1% ex-DVA. We saw strength across certain products and geographies but still have opportunities
to improve results and we are keenly focused on our goal of delivering a sustainable 10% ROE.
Now to the businesses. Our Institutional Securities franchise showed resiliency in the face of more challenging markets
in the second quarter. We continued to see a gradual global recovery led by developed markets. Not surprisingly,
Europe was a softer market, and we expect a continuation of muted activity and volumes in the near term. We are
optimistic about growth in the U.S., and see significant client engagement in greater China.
Revenues were $5.2 billion, or $5 billion excluding DVA, down 5% and 6% versus first quarter 2015. The significant
portion of the decline is attributable to our Commodities business, where we saw less client engagement and lower
volatility. Non-interest expense was down 3% versus the first quarter. Excluding DVA, the compensation ratio was
38%, below our stated target of 39%.
In Investment Banking, we remain encouraged by the level of strategic activity and have seen an increase in the
velocity and size of deals. Deal activity is more diversified, the composition is more varied, and we have seen more
cash deals. Buyers are willing to move unilaterally, and cross-border activity is up. Investor reactions to strategic
transactions have been positive, and this has led to nearly $2 trillion in global activity year-to-date.

For the quarter, revenues in Investment Banking were $1.4 billion, up 23% sequentially. As of June 30, Morgan
Stanley ranked number one in global IPOs, number two in global announced M&A, and number four in U.S.
investment grade debt. Notable transactions in the quarter include: in advisory, Morgan Stanley acted as financial
advisor to Time Warner Cable on the announced acquisition by Charter Communications valued at $79 billion. In
equity underwriting, Morgan Stanley, as lead-left bookrunner, priced Fitbit's $841 million IPO. At $841 million, Fitbit
is the largest consumer electronics IPO in history. This transaction highlights Morgan Stanley's continued leadership in
transformative technology IPOs.
In fixed income underwriting, we acted as lead-left bookrunner on AbbVie's six-tranche $16.7 billion debt offering to
finance its previously announced acquisition. We delivered related debt, equity, and risk management solutions around
this offering. This transaction is a great example of our ability to deliver solutions for clients across M&A, capital
markets, and risk products, as well as the power of our partnership with MUFG, who was involved in the initial bridge
loan.
Turning to the individual businesses. Advisory revenues of $423 million decreased 10% versus the first quarter, driven
by a decrease in the Americas and EMEA, partially offset by increases in Asia.
Underwriting revenues were strong at $1 billion, driven by a pick-up in primary equity issuance and an industry record
for quarterly new issue volumes for U.S. investment grade debt, which was aided by an uptick in M&A-related
financing.
Equity underwriting revenues were up 59% versus first quarter, primarily reflecting increases in follow-ons, secondary
sales, and IPOs.
Fixed income underwriting revenues were up 34% versus a strong first quarter. The pipelines are healthy, and while the
third quarter historically may be seasonally lighter for capital markets, we think longer-term positive trends remain
intact.
In equity sales and trading, our global footprint continues to serve us well. We saw particular strength in Asia, where
we have leading market position, and cash volumes were up significantly. Performance in the U.S. continued to be
strong, led by prime brokerage and derivatives. Equity sales and trading had another excellent quarter with $2.3 billion
of revenue, driven by high levels of client activity across all products.
Prime brokerage revenues increased in all regions quarter-over-quarter and derivative revenues remain strong but were
down off of the first quarter.
Our first-half results in equities are a testament to the strength of our equity franchise and leadership team. We believe
that we have a number one global position year-to-date, driven by our focus on clients and best-in-class execution. We
are confident in our position and strategy, although results will be a function of client activity and volumes.
In Fixed Income & Commodities this quarter, we further executed on our stated strategy. We remain focused on
reshaping and optimizing this business, as well as on efficiency in how we manage all resources.
For the quarter, Fixed Income & Commodities' sales and trading revenues were $1.3 billion excluding DVA, down
33% versus the first quarter. As I noted before, a significant portion of the decline is attributable to our Commodities
business where we saw less client engagement and lower client activity. We also saw declines in EMEA off of a very
strong first quarter, which included the benefit of the start of QE. Our rates business performed well, although down
from the first quarter, while the environment for our traditionally strong credit businesses remains softer.
We continue to be disciplined on risk-weighted assets and ended the quarter at $157 billion of FIC RWAs. A
meaningful portion of this decline was driven by a reduction in risk, as client activity decreased, while Greece
dominated the headlines in the middle of June, as well as our continued passive roll-off. We anticipate variability in
RWAs as clients re-engage and reestablish risk positions, while staying below our target of $180 billion.
During the quarter, consistent with our strategy of exiting physical oil, we also announced the sale of our Global Oil
Merchanting business and expect that to close later this year.

We have dramatically reshaped our business at the same time that the market and our competitors are going through
significant disruption, which brings both opportunities and challenges. We have reduced head count, balance sheet, and
RWAs, while remaining a full service, global fixed income partner to our top clients. Rebuilding the business takes
time; but year-to-date, we have shown progress, in particular, in rates and foreign exchange, though there's more work
to be done.
Other revenues are up versus last quarter, driven primarily by fees and marks on our lending and event book.
Lastly, average trading VAR for the second quarter was $54 million, up slightly, driven by increased client activity and
choppier markets.
Turning to Wealth Management. Our view remains positive as the recovery further plays out in the U.S. We see steady
performance in our business, with growth coming from our bank strategy and fee-based programs. Revenues for the
quarter were up 1% sequentially. Asset management revenues were up 3% from last quarter, driven by higher fee-based
client balances from positive flows. Global-based asset inflows were $13.9 billion, bringing total fee-based client assets
to $813 billion at quarter end, representing 40% of client assets.
We continue to see softness in transactional revenues, which were down 8% compared to last quarter, as retail investor
activity has yet to increase from subdued levels. Consistent with the execution of our U.S. bank strategy, net interest
revenue increased 7% to $737 million, driven by growth in lending and realization of the forward curve in our
investment securities portfolio. Wealth Management lending balances grew $4 billion, or 10% from the prior quarter.
Non-interest expenses were essentially flat to last quarter and the compensation ratio was 57%, driven by increases in
non-compensable revenues. As James mentioned in his comments, the PBT margin was 23%. Deposits in our bank
deposit program were $132 billion, down versus the first quarter, reflecting seasonality. Wealth Management
representatives were down 1% versus the first quarter.
In Investment Management, revenues were up 12% sequentially, driven by gains in the Real Estate and Merchant
Banking business, and total AUM ended the quarter at $403 billion.
Turning to balance sheet and capital, total assets were $825 billion at June 30, down from $829 billion at the end of the
first quarter. In the last few weeks of June, the balance sheet came down as clients took risk off due to disruptions in
the market.
Our global liquidity reserve at the end of the quarter was $188 billion compared with $195 billion at the end of the first
quarter. Our capital ratios continue to strengthen. Reflecting our best estimates of the Federal Reserve final rules, our
pro forma common equity Tier 1 ratio using the Basel III fully phased-in advanced approach was 12.5% at June 30. Pro
forma fully phased-in Basel 3 advanced RWAs are expected to be approximately $429 billion, down from $448 billion
in the first quarter. We estimate our pro forma supplementary leverage ratio under the US final rule to be approximately
5.3% at June 30, up from 5.1% at the end of the first quarter. All of these estimates are preliminary and subject to
revisions.
During the second quarter, we repurchased $625 million of common stock or approximately 16 million shares, under
our 2015 CCAR-approved higher level, and our Board declared a $0.15 dividend per share. To close my prepared
remarks, we saw two different quarters in 2015 in terms of market dynamics, client activity, and volatility. Our global
footprint and business mix were able to deliver stable results throughout these two quarters.
With that, we will open up the line to questions.

<Q - Glenn Paul Schorr>: Hi, thanks very much. So you've done well across just about every business. What I'm
trying to get a feel for is how much seasonality we should think about. I know that's always hard to answer, but
between Asian equities so strong and second half usual seasonality and FIC and the big results in Merchant Banking
and real estate, I'm just looking for any guidance on how much of that we should expect moderating in the second half
just on seasonality.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Well, great. I think as you said, Glenn, the business was much more balanced in the first half
across all of our businesses and all of our products and all of our geographies. In terms of seasonality, all I would say is
from a capital market's perspective, the third quarter is usually seasonally slower, but that's all I would really comment.
<Q - Glenn Paul Schorr>: Maybe on the Merchant Bank and the Real Estate, is that a function of sales or is it just a
really good environment and having things to mark up?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Yeah, I think as you point out in Merchant Banking and our real estate business, we did see
good principal gains in the quarter. It was a combination of both marks and distributions and it's been a good
environment for monetizations here.
<Q - Glenn Paul Schorr>: James noted the two-notch upgrade in May may help in FIC. Can we talk specifically
where, and maybe also just flesh out within FIC, normally your great and strong credit shop. Obviously, that was
weaker, but your results held up really well to your point on rates and FX. Have – do you feel like you've fully
transitioned to a more balanced business?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: There were a lot of questions in there. In terms of the Moody's upgrade, as we've said, we've
gotten some positive feedback from our clients. We were pleased with that result, but I wouldn't necessarily tie the
upgrade to any specific level of performance in FIC. The balance – the business was much balanced – much more
balanced in the first half across products and geographies. You did point out that our historically strong credit
businesses and SBG businesses are a little bit softer. We did see strong results across regions and rates in the first half.
The FX business was strong in the first quarter, given the positive trend and volatility in the U.S.- Euro FX movements,
that did come down a little bit in the second quarter as currencies traded in a tighter band and there was more muted
volumes, but it was still a strong quarter for us. So I don't – I wouldn't say that we're done here, but we're clearly
pleased with the progress that we made and there's more to be done.
<Q - Glenn Paul Schorr>: Okay. Thanks so much.

Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Good morning.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Good morning.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: So starting out in capital markets – and Glenn touched on this a little bit, Asian
strength definitely a driver again this quarter. Maybe can you help us understand how much of a tailwind that was, and
then also, given some of the volatility we've seen since the end of the second quarter, how are clients reacting to that,
and what's your expectation for continued strength in the region?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Sure, first, I would comment our Asia Pacific results and business were strong across all of
our businesses – equity, fixed income, and investment banking this quarter. We do have a diversified business not only
in China, but across all of Asia. So it's not just China and it's really all products. We did benefit from activity levels
being higher in China this quarter. We did see – excuse me, we did see increased volatility there, but given the
liberalization of the capital markets in that region, we have seen significant increases in investor interest in the region.
It's obviously a large and important region and has significant growth opportunities there, so we would expect that level
of engagement to continue.

We saw lots of volatility in the second quarter. I would say that was more broadly dominated with some macro
headlines towards the end of the year, not just in China. So we did see, as we said, risk positions come down and client
engagement slow down a little bit in the back half of June and early parts of July. I would say we have started to see
some of those headlines die down and a little bit more stability in some of the volatility indexes come down,
particularly in US and in Europe. So we are starting to see some more re-engagement by our clients and our investors,
but I wouldn't – I would say it's a little too early to say anything about the quarter, but we feel good about the client
activity and the client engagement.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Okay. Great. Thanks for that. And then on FIC, clearly year-to-date results have
bounced back nicely. What's your view on returns in that business currently? Can you give us an idea of what returns
you've been generating here year-to-date and whether or not that is what you're hoping for in an environment like this
and how much more juice there is for continued improvement there?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Yeah. As we've mentioned many, many times, we've been focused on reshaping and
optimizing that business. We're clearly focused on improving the ROE in that business and we think we've made real
progress here in the first half. We think there is still more opportunity. Some of those opportunities include
continuation of the balance sheet optimization strategy that we have. We are very focused also on the velocity of our
balance sheet, and even though we've kept a tight lid on expenses, we still think there's more to be done in that area as
well.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: I would just add to that, that obviously we've done a lot of internal restructuring, both
in cost and in balance sheet. Clearly, we have a very focused, stable team running our FIC business. We saw the
two-notch upgrade from Moody's. As Jon said, you can't draw a direct line from that to activity, but at best – at worst,
it's neutral and at best, it's more than that, and the feedback from some clients is that over time, it will be additive. And
as others have observed in the global FIC investment banking sales trading marketplace, there's clearly more turmoil in
other parts of the world than there is in the U.S. and we think that there's potential for, over a period of time, for share
gain for our business.
So we take a long view on this. We don't really focus on – I mean, we obviously report on a quarterly basis, but we
don't get that excited quarter-to-quarter. We're more focused on how we're moving this business over a four-year or
five-year period, and obviously, the more recent results suggest it's moving in the right direction.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Yeah. No, agreed. And then, switching gears over to Wealth Management, the
continued grind-down in comp expense, how much of that – is that purely mix-driven? And then, as we start to see
some rate tailwind here, God willing, that only continues to support the mix shift, right? And then, when you think
about your loan-to-deposit ratio, it's still low, so should we think about any change in loan growth with Citi's deposits
all onboarded now?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: So I think in our Wealth Management business, the drivers are still pretty consistent what
we've seen in prior quarters, both in terms of the fee-based businesses, as well as the deposit deployment and the
improvement in NII. We think that both of those trends will continue. We had been very focused on the expense side of
the equation. We've been benefiting from increasing NII, and therefore non-compensable revenues. I believe the
expense ratio came in – the comp expense ratio came in at 57% this quarter. Our stated target is 55, so we will continue
to drive towards that target. PBT margin was 23%, so that was up nicely from the second quarter. In terms of the our
deposit deployment strategy and our excess liquidity in our banks, we still think that has room to play out and that will
be a continuation and the primary driver of our NII growth going forward. We saw $4 billion of loan lending balances
increases in the Wealth Management business this quarter. We saw lending balances increase about $6 billion in
totality, so we had about $2 billion of growth from our Institutional Securities client, and we see that trend continuing
as well. So again, a nice steady quarter in Wealth Management and we would expect those trends to continue.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Great. Thanks for all of that color, and congrats on the solid momentum.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous. Please go ahead.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Good morning. So, we hear some commentary about potential for fixed share gains,
obviously there was some press a few weeks ago about whether or not there was a strategic change. At the same time,
I'm looking at capital balances in Institutional and they're down about a couple of billion dollars this quarter. And I was
wondering if you could help us understand how the two things are trading off, the potential for, perhaps, more FIC
engagement and market share, and on the other hand the decline in the capital that's allocated to the Institutional
Securities group.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Well, let me just start with talking about the strategic issue, and given that it was in the
press and it's being raised and I tried to address in my opening comments, it's a good example of don't believe
everything you read in the newspaper. And I read a lot of things in the newspaper, and now knowing the facts, I've
learned not to believe all of them. What is true is that we did have a two-notch upgrade. What is also true is that a
number of institutions are going through a relook/restructure in their fixed income businesses, which is obviously
public. And thirdly, what is true is that we've been through that process over the last several years, and feel like we
have a business right-sized where the risk-weighted assets have come down from – I don't know, Guy, about four years
ago, there were $390 billion, I think, in FIC, and there we just reported somewhere close in the $160 billions, maybe
even lower than that.
So, we're – what we've said is the strategy is not changing. That doesn't mean that we won't get more velocity on sheet.
That doesn't mean we're not going to be more efficient providers, and it doesn't mean that we won't pick up share and it
doesn't mean that as these markets continue to grow off relatively low volumes, there won't be more opportunity for us
on the revenue side. So, it's – we're not trying to make it more complicated than that. This was a very solid quarter, not
a sensational quarter in FIC. Obviously, the fact we were up year-over-year was important, but also to be honest, a year
ago, we had a relatively light quarter. So we wanted to be up and we needed to be up, and we proved we could be.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Just a follow-up on the reduction in capital that's allocated currently to Institutional
Securities, is that as simple as what you talked about in the opening remarks, that the balance sheet was smaller at the
end of the quarter and it was going to kind of bounce around that way, or is there something more strategic going on
with respect to, for example, runoff of some of those legacy positions that you were talking about that's driving down
that FIC RWA that's driving the almost $2 billion reduction in capital NIS?
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Well, there's certainly nothing strategic going on behind it. I'll let Jon talk about where
we ended with the capital in the quarter.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Guy, I think your first comments were accurate regarding the balance sheet usage.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay, fair enough. And then just to follow up on that, a $1 billion increase in what's
allocated to Wealth Management, whether we will get average common equity or common equity Tier 1 linked quarter,
what's driving that?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Yeah, well, again, in terms of those disclosures, I think you see a couple of things here. The
parent is increased driven by the [ph] last (29:00) segment usage, as we just talked about, plus the earnings accretion
that we had, and then the mix is driven by each segment's relative contribution to the total.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Fair enough. And then just one more thing that was topical for investors during the quarter
based on your 10-Q, and I know you addressed it a little bit at your conference a few weeks ago, but maybe you can
talk a little bit about the decline in interest rate sensitivity that was evident in your Q, the degree to which that might
have reflected just a difference in asset deployment strategy, securities versus loans, whatever, and whether there are
any risk management elements that we need to think about with respect to the change there.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Sure. I think there's a couple of different questions in there, and maybe I can try to address
them in two parts. First would just be our overall interest rate position and how we think about NII, and then the second

part of the question really, around the disclosures.
Let me address the first one. As you heard from James, the onboarding of the Citi deposits came to a conclusion this
quarter. We brought on a little over $4 billion in the quarter and that program has now run its course. The NII was up
nicely and we expect a continuation of that trend. The primary driver of that, as we have said before, is the deposit
deployment strategy. If you look in the supplement, you'll see that our investment portfolio was down about $5 billion
this quarter, and our lending balances were up $6 billion. I mentioned $4 billion of that from Wealth Management
clients and $2 billion from Institutional Securities clients. That's obviously critically important because as you
remember from our January presentation where we laid out some illustrative asset yields, you saw that our lending
products were generating 150 basis points to 250 basis points more of yield than our AFS or cash or short-term
investments. So, that is the primary driver of the improvements in NII.
We are also starting to see the natural runoff in our investment portfolio being reinvested in higher rates, and the
realization of the forward curve, that's a couple billion dollars a quarter.
And then lastly, just on our overall interest rate positioning, our NII growth and results are in line and consistent with
where we were in the beginning of the year in terms of our views.
On the actual disclosure that we have in the Q, a couple of comments there. First, you should know that we don't
manage to any individual rate scenario or rate shock. Instead, we're trying to optimize across a range of plausible
outcomes.
The second comment about that disclosure is, you know it's a 12-month disclosure and we're clearly focused on a
longer-term view when we think about our balance sheet and our interest rate positioning. That disclosure, as you
know, is an instantaneous and parallel shock above the base case. So, it is our 12-month forward NII base case. The
important thing to realize there is that our base case includes two critical things: one of them is our own, which is our
deposit deployment strategy, which is the primary driver of our NII growth; and the second is we use the implied
forward curve, and today, the implied forward curve has two 25-basis points increases in the Fed fund rate. So we have
captured much of our NII expectations already in our base case.
And the last point I would make is that that number and that disclosure is going to move around as we manage our
overall interest rate risk in the bank.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Great. That's actually all really helpful color. I appreciate you taking the time.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Great. Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Hi. My first question's on Wealth Management. You said you have $140 billion of deposits of
what's left to redeploy, and we estimate a Wealth Management net interest margin of 2%. What would you consider a
normal NIM for that business?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: So, in terms of the first part of your question, Michael, I think as we said, the deposit
deployment strategy is one of the critical strategies in Wealth, and we still think that that has plenty of room to play out
here. We still have excess liquidity in the bank and we will be redeploying those cash balances into the lending product
for the foreseeable future.
I'm sorry, the second part of the question?
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Yeah, what is your NIM in the Wealth Management business? We're estimating 2%, but if you
want to clarify that, but what do you think is a normal margin for lending in Wealth Management?

<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: That's really a hard question. As you know, we do have an overall bank strategy. Part of that
benefit of having the bank appears in Wealth Management, part of it appears in other parts of our businesses. So, that's
not really how we look at it. We're obviously focused on the overall PBT in that margin – excuse me, PBT in that
business, which came in at 23%, which as we said before was up nicely, and we continue to hopefully make progress in
that going into the future quarters.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: So where do you hope the 23% ratio to go over time?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: We've stated in the beginning of the year that our target is between 22% and 25% for the
year. We're obviously inside of that target, and we're going to continue to try to make progress there, both on the
revenue side and the expense side.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: All right. Let me switch to Institutional Securities. Prime brokerage, you said has gone up in all
regions, and we lack some transparency to see some of the data underneath. Can you just give us some sense as to
whether it's market share or percentage increase or really just why? We know many clients left during the crisis. Is that
still a factor, people coming back, or what's underlying reason for that growth?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Listen, I think the underlying reason for the growth in all of our business is our client
engagement and client activity. We've just seen a significant pick-up around the world and around the globe in terms of
engagement with our clients, and we're there to meet our clients' needs, and that's why we've seen the growth in our
balances.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay. How about just a general question? The ROE on a core basis is 9%. And that's below
some of your peers, and I know the target's to get over 10%, but why is the ROE still under 10% when half of your
company is a lot more annuity-like than some of your peers – referring to Wealth Management, Asset Management
being half, your ROE is still under 10%. If you were to give the three main reasons why that's the case or why it should
change, what would it be?
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Well, Mike, firstly, I admire your consistency in coming back to this question every
quarter, and it's obviously something which remains a focus for us. Reason number one, not to be facetious, is what our
earnings are, reason number two is what our capital is, and reason number three is what are ability to redeploy that
capital back to shareholders is, as driven, in large part, by the CCAR process. So, in short, we have a high-class
problem, we're not capital short. If anything, we're capital-heavy. We continue to accrete capital as we have already this
year, significantly above what our presumed payout and buyback plans are. So, our ability to grow our ROE is both a
function of the improved earnings the firm is generating, and the ability to right-size our capital base for the business
mix and model that we have.
Through the first half of this year, I think our ROE is running at about 11% – sorry, 10%, not including the first quarter
tax gain which we had, and as we've said publicly, we believe we should be running 10%-plus ROE business. When we
get to that point, we'll lay out further goals and objectives above it, but this has obviously been – if you look back over
the last four years and you strip out some of the one-time, whether it was MBIA, or whether it was Revel, whether it
was the treatment of the deferred comp, whether it was some of the big litigation with Department of Justice, FHFA,
you take all of those things out, essentially the last four years, our ROEs have gone from 2%, 4%, 6%, 8%, pretty much
in lockstep, and, as I said, the first half of this year, we're running right on 10%, 9.1% this quarter, I think 11% in the
first quarter.
So, nothing more to say. Nothing more to project. We're as intently focused on this as you are, but we – it's a function
of controlling both the numerator and the denominator, and the denominator is a little more complicated given the
regulatory world we live in, as you obviously know.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: All right, thank you.

Your next question comes from Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Good morning, Jon. Good morning, James.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Good morning.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Good morning.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: So, a couple of questions on the longer-term prospects of the Wealth Management business. So,
on the comp ratio, just like to get your thoughts on the competitive implications of driving the ratio below 55%. I do
appreciate a lot of that is lending-related, but I would imagine some of it also includes some comp rationalization. In
what is a hypercompetitive environment for advisor recruitment does a lower comp ratio affect your ability to keep or
track high quality advisors?
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Let me deal with that because it's got a long-term aspect which obviously, we think a
lot about. Firstly, the reduction of the comp ratio is overwhelmingly driven by the business FICs as in non-compensable
revenues and by the cost structure non-compensation expenses that we've realized some benefits in scale coming out of
the integration a couple of years ago of the Smith Barney deal.
The changes to the compensation for financial advisors and support staff actually has been very modest, and – but at
the same time, I would say the recruiting environment, the ins and outs has also been very modest. That is not – it
might feel hypercompetitive because some of the wires run every time somebody moves from one firm to another, they
run a story on it, but actually, in the size of these firms now, the competitive environment on recruiting is really pretty
stable. So that's not what's going to be the big driver here. We're not changing the compensation models for financial
advisors to drive those kinds of economics. It's really business mix, and it's the scalability of the business. Once you
cover your fixed costs, the margins obviously improve.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Interesting. So maybe just another question on that business, and advisor growth remains weak,
and you have talked about trimming the lower producing FAs. But I'd like to get your thoughts on maybe growing that
business by another transformative M&A deal – a number of European banks have very subscale presence in the U.S.,
businesses that look like they could fit very well with yours. We would like to get your thoughts on maybe the appetite
for another deal, and any pros and cons of doing a deal.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Well, Christian, I admire the question, but we obviously wouldn't talk about deals on a
call or corporate strategy like that, but suffice it to say, we're very comfortable with the business we've got and the size
of the business, and we think the opportunity to improve margin with the business we have, particularly by building out
the bank and by organic growth within the businesses is extremely attractive to us. We had a desire to get to scale, and
we are well and truly at scale. So we feel good about that.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: I appreciate that. Just wanted to get maybe pros and cons of doing a deal, but I hear you. And
then, just one last clean-up question, on other revenues within ISG, could you quantify how much loan marks
contributed to revenues there?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: No, again, I think that the primary driver was the marks on the loan in the event book but I
think that's where we'll leave it.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Okay. Thank you, guys.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Thanks.

of 2015, you were still thinking you're going to have $25 billion to write off. Has that changed at all?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Well, I would characterize the reduction in RWAs in FIC really, a meaningful portion of that
was a decrease in client activity going into and through the Greek situation. There was some passive rolloff, but it was
really a mix of those two things and more geared towards the risk reduction of our clients.
<Q - Fiona M. Swaffield>: But should we still [indiscernible] (42:46)?
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Did you hear that?
<A - Kathleen McCabe>: Sorry, I think we've lost you, Fiona. Fiona?
<Q - Fiona M. Swaffield>: Okay. Hi. Can you hear me?
<A - Kathleen McCabe>: Yes, we can hear you now.
<Q - Fiona M. Swaffield>: I was just checking whether we should still take the $157 billion and assume that $25
billion could roll off from the end of 2015.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: No, I would tell you that two things, one we've got a stated target of $180 billion of FIC
RWA in that business. We're going to clearly operate within that target. The actual quarter-to-quarter RWA, this is
really just going to be a function of the macro backdrop client activity and supporting our clients. So that number can
move around, but we're clearly going to operate within our target.
<Q - Fiona M. Swaffield>: Okay. Thanks very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Hi, good morning.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Good morning.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: So I was hoping to dig a little bit deeper into some of the – into the SLR, in particular. It
looks like you've reduced leverage exposure by 7% since the 1Q 2014 peak, so you continue to make the good progress
there. But just given the Fed's proposal from Friday, which suggests that the SLR will likely be incorporated in CCAR,
I just want to get a better sense as to how much incremental SLR mitigation potential you see on the horizon, especially
given the backdrop for at least the planned strategy to continue to grow Morgan Stanley Bank?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Well, as you noted, the SLR did increase from the 5.1% to the 5.3%. That was a combination
of both some movement in the numerator and the denominator. On the numerator, we obviously had the earnings
accretion from the quarter; and on the denominator, not only did the balance sheet come down, but we also made some
progress on the SLR add-ons. We're clearly comfortable with that ratio where it is today. That rule doesn't go into
effect until 2018 and I would tell you that we're going to continue to manage our business across all of our capital ratios
and continue to remain focused on having enough capital to grow our business
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Okay. And as a follow-up to that, Jon, just thinking more broadly when you look at the
current regulatory landscape and the multiple constraints that you're managing to, what do you believe longer-term
represents Morgan Stanley's binding constraint and how does that inform your strategy in terms of where you see
opportunities to better optimize those ratios?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Well, again, it's a complex question because we have multiple ratios. Clearly in terms of
capital return, our binding constraint is CCAR. CCAR continues to evolve year-over-year, and we're going to continue
to do our best to manage our capital ratio so we can return capital to our shareholders, as well as continue to grow our
business.

<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Okay. Thanks. And just one more from me on capital. With the Fed's proposal from Friday
suggesting that the advanced approach will be deferred indefinitely in CCAR, I would appreciate if you could disclose,
A, the current level of standardized RWAs; and B, how we should think about the trajectory in standardized RWA in
the context of some of the mitigation targets that you've laid out in the past.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: In terms of the – I think we mentioned in my remarks that the advanced RWAs was about
$429 billion on a preliminary basis. Standardized is pretty close to that; it's about $420 billion. We have seen those
numbers converge over the last several quarters. In terms of the proposal that was put out on Friday, clearly having
clarity and simplification around some of the initiatives is very helpful.
The delay in the SLR, as you said, the delay in the advanced approach, as well as the removal of the Basel I test is
helpful for us and positive for 2016. We spend a lot of time and energy on CCAR, and any time there are changes, we
obviously have to go through a process of model validation and pattern recognition. And so when there are fewer
changes, it is easier for us just to continue running those models as we have been doing in the past.
But overall, I think it's too early to comment on the overall 2016 CCAR. This is, A, only a proposal; B, we haven't seen
the scenarios or the final instructions. So while this has been positive because it keeps the model similar to what it was
last year, it's too early to comment overall on the process.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Right. Understood, Jon. Appreciate you taking my questions.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Good morning. Thanks, guys. First question, just on the expenses and the operating
leverage, just looking year-over-year, I think your revenues are up around 12%, expenses up 5%; the margins are
around 27%, 28%. So, just when you think about going forward in a positive revenue environment, just wanted to get
an update on some of the targets that you had for like the comp ratios by segment. And probably more importantly, on
the non-comp side, because that's been fairly well managed. There's obviously been some volatility around legal in the
past. But just when you think about areas where you're still working on inefficiencies versus some incremental spend in
the business, whether it's on growth or regulatory initiatives, just wanted to get an outlook on like incremental margins
in a positive revenue trending environment.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Sure. I think there are a couple of questions there. In January, James laid out specific comp
targets. They were 39% in ISG; we were at 38% for the quarter. They were 55% in Wealth Management; as I
mentioned, they were at 57% in the quarter. And we laid out a target of below 40% in Investment Management; and it's
running slightly above that, I think about 41%. So, again, tightly managing compensation.
On non-comp, in terms of targets, I'm not sure we have specific targets but we, as I said, been very focused on
non-comp expenses. We've been trying to support the business growth, so the level of activity will drive that number.
Obviously the level of regulatory change will also drive that number, but we've been very focused on keeping a tight lid
on expenses and we will continue to do that going forward.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: And I would just add that the – what should be obvious to everybody is these
businesses are enormously scalable. Once you've covered your fixed costs, you'd be hard pressed to grow your
non-comp expenses. Absent legal, you'd be hard pressed to grow at the pace of what the revenues grew at in the last
quarter. So, we're going to keep that discipline.
Obviously, as Jon said, there are certain parts, like brokerage and clearing, certain marketing development, which do go
up as revenues go up. But there's a heck of a lot of it that doesn't, which gives you the incremental margin is always
going to be higher than the existing margin.

<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Okay. That's helpful. And then, just a quick follow-up on the Wealth Management
business, just two things there. Just on the transaction revenues, what type of an environment would you start to see
that pick up? Because it's been a couple of quarters and it hasn't been just you guys, it's been more the industry. But just
wanted to get what do you think the big driver, the weakness there is.
And then second is just on the DOL proposal, the comment period I think is getting ready to close. So just wanted to
get an update on your guys' view on some of the challenges or the opportunities if that proceeds into the back half of
this year.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Sure. In terms of the Wealth business in the transaction line, as we've stated, the retail
investor is still somewhat on the sidelines. I think what changes that is a function of consumer confidence, whether
that's acceleration of the GDP growth, whether that's rising rates, but I think we need to see some more confidence
before the retail investor sort of totally re-engages. So, that would be on the first question.
On the second question, on DOL. You did highlight that the comment period comes to a close tomorrow. As you know,
that is a complicated rule and the comment period was actually extended 'til tomorrow because there's been a lot of
industry dialog and a lot written on it.
FINRA Chairman, Richard Ketchum, recently spoke about his idea of a single standard. So to have a single standard
across all products and accounts and not treat anything differently, like a 401(k) or an IRA, and we think that makes
sense. Our clients clearly want choice and we would support an approach that gives our ability to deliver that choice to
our clients. So, we'll see where the final rule comes out.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Good morning.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Good morning.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Most of my questions have been answered, but I had a follow-up. I think I asked it
last quarter. The amount of long-term debt you have coming through the next 12 months; there's a good disclosure here
showing it's $27 billion. But what's the difference in the long-term debt rate that's on the balance sheet versus what you
get on new issuance? Obviously rates have come down. The two-notch upgrade helps. How much revenue benefit or
reduction in interest expense occurs as debt rolls off and you get to reissue at a lower rate?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: So, a couple of things. One, you saw in the first half, we did – we issued about $23 billion.
We took advantage of some very attractive markets and we tried to front load our issuance, so we would expect our
issuance in the back half of the year to be lower.
In terms of the rate or the cost of that debt, I think one way I look at it is if you think of the WAM of our debt stack in
2010 was about five years. So, if I look back at 2010 to look where we were issuing debt at that time, it was on an
average of about Treasuries plus 210bp, so our credit spread's about 210 basis points over. That is the debt that is
maturing today and our new issue – excuse me, our credit spreads today are closer to 120bp; so, T plus 120bp.
So, we are clearly getting a benefit as our more expensive debt rolls off, recognize that that roll-off is not our entire
debt stack. We have over $155 billion of unsecured debt. And so, that benefit will accrue over time, but that's sort of a
magnitude for you.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Hey, good morning. My question was pretty similar to Matt. Just if you can give us sort of an
update of where you are in your target of reducing funding costs by 25% in the context of the debt issuance
conversation? Are we close? 50% of the way? Just so you can give us a sense of how much more we can expect on the
lower funding costs.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Again, I think I tried to answer that question when Matt asked it. I would just say we
continue to see a benefit. And until we run through the entire debt stack, we're going to just keep getting that benefit
over time quarter-over-quarter.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: But you don't want to give us, like, you're 50% of the way there, 75% of the way there?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Correct.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Matthew Hart Burnell>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Jon, maybe a question for you on the
Wealth Management loan growth and deposit growth now that the Citi transfers are effectively done. What are you
expecting for deposit growth within the bank and what are you expecting for the growth rate, particularly within the
retail side of the loan growth in Wealth Management? It's been running about 40% annualized. Is – other than just the
fact that the denominator is growing, is there any reason to think that that would slow at any point over the next six to
12 months?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Oh, yeah. I mean, again, I'll answer that last question first. The law of large numbers, that
growth rate will come down; but in terms of our FA penetration and our client penetration, it continues to improve
quarter-over-quarter.
I think we've designed some very unique products for our Wealth Management clients and we've had really good take
up, both on the SBL product, as well as the mortgage product. And I think we feel good about the growth rates that
we've seen and our ability to penetrate our client base. So, we're comfortable with the growth that we're seeing and we
will continue to see. And then again, I'm sorry, I forgot your second – your first question.
<Q - Matthew Hart Burnell>: Just in terms of your expectations for deposit growth now that the Citi transfers are
done.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Yeah, as I mentioned, we did see some seasonality for tax season in the deposit number this
quarter. We still have significant excess liquidity that we're going to be deploying. I think Greg has mentioned some of
the innovation we're doing around digital cash management and payment solutions. So, we think that will be ultimately
a good driver for growth. But right now, in terms of our deposit balances, we have excess deposits that we can deploy
without requiring deposit balance, but we're going to continue to try to penetrate our client base and grow those
deposits with some new products going forward.
<Q - Matthew Hart Burnell>: Okay. And then if I can just move over to the Institutional loan -Institutional Securities
loan portfolio, that's actually growing in some cases faster than in the Wealth Management side of things. But I found it
interesting that the percentage of the loans that are investment-grade are also growing. Can you give us a little more
color as to where you're seeing opportunities within the Institutional Securities portfolio?

<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Sure. As I mentioned, we had about $2 billion of growth in the Institutional Securities
balances this quarter. What we've seen certainly in some of the M&A and the event financing, we've seen a shift more
towards investment-grade borrowers. There's – we've seen a pick-up in strategic activity, so that's a driver. I would say
that the growth has been balanced between our products, in terms of the warehouse lending facility as well as some of
our other corporate products. But that shift in investment-grade is really being driven by the event book.
<Q - Matthew Hart Burnell>: Okay. Thanks very much.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Thank you.
Kathleen McCabe
Thank you, everyone, for your time. With that, we'll bring our Second Quarter Earnings Call to a close, and we look
forward to speaking to you again next quarter.
