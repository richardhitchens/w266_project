Thank you, Lee, and good morning to everyone. We want to thank you for joining us to review our first quarter results.
Today, we reported $2.7 billion in earnings this quarter or $0.21 per diluted share. As you can see in the results, two
large items impacted this quarter's results. We recorded negative market-related NII adjustments for bond premium
amortization. That adjustment alone cost $0.07 per diluted share. And we also recorded a $0.05 per share diluted share
cost of seasonal retirement-eligible incentives.
When you think about revenue, net interest income, excluding that bond premium adjustment, was $10.6 billion this
quarter. This is improvement linked-quarter and year-over-year. Our loans are growing across the franchise and,
compared to the prior year, are up 11% in our business segments. In addition, deposit growth remains very strong. Our
deposits were up $64 billion from last year or 6% to over $1.2 trillion. This growth reflects our progress to grow
responsibly and deepen relationships with all of our core customers.
Moving to non-interest income, it declined year-over-year. Of note, the downdraft in that was driven by capital markets
and related activities, and, to a lesser degree, mortgage servicing and other fees, as we continue to wind down our
third-party servicing book. However, the other banking source of the non-interest income were relatively stable.
Switching to costs, we continue to drive costs down in the company. Costs year-over-year in the first quarter were
down 6%. FTEs were down 3%. That is $1 billion per quarter, $4 billion on an annualized basis. And if you focus just
on the core costs, excluding LAS and litigation, those were down $600 million quarter – from first quarter of last year
or $2.4 billion annualized. We're going to keep driving costs down as we continue to move forward through 2016.
Turning to slide three and looking at the business segment earnings, you can see the good year-over-year results
because of the operating leverage in those businesses. The only exception is the results in Global Banking, which were
negatively impacted by the increased energy-related reserves.
The combination of business segments, outside the All Other group, earned $4.5 billion in quarter one this year
compared to $3.9 billion in quarter one of 2015. Offsetting those earnings were the $1.9 billion loss in All Other. That
loss primarily reflects the two large adjustments I mentioned earlier and some legacy litigation costs. You could also
see the returns and efficiency ratios for each of our segments and note, with the exception of LAS, which came close to
breaking even this quarter, they earned above their cost of capital.
Moving to slide four. During the first quarter, there was a lot of talk with the market volatility accompanied by and
surrounding the question about global growth and the forward-looking economic picture. However, we don't see any
evidence of our customer base changing. Spending by our consumers remains strong and is up year-over-year over 4%.
Loan demand remains solid throughout the franchise and we continue to position our company to face any potential
economic outcome.
When you think about this, this is important to remember the work we've done over the past years to simplify and
strengthen our foundation. We remain a different company today than that which had entered the last downturn. We
started with a clear strategy to serve the core financial needs of the customers. We've gotten out of businesses,
portfolios, products and client relationships that don't meet those strategic goals. We simplified the company in every
area. We cut the number of the legal entities in half and we also reduced costs through programs like New BAC, that
produced a loan more than $8 billion in annual savings, and our SIM program, which continues to operate today.
At the same time, we've continued to invest in the areas where we can grow, $3 billion in technology-related growth
initiatives, especially in areas of digital practice, whether it's in Consumer Banking, commercial banking, where we
lead the industry with mobile and online platforms. We've also invested more in client-facing teammates, funding that
investment through elimination of bureaucracy and simplification, and the elimination of management jobs. We believe
that we have to continue to drive their productivity and we'll continue to do so in 2016.
In the end, when you think about all of this, it makes our company more resolvable. As you all know, we received the
latest input from our regulators on our resolution plans yesterday. Those plans were filed nine months ago and we've
been busy at work since the day they were filed to continue to remedy the deficiencies and shortcomings stated in those
plans and we will do so by the October submission date.

As we move to slide five, you can also see the financial foundation that we've built in this company. Liquidity and
capital at record levels. Tangible book value per share, the marker of what we as shareholders own our company, now
stands at $16.17 and has improved over $5 a share over the last few years even as we've taken the hits that are now
largely behind us.
Our funding structure continues to improve. Long-term debt has been cut dramatically, deposits have increased over
20% and most of that growth is coming through our Consumer Banking and Wealth Management segments. Our loan
book is now well-balanced, half consumer, half commercial; and importantly, the consumer piece is much more
secured lending than it was before the last crisis.
As we look in Global Markets, whether it's our Level III assets, which are more risky, the total trading assets or VaR,
they're all down significantly over the last few years. So as you can see, we've simplified our company and our
operating structure. As we look ahead to 2016, we remain focused on what we can control. We intend to keep driving
the core customer activity you see in the loan and deposit and customer flow growth in each and every business,
focusing intently on the Wealth Management and Global Markets businesses to take advantage as markets have
stabilized. We'll continue to drive on focusing on costs and drive those costs down, and we'll continue to drive to
deliver more capital to you as we did in the first quarter as investors.
With that, let me hand it over to Paul.
Paul M. Donofrio
Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us. Starting on slide six, we present a summary of the
income statement and returns for this quarter highlighting comparisons to Q4 2015 as well as Q1 2015.
Earnings this quarter were $2.7 billion or $0.21 per share. These earnings include the negative impact of the FAS 91
market-related adjustment, which reduced EPS by $0.07. They also include $850 million of FAS 123
retirement-eligible incentive expense, which reduced EPS by $0.05. For comparative purposes, the aggregate impact of
these two same items in Q1 2015 reduced EPS by $0.08.
Revenue, on an FTE basis, was $19.7 billion this quarter. Adjusted for FAS 91, revenue was $20.9 billion, a decline of
$700 million from Q1 2015 on a similarly-adjusted basis. This decline was driven by the reduction in sales and trading
revenue and IB fees, as well as mortgage banking income, offset by improvement in adjusted NII.
Expenses were $14.8 billion, approximately $1 billion or 6% lower than a year ago, driven by good discipline across
the entire company.
Before moving to the balance sheet, I want to note an adjustment to the financial statements this quarter, reclassifying
some operating leases. We moved $6 billion of leases to other assets and we made conforming reclassifications to prior
periods to improve comparability. This reclassification had no effect on net income. However, as a result of this
reclassification, quarterly NII is lower by approximately $50 million, other income is higher by approximately $180
million and depreciation expense is higher by about $130 million. While these changes are small and don't affect
profits, I wanted to note them so that you can more easily adjust your models.
Turning to slide seven and the balance sheet, total assets increased $41 billion from Q4, driven by higher Global
Markets repo activity as well as increased cash. Deposits rose $20 billion from Q4, while loans increased $4 billion.
Driven by deposit inflows, liquidity rose to $525 billion. Time to required funding, while down, remained strong at
three years. And note that the first quarter included the $8.5 billion settlement payment to Bank of New York Mellon as
trustee in the Article 77 suit, which was reserved for over four years ago.
Tangible common equity of $167 billion improved $4.7 billion from Q4. On a per-share basis, tangible book value
increased to $16.17, up 9% from Q1 2015.
Turning to regulatory metrics, as a reminder, we report regulatory capital under the advanced approaches. Our CET1
transition ratio under Basel 3 ended the quarter at 10.3% and really is only comparable to Q4 as prior periods were

reported under the Standardized approach prior to our exit from parallel run.
On a fully phased-in basis, CET1 capital improved $3.4 billion to $158 billion as improvements from earnings and OCI
were partially offset by dividends and repurchases. Under the Advanced approaches, compared to Q4 2015, the CET1
ratio increased 30 basis points to 10.1% and is now above our fully phased-in 2019 requirement.
RWA decreased roughly $18 billion, driven by reductions related to retail exposures as credit quality improved. We
also provide our capital metrics under the Standardized approach. Here, our CET1 ratio improved to 11% with the same
capital improvement as Advanced, but less of an RWA improvement, given Standardized is less risk sensitive.
Supplementary leverage ratios for both the parent and the bank continued to exceed the U.S. regulatory minimums that
take effect in 2018.
Turning to slide eight. We had solid loan and deposit growth in the quarter. Reported loans of $901 billion, on an
end-of-period basis, increased $4 billion from Q4 and are up $28 billion or 3% from Q1 2015. Loans in our primary
lending segments were up $14 billion or 2% from Q4, which is 8% on an annualized basis. We continue to see solid
commercial loan growth in Global Banking.
In Consumer Banking, we continue to see strong growth in consumer real estate and vehicle lending. Lastly, in Wealth
Management, we also saw continued growth in consumer real estate. Loans outside the primary lending segments, in
LAS and All Other were down $10 billion from Q4, driven by continued pay-downs of first and second lien mortgages
as well as loan sales. During the quarter, we sold FHA loans totaling $2.7 billion and NPLs and other delinquent loans
of roughly $1 billion, recording a small gain on sales and other income.
Turning to deposits. On an ending basis, they reached $1.2 trillion this quarter, growing $64 billion or 6% from Q1
2015. Growth was led by our consumer businesses. Consumer Banking grew $43 billion or 8% year-over-year. GWIM
grew nearly $17 billion, a 7% pace. And Global Banking grew at a 3% pace.
Turning to asset quality on slide nine; outside the energy sector, credit quality is strong. Total net charge-offs were $1.1
billion in Q1 and Q4. We had some immaterial movements this quarter from minor adjustments, but overall, very little
change in consumer losses. Commercial losses declined slightly from Q4, despite a slight increase in energy
charge-offs. Provision of $1 billion in Q1 was up $187 million from Q4. While net charge-offs were flat, total reserve
release declined as reserve releases in consumer were mostly offset by reserve increases in commercial driven by
energy exposures.
On slide 10, we provide credit quality data on our consumer portfolio. Net charge-offs declined $41 million from Q4.
Consumer real estate charge-offs benefited from continued portfolio improvement and fewer one-time items, primarily
collateral valuation adjustments on consumer real estate. Adjusting for those items, consumer net charge-offs were
relatively flat versus Q4. Delinquency levels and NPLs improved and reserve coverage remains strong.
Moving to commercial credit on slide 11. Net charge-offs improved $35 million. A decline in non-energy net
charge-offs from Q4 more than offset a modest increase in energy losses. Energy charge-offs increased $17 million
from Q4 to roughly $100 million in the quarter. Given that asset quality outside energy remains relatively stable, let's
focus on energy. We continue to support our energy clients, while managing lending limits and actively engaging with
stressed borrowers. Our overall committed energy exposures declined slightly from Q4, while utilized exposures were
up by $500 million.
As discussed last quarter, within energy, we believe two subsectors, refining and marketing as well as vertically
integrated, which by the way, tend to be large market cap and/or sovereign supported, these two subsectors are less
dependent on oil prices and, therefore, carry less risk than our exposures in E&P and oilfield services.
Looking at our $7.7 billion utilized exposure to the higher risk E&P and oilfield services clients, we saw a decline of
$600 million from Q4 as payoffs and charge-offs more than offset drawdowns. In addition, this quarter we moved $1.6
billion of our energy exposure to reservable criticized, and we added $525 million to our energy reserves. We made
these adjustments based upon another quarter of not only low oil prices but also volatile oil prices. This moves our
energy reserve to just over $1 billion and while these reserves cover our full energy portfolio, they would represent

13% of our $7.7 billion E&P and oilfield services exposures. We believe that percentage is probably more relevant as
you compare exposures across the industry.
Turning to slide 12, net interest income on an FTE basis was $9.4 billion. Included in NII this quarter was a FAS 91
negative $1.2 billion market-related adjustment for bond premium amortization. This adjustment in Q1 2015 was a
negative $500 million, and including TruPS-related charges, Q4 was also negative $500 million.
Adjusted NII of $10.6 billion improved approximately $500 million compared to Q1 2015, excluding FAS 91, and
improved $100 million from Q4 after also excluding the TruPS charge.
Several factors contributed to the improvement from Q4. We had good commercial loan growth funded by deposits.
We also had about $100 million in seasonal benefits in Q1. Offsetting these factors, we had one less day of interest and
lower dividends on our Federal Reserve stock as required to contribute to the Highway Trust Fund. Lower long-term
rates also offset some of the benefit of the Fed rate hike in December, pressuring NII.
Lower long-term rates was also the driver of increased asset sensitivity in the quarter. As of 3/31, an instantaneous 100
basis point parallel increase in rates is estimated to increase NII by approximately $6 billion over the subsequent year.
About 40% of this estimated $6 billion increase comes from short-end rate improvement and the rest is from long-end
rate improvement split equally between FAS 91 and reinvestment at higher rates.
Turning to slide 13, non-interest expense was $14.8 billion in the quarter. That is $1 billion, or 6%, lower than Q1
2015, driven by good expense discipline across the company. Legacy asset servicing costs excluding litigation were
$729 million this quarter, declining $292 million from Q1 2015 and $64 million from Q4. Litigation expense of $388
million was in line with Q1 2015 as we worked to resolve remaining legacy issues. First-quarter expense also included
FAS 123 annual retirement costs of $850 million, slightly below Q1 2015.
First quarter of both years also included about $300 million of seasonally elevated payroll tax expense. Adjusting for
all of these items, i.e., the litigation, LAS, the FAS 123 and the elevated payroll tax, expenses were $12.5 billion.
This decline of $600 million from Q1 2015 was driven by lower revenue-related costs associated with sales and trading
and investment banking as well as revenue in our wealth management business, the roll-off of advisor retention awards
put in place after the combination with Merrill Lynch, and lastly, SIM initiatives that are improving productivity and
helping us lower costs so that we can continue to invest in growth. Our employee base is down 3% from Q1 2015 and
increases in client-facing professionals were more than offset by reductions in LAS and other operations staff.
Lastly, before leaving expense highlights I want to remind you that quarterly FDIC insurance expense set to increase at
the large banks until the deposit insurance fund reaches 1.35%. For us, this will increase expense by approximately
$100 million pre-tax, starting in Q3 2016.
Okay, turning to the business segments and starting with Consumer Banking on slide 14. Consumer earned $1.8 billion,
22% better than Q1 last year. These earnings reflect continued core customer growth coupled with strong expense
management. Lower provision expense from continued improvement in asset quality also benefited the bottom-line.
This work generated a strong 24% return on allocated capital. Note that allocated capital increased slightly for 2016
pursuant to our normal capital allocation reviews completed in Q1.
On slide 15 we focus on some important trends. First in the upper left, we continued to lead the industry in a number of
ways, as you can see from the stats. Revenue increased $242 million or 3% from Q1 2015 as NII growth more than
offset lower non-interest income. Net interest income benefited from higher client balances. Non-interest income was
down due to lower mortgage banking income offset by increases in card income and service charges. We continued to
see mortgage banking income come down given our strategy to book more of our originations on the balance sheet.
Expenses declined 2% from Q1 2015. On the bottom left, you can see the year-over-year decline in FTEs as mobile
banking growth continues to help us optimize our delivery network. Note, while overall FTEs are down year over year,
sales specialists are up 900 from Q1 2015. Lastly, our deposit franchise continues to drive operating leverage. Our cost
of deposits as a percent of average deposits continues to improve and now stands at 171 basis points, which we believe
is best-in-class in the industry.

Focusing on mobile banking users in the upper right for a minute, we added 910,000 net new mobile users this quarter.
We now have nearly 20 million active users and deposit transactions from mobile devices now represent 16% of
deposit transactions. Interestingly, this quarter we added more net new users than any quarter in the last three years and
we continue to add new features and capabilities, improving convenience and satisfaction.
One way we are promoting adoption is by deploying digital ambassadors in our financial centers. Digital ambassadors
engage with customers who come to our branches to transact. They educate these customers on alternatives to branch
banking, which are not only more convenient for them, but also less expensive for us. Digital sales, digital
appointments, digital satisfaction all continued to achieve new highs.
Focusing on client balances, you can see Merrill Edge brokers' assets are up 7% from Q1 2015 on strong flows, offset
by lower valuations. Moving to the bottom right of the page, note that loans are up 8% from Q1 2015 on strong
mortgage and auto growth.
Okay. Moving to slide 16. This is a new page that presents some statistics around loan growth and the quality of
originations in our consumer segment. Starting with card, we issued 1.2 million cards in the quarter, which is a bit
lower than the past few quarters. Average balances were impacted by the sale of a $1.7 billion non-strategic card
portfolio late in Q4. Adjusting for that divestiture, loans were up in Q4. Spending on credit card, adjusted for
divestitures, was up 8% compared to Q1 2015.
As we have discussed many times, and shown here, we are originating high FICO loans that have produced very low
loss rates and strong risk-adjusted margins, currently exceeding 9%.
Moving to vehicle lending, one sees similar high-quality, low-risk lending stats. Average booked FICOs are 780 and
loss rates are low. Also, the tenure of these loans is relatively conservative compared to the industry as nearly 90% of
our loans are less than 73 months. Margins obviously aren't as high as credit card but average balances are growing
well across multiple channels within the business.
Our underwriting standards are producing similar results in consumer real estate lending, which is presented on the
bottom of the page. Net loss rates on first-lien mortgages have been negligible. Remember, we began booking these
loans in the consumer segment in the first quarter of 2014 and the macro-consumer environment has been healthy,
particularly for high-FICO borrowers.
Turning to slide 17. Global Wealth and Investment Management produced earnings of $740 million, up 13% from Q1
2015. Year-over-year, revenue was down but expenses declined more, improving pre-tax margin to 26%. Overall,
revenue climbed 2% from Q1 2015, as strong NII growth was more than offset by lower market-sensitive revenue.
Asset management revenue declined on lower market values. Transactional revenue was also down and continues to be
impacted by the shifting of activity from brokerage to managed relationships as well as market uncertainty. NII
benefited from solid deposit and loan growth.
Non-interest expense in the first quarter of 2016 benefited from the fully amortized advisor retention awards given at
the time of the Merrill Lynch merger. We have not seen a noticeable attrition as a result of this. Lower revenue-related
incentives also contributed to lower expense versus Q1 2015.
Moving to slide 18, despite lower market levels, we continued to see overall solid client engagement and we continued
to invest in the business, growing client-facing professionals year-over-year. Client balances are $2.5 trillion.
Long-term AUM flows were down this quarter as a result of market volatility which impacted client behavior. Average
deposits grew $9 billion from Q4 and average loans also grew this quarter, concentrated in consumer real estate
lending.
Turning to slide 19, Global Banking earned $1.1 billion, down from both comparative periods as energy reserves
weighed on results. Despite this increased provision expense, Global Banking was able to deliver a 12% return on
allocated capital. And note that we allocated $2 billion more in capital to Global Banking for 2016 pursuant to our
annual evaluation of the allocated capital.

Global Banking continued to drive solid loan growth within its risk and client frameworks, and this drove a nice
increase year-over-year in NII, mitigated to some degree by spread compression. That NII improvement, combined
with revenue growth from credit cards and treasury fees, partially offset a decline in investment banking and other
marks on loans and hedges. Non-interest expense compared to Q1 2015 reflects a decline in revenue-related expense
offset by the cost of adding sales professionals over the past 12 months.
Looking at trends on slide 20 and comparing to Q1 last year, it was obviously a tough quarter for the capital markets
with spikes in volatility causing declines in client activity. However, clients still have financing needs, and here is
where the diversity and strength of our franchise allows us to continue to deliver for them even when capital markets
are less attractive. You can see that trend in our average loans and lease balances which increased again this quarter and
are up 14% year-over-year. Growth in loans was broad-based across C&I, CRE and leasing, although recently we have
slow growth in CRE.
Spread compression on average across all our customer sizes has moderated relative to a year ago. Average deposits
also increased from Q1 2015, up $11 billion or 4%. We remain focused on our deposit mix, which is strong, with only
3% classified as 100%-runoff balances. On the other hand, total firm-wide IB fees of $1.2 billion were down 22% from
Q1 2015 with declines broad-based across M&A, DCM and ECM.
Switching to Global Markets on slide 21 and comparing Q1 last year, again, the challenging market condition caused
revenue compared to Q1 2015 to be down. The quarter included a benefit from the resolution of a litigation matter and
we also had lower revenue-related costs compared to Q1 2015.
All of this resulted in Global Markets reporting earnings just under $1 billion. Reported revenue was down
year-over-year, but note that last year DVA negatively impacted revenue versus added to revenue this quarter.
Total revenue, excluding DVA, while up from Q4, was down 17% from Q1 last year on lower sales and trading
revenue as well as Global Markets' share of lower IB fees. Non-interest expense declined 23% from Q1 2015, driven by
lower litigation. Adjusting for litigation, expenses were down 9% as a result of lower revenue-related expenses,
demonstrating a disciplined approach to compensation.
Moving to trends on the next slide and focusing on the components of our sales and trading performance, sales and
trading revenue up $13.3 billion, excluding net DVA is up 25% from Q4 with improvement in both FICC and equity
but down 16% from Q1 last year. Versus Q1 2015, FICC sales and trading of $2.3 billion fell 17%, reflecting a tough
environment for credit-related products as well as a tough comparison to a strong Q1 2015 in currencies. Equity trading
was $1 billion, declining 11%, reflecting weaker trading performance in a challenging market environment. Average
trading assets continued to trend down as did VaR which remained at historically low levels.
Turning to Legacy Assets and Servicing on slide 23. The segment lost $40 million this quarter. I'm not going to spend a
lot of time here, as trends are consistent with past quarters. Revenue was down a bit from lower servicing fees as the
portfolio of serviced loans declines. Revenue was also impacted by lower net hedge results (sic) [lower MSR net of
hedge results].
As the portfolio shrinks, we continued to lower servicing costs, particularly with respect to delinquent loans. The
number of 60-plus-day delinquent first mortgage loans serviced continued to decline and is now only 88,000 units;
excluding litigation, expense this quarter was $729 million, dropping nearly $300 million from Q1 2015 and down $64
million from Q4.
On slide 24 we show All Other, which reported a loss of $1.9 billion. Results were impacted by the $1.2 billion FAS 91
market-related adjustment, the FAS 123 seasonal retirement eligible incentive costs and litigation costs. The loss here is
higher than Q1 2015 for a number of reasons. First, the market-related adjustment is more negative this year than last.
Second, we had higher gains on sales of loans in Q1 2015 than this period. Third, provision expense is higher as both
periods had a benefit from provision but this quarter that benefit was smaller than Q1 2015. Lastly, litigation costs were
higher this quarter versus Q1 2015 as we work down legacy issues.

The effective tax rate for the quarter was about 28%, which is better than we expect for the full year, absent any
unusual items. One expected item that we want to bring to your attention is another U.K. tax rate reduction recently
proposed in the Chancellor's budget. We expect this to be signed into law in Q3 and will result in a tax charge of about
$350 million to reduce the carrying value of our U.K. DTA. The vast majority of this charge will not impact regulatory
capital.
Okay. So let me offer a few takeaways as I finish. Given the market volatility, revenue growth was challenging this
quarter. However, we compensated for this by managing expenses well. If one adjusts this period's reported results for
the non-cash FAS 91 market-related NII amount and the FAS 123 costs, earnings are largely in line with recent
quarters. You can see progress most clearly in our business segments which don't include these adjustments. Taken as a
whole, the segments, not including All Other, improved earnings by 16% versus Q1 2015. The drivers of this
improvement were solid loan and deposit growth across our customer groups.
Net charge-offs were largely unchanged as modest increases in energy were mitigated by other improvements. We
strengthened our capital liquidity and we returned $1.5 billion in common dividends and repurchases to shareholders.
To Brian's earlier point, we have done years of work to simplify the company and reduce risk.
With $167 billion in tangible common equity, $12 billion in credit reserves, and twice the amount of liquidity of a few
years ago, we believe we are well prepared to help customers and clients in good and bad times, and we are focused on
growing earnings in many different economic scenarios.
With that, let's open it up to Q&A.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We can take our first question from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Hey. Good morning. Just maybe I'll focus my question on expenses and then I'll get back in
the queue. But I think outside of incentive comp expenses generally were better than I was expecting, and how much of
that is the Simplify & Improve and how much more do you think there is to do on some of these core expenses, I guess
number one?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Look, about from Q4 to Q1, $300 million in core expense decline. $100 million of that is the
roll-off of the amortization of the awards we gave to advisors around the Merrill Lynch acquisition. $200 million of it
is just good, solid expense discipline being driven by SIM and other initiatives. If you look at the supplement you're
going to see expenses came down in nearly every category.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Yep. And you think there's more to do there? And I guess maybe in the context of your
discussion around digitization in consumer, that seems like that could be a longer-term tailwind. Do you guys agree and
do you think that's a material mover or just more incremental?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Jim, I think there is a lot more to do here because at the end of the day, adjusting the
efficiency ratio for the two major adjustments, which won't recur next quarter, you get in the mid – 66%, 67% and we
need to drive that down in the low 60%s even with the realities of the Wealth Management business not being as
profitable and a big part of our revenue stream but very return-on-capital beneficial. So then if you flip and say how are
we going to get down there, you're exactly right, if you look, we drifted down even further this quarter in numbers of
branches or numbers of customers, but deposits are up. If you look at head count in consumer, we continue to
reposition it toward the sales and relationship management side and away from transactional side.
And so that digitization which is – we're at 19.6 million mobile banking consumer customers and interesting enough
we're growing on the online customer base, meaning computer-based customers grew over 1 million customers from
last year's first quarter.

So all of that just drives more and more transactions and more and more cost structure of the day-to-day transactional
stuff into those environments and saves us money overall. And at 170 basis points, there was a time when that was 300
basis points five years, six years, seven years ago. We got it into the low 200s basis points, 220 basis points, 240 basis
points, and thought that was pretty good; and now we're at 170 basis points and my guess is we can continue to push it
down.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just one ticky-tack question on the FDIC charge. It wasn't
clear, is that an annual expense or is that going to be quarterly at $100 million?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: It's going to be quarterly $100 million beginning in Q3 until the fund gets up to its adequate
level and then it will come down.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Okay. All right. Great. Thank you very much.

Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Good morning.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Good morning.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Any outlook you can provide in terms of the potential for additional reserve boosts
related to energy? We heard one bank yesterday talk about maybe another $500 million, although a lot of variability
around that number they pointed to. And obviously their book is different than yours, but any thoughts, if conditions
stay where they are now on additional reserve boosts. And then just related to that, the outlook for additional reserve
release in the rest of the portfolio, given as you mentioned, trends continue to be strong or even improve in some areas?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Sure. Look, in terms of reserve build we think the reserves we have right now are the right
reserves for our portfolio. Builds and releases in the future are going to be based upon how companies adapt to the level
and duration of low oil prices as well as our net charge-offs, and we think companies are adapting.
In terms of reserve releases, we would expect releases in consumer but at a slower pace than we've seen in the past, as
we run off the legacy portfolio, and dependent upon the real estate market. Consumer releases would likely go to offset
any builds in commercial.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. That's helpful. And then just, separately, kind of big picture from a
regulatory point of view if I look back to last year, you've had kind of some steps forward, some steps backwards.
Obviously, had to resubmit on CCAR. That was net positive once you got the results back. You got the approval for the
extra 1% buyback, which I think symbolically a lot of investors view and I view as positive. You have the living will
issue that came up yesterday for you and a number of others. Just at a very high level, maybe give us an update on how
you're feeling from a regulatory point of view and where the areas are that you feel like you still need to improve.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I think from a global perspective, we continue to implement all of the rules and regulations
that have changed over the last few years. And importantly, Volcker was an implementation mid this year, and a lot of
the work has been done if you think about the LCR, the SLR, the core Basel rules and the changes, we've absorbed the
Advanced increases over the last year and now we're above the 10% Advanced including $100 billion or more of RWA
for the commercial assets and the off risk of capital of $40-odd billion. So we've absorbed a lot of that into the run rate
and I think we're now to the point of fine-tuning the company around the rules and regulations and continue optimizing
it.
And I think that we've obviously submitted the CCAR work. We did a tremendous amount of work just on the expense
side. That was another $40 million of incremental expense this quarter, in the first quarter, to continue to get us – using
third parties to continue to make sure we kept our run rate at best-in-class. And so that's in and being reviewed as we
speak. And then we've got, obviously, as you spoke about, the continuation and finishing up the resolution plan, which

we – has probably spent at least $0.25 billion on external parties to help us with and a lot of internal work. And that's
all in the run rate as we speak and ultimately provide relief as we get through it.
I think overall you've seen us implement most of the rules and optimize the company. We need to continue to do that.
That ought to provide some RWA opportunities in the future but it continues to take time. But I think we're in pretty
good shape and now the question is just to finish up a couple of these key tasks on the resolution plan that you can see.
Unprecedented transparency, you've got the same letter I got, so you know exactly what we have to do and we'll get it
done.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: If I could just add two thoughts. One, this is not an episodic activity for us. This is being
[Inaudible] (44:13-44:18) and meeting the standards under the regulations. That's one. Two is, it's not a group of people
who are doing this. It's everybody in the company. We have a significant – it's really being led in many ways by the
line of business. We've got involvement from all of the support functions, so it's become part of the culture of the
company to get to the right standards across all the regulations.

And we can take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Good morning, Betsy.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Good morning, Betsy.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Hey. Couple of questions. One is on the quality of the book. You went through and
reminded us how much you've improved the quality of book in the Consumer. Could you speak to that in the
commercial as well, ex energy? And then give us a sense as to whether or not you think that's embedded in the CCAR
results. I'm just trying to get an understanding of whether or not you think that RWA hit that you had to take could
potentially come down as commercial rolls through.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: So, on the commercial side, outside of energy and metals and mining, we don't see issues
with credit quality. We're obviously watching very carefully, but it feels very good outside of those two sectors. What
was the second part of your question?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: It's on the CCAR results.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Oh, yeah, absolutely. So look, if you look at our CCAR results, either on an absolute basis or
on a comparative basis, you can see what a third party, the Fed, thinks our losses would be. You're going to see that
again in a few months. And I think you can really see when you look at those results how much we have improved the
credit quality of the company across both consumer and commercial.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Do you think that can help in the buyback ask as you go through? It's not just a
question about this year but just over time.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Over time, Betsy, our view is that we can grow the company and grow it responsibly, as
we talk about. So there is opportunities for growth and that's – on the Consumer segment, a lot of questions we get is
how can you grow and keep your credit discipline; you must be changing. You can see that the stuff coming on today is
as strong as anything we put on, and the commercial you should assume is the same. And so there's still plenty of
opportunity for us to grow which is just good for earnings and prospects.
When you flip it to the other side of it, yes, our job from the management team was to set this company up that it would
never have the kind of risk embedded in it that would lead us to difficult times in a real recession, leave alone the
CCAR analysis. And if you see the CCAR analysis over time, you see our loss content continue to come down and that
should serve us in good stead to be able to take out capital over time, as you said.

And if you think about in the commercial book, it's things like commercial real estate, we have been very disciplined
and what we inherited through all the deals and development loans, all that stuff is really nonexistent at any
consequence. So we feel very good about the commercial book.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Okay. And then just separately, you talked a bit about the mobile user increase, and I
just wanted to get your sense as to the opportunity from here. You recently launched the new app with Mobile Pay
which...
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Yeah.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: ...you've been doing internally, but now you can do externally.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Right.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Could you give us a sense as to how that's resonating with clients? Is there an
opportunity set here for you and are you going to market it a little bit more aggressively going forward?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: So just framing from the overall top, last year this quarter, we had 17 million mobile users.
This year, we have 19.5 million. And as Paul said, there was an interesting point that the nominal rate of growth this
quarter was one of the highest we've ever had. So even though smartphones have penetrated – you think you've kind of
penetrated the customer base, it's still growing fast. So that's number one.
And then as I said earlier, Betsy, and you've followed our company for a long time, you would have seen a plateauing
in the online, the computer-based banking, for lack of a better term, people who come in through bankofamerica.com
and that now is growing as fast nominally or faster than mobile, which means people are also using both sides. And so
that's one thing. So the core activity is growing, and if you look at the activity in the core customer base from card
usage, both debit and credit card use is up 4%-plus year-over-year, and that's good.
The online mobile part of the spend is now up to 20% of the spend and it's growing 15% per year versus the 4.5%
growth on the total. So that's tremendous. Then you get in the wallet category; just to give you a sense, just in the last
week, the growth rates in enrolled cards was 12% week-over-week growth. In terms of volume enrolled, 100,000-odd
cards came on. The payment usage was up 3% week-over-week. So you see this just phenomenal growth rate. If you
annualize that out, that's a weekly growth rate and it ebbs and flows with the holidays and everything else, but think
about that. And you see that usage going up.
But the mobile wallet payments are still less than 0.2% of the total payments made with plastic at Bank of America, so
you still have lots of opportunity to convert activity to a platform which is more convenient for the customer.
And then the other thing we've – and then a part of that you talk about is the new consortium to build a new P2P
deployment for the banking system. We're up and operating that. We still have a few more months before the rest of the
colleagues in the consortium get up and then we'll start to push that out in the market heavily. I think it's a tremendous
improvement over what we have today, even though we have a fair amount of volume on it today through
clearXchange, and that was an effort to get us all together so we could have a very interoperable payment network.
We've got the Visa Checkout work that's going on where we're pre-loading customers' cards in their wallet. We're
about, as best we can tell, 13%, 14% of all the spend in Visa Checkout today, and we've got 1 million plus cards. We'll
drive that forward.
And if you put that all together, you're seeing tremendous volume off of all these mechanisms. And in the month of
March, to give you an example, we had almost $60 billion of payments off the computer-based platform and about $20
billion off the mobile-based platform. So think about the size of that.
Now given all that, we still send out about $8 billion of cash out of our ATMs in the month of March. Now, that's $0.25
billion a day or more. So it's still – you have to have all the capabilities, and that's what we're building towards. And
going back to I think Jim's question earlier, the cost structure keeps moving in your favor as you keep driving this
activity through.

<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: All right, I mean, eventually you've got an elimination of checks and some your bill
pay costs potentially go down as well, I would assume?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Yes, eventually is always an operative word. Even today, I think there's about 0.25 million
checks a day. People take a picture of them and send them in on their mobile phones and that didn't exist a few years
ago, but it's still 0.25 million of them that would have to go away, so it will be a while.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Okay. But that's in line with expectations to bring down the consumer expense ratio.
I mean is that really the driver of getting the consumer expense ratio down is the backend on the payments piece?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Yes. It's everything about payments, processing payments, fraud losses, discussion with
customers about the payment, the multiple payment faculties that they could use and how they interface, and so it has
been a huge driver. And remember we went from 6,100 branches down to 4,600 or whatever today and the customer
base has increased by 10% and the volume of deposits is up by, I think, 30% to 40% and checking deposits are up
dramatically. So I think year-over-year checking deposits were up 8% or 10%, I think, [indiscernible] (52:37)
something like that.
So the activity level is growing up on a smaller and smaller base and that cost structure in retail is driven by two things,
the people which are increasing sales and relationship management content and the physical plant, and you're
absolutely right, driving all that out. Near as we can tell we spend about $1 billion a year just moving cash around in
our company. So less cash moving around saves us money.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Okay. And just remind us what your goal is to get the consumer expense ratio to?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: The goal is to have it keep going down every day, week, month, quarter. And I think
Betsy, with all of these things you've got to be careful about letting my consumer colleagues think they're doing too
good a job, so I keep putting pressure on them, so I'm not going to give them a goal if they think they've achieved
something.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: All right. Thank you.

Our next question comes from John McDonald with Bernstein.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Yeah, hi. Good morning. I was wondering on the net interest income side if you could
talk a little bit about, Paul, what kind of outlook we should think about for the quarter in net interest income, that was
$10.6 billion this quarter. If rates are relatively stable and we don't see any hike for a while, how should that trend with
all the puts and takes?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Sure. So look, we're hesitant to give guidance given the volatility in rates that we've
experienced; guidance has not been that helpful in my opinion but I will give a couple of thoughts. $10.6 billion, if you
think about maybe as a launching-off point, given some of the seasonal NII gains we had in the Q1, I think a more
reasonable launch point would be more like $10.5 billion.
Then you go to the second quarter, we've obviously got a deal with lower long-term rates, second quarter is always a
little bit seasonally lower for us. So there's some – progress there is going to be challenged but I think as you head to
the third quarter and fourth quarter, when you consider what we think we can do on deposit growth and loan growth,
and if rates follow the path along the forward curve, we would expect to make progress in the latter half of the year.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay, and you do get a day count help, modest, in the second quarter from the first
too, right? Doesn't that help?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: It's a leap year so I think it's normally down two but now it's down one. Or...
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: And maybe – right.

<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: ...[ph] it's less, yeah (55:06).
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Going to the second. Okay. And then just on trading there was a quote in the media
from you this morning, Paul, saying March felt better in certain areas. Can you just give us a little color on what
changed in March on the trading front? What got better and has that carried over a little bit into April and how you're
thinking about the Brexit vote from a risk and revenue impact potentially because that comes up this spring?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Sure. So March felt, I think, a lot better than certainly January and February. And April, it's
really too early but April feels, at least starting out like it's more like March than it is like January and February. In
terms of Brexit, we are focused on our clients and customers. They're going to need – there's going to be volatility
potentially around the vote and around any changes after the vote and we're working very closely with our customers to
address how they need to manage their risk.
From our own company perspective, we're going to listen, it's the U.K.'s decision. After we find out what the decision
is and understand it, then I think we will react to it do what we think is in the best interest of our customers and clients
and shareholders and other constituencies.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. Thank you. And in terms of March, any color on what got better, what felt
better, which areas of the business, could you help on that?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: No, I wouldn't say – look, I think you heard from competitors that Asia was a little better in
March. We're stronger in the U.S. than we are in Asia. We have a significant business there, so there was some
improvement out there. But no, I wouldn't have any more specifics than that.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay, thanks.

Our next question will come from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.
<Q - Glenn Paul Schorr>: Hi. Thanks very much. On slide 12 you noted your asset sensitivity increased a bunch from
the prior quarter, you mentioned driven by the drop in long-end rates. Could you talk through how that actually works
and then how much of the $6 billion is short-end versus long-end?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Sure. 40% of the $6 billion is going to come from an increase in short-end rates. And then
the other 60% is split equally between FAS 91 and re-investing at longer-term rates. The FAS 91 piece is relatively
straightforward. I mean, we had a $1.2 billion decline in Q1 because interest rates went down 50 basis points. We're
going to retrace that if they go back up.
<Q - Glenn Paul Schorr>: Separate one, if you look at the ROA for year-on-year, it's a large amount on a percentage
basis from 0.59% down to 0.50%. I'm just curious, I wouldn't think weak capital markets in the quarter was the big
driver but I guess the question is, what's the big driver of it, and are the new business you're putting on coming in at
higher ROA so we should expect that to rise from here assuming not so crazy markets?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Look, if you think about our ROA and you adjust for FAS 91 market-related NII adjustments
and retirement-eligible expenses, you're going to get into the mid-0.70%s and then if you give us some credit for the
progress we've made in LAS over the last few years and continue that progress you're going to get even higher. From
there it's about growing loans – growing deposits, growing loans. Putting on, like you said, assets that are accretive to
what we have on the books right now, and importantly, continuing to grind and work on expenses. And so that's what
we've got to do.
<Q - Glenn Paul Schorr>: Okay. One last tiny one is Wealth Management margins increased a couple hundred basis
points quarter-on-quarter, 500 basis points year-on-year without the help of revenues. Expenses were down a bunch –
you mentioned the $100 million roll-off of the previous amortized retention awards. What's the rest of the expense

saves inside Wealth Management, because that's pretty good in a world that didn't have much revenue growth.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Yeah, so it's compensation-related given the fact that revenue was a little weak because of
the volatile markets. That's not to say we're not working on bringing down costs in that segment as well, but
specifically the answer to your question, in Q1, that's what drove it.
<Q - Glenn Paul Schorr>: Is that non-production expenses? Meaning usually the comp stuff goes hand-in-hand with
revenues.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Yeah, they're working on all their elements of expense so you've got that right. But also
remember, as the NII increases there's not as much expense attached to that. So that's one of the operating leverage
points in Wealth Management that we were losing a lot last year that we're going to get back as short-term rates rise
because they're a heavy deposit business. Remember, they alone are $260 billion of deposits in Wealth Management
and those deposits and loans continue to grow which continues to produce more core NII as well as whatever they think
[ph] sometimes (1:00:51) being a large investment management trust fee type company. But they are a big bank and the
loans grow and that's going to drive that up and that is marginally more profitable for the shareholder.
<Q - Glenn Paul Schorr>: Okay. Perfect. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Paul Miller with FBR & Company.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Hey, thank you very much, guys. On the legacy asset, you lowered your loans from $103,000 to
$88,000 on the high touch servicing or default servicing. How much of that was sold or are you guys just working
through the book?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: I would classify it as little to very little sold this quarter. It's just working service loans –
delinquent service loans down.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Just working it down? And has the new stuff coming in – is that still a material amount? Or has
that been – is that mainly done, like you're not really getting a lot of new stuff coming into this bucket?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Very little from any production that was done after the crisis, Paul, as you could expect,
so, it's delinquency statistics. So really you still have modifications, the re-modification work going on because people
have had modifications for years. Some portion of them go back in the situation. And then you have just the normal
flow but that number keeps working itself down and based on the quality of our portfolio, it should come down even
significantly from where it is. It just is – this is a grind now. This is just working through. Some that are involved in
litigation take time. It's just a grind to work them out now.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: And then you said like in the quarter, and you disclosed this very clearly, that it's about $700
million on this. I mean, where can we – can this be cut in half by the end of the year? When does this really become
immaterial, do you think?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Well, as we've told you, our next way station on improving this thing is $500 million at the
end of the year and we're well on our way to get there, Paul. But you're experienced in this business. That is not an
acceptable number but I just need to keep them tracking it down. What's interesting, and if you look at the head count
that we show you and stuff, what is changing is their head count down is 9,800 or something like that, 9,900 at the end
of the quarter. So it's has come down from a high of 58,000 internal people plus external contractors dramatically.
Now, we've got to get some of the harder costs out, meaning the systems and technology that was overbuilt for a 12
million servicing portfolio, the real estate. And that takes a little harder work.
So we're grinding all that out, so say $700 million and change to $500 million and change. And ultimately we've got to
get it down to significantly below that $500 million to make it make sense as a servicing. I think it's okay but to
actually be an effective servicing platform, we should drive it down. Your point about immateriality is something – this

Our next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Good morning, Eric.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Thanks very much. If I could just refer back to slide 16 for a moment, there's been a lot of
debate about the dynamics in the auto lending market, about deterioration in underwriting and the risks of large
amounts of used cars coming off of lease. Could you give us any granularity about what you are seeing in lending
across the FICO spectrum and how you're anticipating that residual issue to play out?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Sure. Look, just some perspectives. We're maintaining our market share in auto lending but
we're very focused on originating prime and super-prime loans. Average FICO score as you can see on the page, 778.
And debt-to-income ratios are at all-time lows. Again, we're not following the market from a structuring standpoint to
the longer tenures. 90% of our loans are 73 months or lower.
So, that's our strategy and I think if we stick to that, we'll be fine. We did pull forward from – we had an opportunity
this quarter to get more flow. We had planned to do that in later quarters. We've pulled that volume to this quarter and
we'll evaluate in future quarters.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: And you asked a question about residual values and the volume of cars sold and what
happens. We also, as part of stress-testing our portfolios, internal stress testing and also in part for the CCAR/DFAST
work, we stress the collection, the recognized collection value of cars down 40% and it's not – it obviously had more
losses, why wouldn't you, but what really controls your losses is the quality of portfolio and what runs through that
calculation. And that number is because the high quality is very low. So we test that question you're asking, which is
what happens if residual values or used car values fell dramatically in a recessionary environment or something, and
that's one of the things we test and it's not a big number.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: All right. And when you said that you pulled forward some flow, what do you mean by
that?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: We said the opportunity – we have relationships on the flow side and when we see
opportunities we can pull some of that in. Originations come through the branch, they come online and they come
through our relationships with the financial institutions who have relationships with dealers.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: And our relationship with dealers also.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: And – yeah, a direct relationship with dealers. So every once in a while, we will see an
opportunity to add some balances and, if it's within our underwriting standards, we will consider it.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: And that was primarily on the indirect side?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Yes.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Yes.

Our next question is from Mike Mayo with CLSA.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: Hi. My short question is, when will the return on equity go into the double-digit range? Look, you
have a good franchise and balance sheet, you're showing growth in loans, deposits, online banking, other areas, and
you're showing lower and better expenses, branches, head count and risk, but it's not adding up. I mean, your stock is
15% below tangible book value. And this was yet one more quarter of mid-single digit ROEs and worse than peer
efficiency. So, my question is why is Bank of America less efficient than peer? And it's tough on the outside to know
because you have $2 billion of expenses in Other that's not allocated to the business lines. What is your plan B, if rates
don't go up? And when will the ROE go into double-digit?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Okay. Well, hi, Mike.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: Hi.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Thank you. So, I guess I would start by, again, just so everybody understands the facts, we –
if you adjust for FAS 91 and FAS 123, our return on tangible common equity would be roughly 8.5%. And again, as I
said before, we've made a lot of progress in LAS. And if you give us any credit for the progress we think we're going to
make in the future, we're going to be able to take that 8.5% even further. We've made, I think – so the key is we've got
to continue to make progress on expenses. I'll get to revenue in a second, but we've got to continue to make progress on
expenses. And again, I think we've demonstrated that we can do that. If you look, just year-over-year expenses are
down $1 billion or 6%.
If you go back to Q1, Q1 2011, we've taken quarterly expenses down, core quarterly expenses down $3.5 billion. That's
a $14 billion run rate. We've got to continue to do that. If you look this quarter at our Consumer and GWIM segments,
you can see the operating leverage. If you look at the whole company and you back off FAS 91, you can see the
operating leverage. So we've just got to continue to work on expenses, we're not sitting around, waiting for rates to go
up. It would help, if they did. And that's what we're focused on.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: All right. If I can follow up, despite all the progress that you've made – you can about the LAS
expenses, you can talk about New BAC, you can talk about the quarterly expense rate since 2011, but your core EPS is
still $0.33 this quarter. And it is a weak, tough quarter, tough environment, but it's still in that $0.35 range. So, despite
all those expense savings, we're not seeing it in the core EPS number, it's still around $0.35. So where did all those
expense savings go or is this going to come through in future quarters?
I know I've asked this question on many earnings calls. And also I thank you Bank of America for having that, and
Brian for having that opening letter from the Lead Director in the Annual Report. Jack Bovender says that he wants to
engage more with investors. And so I do hope that he takes my questions at the annual meeting to engage a little bit
more, because I've asked this so many times, I still don't feel like I have an answer that I understand. So just one more
try at it, Paul, just where are these expense savings going, if EPS is still in the same range?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: So, they're going – you sort of have identified the opportunity we have in a different market
environment. It's a judgment I think we have to make but a portion of these savings are going to increase growth in the
future, a portion are going to the bottom line. That's the lever we can pull, over an extended period of time, to adjust for
the market environment. We've proven we can get the expenses out. If we wanted them all to drop to the bottom line,
we could do that, but we need to invest in growth at the same time and we've got to balance that.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: So no New BAC coming up or anything like that? It's just, as I guess, Brian, you said you grind it
out, it's just – it'd be nice to see more of the progression. Is it -do you think it's a 2016 event, 2017 event? Or we just –
when run rates go up, we'll see more of it?

<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Look, we are focused on driving down expenses every day, every quarter, every week. You
can call it anything you want. We've got a lot of focus on this and I think you're going to continue to see progress. Our
operating leverage, on an adjusted basis, this quarter was meaningful. You can see it. If you adjust for FAS 91, revenue
down 3%, expenses down 6%. We're getting the operating leverage. Look at the GWIM segment, look at the Consumer
segment. We're focused on it.

Our next question is from Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Hi. Good morning. So, I had a follow-up to Glenn's earlier question on the Wealth
Management margin. I just want to get a sense as to whether we should thinking about that 26% margin that we saw in
the quarter as a good jumping-off point, just given some of the tailwinds you had spoken to, whether it'd be the higher
margin NII growth and the absence of the legacy Merrill awards. And there is – I suppose as it relates to that is our
preparation efforts for things such as DOL compliance potentially going to weigh on the margin in future quarters?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: A couple of things with that. The 26%, if you think back across the last year when we
discussed this, we had the ATP piece and so a chunk of that's that, the other chunk is good expense management. I said
earlier, so the margin net interest income stabilizing, improving. They've been growing the balances now. It's more
stable. So I think it is a good starting point. It will – in some cases, you would hope that it wouldn't go up a lot because
that would mean asset management fees and other things are growing, which attach more compensation, less marginal
profit, which would be good news because the overall profit would grow better, but you should assume that that's a
level we should hold on to, in a relatively stable environment, as we see this quarter starting out.
When you go to the fiduciary, we've been working on that, obviously. Just because this is the final rule and it came out
recently, we've been working on it. So I don't think – I think, to the extent that there's cost embedded in that, a lot of it's
in the run rate and it'll be marginally in the run rate for the next few quarters. It's not a hugely substantial cost. And if
you even look, we've spent a lot of time educating our teammates about doing it. There are operational costs, but I don't
think it's material in the grand scheme of things.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Thanks. I'll just add a little bit to that. I think, from the very beginning, we supported the
fundamental objectives of the Department of Labor. And if you look at our goals-based strategy, it delivers a lot of
what they're getting at with that rule in terms of the best interest standard. Our Merrill Lynch One advisory platform,
which we successfully completed the transition of a lot of clients this quarter, that's a great example of how we've been
upfront to create an experience that is really transparent, single fee schedule, et cetera. That's a significant investment.
And we're guessing that that investment is really going to pay off here in terms of implementing this rule.
If you look at the roughly $2 trillion of GWIM client assets we have outside of deposits and loans, we think the
Department of Labor will probably impact less than 10% of that. And certainly, given the implementation schedule, we
wouldn't expect to see much of an impact, if any impact in 2016. And as we digest the rules, we'll just have to evaluate
how it's going to affect out years.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Okay. So, it sounds as though a lot of the incremental expense is already in the run rate and
that you don't anticipate much revenue disruption based on the final rule as written.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Correct.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: That's correct.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Okay. Got it. And maybe just focusing on the expense base within Global Markets, we're
certainly pleased to see the absolute level of dollar expense was, from what I could tell, the lowest level that we've seen
over the last five years. So clearly some of the efforts that you highlighted to right-size the cost base have borne fruit.
And as we think about the expense trajectory for this business, what should we expect in an environment where the

trading revenues are relatively stable or consistent with what we saw in the most recent quarter? Is that $2.4 billion a
reasonable run rate expectation?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: We're going to continue – like every other segment, we're going to continue to work on
bringing our costs down in this segment as well. I think there's lots of things we can do from an operational standpoint
to improve profitability over the medium and long-term. And we're focused on that. You're right, here our
compensation expenses are significant and they're going to be consistent with the revenue performance. I think we were
disciplined this quarter in terms of our compensation expense, and you saw that in the numbers.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: They've been adjusting – as you read about in the press, there is a – it's not in the run rate
yet. It comes in next quarter because it happened mid-March. They made major adjustments in the size of the platform
in mid-March. And to give you an example, the equity salespeople year-over-year are down 60 or 70 on a base of –
that's probably down 15%, 20% at least. So Fab in that business continues to reposition. Bernie and Jim continue on the
fixed income side. So they've made some major adjustments to head count. So we'll hold it down here.
You want this expense to go up because that means the revenue has come back up, so you've got to be careful. But the
fundamental operating platform has embedded in the run rate costs to actually continue to develop a systems
architecture, continue to drive the compliance of Volcker, and all that stuff is in the run rate. So the chances of, sort of,
the non-compensation related expenses moving a lot is not the big deal and the question is just how do you
incrementally keep management down?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: The other thing to remember, just in this quarter, I would just point out again that we did
have a little bit of help from litigation. We have a reversal of a prior matter that helped on the expense line.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Okay. And can you quantify how much of a benefit that provided, Paul?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: We don't generally comment on those sorts of things. Look, it was north of $100 million.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Okay. Got it. And then just one more final one for me. Just on the investment banking side,
you talked about stability in March continuing into April on the trading business. One of your competitors talked about
actually seeing some improving trends in the capital raising environment in April versus what was clearly a challenging
quarter in 1Q. I didn't know if you were seeing some improvement on the capital raising side as well. And if you can
give us an update just in terms of backlogs in some of the other pockets like M&A, that would be helpful.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Look, as you might imagine, the pipeline looks great because everybody – people need to
transact, they just haven't – they just didn't do it in the first quarter, so it's building up. In periods where there's
volatility like this, the best thing our bankers can do is to be in front of CEOs, boards and CFOs. They're doing that.
There is going to be, have to be financing activity at some point because clients need to finance, and so our pipeline
looks good. I wouldn't necessarily say we've seen any, in the first few days of April, we've seen any dramatic increase
in capital markets activity, but there's certainly lots of dialogue. The pipeline looks good, again, because I think there's
a lot of pent-up demand there.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I think the simple thing to think about in the investment banking and capital market side is
the work is ready to go. We just – if we continue to see the stability, you'll see it come through. And that's – our
comments are really based on – it's still stabilizing, as we speak. And so, if that happens, you'd expect to see it start
pulling through and it would be up from the quarter – quarter-over-quarter. But there's still a few more weeks of
stability that you have to see for people to actually pull the trigger on financings and stuff.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Obvious, the markets right now are stable. People can finance, if they want to. I think it's just
a question, as Brian said, of CEOs and boards just making sure that the stability we're seeing right now is something
that they can count on as they go to market.

<Q - Ken Usdin>: Thanks. Good morning. Brian, right at the outset, you said that there's really been no meaningful
change in the customer base activity. And then following on your comments about stable capital markets, you're
growing the core loan book now double-digits still, 11%. I'm just wondering how much of that is the environment
holding up, how much of that is still kind of the spigot opening from reasonable growth, and just your outlook in terms
of customer behavior on the lending side.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I think the other thing, Ken, is that you have to remember that, for a long period of time,
we were fighting the run-off of the non-core assets, which are now small enough that we could overcome them. So
there were a lot of quarters where the core activity was growing, but you couldn't find it because the – if you look at the
slide, you can see, sort of, the All Other, which is the investment portfolio, really mortgages, and then the LAS assets
are now small enough so that quarter-to-quarter runoff. But I think it's solid across the board.
I mean, I think that, in the segments we focus in, on the consumer side, prime, super-prime, there is strong activity.
Mortgages, you could see the origination volumes this quarter were solid. I think if you think of home equities kicked
back up a little bit again because people see home equity in their house. The auto business is strong, but it will ebb and
flow with how many units get sold ultimately because that's the nature the business, although I think we can gain share
there because our share on our direct-to-consumer business was very low. We didn't even do it two years ago and now
we're up to, I don't know, $0.5 billion or more a quarter.
So, I think from a consumer side, the card business, because we've now sold through all the portfolios we have to sell, I
think you should see stable and start to see better year-over-year comparables than we've had the last several years.
Obviously, the last big portfolio went out in the fourth quarter. And so I think we feel good. And if you look at the
online customers, the creditworthy customers that we deal with are there to borrow and we're lending to them.
And if you go on the commercial side, as Paul said earlier, I think you'd expect the CRE – we want to be careful on
CRE, so we're doing very fundamentally structured loans, but in C&I and a nice -business banking is not a huge
business for us, frankly, but they finally are making it through their runoff and that's good.
And so, I think across all those businesses, you should see – it may not grow as fast as normally it has. Two years ago,
we had the international book grow and corporate – we slowed that down based on our judgments about risk. And so I
think it's a pretty balanced growth. And so the question always is, do you have to compromise your credit standard to
grow? No, we don't because you can see that. And then secondly, is there opportunity to actually get growth? And the
answer is yes and that's just good hard work.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Yeah. Brian, to that last point, how much opportunity actually, without pointing to compromising,
but how much more spigot opening can you still do to your point about the post-crisis, the tightening up internally? Are
you still under-lent if at all? Or you still have to be somewhat careful about where we are in this stage of the economic
cycle, being that we're seven-plus years into an expansion?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: We have to be careful and that's why I think we wanted to show you some of the – the two,
three basic principles that you have to follow. One is we had to balance the portfolios between commercial and
consumer. Second, we had to get the consumer to secured portfolios dominating versus unsecured, both credit card and
other loans that really put us behind the – in a tough situation last time. And then, third, you've got to maintain your
individual quality of underwriting. Consumer, it's more formulaic and, commercial, more deal selection and customer
selection, but if you look at it – I'll just give you the simplest way to think about this.
We have moved probably from eight out of 10 mortgage holders, who are absolutely within our credit box, absolutely
we do business with, getting their mortgage somewhere else to maybe [ph] seven (01:24:40). So we still got [ph] seven
(01:24:42) more to go without talking about expanding the credit parameters in our mortgage business one iota. So
think of that as a demonstration point that you could go over and over again. So there's plenty of market share out there.
And then, one of the things, Ken, we're looking at is, we look across our 90-odd markets in the United States. There are
areas where we have tremendous opportunity to expand our market share, where the franchise just wasn't balanced.
Some areas of franchise – the Wealth Management business is a high percentage; in some places, low. The middle

market business is very high market, very strong good market shares in certain markets, and a third of that in other
markets. And so where we're deploying these people is also based on our view of which market.
So it's going into that market, hiring talent, using this massive customer capability we have to go drive it. Again, target
the exact customers we want. So even on a geographic basis, whether it's a deposit business and expanding in some of
those markets, but also the commercial lending business and otherwise, there's opportunities without compromising
credit.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: As Brian said, that's where those added sales professionals are going. They're going in
markets where we think we have synergies across commercial, GWIM and consumer.

<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Well, I think we've been telling people to focus more on mid-single digits type of numbers
in a given 1.5%, 2% growth economy as opposed to 10%. But the core business is growing faster and then we're still
running off but we've told people to focus in at that level.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Okay. Understood. Thanks, guys.

Our next question is from Nancy Bush with NAB Research.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Good morning, Nancy.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Good morning. Brian, I think we've all, over the last few years, been trying to find banking
normal, and it's proving hard to find. And it has begun to strike some of that maybe first quarter – what we saw in the
first quarter in terms of volatility and continued low rates, et cetera, et cetera is banking normal, at least for the
foreseeable future. And under that scenario, if you believe that, have you begun to take a second look at your
businesses again? And will there be any sort of reallocation of capital going forward? And are there businesses you
might want to exit?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I'm not sure if you can consider first quarter banking normal in the sense that we still have
extra costs we've to get out of here, Nancy. We'll continue to work down. Litigation was elevated in the quarter from
more than normalized level that we feel we can achieve and things like that but leave that aside, the basic principle is
we continuously look at the franchise to see about optimization.
Generally, when people ask that question, they're thinking about a couple of different areas. One is the markets area.
We showed you the markets' profitability returns in the business, but if you get into the supplement, you'll see, you
could never call a markets business an annuity business, but what drives our business is a connection between the issuer
clients, the commercial borrowers and commercial clients and the investor clients that we serve, and to do that – and in
our Wealth Management business because that's a group of people that rely on the research platform.
If you look the interconnectedness that is massive in – whether it's by us getting out of proprietary trading and Volcker
and things like that, the real business has driven at that. And so, if you – we've taken that balance sheet from
[indiscernible] (01:28:11) at the time of Merrill, probably nearly to $800 billion or more, maybe closer to $1 trillion,
down to $500 billion and the revenues have stabilized. And I think that's a good place for us to be; number one research
plant in the world, number one in the U.S. this year, the ability to use it in Wealth Management, the ability to use it to
inform our corporate customers. So we look at how we pair away things and look at it. So, in the international business,
we paired back. There was 800 people to 1,200 people that we're downsized in markets and banking in the first quarter.
So it's not in or out, it's more how do you keep pairing it back.
And so, if you look across there, we always look at that question. We continue to look at it, but right now, we really
like the franchise and the connectivity between the franchise of all the different elements, focused on markets, focused

on Wealth Management, focused on the core business. And I think, now the question is, with low rates, we just have to
grind the costs down. And that's going to come out of really all the pieces in – well, for a while, this kind of – you
could go at it at a fairly high level and drive it. Now, it's really incrementally idea by idea and taking it out. That's why
you see that constant improvement of core costs of $2 billion run rate first quarter last year to first quarter this year is
working at it. It just takes more time, because 130 million square feet of real estate down to 80 million square feet,
going to 70 million square feet, there is a lot of work to get out of the real estate.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Right. Just as an add-on and looking at costs in the Consumer Bank, I mean – and you look
at your mobile penetration and how it is going up, et cetera, et cetera; I mean, is there sort of a magic number in terms
of mobile transactions, mobile penetration, just the whole use of mobile in your company, where I think you've been a
leader that will lead to sort of a step-down in branches? I mean, are we sort of on this threshold of being able to take
branches down yet another however many?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Well, I think, if you think of branches and think about it as offices as opposed to the
historical notion of a place where you transact, the question of how many you have is going to be – how many
relationship managers you need and how many places they have to sit. And so, what we've done is consolidated the
branches to being bigger, so the sheer number – so we had 6,100 relationship managers – or 4,600 relationship
managers. Each year, we've repositioned 200 managers or 300 of them. I mean, it's – but what we're doing is getting
out of smaller branches and building into bigger branches. So we consolidated three into one and build up – that branch
has in it, U.S. trust people, Wealth Management people, small-business salespeople.
So, what we're actually – if you think about it as a real estate question, the number is not as important as they're full and
that they're marginally driving the profit. And you can get a lot of sales people per square inch, a lot of customer
activity per square inch. That's where we're going. And so, you're going to see some of the new prototypes that we've
deployed.
You can see in a place like Denver we're now on our third branch and we'll continue to build out that look much more
like a sales office than what people's visions of a transactional branch. But going to the earlier question, Nancy, I don't
know where this stops. And I'm not saying I'm trying to hide an answer that I have. It's just that, if you and I were here
last year and we were and you said 17 million mobile users, that's good penetration. It's 2 million more, a year later.
And then computer-based banking is up 1.5 million or something like that, which is kind of remarkable on top of that.
So we don't know where this goes, but we're going to be pushing ahead, following our clients, and making sure we stay
with them.
At the same time, our customer satisfaction scores are now reaching an all-time high, which means the way we're doing
it works for them. And you've given me your feedback about our customer focus and capabilities over the year but
they're back to the highest they've ever been and that's importantly managing that transition carefully and that's what
we've got to keep doing.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: I just want to echo a couple of thoughts that Brian said. I think the branches are going to
become not a destination where people come to transact, but a destination where people come because they need a
product or service because there's been something changing in their lives. They need to start saving for their kids'
college or they need a mortgage or they need a credit card. It's more about they're coming there because of some life
event or because of some product or service they need, not for everyday transactional banking. We'll still have the
branches that can do that for people who prefer that, but I think over time, people will recognize the convenience and
safety of doing these things online, doing them electronic not through paper, and the branches will become – we're
organizing our branches so that they become destinations for people who need help with their financial lives.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: Thanks.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Hi, Marty.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: I wanted to focus on mortgage banking and the retention of those loans, more on the balance
sheet than continuing to push them to the G-SIBs. Is that regulatory driven? Or are you really kind of looking for that
higher retention rate, because you're looking for some assets that have duration? So is that one of the better maybe
option adjusted yields that you can get at this point?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Marty, you can come at this a fairly straightforward way, which is we have $1.2 trillion to
in deposits and we have $900 billion in loans. And if we put our own mortgages on the balance sheet, we know the
quality, we know the customer and we know that the servicing costs ultimately will be a lot less of how we're doing it.
If we buy third-party loans – so to extract the value of those deposits, we've got to invest in something. We've invested
substantially in treasuries. We have to – back to mortgages and mortgage-backed securities.
And so, the question is why buy someone else's, when you're producing your own? So it's really a very pragmatic view
of we want to control our destiny and mortgage going forward so that the customer we look in the eye and originate the
mortgage with is the customers we service for, is the customer we have the asset quality with, and there's no third-party
involved. It's more driven by us just getting to our own – controlling our own destiny.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: And a follow-up to that is that if you look at the impact of that on the business segments, you
actually are increasing the portfolio by about 30%, which is showing that retention. However, if you look at All Other,
it's more than over swamping that growth.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Right.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: So, you had about a $45 billion reduction. And kind of getting back to Mike's question about
where is the benefits going, just the reduction in All Other, that almost $50 billion of loans is over $1 billion worth of
NII that is kind of going away, whereas you're having to do and invest and spend money to generate the 30% growth in
the business. So, is the runoff still part of where some of the leakages that we're hoping to get in all the improvements
and growth that you're showing in the core? And when does that – what's left is about $100 billion, when is that finally
done so that you wouldn't have that leakage anymore?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Well, the – we used – there is an element that just as – we used to book that retained piece
in the central area. We stopped doing that. That's showing a changeover so you've got to think of it a little bit together.
And it's consistent with our peers. Most people have their consumer businesses booked to loans they retain. We just
didn't do that for years.
But remember, those – you've got to remember that you've got to think of the whole balance sheet. You're looking at
the loans category, the money comes out of the center because of liquidity demands and the rules. It goes into treasuries
and other securities, which are not in that chart because they're not loans, mortgage-backed securities and treasuries,
and that has a yield to it. Not as dollar-denominated as much as mortgages, but has a yield to it. That has been driven
more by the liquidity demands and LCRs than it is by anything else, which is the centralized portfolio. We've gone
from $100 billion liquidity four years or five years ago to $500 billion. So that has a cost to it – in prior years, that
could have been invested in high-yielding assets but not. Mortgages don't count for liquidity.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: Got you. Thanks.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: And again, look, the facts are we've been growing overall, so year-over-year, including those
segments, which as you point off by our strategy are running off faster, we're still growing the overall balance sheet.

We'll take our last question as a follow-up from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Hi. It's a follow-up on mortgage. So, I think one of your suppliers or one of your
partners, PHH, mentioned that you were going to be pulling back some of the servicing to yourself. And I just wanted
to understand, do you have to do anything to build for that book of business or is this already something that's in your
run rate on the expense side and we're going to be bringing in incremental revenues on the mortgage servicing side?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: It marginally will be absorbed. If you think about it, the total number of loans is relatively
small. The total – it'll go on the platform a very little change.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Okay. And is this the beginning of pulling it all over?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I would just say that we're trying to be consistent with our strategy of controlling our own
destiny.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Okay. All right. That's great. Thank you.
