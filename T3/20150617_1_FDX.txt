Frederick Wallace Smith
Thank you, Mickey. Welcome, everyone, to our discussion of results for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2015 just ended.
Solid FY 2015 earnings resulted from strong performance from each transport segment, all of which posted higher
volumes with improved base yields.
The past fiscal year was a good one in several other ways. We believe the three acquisitions we announced, Bongo,
GENCO and TNT, may prove as significant to FedEx as the additions of Flying Tigers in 1989 and Caliber Systems in
1998 because they provide best-in-class capabilities and fill critical gaps in our portfolio of customer solutions. Our
$1.6 million profit improvement plan we outlined in 2012 is on schedule and we are confident we will reach our goal.
And FedEx team members around the world again provided our customers great service especially during another
record-breaking peak season. Thanks to each and every one of these team members for their continued unmatched
performance.
We now look forward to FY 2016. We're very well-positioned for long-term growth, increased margins, cash flow and
returns.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Mike Glenn for his thoughts on the economy, and then Alan Graf will give you more
details on our financials. Mike?
T. Michael Glenn
Thank you, Fred, and good morning. We see moderate growth in the global economy. Our annual U.S. GDP forecast is
for 2.3% growth in calendar 2015 and for 2.9% growth in calendar 2016. We expect industrial production growth of

2.2% this year and 3.2% in calendar 2016. We expect global growth of 2.5% in calendar 2015 and 3% for calendar
2016.
Now, let me turn to make a couple comments regarding the company's yield performance by segment. Excluding the
impact of fuel, year-over-year Express domestic package yields grew 2.2%, primarily due to rate and discounts. In the
Ground segment, Ground yields per package, excluding SmartPost, increased 4.3% year-over-year, excluding the fuel
surcharge, driven primarily by the change in the dimensional weight surcharge and changes in weight and other
surcharges.
For SmartPost, yield increased 12.4% without fuel, primarily driven by change in customer mix. In the International
Export Express segment, excluding fuel, package yield decreased 2.4%, primarily driven by the negative impact of
exchange which outweighed the positive impact of rate, discount and weight changes. And in the Freight segment,
excluding the impact of fuel, yield per shipment increased 4.2% year-over-year, and the primary driver was rate and
discount and shipment class changes.

Alan B. Graf
Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share was $2.66 compared to
adjusted $2.54 last year, and we achieved a 10.5% operating margin on an adjusted basis.
Adjusted operating income was up 5% for the quarter and adjusted net income was flat as variable compensation,
benefits and net impact of fuel and higher Ground network expansion expenses were headwinds for FY 2015 versus
2014 in the quarter.
For the year, our adjusted operating income grew 19% and adjusted operating margin was 9.0%, up 110 basis points
versus last year. Adjusted EPS grew 27% per diluted share to $8.95 for the year. Annual results increased sharply due
to higher volumes in base yields in all three transportation segments, benefits from the profit improvement program
initiatives, and a favorable net fuel impact, partially offset by increased incentive compensation and higher aircraft
maintenance expense.
As we look at Express, we had a great quarter. Express Q4 adjusted operating income was up 12% versus last year's
adjusted income and adjusted operating margin improved 130 basis points to 8.9%. Our adjusted operating results at
Express improved due to higher base yield and U.S. domestic volume growth, the benefit from profit improvement
program initiatives and lower international expenses due to currency exchange rates. These benefits were partially
offset by an unfavorable net fuel impact, higher incentive compensation and a negative impact from weather, from the
early March weather. Revenue decreased 4% as lower fuel surcharges and unfavorable currency exchange rates more
than offset base yield and volume growth. U.S. domestic package volume grew 2%, driven by a 3% increase in
overnight box. The growth of our adjusted profitability despite lower revenue is a strong testament to the continued
cost management and productivity improvements.
Turning to our Ground segment, Ground margins for the quarter were negatively impacted by the GENCO acquisition
and related integration expenses, as well as increased self-insurance reserves. Outside of these factors, the Ground
operating margin would have been just slightly less than last year's 20%. Ground's average daily volume grew 5% in
Q4, primarily driven by growth in residential deliveries. SmartPost's average daily volume decreased 1% due to the
reduction in volume from a major customer. Excluding that customer, SmartPost volume grew 16%. Freight also had a
good quarter despite a sluggish less than truckload environment with operating income increasing 5% on 1% higher
revenue year-over-year. Operating results improved primarily due to the positive impact of higher LTL revenue per
shipment which is benefiting from our ongoing yield initiatives.
As you know, we previously announced during the fourth quarter that we changed our method of accounting for our
defined benefit pension and postretirement healthcare plans to a mark-to-market procedure which recognizes
immediately in earnings during each fourth quarter actuarial gains and losses resulting from the re-measurement of the

funded status of the plans. We believe the immediate recognition of actuarial gains and losses under mark-to-market
accounting is a preferable method of accounting as it aligns the recognition of changes in the fair value of the plan
assets and liabilities in the income statement with the fair value accounting principles which are used to measure the net
funded status of the plans.
We incurred a pre-tax mark-to-market loss of $2.2 billion in the quarter versus a $15 million gain in FY 2014 from our
actuarial adjustments to pension and postretirement healthcare plans. Our operating segments continue to bear the
service and interest costs for their employees that participate in the defined pension and postretirement healthcare
plans. Although actual asset returns are recognized in each fiscal period due to the mark-to-market adjustment, we
continue to recognize an estimated return on plan assets, or EROA, in the determination of net pension costs.
At the segment level, we have set our expected return at 6.5% for all periods which will equal our consolidated
expected return assumption in FY 2016. In fiscal years where the consolidated expected return is greater than 6.5%,
that difference is reflected as a credit in corporate eliminations and other. Prior periods have been recast to reflect these
changes. Mark-to-market accounting now in place, we will see less volatility in pension expense at the segment level.
In fact, pension expense in our FY 2016 guidance is flat year-over-year versus our adjusted FY EPS of $8.95.
Last week, we announced that we were boosting our quarterly dividend by 25% for a total of $0.25 per share per
quarter. In Q4, we repurchased 1.4 million shares at an average price of $170. Over the past two fiscal years, we have
repurchased a total of 45 million shares at an average price of $136 per share. Share repurchases increased adjusted
earnings year-over-year by $0.12 and $0.53 per diluted share net of interest expense for the fourth quarter and the year
respectively. As of May 31, 2015, we have 12.2 remaining shares authorized for repurchase.
Turning now to the outlook and based on the economic outlook that Mike discussed and the momentum we have, we
project adjusted earnings to be $10.60 to $11.10 per diluted share for FY 2016 before any year-end mark-to-market
pension accounting adjustments. These are driven by continued improvement in base pricing, volume growth and
benefits from our profit improvement program. These factors will more than offset anticipated increases in salary and
benefits as well as an anticipated unfavorable net yield impact for the year. The outlook does not include any operating
results nor integration planning and acquisition related expenses for TNT Express.
Looking at Express's outlook, we do expect revenues and earnings to increase during FY 2016 as U.S. domestic base
yields improve and international export package base yields improve as well, and of course, we will continue to focus
on revenue quality while managing our cost and productivity. We expect operating income to improve through the
continued execution of our profit improvement program including managing network capacity to meet customer
demand, reducing structural cost, modernizing our fleet and driving productivity increases throughout our U.S. and
international operations.
These savings will increase towards the latter part of the year as our various cost reduction and efficiency programs
continue to gain traction. And as Fred mentioned and Dave will discuss, we are on track to achieve our profit
improvement program as we outlined in 2012.
Ground revenues and operating income are expected to continue to grow in FY 2016, led by volume growth across all
of our major services due to market share gains. We also anticipate yield growth to continue during the year through
yield management programs including our dimensional weight rating changes.
Effective September 1, 2015, SmartPost will no longer be a subsidiary and will be merged into Ground. SmartPost will
continue to be an important service offering in the FedEx portfolio. By dissolving this subsidiary and merging the
business into Ground, we enable increased flexibility to leverage the strengths of both the Ground and SmartPost
networks.
We will launch new software that will enable us to combine packages that are destined to a common delivery address.
This increased delivery density enhances efficiency and productivity and profitability. Due to these operational changes
in our SmartPost service, we will begin to recognize revenue on a gross basis at SmartPost and for SmartPost revenue
services starting in FY 2016 including postal fees. Those will start in Q1.

We anticipate this change will dilute Ground segment margins by 100 basis points to 120 basis points but will have
absolutely no impact on Ground's net profit or cash flows. Higher network expansion cost will continue to partially
offset Ground's increase in operating income in FY 2016.
At Freight, we expect continued revenue operating income and margin growth in FY 2016 to be driven by volume and
revenue per shipment increases from our differentiated LTL services as well as continued network and operational
optimization. Freight is working diligently to improve productivity.
Although we don't give quarterly guidance, I'm going to give a little bit for the first quarter here. With the profit
improvement initiatives at Express continuing to gain traction throughout the year, we project much stronger
profitability growth in the second half of the year. We also expect year-over-year growth in our first quarter to be less
than the current consensus due to higher annual incentive compensation accruals in FY 2016's first quarter compared to
FY 2015.
Capital expenditures are going to increase in FY 2016 to approximately $4.6 billion. The increase from FY 2015 is
largely due to a higher investment and the continued expansion of the Ground network. Both the commercial and
residential service offerings at Ground continue to grow, thanks to industry-leading speed and reliability and continued
growth in e-commerce. Given Ground's historical high ROIC, investing in network expansion fits our financial
objectives as well as our operational objectives.
Moving to our tax rate, in FY 2015, our effective tax rate was 35.5% including the impact associated with our
mark-to-market pension accounting. We expect the FY 2016 effective tax rate to be in the range of 36% to 37% before
any year-end pension adjustments and excluding any impact from the TNT acquisition.
And lastly, I want to point out that our balance sheet remains strong and the rating agencies have reaffirmed our ratings
inclusive of the TNT acquisition.
With that, we will open the call for questions.

[Operator Instructions] And we will go first to Rob Salmon with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Robert H. Salmon>: Thanks. Alan, if you could provide a little bit more color with regard to the fiscal 2016
guidance, perhaps with an update with regard to the profit improvement plan, how you guys exited the fiscal fourth
quarter? And should we be thinking about something to the tune of $2.4 billion of EBIT at Express looking out to next
year, or are there some kind of puts? I think you had called out a net fuel headwind. Perhaps if you could also give a
little bit more color in terms of the overall expected headwind related to fuel?
<A - Alan B. Graf>: Well, I'll start and then I'll pass it over to Dave. Yeah, I think everybody has figured out the math
by now about what Express has to earn to hit our running rate in 2016, and you're not far off. But we're doing very well
here in terms of hitting our profit improvement program and we will hit it. And I'm going to turn it over to Dave, who
has under his leadership done a masterful job of getting the company in the position that it's in.
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Thanks, Alan. And thanks for the question. Yes, we're very confident. We're on track. We'll
hit our 75% run out rate. I'm sure you've all figured that out in your models by now. Had a great quarter, almost $600
million of profit, 9% margin, up 30% or more for the year. Our team has done a fantastic job in all five categories of
our profit improvement plan. So we're on track. We're on target. We're excited about the future. And I look forward to
more of the questions later.

We'll go next to Chris Wetherbee with Citi.
<Q - Christian Wetherbee>: Great. Thanks. Good morning. Maybe a question on pricing and just some of your
thoughts around the domestic environment. It seems from a competitive standpoint that price – sort of the posture
towards pricing is improving from your major competitor. Just want to get a rough sense of how you're seeing the
market develop within fiscal 2016 and maybe what's embedded in the fiscal 2016 guidance from a Ground standpoint?
Thank you.
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: This is Mike Glenn. I would characterize the pricing environment as very rational in terms of
Ground pricing. Obviously, the change that we made with the dimensional weight surcharge is now in full effect and
we expect those trends to continue. So, I just would characterize the pricing environment as rational.
Operator
And we'll go next to Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Alexander Vecchio>: Hi, there. Good morning. It's Alex in for Bill. Could you just clarify the comments on the
first quarter expectations for year-over-year growth to be a little bit less than consensus? Is that a reference to just the
overall earnings per share growth rate? And also just talk a little bit about why exactly the run rate of the savings or the
expected savings is going to be more back-half weighted than front-half weighted or just a little bit more clarity there
would be helpful.
<A - Alan B. Graf>: Sure. This is Alan. The good news for our employees and our team here is that we're all working
really hard to continue to grow our cash flows and our earnings, and that's reflected in what are going to be higher
accruals for our incentive compensation programs. And particularly in the first quarter, the accrual is going to be
significantly higher than it was a year ago. And so that's going to mean that we're going to come in below what the
current consensus is for Q1 but that's also factored into our annual guidance of $10.60 to $11.10.
Operator
And we'll go next to Ben Hartford with Robert W Baird.
<Q - Ben J. Hartford>: Hey. Good morning, guys. Dave, this is a question for you on – within Express. As you think
about the progress that you've made hitting your marks on the profit improvement target, it looks like the margin
profile looks a lot like it did throughout the mid-2000s. Obviously, it crested then just shy of 10%. You made some
changes with regard to compensation within that segment. I'm curious how you feel that that segment fits, how it may
differ today relative to last cycle to give us a sense whether when you conclude this program, there's further upside
opportunity as it relates to margins in the segment. Or maybe not and you believe that you've improved the capital
intensity, so return on invested capital at that margin level is better than a cycle ago. But any perspective that you might
be able to provide today and over the next 12 months how Express sits relative to the mid-2000s would be helpful.
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Well, thanks, and it's a great question because you're right. We were cresting right at 10%
right before the big recession. I would say we're actually in a better position and better shape right now because we've
actually brought our whole company around the world more in line with our cost structure and our revenues and so our
deferred packages now around the world are making us more money. Our network is more aligned to the right packages
and the right network. Our U.S. transformation has been fabulously successful where we have reduced our head count,
reduced some of our stations, we consolidated our routes.
So for last time around when our margins were up so high, we're better positioned now than we were back then. The
second half of the year for us, of course, is big as it was this year. We were running over 35%, ended up because of the
mark-to-market and so forth, some adjustments, weather and fuel. We ended up the year at 30%, so I would say we're
on track and probably a little bit ahead of where we were in FY 2015, going out into FY 2016. Our team has done a
great job, Mike Glenn and his team with my team managing the revenues and the yields around the world. But it's a

very good question and I appreciate the question because we are very proud of where we were back then. We're
actually in a better shape going forward now.
Operator
We'll go next to Kelly Dougherty with Macquarie.
<Q - Kelly A. Dougherty>: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow up on the Ground side. We've
obviously seen reports about your peers stepping up their yield improvement initiatives. So how should we think about
you responding competitively? Should we think that it benefits more on the pricing side or maybe from a volume
perspective if you're looking to be maybe a little bit less restrictive than they are to take some additional share? Just
kind of wondering how things shake out in Ground with this more rational pricing environment.
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: Well, this is Mike Glenn. Let me make a couple comments and I'll turn it over to Henry
Maier. We're currently working with our customers to plan for peak to ensure we have the right amount of capacity in
the right places to provide outstanding service which we've done the last couple of years. I think the most important
thing regarding peak pricing, however, is to ensure they have the right pricing in effect year-round to make sure that it
covers the investments that we make in our network to provide outstanding service. So the right pricing for 12 months a
year is first and foremost the primary objective not just pricing for three weeks to four weeks during the peak period.
Having said that, we are going to continue to monitor peak season shipping trends and evaluate potential pricing
changes on a customer-by-customer basis as required to ensure that we have the right return on investment. But let me
reemphasize again. The key to peak pricing is to have the right pricing in place 12 months out of the year, not three
weeks to four weeks out of the year.
<A - Henry J. Maier>: Yeah, Kelly, this is Henry Maier. Let me just add that when we look at customers, in
particular, the way we allocate capacity at peak, we allocate capacity to our existing customers. We don't take on any
volume for just one month a year. And it's really important that we do that because our customers tell us that our ability
to serve their needs during the peak season really drives how they expect to give volume to carriers the rest of the year.
So, we deal with that holistically with pricing but just philosophically, we very much base peak capacity, very scarce
peak capacity to the volume we get the other 11 months out of the year.
Operator
We'll go next to Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.
<Q - Scott A. Schneeberger>: Thanks. Good morning. Staying in Ground, I'm curious obviously a little bit of
slowdown in industrial production and the economy of late. On B2B, what kind of trends did you see in the quarter and
what are you thinking about with your outlook for B2B in the fiscal 2016? Thanks.
<A - Henry J. Maier>: Scott, this is Henry Maier. Volumes in the quarter were up 5% year-over-year. I can tell you
that I think volume for probably the last nine months has been a little bit on the soft side but that's just us. We're always
dissatisfied with our volumes. We are not seeing anything that would suggest that there's anything going on here. I
think that there clearly were some inventory disruptions with the port situation on the West Coast last year. We saw
that manifest itself mainly at peak because we saw volumes from customers come from places that, frankly, they didn't
expect them to come from and we didn't expect them to come from either. I think most of that is washed out now and
we expect fairly normal business levels going forward.

<Q - Jack Atkins>: Good morning, guys. Thanks for the time. Just going again back to the Ground segment, could you
maybe comment for a moment on the integration costs that you mentioned from GENCO that may have weighed on the
profitability at Ground during the quarter? Do you expect that to continue during FY 2016, and can you quantify that?
And then just a follow-up there. Alan, you talked about merging the SmartPost subsidiary and that could be dilutive to
margins in FY 2016 for Ground. Could you maybe flesh out a little bit as to why that's the case?
<A - Henry J. Maier>: Jack, this is Henry Maier. So let me – there's two questions there. Let me take the first one. We
are actively involved in integrating GENCO into FedEx. We have a very disciplined process for doing that. It takes 12
months to 18 months to pull that off. There are integration costs that we have to incur doing that. I think that we can
expect that with the full year results of GENCO in our plan with very, very light profits as a result of these costs that
GENCO will be a drag on our margins for FY 2016.
Concerning SmartPost, there's a number of things going on with SmartPost. First of all, we made a decision this year to
merge SmartPost into FedEx Ground. We did that for three reasons. One, our people provides more opportunities for
SmartPost people within FedEx Ground and vice versa. Operating them as a separate subsidiary created some burdens
to or some obstacles to freely moving people back and forth between the two companies. In the area of service, we've
discovered over the last couple of years that when we can maximize the use of facilities both SmartPost facilities and
Ground facilities, not only do we drive cost out of the equation but improved service. And this change helps affect that.
And then finally, on the profit side, we expect OpEx to go down significantly as a result of this change because we'll
have more efficient line haul and we'll make better use of our capital assets without adding CapEx going forward.
Now, as Alan alluded to, we have a piece of software that's going to be released this summer which will allow us to
match addresses in the network between SmartPost and FedEx Home Delivery. When we did two packages going to
the same address, we're going to divert that SmartPost into HD for delivery. We get significant savings when we do
that as you can imagine. The accounting rules suggest that when we decide what network the package is ultimately
going to go into for delivery, we have to recognize gross revenue instead of net. Now, there's absolutely no change in
the profitability of any of these services. SmartPost will continue to be a very important service offering in the
residential portfolio. But adding that gross revenue portion to the top-line with no corresponding operating profit
dilutes Ground's margins by 100 basis points to 120 basis points.

We'll go next to Art Hatfield with Raymond James.
<Q - Art W. Hatfield>: Hey. Good morning, everybody. Every so often we hear about a prominent user of parcel
services that is deciding or trying to decide whether or not they want to do delivery on their own. And I think it creates
a lot of confusion about the impact that that may have on your business, or UPS's business. Can you address what the
impact any one customer could have on your business, and how people should think about that? Also whether or not
they could become a competitive threat over the long haul?
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: Well, first of all, let me just say that setting up a transportation network is an extremely
capital-intensive network, requires very sophisticated information technology and takes a very long time to build out to
scale to be able to provide the type of service that customers expect. I think what a lot of people lose in this
conversation is the fundamental input costs on pickup and delivery. And that while technology today has certainly
made user interface much more streamlined and easy as in the case of some of the applications we're all accustomed to
today, the fundamental input costs have not changed.
The other part about it that I think people lose sight of is the customer experience. Research has indicated time and time
again that a uniformed person with proper identification showing up at your doorstep is an important issue for
customers. And consistency of customer experience is very critical in that regard. So, when you talk about the
challenges of building a network at scale, the input costs, the technology issues, and the customer experience required
to deliver what customers expect of companies like FedEx and our primary competitors, it's a pretty tall hill to climb.
So, obviously, we continue to monitor these situations and opportunities that pop up from time to time but we feel

We'll go next to Scott Group with Wolfe Research.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Hey. Thanks. Good morning, guys. So, Alan, with the guidance for the year being a little
back-ended, can you help give us some numbers to just get some comfort in terms of how big is the incentive comp or
stock-based comp headwind in the first quarter or the first half of the year? And is it right to think that that becomes a
tailwind in the third and really the fourth quarter? And how big of a year-over-year tailwind is that going to be in the
back half?
<A - Alan B. Graf>: Well, Scott, as you know, we usually don't get down to that granularity level but it's significant to
the first half versus last year's first half and particularly the first quarter because we're accruing at a higher rate. I think
we go from $8.95 to our range. It's a significant achievement for all of our employees and we need to reward them
accordingly. We're talking about incentive as cash compensation here. We're talking about our annual incentive
compensation program.
We're not talking about any of our stock or stock option programs. It's simply related to the cash part of our incentive
compensation. So, it's significant. It's in the yearly guidance and, as I said, we quit giving you quarterly guidance
because, frankly, I couldn't hit the numbers. So, I freely admit that but I'm very comfortable about the year.
Operator
We'll go next to Tom Wadewitz with UBS.
<Q - Thomas Wadewitz>: Yeah. Good morning. I wanted to ask you a bit more on Ground. You've got a lot of
moving parts going on there. If I look at the fourth quarter numbers and assuming I'm looking at the right adjusted
numbers, it looks like operating income was only up a touch year-over-year. And I'm wondering – so I assume there
were maybe some GENCO costs and so forth. But how much operating profit growth would you expect in Ground in
fiscal 2016? Is it 5%? Is it 15%? What's the right ballpark to be in for operating income growth in Ground?
And I guess on the SmartPost comments, I'm a little confused. I think you've said, well, there are efficiency gains from
integrating SmartPost with the Ground network and so forth, but we wouldn't expect any change in profitability in that.
I understand the optics of the margin impact to gross revenue versus net, but wouldn't there be some operating income
benefit over time from that integration? So, there's a couple there on Ground. Thank you.
<A - Alan B. Graf>: Hey, Tom. I'll start and I'll turn it over to Henry. Your question about net income in the quarter,
that is the result of our increased self-insurance reserve catch-up that we had to make in the quarter. And that's why that
net income is flat. The margin was down because of the GENCO addition of revenue with very little income associated
with that. And so I'll turn it over to Henry for the rest.
<A - Henry J. Maier>: Yeah, I think it's safe to assume that there's going to be fairly significant OpEx savings with
the SmartPost change. Obviously, there's a lot of moving parts there. We're going to do that in pieces to make sure that
we preserve the service. And I would venture a guess to say that most of that will occur in the late second half of the
year and will likely be realized in FY 2017.

<Q - Allison M. Landry>: Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if you could maybe break down the CapEx
guidance of $4.6 billion between Express and Ground. And directionally, is the Ground spending higher or lower than
maybe what you were thinking perhaps a year ago?
<A - Alan B. Graf>: Allison, this is Alan. We are significantly stepping up Ground investment in 2016 versus 2015.
That explains the entire increase year-over-year. This will be the peak, we believe. Because as you bring on, as Henry
will tell you here shortly, as you start building hubs and bring things online, we have a fairly substantial step function
particularly because we're so highly automated and those investments are going to give us returns right away. But that's
why the CapEx is going up in 2016 and it's entirely related to our increased investment in Ground. Henry?
<A - Henry J. Maier>: Yeah, Allison, we have a CapEx budget in FY 2016 of $1.6 billion. 90% of that is for network
expansion due to growth. This will be our peak year. I think you can expect that in 2017 and years beyond, our CapEx
should drop 30%, 35% from where it is this year.
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: This is Mike Glenn. I've got an email question from Brandon Cannon from Gutenberg
Equity Research. It's regarding Ground yields. Can you provide some insight into Ground yield exiting the quarter?
With the first full quarter of dimensional weight changes behind us, should we expect some decline in yield heading
into FY 2016 as customers adjust packaging?
I touched on this a bit earlier and as I just remind everyone that we announced this change six months in advance and
the reason we did that is to give customers plenty of time to start making adjustments and many customers have made
adjustments in their packaging. We would certainly hope that they will continue to evaluate their packaging going
forward but, having said that, we don't expect any material change in trend in the dimensional weight surcharge going
forward.
Operator
Okay. And we'll go next to Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Kenneth Scott Hoexter>: Okay, great. Good morning. If I could just follow up again on Ground. It seems like a
lot of questions, but just because you're spending more and obviously you're talking about lower margins and I get the
GENCO lower margin impact and the SmartPost consolidated impact, but yet I think, Alan, you mentioned that overall
Ground margins were up if you exclude a lot of that. I just want to understand is e-commerce having a larger negative
impact? And then maybe your thoughts on the contractor lawsuit and thoughts on margin impact going forward, is that
something you're going to continue to see costs increasing? Does that expand beyond California and other thoughts on
expenses related to that? Thanks.
<A - Alan B. Graf>: Ken, Ground margins in the fourth quarter adjusted for the one-time insurance reserve change and
GENCO would have been around 19.2%. The delta between last year and this year on an apples-to-apples basis would
have largely been driven by increased appreciation in rent due to network expansion. And I will turn the other question
over to Chris.
<A - Christine P. Richards>: Hello. This is Chris Richards and I'll try to answer your question on the Alexander case
in California. The settlement in Alexander resolves claims that go back to 2000 and concern a model that FedEx
Ground no longer operates. The settlement is really unique because while we disagree with the Ninth Circuit's decision
that applies to this case, we have to recognize that decision and the size of the class and impacts to California state laws
on the damages sought by the class. The settlement covers about 2,375 class members who signed operating
agreements with FedEx Ground between 2000 and 2007. The parties have agreed that the settlement will resolve any
claim damages by the class members through the current year.
California law imposes by far the most penalties and damages of any state. So if we have settlements with other states,
this settlement is not an accurate measure to predict potential expense. Ground has one more than 100 cases of this type
during its history. We continue to challenge the appeals at the Eleventh Circuit, at the Eighth Circuit and recently
received a very favorable decision in the Massachusetts case which is now on appeal at the First Circuit where the

We'll go next to Tom Kim with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Tom Kim>: Good morning. I have a question on Express. We continue to see some unevenness in the growth in
IP and IE, obviously, last quarter we saw IP package volume dipped a little bit with just obviously incremental growth
in IE. And I'm wondering is there anything that you're seeing to suggest that we could see a pickup in IP in the fiscal
2016 outlook? And then if not, can you talk about what you might be able to do to adjust your cost structure
accordingly, whether it's retiring more fleet or using third-party capacity or leveraging [indiscernible] (43:06) a bit
more. So, if you give us a little bit of color on that, that'd be helpful. Thanks.
<A - Alan B. Graf>: Okay. Thanks, Tom. Just so you know, the boxes which is what our focus is, is growing very
nicely. The envelopes, of course, are declining. So that would be how the numbers, they're all rolled together, but that's
where you would see that end result. But I think that going forward, we've actually – and several of you have sent notes
to Mickey Foster on our fleet and our network and so forth. We've adjusted our network, as you probably know in
April, where we actually adjusted our system form and took down one of our trans-Pacific flights. So we're down one
trans-Pacific flight there now.
That being said, we have adjusted it to the point where we still actually have 83% of our traffic moves as International
Priority. And when we're moving deferred traffic, we're moving it in a system like our FedEx Trade Networks system.
It actually makes more money on our deferred traffic as well. So, we're very well positioned. Boxes are growing.
Documents are declining somewhat in international. And so going forward, we think we're in very good shape.
Operator
We'll go next to Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.
<Q - Brandon R. Oglenski>: Hey. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if
the team can just comment on what we're seeing economically because it sounds like you took down your growth
forecast for 2015. And if I heard Mike correctly, it sounds like you have some acceleration baked into 2016. So, are
there expectations from your customers? What's driving the brighter outlook in the back half of your fiscal 2016 year?
And then if I could follow up as well on Tom Kim's question here, if things aren't that great, it looks like you do have a
net reduction in your fleet for the first time in quite some time at Express. Can you talk to, apart from the trans-Pacific
frequency, is there domestic capacity that can also be rationalized?
<A - Henry J. Maier>: Let me go ahead and start with the second part of your question. We're actually modernizing
our fleet, so we're getting rid of very inefficient fuel-burning aircraft that's high maintenance to a newer fleet, better
maintenance, better reliability, better fuel efficiency. So, we're balancing our fleet in the United States and around the
world. And that's part of our profit improvement plan.
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: This is Mike Glenn. The primary reason for the lower GDP outlook for the remainder of
2015 and the first quarter, as you know, the first quarter came in at negative 0.7% GDP growth year-over-year, and as a
result of that, that took down the annual number. We do expect stronger growth in the second half of the year and our
forecast really hasn't materially changed in the second half.

We'll go next to Matt Troy with Nomura.
<Q - Matt Troy>: Thank you. Just a quick one. I wanted to understand directionally, you guys with the self-help
initiatives have done a lot of heavy-lifting in the Express segment and there seems to be an undercurrent of concern that
the targets for next year may be back-end loaded. You've done a good job of explaining how incentive comp is driving
some of that but given the magnitude of what you came in on, on an EBIT basis and we've got a year left to target, can
you just help us in light of the confidence you expressed on the makeability, what are the major buckets to get there? I
mean is it primarily at this point those aircraft retirements you talked about and the fleet enhancement? How much of it
is tied to things you can directionally control and have line of sight because you seem very confident in the
makeability. I just want to make sure that this isn't primarily something pricing or volume dependent. That would be it.
<A - Alan B. Graf>: Hey, Matt, I'll start. It's Alan. First of all, it's really much more of a first quarter issue again on
this incentive compensation but also our maintenance expense at Express is going to be flat year-over-year. And it was
fairly high in the third and fourth quarters. So that's another benefit to the second half. But more importantly, let me
just say that back in October of 2012, we didn't think we were going to have any negative GDP growth quarters. We
thought we were going to have a 3% to 3.5% growth rate in the U.S. and a better international. None of those things
have materialized. So where we're really being outstanding is our performance across the board in productivity and cost
management.
And although we don't talk about it very much, I'm going to kick it over to my partner, Rob Carter, in IT because our IT
transformation here is nothing short of spectacular. Rob's team spent less money in fiscal 2015 than they did in fiscal
2014 and are going to be flat in 2016 while they're modernizing our IT making us quicker to market. I just let him talk
about that a little bit. This is a very big part of our profit improvement program and why we're part of the region why
we're so confident in our ability to achieve it.
<A - Rob B. Carter>: Well, thanks, Alan. The profit improvement plan is definitely a team support where lots of parts
of the business are contributing and we are just relentlessly focused on simplifying and modernizing our IT footprint
and that has a couple of really important benefits. One is it lowers the cost as we modernize and simplify that footprint,
we spend a lot less money on infrastructure and infrastructure upgrades. But then secondarily, it makes us more agile as
the business that modernize footprint is much more flexible to meet the needs of the business to shift volumes and to
represent customer needs more effectively. So thanks, Alan. We're proud of what we've done and we plan to continue
to relentlessly focus on lowering cost and making the environment much more agile.
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Let me jump in here. This is Dave Bronczek. Rob's right. Rob and his team have done a
great job. Our profit improvement plan, we have a clear line of sight on really all five of the categories. The fleet
modernization is performing magnificently. Our aircraft maintenance, as Alan pointed out, is going to be flat
year-over-year which was always part of our plan. Our U.S. domestic operations led by Matt Thornton and Pigors,
excellent productivity, great cost control. The international network is performing as good or better than I actually
thought it would be and we have – the plan around the world is actually achieving all of our goals. What we actually
didn't try to accomplish was overreaching on revenue. So Mike Glenn and his team and we partner on that is we were
taking more aggressive steps on our cost networks around the world, they're performing magnificently. So the line of
sight is pretty clear for us and we're very confident.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: This is Fred Smith. I have two questions that came over the Internet. One of them –
another one about airplanes which I will let Dave Bronczek read and answer here in a minute and a second one about
Freight which Mike Ducker can answer from Washington. For Freight, could we discuss ongoing yield initiatives and
how they specifically relate to new hires, either drivers or dockworkers?
And there is a question related there. I'm interested in any incremental productivity gains related to new IT
deployments. I think in the macro sense you can take what Rob just said for the enterprise and apply them specifically
to FedEx Freight as well. There will be in the next few years significant productivity improvements in FedEx Freight as
a result in the software improvements that we'll be applying to the business. Now, as to the new hiring in Freight,
drivers or dockworkers as they relate to yield initiatives, let me ask Mike Ducker to answer that question. Mike?

<A - Michael L. Ducker>: Yes. Thanks, Fred. Yes, we hired to catch up with the demand from the first half in
preparation for the busy season. So our salaries, wages and education costs accelerated. Most of those are drivers which
will serve us very well going forward and our teams are focused right now working hard to get the productivity
increased and balance those with – balance those with the volumes in the network as these new team members hit their
normal efficiencies. Also, the performance on the small and medium segment has been very good in terms of yield
improvements there. That was the one that we were targeting for the most part. So the fundamentals are really sound in
the business.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: We have a question, came in on the Internet that Dave Bronczek has now read about
the airplanes and he will answer it for you. Let me make two comments here: one on the broad sense; and then
secondarily to Dave on the airplane side. I think the important thing the people that follow FedEx should focus on is
our constant comments that we are very confident that we will continue to increase margins, cash flows and returns.
And we told you that in 2012 and we've consistently done that.
So let me reiterate that the management team around this table is very confident that we will continue to increase
margins, cash flows and returns. Having said that, we are a big outfit and we buy lots of trucks, lots of Ground support
equipment, lots of trailers. Between Ground and Freight, I was just looking at these numbers the other day, we have
over 70,000 28-foot pups. There was an article in The Wall Street Journal a couple of days ago about UPS handling
oversize packages and I can tell you that the growth in those oversize packages is a big deal in e-commerce. So we're
very, very hopeful that the Congress will increase the limit on twin trailers from 28 feet to 33 feet. Because it will take
thousands of vehicles off the road, improve safety, save fuel, reduce emissions and allow both the LTL and the Ground
parcel businesses to better reflect the needs of the nation's supply chain.
Now, as it applies to airplanes, they're just like trucks and Ground support equipment. We need to buy to modernize the
fleet, 12 airplanes, 15 airplanes a year and we continue to do that. And you can count on us continuing to do that
because they're aluminum, they oxidize, they wear out, and the new models, fortunately, burn a lot less fuel and are
much more reliable. For instance, one of the reasons that the fleet can go down is we don't need as many spares with
the new technology airplanes as we did with the old ones. Now, having said that, Dave, you take over.
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Yeah, thanks, Fred. This question came in from William Flinn from Potomac. Says with
regards to Express and the recently retired 15 aircraft, 21 related engines and the adjusted retirement schedule of the
additional 23 aircraft and 57 engines, what is the timeframe for the ongoing fleet reconfiguration to incrementally boost
margins?
This was all part of the plan, William. It was all part of the profit improvement plan. Those planes that we talked about
retiring, they were all basically parked in the desert, they were in engine repair that was going to be too expensive to
bring back in, as Fred pointed out. So it's probably incrementally going to boost our profits more but it's all part of our
fleet modernization which is a big part of our plan. So you're right, and you focused on a very important point. The
fleet modernization does boost our productivity and our profitability.
<A - Alan B. Graf>: Just want to add one more thing about our profit improvement plan and our confidence. If you
take anything away from today about Express, let me just focus you on the fact that in the fourth quarter, the revenue
line was down 4% and the adjusted rate at operating income line was up 12%. So, it is a lot of hard work and elbow
grease and productivity improvements and tough cost management that we're continuing, that we have ingrained in all
of our companies and it's going to continue and that's why we're so confident the way that Fred spoke.
And by the way, that 12% increase in adjusted operating income could have been a lot higher had it not been for fuel,
incentive comp and weather. So, we're highly confident about Express and that's in our guidance for 2016 and I'll give
you guidance in 2017 a year from now but I'm just as excited about that as I am about 2016.

<Q - Donald A. Broughton>: Good morning, gentlemen, ladies. There's been certainly – beyond your TNT acquisition
in the freight forwarding space, there's been one acquisition after another after another, mergers, both in domestic and
global. How, if at all, does it change your competitive outlook, your strategic approach to the market, to see all these
mergers and acquisitions in your space in general but especially in the freight forwarding space?
<A - Alan B. Graf>: This is Alan. I'll start. Obviously, we've been very aggressive in the acquisition space over a long
number of years. I expect we will continue to be aggressive in the acquisition space over the next several years. We
invest for the long-term around here. But we also are very concerned with shareholder returns as evidenced by our
buyback and our increasing dividends. As to any specifics about any specific space, I will just say that it depends on the
fit, the culture, the price and all three of those things are vital and we're working on the TNT integration planning right
now, which by the way is going very well, thanks for asking. And I'll turn it over to Chris on the other.
<A - Christine P. Richards>: This is Chris Richards, and I have an email question that came in from Scott Group of
Wolfe Research. Can you give an update on the TNT acquisition and timing? Could it be completed earlier than
expected?
Well, I sure hope so. We are doing a tremendous job. We are preparing to submit our initial offering documents as
required by Dutch law by the end of this month and we are well underway with the preparation of the necessary filings
with competition authorities. We have been in consultation with the European Competition Commission and continue
to believe FedEx and TNT operations are highly complementary in Europe, and we do not believe that the transaction
faces any competition issues for the Commission.
So we're in good shape. We're going to try to get this done as quickly as we can. My boss asks me this question about
once a week. So let me assure you, it's top of mind here at FedEx.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: And I'd like to thank Chris Richards who's had a tough time speaking the last four
days and I have to tell you, sometimes I would applaud my General Counsel not being able to say anything when she
comes into my office. But thanks for coming out this morning, Chris, because I know it's been hard with that laryngitis

related to TNT. Do you have any estimate on costs that you expect to be related to TNT in the upcoming fiscal year?
And then just one quick question for FedEx Freight. What was the change in average length of haul year-over-year in
the fourth quarter?
<A - Alan B. Graf>: First of all, we're not going to answer the average length of haul. That's down in the weeds. That's
what I would call not a strategic question. But as to – yes, I have a pretty good idea of what we're going to spend on
TNT and I'll report it each quarter as we actually spend it.

beyond, when you factor in the TNT acquisition and any major CapEx needs you see in Europe?
<A - Alan B. Graf>: I think 2017 will be another year that's going to be a little bit on the high-end of our range. We'd
like to be at the 6% to 8% of revenue but the way our aircraft delivery schedule is shaping up at the moment, it looks
like 2017 will be a little bit higher than that, maybe in the 9% to 9.5% range. But after that, we will just see. But as I
