With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Marillyn.
Marillyn A. Hewson
Thanks, Jerry. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call. As today's release illustrates, we
completed another quarter of solid operational accomplishments, while exceeding all of our full year financial goals.
And I couldn't be more proud of our team. They remain focused on mission success for our customers and financial
results for stockholders, while also supporting extensive portfolio reshaping actions.
We have a number of significant events to discuss today. In addition to reviewing our financial and operational results,
I want to provide an update on the FY 2016 DoD budget and a discussion of two completed strategic actions, the
closure of our acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft and our decision to separate and combine our Information Systems &
Global Solutions business with Leidos in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction.
Financially, 2015 was an exceptional year with achievement of multiple new high watermarks for the corporation. I
was especially pleased to see the broad-based domestic and international customer support for our portfolio of
products. This support resulted in our achieving a record level of backlog of nearly $100 billion. Excluding the
acquired Sikorsky backlog, the rest of our portfolio achieved $84 billion, significantly surpassing the $80 billion goal
we outlined at the beginning of 2015. Our backlog has us positioned to deliver expanding sales levels and financial
results as we move forward in 2016 and beyond.
The second area where we achieved another high watermark was the generation of over $5 billion in cash from
operations, achieving a record annual level for the corporation in this critically important area. This cash flow is only
achieved through the daily efforts and focus of our team in executing on contracts for our customers. The robust cash
generation also enabled us to expand our cash return to stockholders to a record annual level of $5 billion, achieved
through our industry-leading dividend payout level and ongoing share repurchase activity.
For 2015, share repurchases reduced the year-end outstanding share count to approximately 305 million shares. We are
well on our way to achieve or exceed our goal to reduce outstanding shares to below 300 million by the end of 2017.
Overall, the corporation continued to excel in the attributes we most value, providing critical solutions to customers and
returning value to stockholders.
Looking beyond 2015, our 2016 guidance outlined today, results in increased sales, earnings per share, and growing
cash from operations. The guidance includes the Sikorsky financials from the recently completed acquisition, and also
reflects the realignment of our Information Technology and technical services businesses. The guidance also assumes
continuation of the results for the full year of 2016 from the Information Systems & Global Solutions business
identified in our strategic review. We will adjust our financial outlook later this year when the disposition of IS&GS is
completed.
Bruce will provide a detailed review of the guidance and assumptions in his comments and Web charts. I'd like to
briefly discuss the defense budget. Since we spoke last quarter, significant uncertainly was removed with the successful
completion of a bipartisan agreement of the FY 2016 base DoD budget. The new budget reflects an annual increase of
approximately $25 billion above the previously planned budget level and is also the first increase in annual DoD budget
since 2012. The budget is a recognition of increasing global security requirements and the need to allocate additional
fiscal resources to respond to the threat environment.
A key element in the increased DoD budget is a double-digit annual percentage increase in the investment accounts that
fund new equipment procurement and research and development activities. This strong funding increase will be used to
address the acute need to replace aging equipment while ensuring development of key new technologies to respond to
evolving security requirements facing domestic and international customers.
As part of the budget, we were pleased to see 11 additional F-35 aircraft added in the FY 2016 omnibus. This marks the
first time in the history of the F-35 program that aircraft were added to the baseline request, demonstrating strong
support for our largest program. We believe our portfolio of products and new technologies will line up very well with

the central recapitalization actions in the areas of ballistic missile defense, tactical missiles, and rotary aircraft.
I'd like to now turn to the two strategic actions we announced back in July. First, we were proud to welcome the
Sikorsky team to Lockheed Martin with the successful closure of their acquisition on November 6. Together, we will
build upon a legacy of innovation and performance that has shaped the history of aviation for more than a century. This
action advances our commitment to provide customers with affordable, mission-ready solutions in rotary aircraft. Their
inclusion will enable us to move forward with our goal to expand our business and to the strategically important areas
of helicopter production and sustainment.
Since the transaction closure, the combined team at Mission Systems and Training have hit the ground running. We are
already seeing accelerated customer interest in both military and search and rescue opportunities emerging in the
Middle East, Asia, and Eastern Europe.
It is increasingly clear that we will be better together as we leverage our combined scale and serve as a technology
leader at the forefront of vertical lift. I am enthusiastic about the opportunities for long-term value creation of this
business as we move forward in providing essential products and solutions to customers around the world.
Turning to our second strategic item, as announced earlier today, we completed the review of our Information Systems
& Global Solutions businesses. That review culminated in our decision to separate and combine our IS&GS business
with Leidos in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction. We are excited about this path forward and believe this is the best fit
strategically and will be beneficial to the shareholders of both corporations. This transaction is an important milestone
in the portfolio-shaping strategy we announced last July and allows us to focus on our core business in aerospace and
defense.
The combination of our proven IT and technical services businesses with Leidos will create a more diversified
competitor positioned for growth and future success, while unlocking value for our stockholders. This agreement aligns
the IS&GS business with an industry leader in government IT and technical services and will create an enterprise
capable of providing unparalleled solutions in industries ranging from national security to health and life sciences.
The complementary portfolios of both companies will create a diversified and balanced business mix with expanded
domain expertise, increased advantages of scale efficiencies and synergy opportunities. These benefits will be the
foundation to create value for stockholders, customers and employees.
One of the important goals in our strategic evaluation of the business was to ensure that the final decision provides a
good cultural fit and home for IS&GS employees. It is my belief that employee morale and opportunities for their
growth are key elements in the future success of every enterprise.
Over the last few months, during our many interactions with Leidos, we have come to know their management and
culture and we are confident that this combination fully satisfies our employee goal. Bruce will speak more about the
financial aspects of the transaction and the projected time line for closure in his remarks.
I'd like to end my remarks with a few key operational highlights in the fourth quarter that enabled the corporation to
finish the year on a very strong note.
Starting with the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, we achieved our full-year delivery goal of 45 aircraft to domestic and
international customers. This delivery level reflects our continuing ramp-up in production on the program and is a 25%
increase above prior year deliveries. For 2016, we are expecting additional production expansion with planned
deliveries increasing to 53 aircraft. The team also continued to retire key task on the F-35 development program as we
look forward to completing remaining tasks in 2016 as the development phase winds down.
Switching to the C-130J airlifter, multiple highlights were achieved in the quarter, with delivery of the 2,500 aircraft
and receipt of the multiyear two contract that extends the production line into the late 2019. This contract was a portion
of the $26 billion in total new contract awards we secured in the quarter and enabled an achievement of a strong
book-to-bill ratio for the full year of 2015. We also made progress on growing our international sales content, which
grew 6% above prior year levels and expanding the international sales content to 21% of total corporate sales.

I'll close by stating that 2015 was an exceptional year for our corporation and we implemented bold strategic actions to
better position the business for operational and financial success. We secured record new business awards and cash
generation, both essential components to future corporate success and value creation. Looking forward, I am
enthusiastic about the future contributions we can provide to customers and stockholders with our enhanced corporate
posture.
I'll now turn the call over to Bruce to review our financial performance in more detail, outline our 2016 financial
guidance, and then we'll open up the line for your questions.
Bruce L. Tanner
Thanks, Marillyn, and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along
with the Web charts that we included with our earnings release today.
Let's begin with chart 3 and an overview of our results for the year. Sales for the year were $46.1 billion, ahead of our
expectations from when we spoke in the third quarter. Our segment operating margin was also better than expected,
ending the year at 11.9%, and this enabled us to achieve earnings per share of $11.46 for the year.
Cash from operations for the year was our highest ever at $5.1 billion. We returned $5 billion of cash to our
stockholders in the year, led by repurchasing 15.2 million shares for $3.1 billion. And we grew our backlog
significantly to almost $100 billion for the integration of Sikorsky into the corporation. We'll cover all these items in
more detail in the coming charts for what was an exceptional year in 2015.
On chart 4, we compare our sales and earnings per share for 2015 with our results in 2014. Sales were about $0.5
billion higher this year than last year, including the addition of about $400 million of sales from Sikorsky for the short
period after the close in early November.
Even without the Sikorsky sales, we were slightly higher than last year's results and better than we had expected when
we spoke in October as we had higher volume in several business areas as we closed the year.
Earnings per share were $0.25 higher than last year at $11.46 for the full year and were also higher than the guidance
we provided in October, driven by the increased sales volume and improved performance.
On chart 5, we'll discuss our share repurchase activity. We repurchased 15.2 million shares in 2015, nearly 4 million
shares more than in 2014, and that brought our shares outstanding at year-end to 305 million shares. This positions us
well to achieve our goal of reducing share count below 300 million shares by the end of 2017.
At the end of 2015, we have around 4 million unexercised options, which is a significantly lower level than we had
several years ago. And the announced transaction with Leidos creates the potential to reduce share count by up to 15
million shares upon closure later this year.
If you'll turn to chart 6, we'll review our cash returned to stockholders in 2015. Our cash from operations, as we said
earlier, was $5.1 billion, and with about $900 million in capital expenditures in the year, we had $4.2 billion of free
cash flow. With $1.9 billion in dividends along with $3.1 billion in share repurchases, we returned $5 billion to our
stockholders in 2015, the highest amount in our history, and this represents 120% of our free cash flow for the year.
Chart 7 shows our backlog levels over the last five years. 2015 represents the fifth consecutive year that we've ended
the year with more than $80 billion in backlog. Without the addition of Sikorsky's backlog, 2015 would have still
represented the highest backlog level in our history at more than $84 billion. And with Sikorsky, our backlog is nearly
$100 billion.
On chart 8, we discuss our outlook for 2016. We are expecting sales to be in the range of $49.5 billion to $51 billion,
and this range includes the realigned IS&GS business area for the entire year as it is our practice not to incorporate
adjustments such as our RMT transaction until they've been consummated. I'll provide more color on the sales ranges
by business area in a couple of charts.

Our outlook for segment operating profit is a range of $4.9 billion to $5.50 billion. I'll also show you the range by
business area in a couple of charts. Our FAS/CAS adjustment is higher than we provided on the October call and I'll
discuss the reasons behind the increase on the next chart. We expect our earnings per share will be between $11.45 and
$11.75 for the year. And our outlook from cash from operations is strong again this year at $5.3 billion, up from the $5
billion we projected in the October call.
Chart 9 provides a reconciliation of the expected 2016 FAS/CAS adjustment that we discussed in October compared
with our current guidance. We had an actuarial update to the mortality or longevity assumptions that reduced our
longevity estimates and results in a lower FAS expense and increased the FAS/CAS benefit by $125 million.
Our prior assumed discount rate of 4.25% increased at year-end to 4.375%, which resulted in a $60 million
improvement in the FAS/CAS benefit. The actual return on our pension assets was a negative 2% rather than a zero
return we expected in October, which results in a $40 million reduction in the benefit. And with some minor
adjustments which improved $20 million, we increased the FAS/CAS benefit for 2016 by $165 million to $975 million
in total.
Chart 10 provides our sales and segment operating profit outlook by business area for the year, and all but Aeronautics
had been adjusted since we spoke in October to incorporate the addition of Sikorsky, the realignment of the heritage
IS&GS business or, in the case of MST, both.
Overall, sales excluding Sikorsky will be roughly comparable to our level in 2015, although 2015 finished stronger
than we had expected. And our segment operating profit and margin before the incorporation of Sikorsky is right in line
with where we expect it to be when we spoke in October.
I want to draw your attention to MST and the incorporation of Sikorsky into that business area as we've made some
significant adjustments to account for purchase accounting and integration which we'll discuss more on the next page.
Chart 11 captures the adjustments made to Sikorsky outlook for both sales and profit. Beginning with purchase
accounting, the largest impact to profit is the incorporation of the noncash, intangible amortization associated with the
acquisition, which lowers profit by approximately $230 million based on current projections which can change as we
finalize our purchase accounting analysis. And we impacted both sales and profit by what are called customer inventory
rights.
Essentially, this recognizes the portion of government contracts that were partially completed by Sikorsky before our
purchase and for which Lockheed Martin can only recognize the sales and profit that has occurred since our ownership.
This adjustment reduced the sales by $400 million and profit by $30 million, and is weighted much more heavily in the
first part of the year as you would imagine. You will notice a similar sales reduction in 2015 described in our earnings
release.
Cost to integrate Sikorsky into the corporation along with the remaining cost to complete the restructuring actions
announced by Sikorsky last year before our purchase amount to another $115 million reduction in profit this year. All
told, these adjustments reduced sales by around $400 million in profit by $375 million in 2016.
If you'll turn to chart 12, we'll discuss the impact for the transaction with Leidos that was announced this morning.
Stockholders of Lockheed Martin will receive $5 billion of value for our contributed assets in a very tax efficient
structure. Just to put some sizing to the tax benefits, we would have needed to sell the business for almost $7.7 billion
to have created the same after-tax value as the transaction we announced.
At current valuations, we would receive the $5 billion in the form of $3.2 billion in equity from Leidos for 50.5%
ownership in the newly-formed company, and $1.8 billion from a special cash payment to Lockheed Martin. The $1.8
billion special cash payment is a fixed amount through closing, while the equity amount will vary with changes in the
value of Leidos' shares until closing. Because this is structured as a stock split-off, an additional benefit we would
anticipate is the reduction in our share count of up to 15 million shares.

In addition, Lockheed Martin's stockholders, who choose to participate in the split, will also benefit from the synergies
created by the new company, which are expected to be $120 million a year at steady state. And because this is
anticipated to be a stock split-off, we expect to have a significant book gain of more than $1.5 billion at closure.
On chart 13, we show the expected high-level impact of some of our future financial measures after the IS&GS
transaction is complete, compared to what those results would have otherwise been had we retained the IS&GS
business. We expect our sales growth rate will be higher under the new structure. GAAP earnings per share should be
neutral to slightly positive as the share count reduction from the transaction more than offsets the lost operating profit
from IS&GS.
Cash from operations is also expected to be higher as the increase in cash generation from Sikorsky offsets the lost cash
generated by IS&GS. Return on invested capital should be higher after the transaction as a result of using the proceeds
to reduce our invested capital base. And we expect shares outstanding to be lower because of the stock split-off
arrangement. And at the end of the day, we think the new organization better positions the company for long-term
growth.
Finally on chart 14, we have our summary. 2015 really was an exceptional performance year, particularly given the
strategic actions we undertook. We finished the year strong and we set a very solid foundation for 2016. We continue to
make cash deployment actions with our stockholders in mind, and we believe that our portfolio of shaping actions have
us well positioned for future value creation.
With that, we're ready for your questions. Karen?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question for today comes from the line of Rob Stallard from RBC Capital
Markets.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Thanks so much. Good morning.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Good morning, Rob.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Good morning.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: I think we can start with the F-35. Marillyn, you mentioned what your expectation was for
2016 deliveries of this aircraft. I was wondering what the cadence might be for the future years beyond that, given what
we've seen in the FY 2016 budget and the export market and when you might expect this program to move on to a fixed
price contract basis? Thank you.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Thanks for the question, Rob. Well, as we're looking at deliveries for 2016, 53 deliveries,
as I mentioned in my opening remarks, it will grow to roughly 59 or 60 in 2017 and then by 2018 will be up to roughly
100 aircraft. And then beyond that, if you – so if you look at over those three years, it's about 250 to 260 aircraft going
forward. And so, we really see that the program is getting much more stable as we continue to ramp up. The LRIP 11 is
going to be the last LRIP where we will be a fixed price incentive contract, and then we move into the production Lot 1
and on and that will likely be firm fixed price.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel from Jefferies.
<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: Thank you very much. Bruce, with all the moving parts, would it be possible for you to
provide a little bit of a walk between 2015 and 2016? I mean, for example, you have a couple of restructuring items last

– this past year. You have a benefit of an R&D tax credit that was offset. And now in the upcoming year, it won't be
offset. So, you kind of have flat earnings, but the reality is there's some things that should improve as you go forward.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah, thanks for the question, Howard. So, you hit that this is a very complicated quarter and
a very complicated outlook for 2016 because of all the moving parts you just described. We did have a restructuring
event at the end of the last year. You saw that this was in our MST business. It amounts to about $67 million. Think of
this as sort of right sizing that business post the integration of Sikorsky into MST.
I also mentioned in the chart that shows the adjustments to Sikorsky that we're seeing some carryover, what I would
call restructuring charges from the actions that were taken under Sikorsky in 2015 before our ownership that are
somewhat carrying over into 2016. Those don't quite offset each other, but it's pretty close. As you said, we had the
R&D tax credit that occurred at the end of 2015, which benefited us that wasn't in our outlook until it literally happened
in the month of December. The good news about that is that's now becoming permanent going forward. So because it is
permanent, we've also assumed that in our 2016 outlook. We had some deal closure cost that also hit 2015. Think of
that as about roughly $0.09 a share or so, I think about $45 million collectively for those sort of transaction costs.
And then 2016 is where it gets complicated. We've got, as I said, the purchase accounting adjustments for Sikorsky, the
integration cost for Sikorsky, so just a lot of moving pieces there. It's also important to note that as a result of the debt
deal that we did to acquire Sikorsky, interest expense is somewhere on the magnitude of about $230 million or
thereabouts higher than it was in 2015. So, I've hit I think most of the sort of the things that are changing there between
the years. Howard, there are probably a couple I left off, but I think those are the big drivers.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research.
<Q - Hunter K. Keay>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Good morning.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Good morning.
<Q - Hunter K. Keay>: Bruce, can you maybe sort of follow-up in some of these, sort of the math behind the
Sikorsky. Can you maybe help us get a sense for what the actual underlying revenue number is for Sikorsky in 2016,
and maybe think about helping us figure out sort of what MST margins would be on sort of a core apples-to-apples
basis in 2016? And then maybe beyond that, think about maybe a longer term trajectory for how you can think about
getting some efficiencies out of Sikorsky and maybe a little bit of a more stable sales environment on the oil and gas
side, longer term in that segment?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. So all good questions, Hunter. Let's see, where should I begin? So, Sikorsky, because
of the adjustments that we talked about for the customer inventory rights, I don't think a lot of people necessarily had in
their head that there's about a $400 million reduction for sales that occurred before our ownership, if you will, that are
carrying over into 2016. But that brings the sales down and profit down from what it otherwise could have been.
You should think of Sikorsky as being roughly the same size as the realigned IS&GS. They're kind of both in the $5
billion range, if you want to put it in that perspective.
I think you asked about sort of apples-to-apples margins from MST before considering Sikorsky. That's a little bit hard
to do because, as you recall, and we talked about this in the opening remarks, the realignment of IS&GS really affects
four of the five business areas. So if you put it just on the basis of what I'd call the heritage MST business before the
incorporation of the portion of IS&GS that's going into it starting this year, its margins are actually fairly comparable to
what they were in 2015, the IS&GS business. So think of this as the C4ISR business that was previously within
IS&GS. That business coming into MST is a little bit of a margin headwind, so it brings it down a little bit.

And then I think you talked about the prospects for Sikorsky going forward. I think maybe the easiest way to talk about
this, and I should say before I talk about the prospects going forward, we tried to capture all this. I know there's a lot
that I just said that I think we've provided some pretty good insight in our schedules in the press release that show the
realignment to capture all the pieces I just walked through if that's not clear by what I've just said. Sikorsky, I think the
biggest change that we're seeing from when we announced this deal is the changes in sort of the OEM helicopter sales
in the commercial marketplace, obviously driven by the oil and gas marketplace as we sit here today.
So I think I had said at the July call that OEM sales for commercial helos had peaked at about roughly $1.5 billion.
This doesn't include the aftermarket sales, which I'll portion off to the side here, but just the pure helos sales is about
$1.5 billion in 2014. And what I said at the time was we thought because of the oil and gas pressures, we thought 2016
would probably be half that number.
As it turns out, our current outlook is probably half of that number. So think of that as roughly $375 million or so of
commercial helos sales in the year 2016, which – and think of that also as being the highest margin products within the
IS&GS portfolio. So that's some of the pressure that we're seeing.
On the flipside, Hunter, what I'll tell you is we're already seeing the benefits of some of the combination, particularly
on the international military side. Marillyn talked about some of that in her opening remarks. And what I would
characterize is sort of the paramilitary side. So think of that as things like coast guard, search and rescue, and border
patrol fleets. And those are actually, we think, upside to the plan and upside to the business case as – at least as we
initially looked at that. But those prospects won't impact 2016 and won't frankly have much impact even in 2017 if we
are successful in closing on those.
And then the last thing I'd close with, Hunter, is the cash prospects going forward we do expect to be much improved in
terms of the current level of cash generated by Sikorsky going forward over the next few years, and you should think of
that primarily as the transition from development programs where we are seeing lower margins, and therefore, lower
cash and some different terms associated with that to pure production programs that should be sort of normal
cash-generating business just like they would be within Lockheed Martin. Hopefully that covers the waterfront for you
there, Hunter.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rich Safran from Buckingham Research.
<Q - Richard T. Safran>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Good morning.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Good morning, Rich.
<Q - Richard T. Safran>: Marillyn, Bruce, a two-part question on logistics programs. Some time ago you had talked
about assertions against the government for extra work done on the C-5 program. These are these over and above
issues. Wanted to know if this is the year when you expect that to start to flow through and is that factored into your
guide? And second, on the C-130J program, congrats on the multiyear and extending production to 2019. Could you
comment if you have the opportunity on that program to get to the same margins you currently have? I'm just getting –
I was just looking to get a sense of how you see margins trending on the program. Thanks.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. So, Rich, I'll take those two. So we had talked about the C-5 program in the past and
the fact that there were some what we thought were some over and above activities that we believe created some
entitlements for some adjustments. We still believe that to be the case, but we have not factored that in our guidance for
2016. I'd love to say it's going to happen this year, but I'm not sure I'm that good at predicting the future. But we do
think we still have entitlement there. So, hopefully, that helps with that question.
On the C-130 multiyear, thanks for the comment relative to getting that done. And it's good to have that program
stretched out to 2019 now. You asked about do we have the same margin opportunity. I've described this in other

forums where you should think of new multi-years as sort of starting off at a lower initial profit recording rate than
probably where we ended the current or older multiyear and contracts on the C-130 program. So we'll see some, I'll say,
optically lower margins from a GAAP perspective because we're starting that program lower.
But at the end of the day, and sort of from an economic value perspective, we would expect the current multiyear
program to have very similar economics, and especially similar cash flows even from day one as the previous programs
that we've completed. So while a little bit of near-term, I'll say, EPS and margin pressure relative to what we have done
on years past with prior C-130 deliveries, we think at the end of the day, the economics for those two programs are
comparable.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr from Cowen & Company.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Yes, thank you very much and congratulations on the Leidos transaction. You report IS&G as
part of your numbers that guides approximately $360 million of EBIT. They are saying it will be higher because they
won't have the pension, the corporate overhead, the home office costs. How much of those costs, which look like they
are about $100-plus million, are you able to basically cut now that – if and when you kind of get rid of IS&G in that
transaction?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. So, Cai, I'll take that one on. So you should think of the discussion and what was talked
about from the Leidos' point of view as this is more of an EBITDA comparison than the EBIT numbers, the segment
EBIT actually that we're showing for IS&GS. So your numbers are right as usual and about – think of it as about $360
million of segment EBIT from IS&GS this year.
I mean, the first adjustment that's made to that to get the EBITDA is obviously to take out the depreciation and
amortization. You should think of those being collectively about $80 million because we have some level of
depreciation from the capital assets there. But we also have the amortization from previous acquisitions within IS&GS.
And so that gets you to, what, about $440 million or so. But the total EBITDA for this business going into Leidos, you
should think of it as about – in the $500 million-ish range. And the delta to go from what I've just described, from the
original EBITDA, EBIT, segment EBIT, plus the depreciation and amortization, there's a lot of moving pieces to get to
the top, but the biggest single one is the elimination of the pension costs. We are repaying those assets and liabilities
and, therefore, that cost reduction is what the other benefit is to get to roughly the $0.5 billion of EBITDA for IS&GS
in the new structure.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: And, Cai, thank you for your comments. We're really excited about the transaction, so we
appreciate your congratulations.

<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Yes. Good morning.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Good morning.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Good morning.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Bruce, I wanted to – a couple of things here. With the $15 million share reduction at
closing, that looks like it effectively offsets the dilution from IS&GS. And so when you go into 2017 with the lower
shares, you get at least some profitability out of Sikorsky because this year it looks like maybe zero when you include
all the amortization. So why – and you're going to get some growth from the F-35 and you get some growth from the
budget, so why won't the GAAP EPS be higher rather than what you say, neutral to higher, in 2017 and beyond?

<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. George, I think we're – my fault, I probably confused people by the words I chose to
use there. I'm not trying to give you an outlook of what 2017 looks like compared to 2016. So that's not the way to view
the words neutral to higher. It's what would 2017 and beyond look like now after IS&GS versus had we retained
IS&GS.
And the words you said are exactly what I intended, which is, back to Cai's comment, we're losing, think of it as $360
million of profit that you would expect to have a negative earnings per share impact. Because of the split-off
arrangement and the expectation that we get $15 million shares back, plus the benefits potentially of the $1.8 billion in
cash, tax free, that we'll be able to have enough share count reduction to offset the effects of that $360 million or
actually maybe a little more than that and that's all we're intending it. It was not intended to say we expect 2017 EPS to
be neutral or higher. In fact, we expect 2017 to be higher than 2016 for all the reasons that you just said.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman from JPMorgan.
<Q - Seth M. Seifman>: Thanks very much and good morning. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about
ULA and just quickly talk about what's in there for 2016, but then also talk about your long-term plans. It would seem
that that's a market that's coming under some pressure as well as one where there is some competition and whether
there's going to be any investment required there from Lockheed Martin at any point and just your plans for that
market?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. So, a really good question, Seth. This is something – obviously, it's a 50/50 joint
venture with Boeing. So, this is probably a question that was better answered from the two partners as opposed to a
single partner.
We had some good things happen recently relative to the ability to procure the Russian RD-180 engines and think of
those as for the civil and commercial marketplace. That activity is very strong. We're seeing some benefits, actually
from the cargo, the CRS. I've lost track what the acronym stands for, the crew re-supply or cargo re-supply mission
where two of the three vehicles are currently slated to be launched by Atlas vehicle. So, that's helping us. We have to
kind of bridge, we think, to get to the ability to develop an American engine, if you will, to replace the RD-180.
Right now, it is not our expectation that that will require contributions from the parents, but that's something that we've
got to work out sort of between our partner and the U.S. government to ensure that. As you know and as you've read,
we have had some commercial development activity on the engine front, and we're watching that closely and see how
that plays out. But you should not think of this as requiring large contributions from a developmental perspective to
develop that engine going forward.
I think you also asked about the earnings in 2016, maybe compared to 2017. You should think of those maybe down a
little bit but actually fairly comparable year-over-year between what we had in 2015 and what we expect in 2016.

<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Hey, Bruce, I guess, clarification back to Sikorsky. The long-term target on the synergies was
$150 million when you originally announced the deal, but given some of the pressures on the energy side, some of the
restructuring they announced, is that still a good number and what's the time line we should be thinking about that?

Thanks, Bruce.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. So, Peter, good question. That is still very much the plan and the expectation, and that
is the work that the MS team is doing now. Last year was sort of spent in the integration mode, bringing Sikorsky
onboard and making sure everything can happen from the IT services to making payroll and the like. 2016 is very much
focused on creating synergies and capturing those synergies. I have said in either the July or October call, we probably
could have about $150 million sort of steady state run rate. That occurs probably in the 2018 timeframe.
Again, we're seeing a lot of the integration cost occurring in 2016 that's dampening that a bit. But the run rate is still
what we expect. And, as I've said I think on previous calls, we'd expect sort of the retained portion of that run rate to go
down a little bit over time as we give some portion of that back to our U.S. government on the contracts. But at the
same time we expect to start getting revenue synergies from the combination. Some of which I talked about earlier on
in terms of the international military market, that will maintain that $150 million synergy run rate going forward.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rob Spingarn from Credit Suisse.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hey, Rob.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Good morning.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: I want to just take a high level look at sales. And I think you said that ex-Sikorsky, you're
kind of flattish for the year and, I guess, there's a 1% headwind here from IS&GS. But perhaps you could talk at a high
level about what's happening in space and, I guess, core MST and, I guess, a little bit in MFC to drive sales down in a
year that the budget is inflecting understanding that there is some lag there, but why we don't see better growth in
2016? And then, one clarification, Bruce. On the 300 million share count, you don't just get there by the RMT, but
you're planning to continue to buy back stock with some consistency from what you did in 2015?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yes. I'll answer that first. So, we're really, really close. It sort of depends on what you assume
in terms of how the stock prices move and so forth. But you should think of the RMT benefits from a share count
exchange as just about getting us back to neutral. And we would expect again to use at least some portion of that $1.8
billion to make up the rest. And maybe there's some more on top of that, Rob.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Okay.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Relative to – I think you asked about the – maybe three of the business areas, MST, Missiles
and Fire Control and Space Systems for what's going on in 2016, maybe compared to 2015. I talked a little bit about
this in the October call and really nothing has changed other than we've – again, we've moved pieces around because of
the realignment of IS&GS. But at a very high level, you should think of the Missile and Fire Control being lower than
2015.
Again, we've realigned that business to remove the Tech Service business that was there. But sort of the core or
heritage Missile and Fire Control is lower, again, because we expect lower – what I would describe as in-theater
demand for programs like the GMLRS, the ATACMS missile, Javelin, and some of the Fire Control programs. And
you should think of that as – again, this is reflecting a reduction in OCO funding for some of that in-theater activity that
is very quick turn business to us. So, even though we're talking about the procurement accounts going up, we don't
expect that to offset in 2016 for Missiles and Fire Control.
MST, the current outlook really makes kind of for a hard comparison. So, it's got Sikorsky for the full year in 2016
versus less than two months in 2015. The heritage – I think I've talked about this earlier – the heritage MST business
has slight growth, 2016 over 2015, which reflects the continuing ramp up of some of the programs that were won in
2015, for that matter, 2014. And the realigned C4ISR business that I talked about earlier from IS&GS is expected to

have sales reductions from the 2015 level for that business that are probably comparable to what is currently shown for
the realigned IS&GS business in total. So, that's sort of what's bringing the combined, if you will, MST without
Sikorsky to the levels that we're seeing.
And then Space Systems, Space Systems is sort of a good news/bad news, a little bit lower funding for things like
Orion and the fleet ballistic missile programs. But the main reason is because of lower government satellite activity in
2016 and 2015. That's a good news story because that says each incremental satellite that we're selling to the U.S.
government is costing less than the previous one. We're doing about the same volume in terms of numbers of satellites,
but our programs to reduce cost are paying off and each one is subsequently cheaper and that's what we're seeing within
Space Systems.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Good morning, Myles.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: One clarification, if I could, Bruce, on the purchase accounting, just what the trend
line looks like into 2017 and 2018 of Sikorsky. But on the real question, cash flow, utilization in 2016. It sounds like
maybe some of this is implied to go to debt pay-down or reduction. Otherwise, it looks like you're building up your net
cash balance or you could do repurchase that is well in excess of the $1.8 billion. Obviously, that's the dividend you're
getting back. It sounds like, otherwise, it's a pretty wholesome debt pay down or a lot of optionality on further
repurchase. Where's your thinking on that?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. So, Myles, you should think – we had about – it's not quite, but a little less than $1
billion. I think it's $945-ish million of debt where the maturity is coming up this year in two different tranches. So, we
are going to pay that debt down. So, think about – it's about, again, roughly, a little bit less than $1 billion use of cash.
The trend on purchase accounting going forward, the customer lien rights that we talked about, those are essentially
through at the end of 2016. In fact, I think they end up in the third quarter of this year. So, even the fourth quarter is
clean from sort of the reduction associated with that and that's both on the sales and the profit. So, the only one that will
sort of carry over year-over-year is the intangible amortization. Again, as I said in my opening remarks, that's kind of
subject to a little bit of bouncing around between now and about a year after closure as those purchase accounting
adjustments net out. But we think right now it's about $230 million a year.

<Q - Ronald Jay Epstein>: Hey, good morning. Just a...
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Good morning, Ron.
<Q - Ronald Jay Epstein>: ...big picture question for Marillyn. When we think about Sikorsky, what do you think
Lockheed can do with Sikorsky that United Technologies couldn't? Like, what do you guys bring to that party that it
was being starved of or whatever? I mean, how do you really create a lot of value with this thing that wasn't being
created before?
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Well, thanks for the question, Ron. I mean, if you look at how Sikorsky aligns with our
portfolio, we've been doing business with Sikorsky for the past 40 years with the mission systems that we've put in
place into the platform. So, right off the bat with that opportunity, we think that we've got some opportunities and cycle
time reduction and some synergies that come with that.

And then in addition to that, that's our customer base where we sell Sikorsky as the same customer base where we're
selling the balance of our portfolio. It broadens our opportunity both in the domestic and international marketplace. It
just gives us a broader opportunity to sell into those marketplaces. So, I see that as an opportunity.
And then we have excellent expertise in doing business with the Department of Defense and with other governments
around the world. And the work that we do in our international business development, what we do with our government
affairs here in the U.S., we believe we can make that piece of business better by bringing it in to Lockheed Martin. It's
an area that we bring expertise and capability and, again, allows us to do that.
Our customer relationships, our understanding of doing business with the U.S. government, our understanding of doing
business around the world is what we bring to that. We also, I think, understand government contracting to a great
extent, and we bring the expertise of our folks to that arena. So a lot areas of synergy and a lot of that is represented in
some of the things that Bruce was talking about in terms of both cost and revenue synergies, the run rate synergies that
we have in that sense.
And then, Bruce, if you want to add anything along that line?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. Ron, I think, the other thing that we bring is maybe a little different focus on especially
the, I'll say, the negotiation of government contracts, at least as we looked at that. Some of the terms and conditions, I
think we'll do some different ones going forward, especially as they relate to cash. And so, I would like to think that,
going forward, we'll be a stronger cash generator under our ownership than what it was previously.
And in doing that, I don't think there's any sort of like difficult to do things. It's just sort of getting them, in this case,
being Sikorsky in parallel to what we do with all the other business within Lockheed Martin. So, we know the game
plan, we know the playbook, we just have to sort of execute it with Sikorsky.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: The only other thing I would add is, as I said, in the past, I mean, we align well with them
in terms of the focus on innovation and technology. We're always looking beyond the day and the rotary wing area is
one that is in great demand and the one that we want to continue to invest in the research and development to bring
better and new innovation to those platforms.

<Q - Samuel J. Pearlstein>: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what's happening in the international
markets right now. Have you seen any sort of slowdown from the Mid-East and kind of key awards to watch this year?
And then, Bruce, do you expect to have a relatively flat backlog or should we start to see you eat into that a little bit
this year?
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Well, let me just pick up on the international interest. We continue to have growing
international interest for our programs, particularly in the area of missile defense in the Middle East, in Asia Pacific and
even in Europe where Germany has selected MEADS as their missile defense capability and Aegis Ashore. So, that is
an expanding demand. We continue to see that. With some of the current conflict in the Middle East, we're seeing some
of our ammunitions and things of that nature that there is a continued desire for our targeting pods and other things that
they need in the current conflict.

F-35, on the international front, it will continue to ramp up. There's a strong interest of growth in those sales. In fact, in
the next five years, about 50% of the orders will come from the international marketplace. And then, I know that there's
a lot of interest in terms of oil prices. We're not seeing a lot of pullback on expenditures on national security. Certainly
oil prices affect our sale of commercial rotary wing. But in the balance of our business, while it does put some pressure
on budgets in the countries that are buying national security assets and things that they need to protect their citizens, the
choices that they're making are cutting another area so that they can protect their citizens. And so, we're not seeing a
big damper on that. It may mean some things that will slip out a little bit or they might reduce the volume on the near
term, but they're still going to buy the products and capabilities and technologies they need to enable them to protect
their citizens and to deal with their security issues.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. So, Sam, on the question relative to backlog and would it be flat, the short answer is
no. We would expect to see a reduction by the end of this year, and you should really think of that as coming primarily
from two business areas. MST will have – and when I say down, we're talking probably somewhere less than $5 billion
down, maybe $4 billion and probably half or some of that is MST, the bulk of which of that is for Sikorsky. As you
might expect, we're having sales that are coming out of backlog from prior years, orders that are not being replaced
because of the, particularly the commercial business I talked about earlier with new orders.
Second one is space, also down pretty – about half that number as well and that's just the timing of orders. We had
some very good orders in the past few years that are playing out to sales. And we don't have quite the size, including
the Orion order a few years back, and we're not seeing those orders replicated, that they are translating into sales as we
speak here.
The big orders we're watching this year, frankly, not a lot of large competitive orders that we're chasing this year. The
biggest orders we're looking for are the sort of the follow-on F-35 orders, in particular Lot 10 and the finalization of
Lot 9 and a lot of the ancillary contracts that go with both of those LRIPs. So that's a big chunk of it.
The biggest single international order we're watching probably is a THAAD order with Qatar. And we have other air
missile defense programs kind of scattered throughout the region, but not nearly of the same size as we're seeing in
Qatar. But that's the driver of the biggest international orders prospects as we see 2016.

Operator
Thank you. And our final question for today comes from the line of Joe DeNardi from Stifel.
<Q - Joseph DeNardi>: Hey. Thanks for squeezing me in. Bruce, just on Aeronautics margins going forward, can you
just talk about, given the booking rate increases you've had on F-35, how dilutive to segment margins is that program?
And when is the inflection point for margins within that segment? And then just directionally, how should we think
about FAS/CAS in 2017 at this point?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. So, Joe, let me try to capture those in my thoughts on that. Aeronautics margin, as I
said on the October call, there's really two reasons for that that are driving them below 2015, the first one being, as I
call the dilutive effect of the F-35 program. Even though the margins on F-35 are increasing year-over-year, they are
still lower than the overall composite rate for Aeronautics and that's bringing the rate down slightly.
The other reason primarily was the C-130 impact that I think Rich was talking about relative to the sort of the
conversion of older C-130 contracts and now booking sales under a new multiyear. Again, economically, I don't see a
lot of difference between the two, but from a sort of a GAAP reporting perspective, we'll expect to have sort of a lower
starting margin on the new multiyear than the ending margin on the previously-negotiated C-130 contracts. And those
two are what are kind of bringing down the margins of Aeronautics in 2016 compared to 2015.
I do think – I think you asked about what's the prospects going forward. I think 2016 is sort of the bottom point. If that
makes sense relative to the margins of Aeronautics, then we would expect to see slow improvements, going forward,

every year primarily as we see the sort of getting to a – I'll say, an ordinary production program on the F-35 program
starts to take effect as well as the inevitable increases on C-130 because we're starting off at a lower booking rate than
we are right now.
I think you asked about 2017 FAS/CAS. I would expect it to be – and look, I always hesitate to talk about next year.
There are so many moving pieces in FAS/CAS but, if we were – sort of current course and speed is always the way I
like to describe that were about $975 million today. It's probably in the $450 million higher next year if we were to
strike a line today. But obviously, a lot of things can change between now and the end of the year.

So, let me just wrap up the call for today and summarize the year and how we're looking at the business going forward.
I want to end by reiterating that the corporation completed an extraordinary 2015 strategically and financially. And the
performance of our team continues at a very high level, even amid our bold strategic actions that we took to position
the business for future growth.
As we're looking in to 2016, our record backlog, coupled with increasing DoD budget, has the corporation positioned
for a bright future of top line growth and increasing cash flows. Through the focus, dedication and integrity, we
continue to deliver on our commitments to customers and stockholders. So, again, thank you for joining us on the call
today. We look forward to speaking with you in our next earnings call in April.
Karen, that concludes our call today.
Operator
