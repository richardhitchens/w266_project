Because we use non-GAAP measures, we have provided a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly
comparable GAAP measure, which is included in our appendix.
With that, let me turn the call over to Denise.
Denise M. Morrison
Thank you, Ken. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter fiscal 2017 earnings call. I look forward to
reviewing and discussing our results with you this morning. I'll start with a high-level overview and then provide my
perspective on each division's performance. Anthony will follow with a detailed financial review.
But first, let me start with some context about the external environment. In the United States, the length and tenor of the
presidential campaign was unprecedented. There are many important issues the new administration will address that
will impact the food industry, including tax policy, regulation, trade agreements, new leadership of the USDA and
FDA, as well as the upcoming farm bill.
Meanwhile, the seismic shifts that I've outlined in our previous discussions continue to impact our industry, including a
shrinking middle class, major demographic shifts, changing consumer preferences for food with an emphasis on health
and well-being and the continued evolution of digital media and e-commerce channels.
Across the industry, top line growth remained sluggish, particularly in center-store categories. Simultaneously, food
deflation is pressuring both top and bottom lines and limiting pricing opportunities. This is driving a hyper-competitive
environment for market share along with a continued focus on cost savings measures to deliver earnings. As we've
seen, many food companies have reported flat to declining organic sales in their most recent quarters and that pressure
is not limited to manufacturers. Retailers, too, are taking actions to reposition themselves for growth through
consolidation, management changes and increased investments in e-commerce.
With that as context, let me turn to our first quarter results. Relative to our expectations, I'm encouraged by our overall
performance. We're executing against the plans we described in September. We expanded gross margin and delivered
adjusted EBIT and EPS growth, cycling a strong year-ago quarter.
Organic sales decreased 1% in the quarter, driven by declines in our Campbell Fresh business, which we expected and
which we communicated in early September. Additionally, we remain on track to achieve our $300 million cost savings
goal by the end of fiscal 2018. Importantly, we're reinvesting across the business to drive top line growth, including
increased advertising support of Chunky Soup and Pepperidge Farm Goldfish crackers, expanding our digital and
e-commerce capabilities, and funding long-term innovation initiatives. Given our start and our expectations for the
remainder of the year, we reaffirmed our full-year guidance this morning.
Let me now offer my perspective on the performance of each of our three divisions. Let's start with Americas Simple
Meals and Beverages, our largest division. As a reminder, this division's portfolio role is to deliver moderate growth
consistent with the categories in which we operate and to expand margins. Our sales were mixed this quarter. However,
the division delivered strong operating earnings, and I continue to be pleased with the gross margin expansion driven
by the improved performance of our supply chain.
I'm optimistic about the start to the soup season. U.S. soup sales were comparable to a year ago, which reflects an
improvement in trend. Sales of RTS soup and broth increased, while condensed sales declined slightly. Campbell's
consumption outpaced the category, largely driven by the performance of the RTS portfolio.
Chunky led the way, as we dramatically improved our execution. We have corrected the labeling misstep from last
year, began airing a new integrated NFL themed campaign, and introduced new stackable cans that are driving
increased merchandising opportunities at major customers. It's also important to note that we're cycling net price
realization gains that have held in the marketplace. All of this is resulting in improved performance.
Looking ahead on soup, we continue to expect to deliver modest growth for the full year behind improved performance
in Chunky, strong holiday plans for both condensed soups and broth, and the upcoming launch of our Well Yes RTS

soup line. This new clean-label soup is made with nutritious, recognizable, and desirable ingredients, and will begin
shipping in December. The response from retailers has been overwhelmingly positive, and we have a robust integrated
marketing plan to fuel the launch.
In other parts of the portfolio, we drove double-digit sales gains in Plum, with growth in the core Pouch portfolio as
well as the introduction of Plum organic infant formula. However, our shelf-stable beverage portfolio remains
challenged, specifically V8 V-Fusion and V8 Splash. On the positive side, V8 + Energy continues to perform well, and
we're seeing improving trends in V8 Red following our decision to increase advertising support. As we previously
stated, we do not expect V8 to grow in fiscal 2017.
While we have more work ahead, I'm encouraged by the start to the year, especially in U.S. soup, and I'm confident in
our plans. In short, the Americas Simple Meals and Beverage division continues to deliver against its portfolio role.
Now let's turn to Global Biscuits and Snacks. As a reminder, this division includes our Pepperidge Farm, Arnott's, and
Kelsen businesses. And its portfolio role is to expand and develop in developing markets while improving margins.
Sales growth in the quarter was driven by gains in Pepperidge Farm on strong performance of Goldfish crackers and
Milano cookies. Operating earnings decreased 2%, as we invested in increased advertising. In the U.S., the team
delivered sales and share gains in both Goldfish crackers and Milano cookies. Goldfish benefited from increased
advertising investment, channel gains leveraging multiple pack sizes, and innovative new products.
Our efforts to expand our health and well-being offerings are performing well. Both multigrain Goldfish and Goldfish
made with organic wheat contributed to the sales gains.
At Investor Day, we shared our plans to focus on building brand equity and increasing our marketing investments in
our cookie portfolio, and we're beginning to see results. Effective new advertising and flavor innovation drove sales
and consumption gains for Milano cookies.
Sales in Fresh Bakery declined in the quarter in the face of intensified competitive activity, and we have taken steps to
address this with improved innovation and quality on our Pepperidge Farm Swirl bread.
Looking ahead in the U.S., we're focused on driving growth in Goldfish, increase innovation in cookies, including the
relaunch of our Pepperidge Farm American classic cookie line and the new Fresh Bakery quality improvements to take
hold in the market. Additionally, expanding both Tim Tam distribution and our West Coast bakery operations remain
top priorities.
Turning to other parts of the world, in Southeast Asia, we maintained our momentum in Malaysia behind strong sales
of sauces, but sales in Indonesia were negatively impacted by aggressive competitive activities in the general trade. In
Australia, we delivered sales growth in biscuits driven by strong performance in our Chocolate Biscuit portfolio despite
declines in Shapes crackers. We have taken action to address Shape's performance and we are beginning to see signs of
improvement.
Looking ahead, we're focused on delivering consumer-driven product innovation in Tim Tam chocolate biscuits with a
new range of seasonal varieties. We also expect our Shapes performance to accelerate behind our new marketing
campaign, highlighting both new and original recipes.
Finally, I'll discuss our Campbell Fresh division. The CPG portion of C-Fresh includes Bolthouse Farms beverages and
salad dressings, garden fresh gourmet salsa, hummus, and chips, and our refrigerated soups. The Farms portion of the
portfolio includes carrot and natural ingredients.
As a reminder, C-Fresh is a strategically important business to Campbell. It addresses the key consumer trend towards
fresh foods and health and well-being, and its brands resonate with millennial consumers. The business performed as
expected to the start of the year, as we're continuing to execute the recovery plans related to the voluntary product
recall of Bolthouse Farms Protein PLUS drinks and the carrot quality and execution issues we experienced in fiscal
2016.

As we discussed on our fourth quarter call, we installed a new leadership team and have increased the integration and
oversight of the Campbell Fresh supply chain. There have been other changes since then. As previously announced,
Jeff Dunn left the company in October and we named Ed Carolan President of Campbell Fresh. Ed has been with
Campbell since 2001 in a variety of leadership roles including the President of U.S. Retail Soup, Sauce and Beverages.
Most recently, he was President of Integrated Global Services where he created and implemented a business model to
build new capabilities and deliver faster, more efficient services. Ed and the Campbell Fresh leadership team are
focused on returning the business to growth starting in the second half of the year.
Now let's take a closer look at what drove the declines in the first quarter and our continued recovery from the Protein
PLUS beverage recall and the carrot equality and execution issues. First, beverages. As we discussed in the fourth
quarter, we identified and corrected the primary cause of last year's Protein PLUS recall and implemented enhanced
processes to improve quality standards. While we're making progress, we still continue to expect the Protein PLUS
supply will be negatively impacted through the end of the calendar year 2016. Our objective is to meet demand through
a combination of improved run rates, increased in-house capacity and adding co-packers. Following the recall, we have
been steadily increasing production capacity while also working hard to improve our customer service levels. We've
made solid progress in the first quarter in improving our run times. To increase capacity, we're in the process of
installing a new beverage line in our Bakersfield plant, which we expect will be commissioned by the end of the
calendar year.
Performance was mixed in other parts of the Campbell Fresh CPG portfolio. In the ultra-premium category, sales
growth of 1915 by Bolthouse Farms cold-pressed juice was driven by increased distribution and share gains. Sales of
Bolthouse Farms salad dressing also continue to grow.
Turning to Garden Fresh Gourmet, sales of hummus and salsa declined in the quarter. The team is focused on further
product differentiation through regional flavors as we continue to execute our plans to expand Garden Fresh Gourmet
beyond the Midwest.
Another bright spot was the performance of retail fresh soup. Sales increased in the quarter with the introduction of
new branded Garden Fresh Gourmet soup, which has been well received by customers.
Now, turning to the Farms business. We are stabilizing our carrot operations and improve quality. The team remains
focused on service levels and working to regain lost customers over time. We expect the recovery to continue
throughout the year as we demonstrate to customers our ability to deliver sustained quality. While we're making
progress, we clearly have more work ahead to get this division back to performing in line with its portfolio role of
full-force growth. For the full year, we continue to expect Campbell Fresh sales to grow in the low single-digits.
Before closing, I want to touch upon our efforts to create new models of innovation to define the future of real food and
drive growth in new ways for Campbell. As I discussed with you in the past, new models continue to emerge and new
startup companies are being fueled by an influx of venture capital. Campbell is now more fully participating in venture
opportunities through Acre Venture Partners, an independently managed $125 million venture fund where Campbell is
the sole limited partner. Acre is investing in a number of promising and innovative food and food-related companies.
At the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we funded $41 million out of our $125 million commitment.
Another example of how we're investing our cost savings into long-term innovation is the new startup company called
Habit, a business backed by Campbell and led by Neil Grimmer, the co-founder of Plum. Positioned at the intersection
of health and well-being, technology, and food, Habit will leverage individualized data to create personalized nutrition
and meal plans for people who want to harness the transformative power of food to improve their lives. Stay tuned, we
will be sharing additional details about Habit at CAGNY in February.
Finally, we continue to build a robust pipeline of internal innovation focused on the large and growing consumer
platforms of health and well-being and snacking. And we're also continuing to pursue smart external development to
diversify our portfolio in faster growing spaces.
Given our expectations and plans for the year, we're satisfied with our performance to start the year and confident in
our plans for fiscal 2017. We continue to take action to strengthen our core business while also driving growth for the

high-performance organization focused on talent and culture and transforming the way we work.
In summary, these unpredictable and uncertain times in which we live are marked by sweeping changes across the food
industry landscape. At Campbell, we're guided by our purpose, real food that matters for life's moments and focused on
meeting the needs of our consumers, helping our customers grow their business and increasing shareholder value for
our investors.
Now let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Anthony DiSilvestro, for an overview of our financial
results.
Anthony P. DiSilvestro
Thanks, Denise, and good morning.
Before reviewing our results, I wanted to give you my perspective on the quarter and outlook for the balance of the
year. As Denise stated, organic sales, while down, were in line with our expectations. We anticipated our first quarter
sales to be under some pressure as we begin to recover from the capacity constraints on Bolthouse Farms beverages and
stabilize the carrot business. Overall, U.S. soup sales were flat and we were pleased with the performance of Chunky,
which is responding well to our marketing programs.
Our adjusted gross margin expanded 120 basis points as our supply chain performed well and delivered significant
productivity improvements while cost inflation remained moderate. We continue to make strong progress against our
cost savings target of $300 million by the end of fiscal 2018, delivering about $35 million of incremental savings in the
first quarter, bringing the program to-date total to $250 million. We adopted a new accounting standard that impacts the
recognition of excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation. The tax rate for the quarter reflected a $6 million tax
benefit related to the change. We are pleased with our first quarter start and are reaffirming our fiscal 2017 guidance
that we announced in September. Now, I'll review our results in more detail.
On an as-reported basis, net sales of $2,202 million were comparable to the prior year. Excluding the favorable impacts
of currency translation, organic net sales declined 1%, driven by declines in Campbell Fresh, partly offset by gains in
Global Biscuits and Snacks. Adjusted EBIT increased 1% to $486 million as the benefits of a higher adjusted gross
margin percentage and lower administrative expenses were partly offset by increased marketing and selling expenses.
Adjusted EPS increased 5% or $0.05 to $1 per share.
Breaking down our sales performance for the quarter, organic sales declined 1%, driven by a 1-point decline from
volume and mix. Net price realization, both pricing and promotion, was stable for the quarter compared to last year.
Offsetting the organic sales decline was a 1-point favorable impact from currency translation, principally the Australian
dollar, resulting in net sales being comparable to the prior year.
Our adjusted gross margin increased 120 basis points in the quarter. First, cost inflation and other factors had a negative
impact of 70 basis points. Cost inflation, on a rate basis, increased by about 1.5%. In addition, cost of products sold
reflects higher cost and our C-Fresh division. These negative drivers were partly offset by the benefits from our cost
savings initiatives.
Reflecting the increased promotional spending in Pepperidge Farm to support Goldfish and Fresh Bakery and in
Indonesia to remain competitive, promotional spending had a 20 basis point negative impact, which was offset by list
pricing gains of 20 basis points, primarily from our retail business in Canada. Mix was slightly favorable, adding 20
basis points, reflecting the sales decline in our lower-margin C-Fresh segment.
Lastly, our supply chain productivity programs, which are incremental to our $300 million cost savings program,
contributed 170 basis points of margin improvement in the quarter. All in, our gross margin percentage increased 120
basis points to 39.1%.

Adjusted marketing and selling expenses increased 11% in the quarter, primarily due to higher advertising expenses as
we reinvest in our key brands as well as higher selling expenses due largely to timing. The increase in advertising was
primarily driven by increased support on Chunky Soup behind the new advertising campaign and on Pepperidge Farm
Goldfish crackers.
Adjusted administrative expenses declined 4%, reflecting the benefit of our cost savings initiatives, partly offset by
inflation and investments we are making in longer-term innovation.
For additional perspective on our performance, this chart breaks down our EPS change between our operating
performance and below-the-line items. Adjusted EPS increased $0.05 from $0.95 in the prior year to $1.00 per share in
the current quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, increases in adjusted EBIT had a $0.01 benefit on EPS. Share
repurchases lowered our share count, also adding $0.01 benefit.
Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter decreased by 2 points to 32.1%. The decrease in the tax rate contributed $0.03 to
EPS growth, including the benefit from the change in accounting for stock-based compensation.
Interest was comparable to the prior year, as the impact of higher interest rates was offset by a lower debt level. While
slightly favorable, the currency translation benefit rounds to no impact, completing the bridge to $1.00 per share.
Now turning to our segment results, in Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, organic sales were comparable to the
prior year at $1.297 billion, as double-digit gains in Plum products were offset by declines in V8 beverages. Sales of
U.S. soups were comparable to the prior year, as gains in ready-to-serve soups, primarily Chunky, benefiting from
increased marketing support, and in broth were offset by modest declines in condensed soups. Delivering against its
portfolio role, operating earnings increased 6%, reflecting a higher gross margin percentage, driven primarily by
productivity improvements, partly offset by increased marketing and selling expense.
Here's a look at U.S. wet soup category performance and our share results as measured by IRI. For the 52-week period
ending October 30, 2016, the category as a whole declined by 2.3%. Our sales in measured channels declined 2.7%,
primarily driven by weakness in ready-to-serve, partly offset by strength in broth. Campbell had a 59% market share
for the 52-week period, declining 20 basis points. Private label grew share by 30 basis points, finishing at 13%. All
other branded players collectively had a share of 28%, down 10 basis points.
In Global Biscuits and Snacks, organic sales increased 1%, driven by gains in Pepperidge Farm on strong growth in
Goldfish crackers, which benefited from increased advertising and promotional activity as well as new items. Operating
earnings declined 2% to $112 million, driven primarily by higher advertising expenses, partly offset by the favorable
impact of currency translation. The segment gross margin percentage was comparable to last year, as the impact of cost
inflation and increased promotional spending was partly offset by productivity improvements.
In the Campbell Fresh segment, as expected, organic sales declined 6%, reflecting declines in Bolthouse Farms
beverages due to capacity constraints following the recall of Protein PLUS drinks in June 2016, as well as declines in
carrots and softness in Garden Fresh Gourmet, partly offset by gains in refrigerated soups. Lower carrot sales reflect the
market share impact of quality and execution issues from last fiscal year.
Operating earnings declined by $17 million to $1 million, reflecting higher carrot costs, which were associated with
lower volumes and improved quality, the cost impact of lower beverage operating efficiencies, and the impact of lower
sales. As we've previously stated, we expect a return to growth in C-Fresh starting in the second half of the fiscal year.
Cash flow from operations was $221 million, $23 million lower than the prior year. The decline reflects lower cash
earnings and higher working capital requirements. Capital expenditures declined $23 million to $48 million. We
continue to forecast CapEx of approximately $350 million for fiscal 2017.
We paid dividends totaling $100 million, reflecting a quarterly dividend rate of $0.312 per share. In September, we
announced an increase in the quarterly dividend rate to $0.35 per share, which from a cash flow perspective, will be
reflected in the second quarter.

In aggregate, we repurchased $112 million of share, $100 million of which were under our strategic share repurchase
program, as we've increased our level of share repurchases. The balance of the repurchases were made to offset dilution
from equity-based compensation.
Net debt declined by $522 million compared to year-ago levels, as cash from operations over the last four quarters was
well in excess of capital expenditures, dividends, and share repurchases.
Now I'll review our 2017 guidance, which remains unchanged from what we announced in September. The company
expects sales to grow by zero to 1%, adjusted EBIT to grow by 1% to 4%, and adjusted EPS to grow by 2% to 5% or
$3.00 to $3.09 per share. This guidance assumes, based on current exchange rates, that the impact from currency
translation will be nominal. We expect gross margin to improve slightly for the year. While inflation on core
ingredients and packaging has moderated, we expect inflation in cost of products sold of approximately 2%.
On our cost savings program, we are ahead of our expectations, having generated $35 million in the first quarter against
our full-year estimate of $50 million. It's early in the year, so before making any changes to the savings estimate or
full-year guidance, we would like to see how our cost savings develop in the second quarter, assess the performance of
the business, especially C-Fresh, and evaluate potential reinvestment opportunities. Our EPS guidance reflects an
effective tax rate of approximately 32%, which includes the change in accounting and from the favorable impacts of
anticipated share repurchases over the course of the year.
That concludes my remarks, and now I'll turn it back to Ken for Q&A.
Kenneth Gosnell
Thanks, Anthony. We will now start our Q&A session. Since we have limited time, out of fairness to the other callers,
please ask only one question at a time. Okay. Operator?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Your line is open.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Good morning, everybody.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Andrew.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Good morning, Andrew.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Hi. Quick question on gross margin, which I think did come in quite a bit better than at least we
had forecast in the quarter. Still looking for moderate gross margin expansion for the full year. Given the rate of
expansion use in 1Q, Anthony, I guess what at this stage would cause that rate of expansion in the next couple of
quarters to moderate a bit on a year-to-year basis? And did the P&L impact of the incremental cost saves split out
among cost of products and SG&A roughly evenly, as I think you may have mentioned it previously? Thank you.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: So, Andrew, I could take a couple of points. Of the $35 million, the majority of those
cost savings in Q1 were within the supply chain, therefore, they're on the cost of products sold line and the balance I
would say is primarily within administrative expenses. We are certainly pleased with the gross margin performance in
the quarter. We're a little bit ahead of our expectations. And there's a couple of things we see unfolding in the balance
of the year.
We are benefiting on our core ingredients and packaging items, a little bit of deflation in the first quarter and we see
that swinging to more neutral to slightly positive in the back half. And the categories to think about are – there's
primarily three big ones. One is steel cans. The other is dairy products. We're currently wrapping the impact of avian

flu and wheat prices, which are currently in deflation and we expect that also to be more neutral. So, we see a little bit
of a swing front half to back half.
The other thing we anticipate as we unfold some of our real food investments. We are removing artificial colors and
ingredients. We are removing BPA from our can liners and those costs are going to accelerate as we go through the
second half of the year relative to the first – relative to the first half. So, we see a couple of headwinds ahead. Again,
we feel good about our first quarter. We'll see how the second quarter unfolds and make an assessment then.

<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Sure.
Operator
Our next question comes from Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Hi. Thanks, everyone. Hi. Happy Thanksgiving. Denise, I guess I wanted to come back
to Global Biscuits and ask a little bit more specifically about the performance of Pepperidge in the U.S., which based
on scanner data, seems to be carrying some pretty significant momentum at the moment. Could you just elaborate a
little bit on how that business performed in the quarter relative to the overall segment growth? And just tactically,
what's going on that's enabling you to gain so much market share at the moment? How sustainable that is? And just the
way you're phasing investments against those products at the moment?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: We definitely invested in Pepperidge Farm this quarter, particularly in Goldfish and
Milano cookies and both of them have had really nice consumption gains relative to the categories. And we're going to
continue to invest in Pepperidge Farm. One of the places where we have momentum brewing is in the American classic
cookie. We're going to be relaunching a new product there. So we believe that on top the Milano momentum, we can
fuel it with American classic.
And the one place where we are experiencing declines is in Fresh Bakery as the competitive environment has heated
up, but we will be – we've introduced a new improved Swirl Bread, and we'll be investing against that. So, only other
two things are the expansion of Tim Tam in the United States, which we're really excited about and that campaign
starts in January. We're building distribution as we speak. And then moving – after the successful expansion of our
Bakery business in the Arizona market, we're expanding into a couple other west markets. So, there's lots of activity on
Pepperidge Farm.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay. And just from a phasing perspective, as some of the A&C investment shifts into
Well Yes and maybe a bit over toward Simple Meals in Q2. Should we see the balance shift a bit between these
segments? Is this more of a kind of a concentrated spike in some of the reinvestment going against Pepperidge
business?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Yeah. I would say that we're being very consistent with our plans and we definitely
prioritize our investments. I think where you'll see a shift is more off of smaller niche brands and back more onto the
core brands, of which we include – we're including the launch of Well Yes as a key RTS initiative as well as the
investment in Pepperidge Farm.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay, great. Thanks, Denise.

<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Hey. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Hi, Bryan.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Just a question about the U.S. soups business and just wanted – in the quarter, sales were
comparable. And I think in the Nielsen data at least it looks like in the 12-week period, sales were down. So, is there
anything, any mismatch in terms of timing of shipments versus consumption? And then, I guess related to that, as we're
thinking about 2Q, will Well Yes ship in 2Q? Or does it ship in 3Q?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Okay, I'll take the first part. I guess the best way to explain it is we started our marketing
this year in October, so on U.S. soups, we definitely saw a tick-up in consumption and in sales at the latter part of the
quarter and expect that momentum to continue. Inventory this quarter was very comparable to year ago and although
retailers are still tight on inventory, it wasn't a meaningful or material shift.
So, I think the main issues with U.S. soup are we saw Chunky rebound, particularly towards the latter part of the
quarter, against the marketing effort. We've been able to hold our price realization on Chunky. And again, we're cycling
some poor execution issues in the prior year. So, we're very happy to see the response of Chunky.
Broth has been under a little bit of pressure, but we have big holiday plans. And so, we're very confident on our holiday
plans on broth. So, I think it's shaping up to be a season very much as we expected. Well Yes starts shipping in
December. And so, we have a – the customer acceptance has been great and so, we have a huge Campbell launch on
this one. So, very excited about that.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Okay, so it sounds like there isn't a meaningful – assuming that you get consumer
pull-through in 2Q, there's no meaningful sort of discrepancy between takeaway and shipments as we're modeling
forward?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: That is correct.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Okay. Great. All right. Happy Thanksgiving, everyone.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Same to you, Bryan.

<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hello, Ken.
<Q - Kenneth B. Goldman>: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Hey. How are you, Denise? How are you, everyone?
Anthony, I just wanted to follow up on the guidance for cost savings for the year. Correct me if I'm wrong, I think the
guidance is $50 million and you did $35 million in the first quarter. I know it's early, I know you want to see how the
year progresses but I'm curious what would hold the savings back from surpassing that $50 million? You mentioned
reinvestments. I thought the $50 million was a gross number prior to investments. But again, just trying to get a little bit
of color there and see maybe where some headwinds are that I'm not maybe visualizing right now.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: No, I think you've got it right. I mean, again, the $50 million was a growth target,
perhaps we were a little conservative as we did achieve $35 million of that in the first quarter. So, we do want to see
another quarter unfold, making sure it's not just timing. But we feel really good about where we are. And if all goes
well, we could have a little more savings available to us.
The other thing we want some time is to see how the other businesses progress. We've got a big turnaround in C-Fresh
that we're forecasting. And also, we have identified some additional reinvestment opportunities. So, before making any
decisions about, hey, we've got more cost savings, it's going to drop to the bottom line, we do really want to evaluate

Our next question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel. Your line is open.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Chris.
<Q - Christopher Growe>: Hi. Good morning. And my Happy Thanksgiving to you and your families as well. Just a
question for you in relation to C-Fresh. So, with the soft first half that we've expected and you showed – started out
here in the first quarter and that business seems to grow, call it 5% across the remainder of the year. So, I just wanted to
understand your expectations for that business. And is it about getting back on-shelf for Protein PLUS as well as
gaining carrot customers back? So, is there one of those that's more the main driver here that could lead you to low
single-digit growth for that division for the year?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Yes, you have it correct, we expect to be down in the first half and return to growth in the
second half. Our shelf is building now for Protein PLUS and our service levels have gotten quite better, although we
still have more to do.
I think the main other driver is the fact that because we've been on allocation and we're basically supplying the shelf
stock, we have not been merchandising. And in some cases, retailers are not merchandising the whole line. So, we think
that has affected both our performance and also the category performance. But when we get to the second half, we
should be in a position where we're not only supplying the shelf stock but we are also able to supply merchandising
stock. We're literally selling everything we make.
<Q - Christopher Growe>: Okay. And just to understand the opportunity around regaining carrot customers. Are
those expected to come back in the second half of the year? Is it that quick? Or is this something that happens over
time?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Yes, that absolutely happens over time. The good news is that our quality is improving
and we believe that as customers see us sustain that quality, we will gain that business back but we're going to have to
earn it.
<Q - Christopher Growe>: Okay, thank you for the time.

Our next question comes from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Hi, thank you.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Rob.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Hi. Denise, in your opening remarks, you mentioned the competitive environment getting
tougher, the retailers becoming more aggressive in promoting to be competitive with each other. Have you seen
anything dramatically different over the past three months compared to maybe three months ago, or are you specifically
talking about one category, fresh bread? Because I would argue in your Soup business, it didn't seem like you needed to
be particularly promotional, and I would argue that a lot of your competitors in shelf-stable food have been trying to
reduce the promotional intensity. Has something changed in that regard?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: I think that your observation in some of our categories is correct. We're finding that our
categories are pretty stable when it comes to food deflation. But we are seeing some refrigerated food and beverage
categories experiencing food deflation, about 3.4% in the last 13 weeks, driven predominantly by dairy and refrigerated
meats. And although our categories are relatively stable, you're still dealing with a center store that's growing about

zero to 1%, and therefore, growth is hard-won and it becomes a market share gain. So those are just observations I'm
sharing. That doesn't necessarily mean it's driving crazy behavior, but it is definitely a dynamic that we're dealing with.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Just to add to Denise's comments, I would say in Italian sauce, we're seeing an
increased level of competitive activity. And also within soup, on broth we're seeing an increased activity on private
label, specifically around price competition there.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Okay. Does that sound transitory to you, Anthony, or do you think that's going to be
throughout the year? I guess you don't know because it's competition.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: I think our seasonal plans on broth are just hitting the market now or has hit the
market. So we do expect to obviously be more competitive on broth as well as on Prego, given the competitive
situation.

Our next question comes from Alexia Howard with Bernstein Research. Your line is open.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi there.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: Maybe I'll stick with the cost-cutting question. After this $300 million is done, you've
obviously got the underlying productivity improvements this quarter of 170 basis points. But does that mean that once
the $300 million is done, that's really the end of the heavy or the big opportunity on cost-cutting? I'm just trying to get a
sense for this year, your overall EBIT growth is fairly modest even with all that cost coming out. Once that evaporates,
what's the next lever that's going to propel the earnings growth from here? Thank you, and I'll pass it on.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: So certainly we feel really good about where we are against the $300 million program.
We're $250 million into it, $50 million left to go. So obviously we're very focused on delivering that. And if I step
back, I will say that it's never over. Cost savings are always going to be part of our long-term algorithm. We've got our
annual 3% of cost productivity program. In addition to that, as we finish this program, we are looking for additional
opportunities. We don't have any news to share with you today. But again, it's something that we're looking at. We'll
finish this program and then figure out where we go from there.

<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, John.
<Q - John Joseph Baumgartner>: Good morning. Denise, I'd like to ask about the Soup category and that overall
volumes are still pretty weak after two years, I guess back in 2013 and 2014, when ready-to-serve came back to growth.
So as you step back and look at the broader Simple Meals universe in which you compete, how much has the
competitive intensity increased more recently, whether it's from reformulations or innovation? And what do you think
gets the category back to at least flattish volumes on a sustainable basis?

<A - Denise M. Morrison>: I think in the recent past, what we experienced last year was some execution issues on our
RTS soup. Condensed was largely stable and broth has been increasing nicely for several years. But we experienced
declines on our Chunky brand that were quite severe due to a labeling misstep. We took a very robust price realization,
which the good news is it has stuck, but we did do that and that cost us some volume.
We thought that was really necessary for the price spectrum of soup from value to premium that we are providing now
to the consumer. And we didn't advertise Chunky. We literally did not have a consumer advertising campaign. We have
remedied that this year. And that's why I believe that if we can continue to keep the stability on condensed soup,
continue to grow broth and have a good comeback on RTS with Chunky and new Well Yes, I believe that is a stronger
plan going forward.
<Q - John Joseph Baumgartner>: So it sounds like over the past two years, it's more self-inflicted as opposed to
anything from other simple meals categories then?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: We are the largest player in the category, so I believe it's our responsibility to grow the
category too.

Our next question comes from David Driscoll with Citi. Your line is open.
<Q - David Cristopher Driscoll>: Great, thank you and good morning.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hey, David.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Good morning.
<Q - David Cristopher Driscoll>: So I wanted to ask about the gross margins a little bit more here and the expansion
that we saw in margins in Simple Meals. Was anything here just like a continuation from last year, or how sustainable
is the margin expansion?
And, Anthony, we've seen that in Q1 and Q2 that the company can have really large swings in margins depending on
the timing of shipments and how you pace your soup production. So I feel like there could be an answer in here related
to plant efficiencies and things like that that might inform us a little bit more on how gross margins will move
throughout the next few quarters. But can you just kind of – it's a big question there, so could you peel that thing apart
and give us a little help?
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: As you've seen, the primary contributor to gross margin expansion came out of our
Americas Simple Meals and Beverage segment, and it's driven by a couple things. One is our supply chain is just
running really well, and that is definitely sustainable. There's no reason that should fall back as we go throughout the
year here.
We're also out of the gate pretty well on productivity improvements, so let me give you a couple of examples. We
recently expanded one of our warehouses at our major thermal plant, so we brought in some of the storage that was on
third-party sites, so that saved us some money. We've added capacity in product lines like our Prego White Sauce,
additional capacity in aseptic broth. So we've repatriated some co-pack volume on those two products and that
obviously is sustainable. So, I think these things that are generating the savings in the first quarter are definitely
sustainable.
The things that we see kind of moving against us as we look ahead, one is on cost inflation. We are particularly within
Americas benefiting from some deflation in a couple of key categories, things like steel cans and dairy, which I don't
think is sustainable. And based on our forecast, that is going to move from more deflation to more I would say flattish
in the back half.

And the third thing, which I mentioned earlier, we are making investments in the cost line against our real food
initiative, the cost of removing artificial colors and ingredients, costs associated with moving BPA from our can liners.
That's going to hit more as we progress throughout the year. So again, I think the supply chain is running well and
we've got a couple of things that are going to turn a little bit as we go through the year.
<Q - David Cristopher Driscoll>: And then just to follow up on this, how does net price realization play into Simple
Meals? And then big picture, how does all these changes affect your quarterly EPS layout for the remaining portion of
the year, noting that last quarter, you indicated that the year was going to be back-half weighted?
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Net price realization, in this environment, I think we've talked about this before, where
some categories are deflationary, some categories are extremely competitive. We don't expect a lot of gains on net price
realization this year. So, that should be fairly stable throughout the year. In terms of the front half, back half, I think we
continue to see the majority of our growth coming in the back half compared to the first half.

Our next question comes from David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, David.
<Q - David Palmer>: Thanks. Good morning. Hey, Denise. From the measured channel data, it looks like your volume
lift to soup specifically from promotions improved in the quarter. I'm remembering the labeling issue from last year.
But perhaps there's more insight about the stronger performance from your soup promotions this year and how we
should look at those, that year-over-year lift from promotions going forward. Any color would be helpful. Thanks.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: So, I can take a crack at that. As we look back over the first quarter, it's relatively
early. And I think in terms of our promotional programs, last year was the year which we saw significant change in
some of our EDLP and our promoted price points. This year is going to be more stable year-on-year on the price points
and I think we're seeing the benefit of that.
So, at mid quarter, we started to put out our Chunky advertising program. I think that more stable pricing environment
enables these other things to kind of work together and to work well. We've got some new varieties on Chunky. We
definitely have new and better advertising. We're spending more behind the brand. So, I would say it's not like you can
point to one thing, on Chunky. I think it's all those demand drivers working together that are enabling us to see better
performance on Chunky.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: I also will add that the launch of Well Yes, although it's midyear, will be big. And it's
hitting and shipping during that key January wellness month from a consumer standpoint. So, we expect that the
promotional and merchandising support on that brand will be great.

<Q - Michael Lavery>: I was wondering if you could just touch on your Kelsen business in China. I know you had
reconfigured some your distribution there. How is that progressing? And specifically with say golden wheat or Single
say, have you seen better execution and performance?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Sure. We are expanding Kelsen in China. Last year, we made a distribution change and
went from a distributor that we literally inherited when we bought the business to a different distribution network. That
has actually worked out very well. The litmus test was the Autumn Festival where we increased consumption and
gained share in an expanded footprint and we're going to continue to work that. But we believe that that bodes well for
Chinese New Year, which is really the big event for Kelsen. The first quarter is not usually a large quarter for us on that
business, but second quarter is.
<Q - Michael Lavery>: Okay, that's helpful. And then, just lastly, a housekeeping item on the tax rate. Any change we
should be aware of? I mean, is there any impact on the rest of the year from the change to the stock-based
compensation? How should we think about the full year tax rate?
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: So there has been a couple of puts and takes. But we continue to estimate that our
full-year rate to be around 32%, which is where that forecast has been.

Our final question comes from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research. Your line is open.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Jonathan.
<Q - Jonathan Feeney>: Hi. How are you doing? Happy Thanksgiving.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Hey. Thanks, Jon.
<Q - Jonathan Feeney>: I listened to some of these questions about the competitive landscape and it seems to me like
your biggest competitor, only one to speak of in ready-to-serve soup, has not only communicated to the world that it's
now a foundation brand, not a growth brand for them, but has announced they're closing the original facility, that's the
headquarters of that and their largest single place.
So, I guess my – as you look at manufacturing centers – so if you look at ready-to-serve going forward, it would strike
me the big risk here is only really that it loses shelf space with the retailers because it must be, I mean, there must be
some pretty good momentum in Chunky as you are presumably putting more resources behind this.
So, my questions would be, are retailers recognizing the difference? Are they aware of this change in relative sort of a
commitment to this category? I know you've gotten net price realization there. And what sort of expectations do you
have over, not only the next year but the next couple of years as capacity changes in that industry that you'll be able to
hold share for ready-to-serve as a whole as you presumably play a bigger role in that? Thanks very much.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: We are committed to helping our retail customers grow their business and the center store
needs more innovation. To that point, we are increasing our investment in RTS soup this year, again, on Chunky with a
full-court press and full integrated marketing campaign, as well as the Well Yes introduction. And I just believe in this
environment that brings news to the center store. Retailers have also expressed real positive feedback on our stackable
cans. It doesn't sound that big, but it is big to them because it enables them to merchandise with operations, efficiency
and effectiveness. So, I believe it will be a good season for RTS.
