I'll now turn the call over to Richard.
Richard K. Davis
Thanks, Jen. Good morning, everybody and thanks for joining our call. I'd like to begin our review of U.S. Bank's
results with a summary of the quarter's highlights on page three of the presentation. U.S. Bancorp reported net income
of $1.5 billion for the third quarter of 2016, or a record $0.84 per diluted common share. I'm very pleased with the third
quarter results. Industry-leading profitability was supported by solid loan and deposit growth and broad-based core
revenue growth.
As a reminder, our prior quarter results included notable items including a Visa gain of $180 million in non-interest
income and $150 million related to litigation accruals and a charitable contribution in non-interest expense. There were
no notable items to report in third quarter. So for the remainder of this call, we'll discuss the results on a core basis,
excluding the notable second quarter items I just described, as this is how we believe the investment community looks
at our results.
Slide four provides you with the five-quarter history of our profitability metrics, which continue to be among the best in
the industry. In the third quarter, our return on average common equity was 13.5% and our efficiency ratio was 54.5%.
Turning to slide five, the company reported total net revenue of $5.4 billion in the third quarter. Excluding notable
items from the second quarter of 2016, this represents an increase of 2.3% on a linked-quarter basis. Our revenue
growth is primarily driven by loan growth of 1.1% and strength in a number of our fee-based businesses, including
Mortgage Banking and Payment Services.
The industry continues to face headwinds from the low rate environment and the flatter yield curve. This quarter, our
net interest margin was also impacted by higher levels of cash balances due to the strong deposit inflows. However,
despite a lower net interest margin, which declined by 4 basis points to 2.98% in line with expectations, we reported net
interest income growth, both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis. Credit quality was stable in the third quarter,
as expected. Both non-performing assets and net charge-offs decreased modestly compared with the prior
linked-quarter.
Before turning to Terry, I'll provide you with an outlook for the fourth quarter. Currently, we expect average loans to
continue to grow in the range of 1% to 1.5% sequentially. While mortgage loan growth is expected to slow in line with
industry-wide tapering and refinancing activity and due to seasonality, we look for a rebound in commercial loan
growth in the fourth quarter, and expect strength in consumer loans to continue.
Given the current shape of the yield curve, we expect that the net interest margin will decline a couple of basis points.
However, we expect net interest income will increase on a linked-quarter basis, principally driven by growth in earning
assets. We look for somewhat lower mortgage revenue in the fourth quarter, in line with an expectation of lower
refinancing activity. We expect expenses to grow 2.5% on a linked-quarter basis, primarily driven by seasonally higher
expenses, including tax credit amortization costs related to our Community Development business.
And finally, given the underlying mix and quality of the overall portfolio, we expect credit quality to remain relatively
stable and we expect the provision to increase in line with loan growth.
Terry will now provide you with more details about our third quarter results.
Terrance R. Dolan
Thanks, Richard. I'll start on slide six, which highlights our loan and deposit growth. Average total loans outstanding
grew 1.1% on a linked-quarter basis and increased 7.6% compared with the third quarter of 2015. Excluding the retail
card portfolio acquisitions, completed in the second half of last year and student loans that were reclassified to held for
investment, in the third quarter of 2015 loans grew by 6.4%, compared with the prior year.

In the third quarter, the year-over-year increase in average loans outstanding was led by strong growth in average total
commercial loans of 9.0%, and strong growth in average total residential mortgage loans of 8.6%. Consumer loan
growth was broad based, led by credit card loans and other retail loans, specifically credit card loans grew 5.9%,
excluding the retail card acquisition and other retail loans grew 5.2%, excluding the student loans. Home equity loans
grew 2.4% on a year-over-year basis with growth primarily sourced from our branch network.
On a linked-quarter basis, our average loan growth was 1.1%, in line with our expectations. Credit card loans grew
2.4%, residential mortgage loans grew 1.4%, home equity loans were up 0.5%, and other retail loans were up 2.7%.
The total average deposits increased by more than $28 billion, or 10% compared with the third quarter of 2015, and
were up 3.6% on a linked-quarter basis.
On a year-over-year basis, the trend reflected strong growth of 11.9% in our low cost deposits, which includes our
non-interest bearing deposits, and our interest bearing savings deposits. This strong core deposit growth more than
offset the runoff in higher cost time deposits.
Turning to slide seven, credit quality remained relatively stable in the third quarter. Third quarter net charge-offs
increased by $23 million, or 7.9%, compared with the prior year, but decreased by $2 million compared with the
second quarter of 2016. Net charge-offs, as a percentage of average loans, were 46 basis points in the third quarter,
unchanged from the prior year, and down from the 48 basis points reported in the linked-quarter.
Compared with the year ago, non-performing assets increased $97 million, or 6.2%, mostly due to downgrades that
occurred in the prior quarters related to energy credits. Linked-quarter non-performing assets decreased by $8 million,
or less than 1%, primarily driven mainly from improvements in residential mortgages and other real estate. We
continued to add to the allowance for loan losses in the third quarter, in line with loan growth.
Slide eight provides highlights of third quarter results, comparable – versus comparable periods. Third quarter net
income increased by $13 million, or 0.9% on a year-over-year basis. Net revenue growth was partially offset by higher
non-interest expense.
As Richard mentioned, results in the prior quarter were impacted by notable items including a $180 million Visa gain
in non-interest income, and $150 million in non-interest expenses related to litigation accruals and a charitable
contribution. Excluding notable items from the second quarter, net income increased by $2 million, or 0.1%, reflecting
total net revenue growth of 2.3%, offset by non-interest expense growth of 3.1%. Our efficiency ratio of 54.5% was in
line with our guidance of 54% to 54.9%.
Turning to slide 9, net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis increased by $122 million, or 4.3%, compared with
the prior year. Strong average earning asset growth was offset somewhat by the impact of a 6 basis point decline in the
net interest margin to 2.98%. The year-over-year decline in the net interest margin primarily reflected increased
funding costs, higher average cash balances, and lower rates on securities purchases, partially offset by higher rates on
new loans.
Compared with the second quarter of 2016, taxable equivalent net interest income increased by $47 million, or 1.6%,
growth in average total loans was offset by a 4 basis point decrease in the net interest margin. The linked-quarter
decline in the margin primarily reflects the impact of higher cash balances which represented 3 basis point out of the 4
basis point decline, as well as lower average rates on securities purchased offset somewhat by the benefit of higher
LIBOR rates on loans during the quarter.
Slide 10 highlights trends in non-interest income, which increased $119 million, or 5.1% year-over-year. The increase
was primarily due to growth in mortgage banking revenue, trust and investment management fees, credit and debit card
revenue, and merchant processing revenue. Mortgage banking revenue increased $90 million, or 40.2%, supported by
core growth and strong industry-wide refinancing activity, which drove originations and sales volume. Trust and
investment management fees increased $33 million, or 10%, reflecting lower money market fee waivers, growth in
assets under management, and improved equity markets. A $30 million or 11.2% increase in credit and debit card
revenue was driven by higher transaction volumes including the acquired portfolios. Merchant processing revenue
increased $12 million, or 3%. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, merchant processing revenue

increased 5.3% from the prior year.
On a linked-quarter basis, non-interest income increased $73 million, or 3.1%. The increase was principally due to
stronger mortgage banking revenue and growth in payment services revenue. Mortgage banking revenue increased $76
million, or 31.9%, which slightly exceeded our previous guidance range of 20% to 30%. Growth in mortgage banking
revenue was driven by higher production volumes reflecting stronger refinancing activity. Mortgage banking revenue
was also supported by a favorable change in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights, net of hedging activities.
Corporate payment products revenue increased by $9 million, or 5.0%, and as a reminder, corporate payment products
revenue is seasonally stronger in the third quarter of each year. Merchant processing revenue increased $9 million, or
2.2%, due to seasonally higher transaction volumes. Excluding the impact of foreign currency changes, merchant
processing revenue would have increased by 3.5% sequentially. Commercial product revenue decreased by $19
million, or 8.0%, primarily due to higher capital markets volume in the second quarter, which in turn reflected market
volatility during that quarter.
Turning to slide 11, non-interest expense increased $156 million, or 5.6% on a year-over-year basis. Compensation
expense grew versus the prior year, primarily due to hiring decisions to support business growth and compliance
programs, as well as the impact of merit increases and variable compensation tied to production.
Professional services increased $12 million, or 10.4%, also reflecting costs associated with compliance programs.
Technology and communication expense increased $21 million, or 9.5%, including the impact of capital investments
and costs related to the acquired credit card portfolios. We continue our investment in our brand, which is reflected in
slightly higher marketing costs from a year ago.
On a linked-quarter basis, non-interest expense increased $89 million, or 3.1%. Compensation expense increased $52
million, or 4.1%, due to the impact of one additional day in the quarter and increased staffing. The $23 million
increase, or 5.1%, in other non-interest expense primarily reflected seasonally higher costs related to investments in
tax-advantaged projects and the impact of the FDIC surcharge which began in the third quarter of 2016. Marketing and
business development costs decreased $7 million, or 6.4%, due to the timing of various marketing programs.
As Richard mentioned, we expect expenses to grow in the fourth quarter; however, at a slower pace than the 3.1%
growth that we reported in the third quarter. Our current expectation is for linked-quarter expenses to grow by 2.5% in
the fourth quarter. This is primarily due to seasonal expenses, including tax credit amortization costs, which we expect
will increase on a linked-quarter basis approximately $60 million during the fourth quarter. As a reminder, we realize
the benefit of these tax credits in our tax rate.
The linked-quarter decline in preferred dividends was reflective of our fourth quarter 2015 preferred stock issuance,
which has a semiannual dividend payment. As a result of that issuance, we will have higher quarterly dividends in
quarters two and four of every year, compared with quarters one and three.
Turning to slide 12, our capital position remains strong and in the third quarter we returned 79% of our earnings to
shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. We expect to remain in our targeted payout ratio of 60% to 80%
going forward.
Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach as if fully implemented at
September 30, was 9.3%, which is well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement. Our tangible book value per
share rose to $18.85 at September 30, representing a 9.6% increase over the same quarter of last year, and a 2.1%
increase over the prior quarter.
I will now turn it back to Richard.
Richard K. Davis
Thanks, Terry. I'm very proud of our record third quarter results. We maintained our industry-leading performance
measures and we reported an 18.1% return on tangible common equity in the quarter. Our industry continues to face

challenges from the low interest rate environment. However, we remain confident that we can continue to grow
revenue, even as we prudently manage expenses and strategically invest in our businesses to create value for both our
customers and for our shareholders.
That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Terry, Bill and I would be happy to answer any of your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Ricky Dodds>: This is Ricky Dodds from Matt's team. I've got a quick question on C&I loan growth. It's a little
weaker than we expected, and I was wondering if you could provide us any color on what's driving the slowdown at
USB.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah, I'll go first, Ricky, and I'll turn it over to Andy. As we've said I think at our Investor
Day five weeks ago, we think quarter three represents a pause in C&I lending, meaning that it was strong in quarter two
and we expect it to recover in quarter four. In part, based on what we believe is the vagaries of quarter three where we
had some of the Brexit activities move things up into quarter two, and perhaps some of the uncertainty around election
and other things moving things into quarter four, but we see that returning nonetheless.
You'll see that we had a particularly kind of across the board performance in most of the corporate space as the
slowdown reflected things like higher pay downs, reduction in deal activity, and a healthy capital market condition
allowed some borrowers to use the debt markets, although we also captured some of that in our capital markets activity.
The rest of the lending, though, on the consumer side remained strong and, in fact, got stronger as the year progresses,
and we continue to see that progressing into quarter four as well. But for a little color on commercial and CRE, maybe
we'll have Andy give you that.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: So another factor was a little lower utilization rate. We were down maybe 75 basis points
from 26% to 25% in a quarter this quarter and this is reflective of some of the things Richard talked about. Again, I
think the very strong debt capital markets issuance that we saw in the second quarter and early in the third quarter
impacted bank outstandings, as we talked about. And finally, M&A activity, which was a driver of strong growth in
prior quarters, took a little bit of a pause here in the third quarter, either delayed or deferred to future quarters. So those
factors all come into play and that's why we think it was more of a pause and that we'll come back a little bit as we [ph]
look forward (18:45).
<A - Richard K. Davis>: And I just might add, it's already October, what is it, 19th? And so we're deep into the fourth
quarter and we have a pretty good idea how the annuities are moving. So we can see growth certainly over quarter
three. It's how strong it gets in the next couple of weeks, we'll be able to reflect at the next conference.
<Q - Ricky Dodds>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yep.
Operator
Your next question is from John McDonald with Bernstein.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Good morning, John
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Good morning, guys. Wanted to ask about expenses and efficiency, Richard. Where
are you on the ongoing effort to kind of improve productivity and expenses but also keep investing? Is it a goal to try to
kind of self-fund your expenses and investments with savings elsewhere? Or is it more about an efficiency ratio

mindset?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah, so you know, John, we don't measure efficiency ratio. It becomes the result of our –
the fraction of revenues to expenses. So the best way to keep it low is to do more revenue, which is our number one
goal.
Expense-wise, I think we've telegraphed to you all that we appreciate that the higher costs of compliance and actually
some of the capital expenditures we've been making in innovation technology continue to bear down on expenses, so I
will continue to let expenses grow only to the level that revenue is allowing it, under these circumstances that we set
forth at the Investor Day, which is that we think there'll be a couple of rate increases, nominal rate increases in 2017.
With those rate increases, we made a commitment to you all based on what we can see today to provide slightly
positive operating leverage in this environment. We also said, however, if those rates don't materialize, it will be much
harder for us to do that. To give you a sense of it, without the rates, a couple of rate increases in the next year, that for
us is hundreds of millions of dollars in expenses that we would need to reduce further. And I think would probably cut
into some of the muscle of the company's long-term objectives for growth and innovation. So we're not going to make
that commitment at this stage, but we'll watch every nickel and dime.
I always find a need to pause and remind you guys, to be in the 54s% isn't, like, easy. We don't sit there – we watch
every nickel and dime and we have efficiency programs all over the company. One of the ways we've kept it low is we
continue to get better every day and we take innovation and we let technology make it more efficient for our company
and for our people and therefore better service, but it's not easy. So we do have expense programs all the time, every
day, and forever. And some of the companies I know that announce efficiency programs, they put names around them,
they give you dollar amounts, we don't do that because it's not our style. We also don't need to, but we do watch it
every single day.
So we will let revenue be the dictate in most cases to how well that efficiency ratio performs. Our goal is to have it
continue to be in the mid-50s% and for a while, at that point, we'll measure against a future that I think won't be starved
for investment. The same token, the minute things get better and we have every opportunity to save a dollar, we will do
that very thing and give you a better return.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay, great. And just on the topic of rates, I was hoping to ask Terry if he could flesh
out a little bit of the outlook on the NIM that you gave for next quarter. What are some of the puts and takes, the good
guys and bad guys affecting the NIM outlook for next quarter? And if you could include there, what's your guess as to
the effect that one Fed rate hike would have on your NIM in the quarter afterwards? Thanks.
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Sure. Incorporated into our guidance, we're assuming that the rate hike does occur in the
December sort of timeframe, and that in and of itself would have a positive impact with respect to margin, probably
maybe by a basis point or so. But one of the things that we anticipate, John, is that the cash balances that we saw an
increase in, in the third quarter, we think are tied to money market reform, and that is going to have an impact in terms
of net interest margin, at least probably through the fourth quarter.
We anticipate that it's going to be transitory and that those cash balances will start to dissipate as people kind of get
more comfortable with money market reform. But we do – when we guide that the net interest margin is going to be
down a couple of basis points, you know, the cash balances are going to have an impact on that.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Got it. And Terry, just to clarify: The 1 basis point NIM help, is that for the quarter
that – if it happened in December you would get that help this quarter? And would there be a carrythrough to the next
quarter that's a little bigger than that?
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Yes.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: [ph] That's in the update (23:10).

Your next question is from John Pancari with Evercore ISI.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hi, John.
<Q - John Pancari>: Morning.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Morning.
<Q - John Pancari>: Back to the loan growth topic, thanks for the color that you've given in terms of near-term trends;
and I hear you in terms of some of the inconsistencies around borrower demand amid the uncertainty right now. How
does that play into your expectation for how you're looking at 2017? I know you don't yet have guidance there for loan
growth. But wanted to get an idea if you continue to expect improvement coming out of fourth quarter through 2017
and generally expect a higher level of loan growth. Thanks.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah John, this is Richard, the answer is yes. We've been in that range of 1% to 1.5% for a
long, long time and every quarter is different, and yet we've found a way to pretty much stay there. And I think you can
count on that to be a forerunner for the future. When revenue is – when growth is strong in retail, it might be stressed in
commercial, but this is a really well bifurcated model we have here. And we like C&I, we like CRE, we like all
consumer categories. But we see actually a little, slightly stronger 2017 than 2016 based on nothing more than the fact
that the world gets better a little bit, slowly but surely, and because we're taking market share.
And I haven't talked about market share in a number of quarters because I know it's a hollow kind of category when all
banks are doing well and everybody talks about it. But we really are, $28 billion in deposits in one year, the kind of
loan growth we've had consistently, 10% commercial loan growth year-over-year, we're taking market share. And part
of that, John, is also a proxy for next year because we believe that market share momentum not only continues, but it
gets stronger.
When anybody in our environment, think of the foreign banks or think of other banks that go through any period of
stress, we get the benefit of that. And as long as we continue to be, if we're not their first customer, we're their first
choice after that particular bank they're with, that's going to be a really good way for us to grow the business. So next
year it's across the board, we expect to be strong in virtually every category. Look at our home equity. We continue to
grow home equity and it's not with smoke and mirrors. We do it the old-fashioned way with really good products and
really good branch-based products coming out of the branch employees, and that's something that is really quite a
difference from most of the companies that we compete with. So we can do it across the board and we like all the
categories. So I think quarter four will continue to be in that range. I think next year will be in that range, and maybe
slightly positive bias to that.
<Q - John Pancari>: All right, Richard. Thank you; appreciate the color. And then separately, I guess this would be a
question for you as well, would be around the regulatory side. Since we've been talking about the regulatory expenses
that you've been putting in the work, can you give us a related update on the BSA/AML progress and if there's any way
to help us with expectations of when that could be resolved? Thanks.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah. Sure, John. We're deep in the middle of it, so I not only don't have a projection of
when we'll leave, if I had it, I wouldn't tell you because of the regulators. I haven't made any agreements. So that will
take a while. It'll definitely be well into next year that we'll get a line of sight on when we can look for an exit of that.
In the meantime, it's taken us to a compliance cost level that I'd hoped to recover when we got out of the mortgage
consent order, which we're now long out of. But as it turns out, when the AML Consent Order came in, it virtually
replaced those same costs, so with our growth expectations of reducing expenses, we're unable to do that at this point.
But it's also finding its footway now into the run rate of the company.
It's also made us a better bank. You know I don't like consent orders and we only have the one, and it's frustrating to
me. But the fact of the matter is, it is a proxy for the expectations of zero tolerance for errors and we've aligned that
proxy with everything we do, and it takes a little bit of time to adjust to it. It takes a little bit more money to get your

first, second, and third lines to do amazing levels of oversight and quality assurance, but once and when you've done
that, and you put it into your run rate, both in costs and in the way you do business, we'll be a better bank for it.
So I'd like you to think that the AML project has extended itself through the whole company to improve our
compliance capability, and therefore, sendoff any other future areas of shortcomings. And I would say next year, we'll
be able to give you a better line of sight, but at this stage, we're deep in the middle of it, doing our very best job to
satisfy the regulators and to over perform even to our own expectations. And at this point, I'd be hesitant to give you
any kind of an exit timetable.

Your next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hi, Ken.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Thanks. Good morning. I had a question on the fee side of things. Terry, you mentioned that
mortgage would be down in the fourth; and you talked about into the quarter how it would have a nice leap. I'm just
wondering, it looks like the gain on sale margin was quite high. I'm calculating [ph] 150 bps (28:01). Can you walk us
through the mix of refi versus purchase, and what you're expecting in general for mortgage to do in the fourth quarter?
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Sure. So, if you end up looking at the third quarter versus for example the second quarter,
just to address your question related to the mix of refinancings. So, in the third -second quarter – excuse me, the mix
was about 65% to 70% on the purchase side and the rest was refinance, so let's say 35%. It was closer to 45% during
the third quarter, and we would expect that refinancing sort of mix will probably decline closer to 40% in the fourth
quarter, so it is coming down based upon what we're seeing.
You are right that when you end up looking at kind of the mix of where a lot of that refinancing is coming from, it's
coming from high-quality product, again primarily sourced a lot, probably a higher mix through our retail banking
system. And so, when you end up looking at the gain on sale and that margin, we are seeing in the third quarter a better
margin than what we had experienced in the past. So, the growth that we saw in the third quarter is a mix of higher
production, as well as higher margin, so you're right on.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: So can you help us triangulate that to what kind of delta? You helped us understand the 20% to 30%
up in the third; does that roll back off in the fourth, or is it somewhere in the middle?
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Yeah, I would say that it's probably somewhere in the middle, again, simply because of
where the production is going to come from. And when you have higher levels of production, you're able to get better
margins, and pricing with respect to the product and therefore better margins as a result. But when we end up looking at
the fourth quarter, we do expect the margin on production to be starting to taper a little bit, as well as production levels.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Okay, great. Understood. A second follow-up. Just, Richard, you've made the point about the kind
of set-your-clock-to-it seasonality. And I was just wondering on the rest of fees generally, do you see just the same type
of growth patterns happening as far as the ones that grow and the ones that typically don't? And just your general sense
of the ex-mortgage, just fee businesses, any improvements underneath the surface there?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah, I'll let Andy answer that, but I want to tell you, Ken, we're a seasonally strong fourth,
third quarter company on revenue, also higher expenses in third and fourth quarter because of the CDC. But that's one
of the reasons this can look like a consistent predictable outcome, but it's slightly different each time. Quarter four we
like a lot for fees and I'll have Andy give you some color on that.

<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Right. So, the quarter three is the strongest quarter for corporate payments, and then it tapers
off a little bit. And if you look at merchant and credit card issuing, I would expect a continued level of growth that you
saw this quarter, sort of the same-store sales in a 2+% total revenue in that 3% to 5% like you saw this quarter. So I
would see that same expectation, other than corporate payments, which does tend to go down in the fourth quarter
because the third quarter is the strongest, given the government activity.
Trust fees will be a bit of a function of what the market is doing. We had a strong quarter this quarter with both strong
market activity as well as good core growth. I would expect that to continue. And then Terry made reference to money
market reform. We did see quite a shift in our balances also. Our prime funds went down in the neighborhood of $6
billion, given money market reform, but our government bonds went up almost $9 billion. So how that settles out will
also be [ph] impacted with fees (31:30) here in the fourth quarter.

Your next question is from Erika Najarian with Bank of America.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hey, Erika.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Hi, good morning. Just a follow-up question on John's line of questioning. If I look at the
6% year-over-year increase in expenses in both 2Q and 3Q, Richard, could you help us break it down in terms of how
much of that could be attributed to higher compliance costs and risk management costs, and how much of that could be
attributed to costs to invest for innovation?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah, so the breakdown is, it's both. Let's start with just year-over-year running the company
this size. Your merit increases alone, say they're 3%, 3% plus, and our total expenses are [ph] half (32:20)
compensation, that's 1.5% right there.
Number two, I want to make it clear, we're spending a lot more in our CapEx in innovation and technology. Gosh, five
years ago this company was at a $400 million, $500 million max annual investment in CapEx. This year it's going to be
between $800 million and $1 billion. And our run rate is probably going to be more like 7.50% to 8%. That's good
because it's appropriately – because we're now more of a technology company than we used to be. And given our
payments leadership, we should be making those kinds of investments, which, of course, will yield value down the line.
So that's another piece of it.
What's left then is the compensation costs and the overall just running the company better and spending money on
things that we didn't used to spend money on, like quality assurance, which isn't related to compliance, that's just doing
the job better. And making sure our people are paid fairly, that the compensation is entire, it's employee benefits and it's
the way we treat the employees and making sure that the culture itself is strong across all categories. And sometimes
you have to spend money to make sure that the brand is protected, that the employees feel safe, that the work
environment is good and we're investing in all of those things too.
So compliance is a piece of it, Erika. That 6% is a number I don't want to see go over the long course of time. I'd like it
to come down to more, over course of time, more like a 3% to 5%, because I do think you have to spend money on
investments, but that's a little bit high and compliance is probably the delta on that, that 1% to 2% delta that I want to
bring down over time in these most current periods. So, it's probably a third of it, but it's also a part that won't sustain
over the course of long period of time because once we get it right, we'll get the benefits back.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: That was helpful, thank you. And just a follow-up question. In terms of Governor Tarullo's
speech, it sounds like given that your binding constraint will be the capital conservation buffer, that shouldn't make any

difference in terms of how you think about capital planning at your size or the need to scale up to your asset base in
order to deal with a higher capital requirement. Am I thinking about that correctly?
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Yeah, so let me take a stab at it and then Andy can add to it. When you end up looking at
Tarullo's comments and then the impact to U.S. Bank, we don't really see that it's going to have a significant impact to
either our capital distribution plan or the requirements that we have with respect to the minimum requirement. And that
is because of the fact that when you end up looking at the capital depletion that occurs during the stress testing process,
that capital depletion for U.S. Bank, given our risk profile, is lower than the 2.5% buffer that is already incorporated
into it. So we think that our minimum requirement from a regulatory perspective is going to continue to be at that 7%.
We don't see that really changing a lot. Impact to peers, probably the smaller peers, simply because of the fact that they
don't have to deal with some of the qualitative aspects, I think will be net positive to them, but we don't see a big
change to it. So, Andy?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: And because of that, Terry, our current binding constraint is the standardized ratio under the
base case and it will continue to [ph] be up (35:37).
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Great. Thank you.

Your next question is from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Good morning, Marty.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: Morning. You talked a little bit about the shift that was coming in because of the money market
change. But deposit growth just continues to outpace loan growth. 10% over the last year for you all is just incredible at
this part of the cycle. So why is this deposits just keep flooding back into the bank balance sheets? Where is the
primary source of all that coming from, because it's across the board for most banks?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: And, Marty, I think one of the principal reasons, and we both Terry and myself referenced
it, is money market reform. We saw ourselves about a $6 billion decline, some of it going to governments, but the
industry saw about $0.5 trillion move out of prime obligation or prime funds. Some of that's moved into bank balance
sheets, and I think some of that will move back once the investment policies and so forth are adjusted to allow for a
floating NAV. But that is one of the key factors. I think the other factor is some of the movement between and among
banks, again, given ratings and some of the stresses that are occurring, we're getting a lot of deposits that are flowing to
us from some of the non-U.S. banks, and that has also been helpful.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: The other thing, when you look at the mortgage servicing, this was an interesting quarter for
mortgage because you had the production go up with refis, but you also had rates trickle up at the back end of the
quarter. So your valuation on servicing was actually positive as well. That happens occasionally but not typical. When
you look at the about $25 million that you had positive in valuation, but you also had prepayments that were coming
through, so your actual cash flow increased the other adjustments of servicing value: How do you look at the net of
those two things going forward in the impact to the mortgage banking fees in fourth quarter and then into next year?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Yeah Marty, I think when we end up, at least with respect to fourth quarter because it's a
little hard to kind of look beyond that, but when we end up looking at fourth quarter relative to the MSR hedge, we
would expect that to taper a little bit, as well. That would be another reason why we would expect the mortgage
banking revenue to decline somewhat during the quarter.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: But the other changes would also taper down, so that big negative you had there would be less
negative as you moved into the next quarter as well.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: That's fair.

Your next question is from Mike Mayo with CLSA.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Morning Mike.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: Hi. First, a follow-up from Investor Day. I wasn't sure about your appetite for bank acquisitions
after that day. In other words, once you get the regulatory side resolved, are you willing to look a little bit more, or not?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah, sure. But you can go back to, gosh, any of the 40 earnings calls I've had where we
would remind you that we will more gladly double down in the 25 retail markets and states that we're in than to go into
a new market where we would have lower pricing power and lower brand value. So think the Chicago deal a couple
years ago where we doubled down in Chicago. Think the New Mexico transaction we moved in as number three bank
overnight. Those kind of opportunities will continue to be attractive to us. The idea of moving to a new market that we
don't currently have a position in would have to be remarkably attractive and it would have to be at a pretty high market
position to get our attention.
So the good news is despite the fact that we haven't got the ability to do that right now, there's nothing out there that we
wish we could have had and the timing is working out pretty well. But when that opportunity is back, you can well
count on us looking in-market for sizable deals that are worth disrupting the momentum of the company, but in markets
we're already present.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: And then a separate question. Your last comment at Investor Day, maybe I can call it the Richard
Davis soliloquy.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: I don't know, now what? Me and the ten year bond, what is it now?
<Q - Mike Mayo>: Well, you go: Look; banking has this remarkably noble opportunity to change the world; there's no
other business I can think of. We don't feed people or fly people or give them medication; we get behind their
possibilities. And it goes on a little bit more.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: And just the disconnect between that statement talking about the noble opportunity of banking and
the tarnish the banking industry has now, due to some issues around cross-selling and -
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Sure.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: I'm just looking for some additional perspective from you. What are you doing to ensure this
doesn't happen at U.S. Bancorp? And, more generally, when you do make a mistake and you say there's a guarantee,
what do you do to fulfill that guarantee?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah, thanks, Mike. There's a lot in there. I just want to start out by saying we've looked at
this whole topic as industry and individual bank many years ago at a financial services roundtable, we made an effort to
consider a nationwide brand reputation rebuilding after the downturn and discovered very quickly that American
population wasn't ready for that. The bank industry, sadly, doesn't speak yet as one voice. And even today, still doesn't.
But we did agree that each of us could do a much better job of satisfying our own customers and building our own
brand and eventually, the totality of that would be the way to rebuild. And, I think, sadly, we're not where we'd like to
be, but that's the way to do it. So each bank needs to stand very strongly on its own and do what's right by its
customers. If one bank falls away from that, then it's just one bank, it's not an industry. So we'll figure out how to tell
that story better.

In our company, it's where you start that matters the most, in terms of sales culture. It's not even sales culture, it's
culture, just underline the word culture, sales practice is part of that, the way you incentivize people is part of that, the
way you handle your customers. So, answering your last question at first, the guarantee is always stand behind what
you promise, overperform if you've made a mistake, atone and apologize, fix what's wrong and then figure out how that
applies to the next possible action that could otherwise become a problem later. I long talked about bankers going from
baggage handlers to pilots in the same company. In fact, as of this morning, baggage handlers now have to be more like
pilots if you follow the news out of the White House. But we believe that same thing is the case. I think as an industry,
we have to be much better at handling every individual transaction uniquely and honestly and genuinely, and when we
make mistakes, get it right, fix it and apply it to the next things.
Mike, I've been with you as long as anybody on this call, and we've never been use the word cross-sell. I don't even
know what the cross-sell is at this Bank. Honest to God, I've never, ever looked at that number. I would guess it's
between two and four because nobody wants any part of their lifecycle needs more than probably two or four services
at one time from a bank. But we don't measure that, we don't set quotas, what we instead do is ask our employees to
make sure people know what we have. So that as their lifecycle change needs, and if we're their trusted partner, they'll
ask us for it. So what that means, is people buy our products, we don't sell them. And as long as we have something
they want and it's for services rendered and fees benefited, we'll be happy to provide that. I want to make sure it's clear
though, for this industry, selling is not bad. That's not bad anywhere. As long as you're selling to people's needs and
you're making it clear what advantages you have to provide them at the time that they want them.
So, yes, it's tough on the industry, but it's still always goes back to people love their banker, they like their bank
because they made those choices. They don't so much like the industry. We're sadly years away from getting that right.
But if every bank and every banker does a better job, despite what happens on occasion in one location or another,
we've got a fighting chance to bring this thing back, and I'll close the soliloquy with the fact this has all been
accomplished under a very negative economic environment. One of the reasons banks were popular 10 years ago,
notwithstanding the downturn, was when times were good, banks were doing more positive things. People are healthier.
The economy is moving more quickly. People want us and need us and we can say yes more often. When the world
gets a little bit better, we could say yes more often, we're more popular and we're more effective. When times are
tough, actually, we move on to defense and we're there to protect people from things that could get them in harm's way.
That's a less attractive position, people don't like to watch defensive games either, because it's low-scoring. At the end
of the day, at the very end, it really does matter.
So I do think it's a noble occupation. I'm very proud of what we do. I'm very proud of the people that do it across this
country. It's one of the most important things that we have in America and it's what makes us unique. And by the way,
it's the only place where you can get leverage. $1 of deposits at a good bank is worth $7 in loans and that is an amazing
way to grow an economy. So, I'm going to still be in the camp of it and will get there one day. But one bank at a time,
we can control it on that basis and we're doing our best here to do that.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: Thank you.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yep. I need music behind that. Don't you think music maybe, a symphony behind me, maybe
birds flying about, or something? Thanks, Mike.

the comments you made about mortgage banking. In particular, you're mentioning the increase in refi activity. I would

positive mix shift this quarter. Was that a dramatic impact on the number and the gain on sale margin? And going

forward, do you expect that mix shift to change, as well?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: This is Andy, there was a little bit more retail, and just generally speaking, the gain on sale
margins on refinancings are higher than purchases, so that was also a factor. As Terry mentioned, we would expect the
refinancing component to go down in the fourth quarter, as well as the overall volume. If you look at the last few years,
historically, in a normal environment, fourth quarter activity is down 10% to 15% because it's just fourth quarter and
new purchases particularly are down, so I would expect that same trend. And we will update you at further conferences
during the quarter to give you an update what we're seeing, because it's also very dependent upon rates, particularly at
that level of the yield curve, which is going to impact activity for the fourth quarter.
<Q - Kevin J. Barker>: We're also seeing in the servicing market the market for MSRs softening, and so the yields on
those assets are going up. Are you seeing an opportunity to get better margins in the correspondent market and that
support your overall gain on sale margin? And are you potentially participating in the purchase of MSRs?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: We're not going to participating in the purchase of MSRs. We are in the correspondent
market. It depends on the geography and the type of loan. I would say some of it is very competitive in terms of
pricing, and some of it a little less competitive. So it depends on the mix.

Your next question is from Brian Foran with Autonomous.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hi, Brian.
<Q - Brian D. Foran>: Good morning. Maybe on the auto business, I realize it's not a huge part of your loan book;
between the loans and leases maybe 9% or so of the book. But it's been a source of growth. You outlined a couple years
ago some ambitions for market share improvement, which you seem to have achieved. I wonder if you could just talk
about further appetite for growth both in loans and leases. And then in terms of the credit quality, you had the comment
in the release about lower residual gains. The appendix does show delinquencies rising, albeit from pristine levels. Is
the performance you're seeing in line with what you had penciled out when you wanted to grow this book? Or is there a
deterioration happening? Or how should we think about that?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Brian, this is Andy, I'll answer those questions. So, first of all, the volume continues to be
strong. It's a function of our dealer partnerships and the technology investments that we've made in the business. It's a
good mix of lease as well as purchase. I would expect us to continue to have partnerships expand and continue to see
strong growth. I'd also mention that we do not do any subprime activity in this business, and we, in fact, have very
conservative credit standards, both in terms of term, as well as the credit quality underneath it. So it is a high-quality
portfolio and I'm very comfortable with the credit.
One phenomenon that is occurring in the marketplace, is residual values are coming down a bit. That's a function of
dealer incentives going up, which makes the comparison of new versus used favor the new. And that means that the
gain on sales, still positive, but might have been somewhere in the $1,000 range, is closer to $600 or $700. You'll see
that phenomenon occur through our fee income category. Again, I want to highlight, it's still positive, it's just less
positive.
<Q - Brian D. Foran>: Thank you. Maybe one follow-up. And just to get the spirit of the question right, it's not to pin
down basis points and the efficiency ratio, but just to make sure it's the right base. For 2016, I mean it sounds like
efficiency will be a little higher; the ratio will be a little higher in 4Q. And then I'm assuming we're using the adjusted
2Q number. So as we think about slightly positive operating leverage with a couple rate hikes or maybe flat without, is

the base 55%? Basically 55%?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Okay. So you are trying to get the basis points. Look, this year is going to look back, it's
going to be in the mid-54s. If we can deliver positive operating leverage and I said slightly, then it stays in the mid-54s.
If we're unable to do that, it floats into 55%, doesn't go above the mid-50s%, and it doesn't go down to 51%. Until the
world starts to give us a more robust both interest rate trajectory, mostly a steeper yield curve, and/or just a stronger
economy, pick any of the three, and pick all of the three, things start to take off.
So I'm going to say it as just, an expense as much of what you see this year, is much of what you'll see next year. It's
not going to move a lot one way or the other, for better or for worse. But I will tell you, it's the revenue that we're going
to try to hope we can pull down even further into 2017 and keep growing this thing like we do every year. We had
record EPS this year, not just because we had a decent buyback, but because we have good underlying loan quality and
good underwriting and really decent revenues. So we're going to keep delivering that, Brian. And I would just expect it
to be fairly consistent with what you see this year.

Your next question is from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Good morning, Matt.
<Q - Jason E. Harbes>: Hey, good morning, guys. It's actually Jason Harbes on Matt's team. Most of my questions
have been asked and answered, but maybe I'll just ask a question on the card business. You've seen really nice
momentum there this year. It looks like a lot of that is on the back of a Fidelity portfolio acquisition late last year. One
thing that caught my eye was the net charge-off ratio was unusually low both sequentially and year-over-year. Is that
primarily a function of the higher quality of that Fidelity book? Because I'm looking at the reported level compared to
your normalized through-the-cycle target of [ph] 4.65% (50:43), and it's quite a bit below. So just any comments
around how your credit card business is going would be much appreciated.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Matt, this is Andy again. Yes, that is the key difference. The Fidelity portfolio is slightly
higher quality. Our card portfolio is very high quality but the downturn that you see in that charge-off level in
delinquencies is a function of the higher-quality Fidelity portfolio.
<Q - Jason E. Harbes>: Okay, thanks. And maybe just a bigger-picture question on the expense outlook for next year.
This year it looks like you're going to come in a bit above the 3% to 5% target. A lot of that seems like it's related to
some of the remediation activities that you are undertaking. But as we think about 2017, would it be realistic to think
you might actually come in more towards the low end as those costs or ratios are resolved?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Yeah, Jason, one of the things that we've talked about when you think about the compliance
programs, and it kind of ties into some of the things that Richard talked about with respect to AML and BSA. We'll
continue to kind of work on that probably through next year. And last quarter we said that the compliance costs were
peaking in the second quarter, but we also said that we really don't see them declining significantly, at least not through
2017. In other words, I would think about it more as it's kind of plateauing. And it's going to stay at that level at least
for some period of time until we get through some of these compliance issues. So if you're thinking about the 2017
timeframe, that's kind of the way that I would think about it.
<Q - Jason E. Harbes>: Okay. Thanks, guys.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Thanks, Jason.

Your final question is from Nancy Bush with NAB Research.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hi, Nancy.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Good morning, Richard. How are you?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: I'm good. I was wondering where you were.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Still here in Georgia.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: But you were on the Morgan Stanley call. I know. You love them more.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Oh, yes. Yes, you could have brought up the – you opened the door with mentioning
election and Brexit and some other things.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: But I'm just more curious about your view of the regulatory scene right now. It seems
everybody is focusing on Tarullo's latest speech or what a Fed governor is saying, and we're losing sight of the forest
for the trees. So can you just give me your impression of the overall regulatory scene? And do you expect it to change
markedly one way or the other depending on the outcome of the election?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Sure. Thank you. First of all, I think, and I said this at our Investor Day, I think if we're a
nine-inning game, we're probably in the eighth inning. And we know most of the conditions. We know the condition on
the field, we know the umpires, we know the fan attitude, we know the weather, we know the ball speed. There's not a
lot here new. And there will be some adjustments to the election, but as you know, most of these positions are not tied
directly to the election or directly to the President's term. They have different term timetables, and think the FDIC and
the OCC to name two.
So, I think the philosophies and the general sense of what regulation looks like for banks is pretty well set. I think we
understand most of those rules, and what we're dealing with now is nuances, why certain speeches make so much
attention, because we're trying to read tea leaves and figure out if they're changing anything systemic. I don't think
there's anything major to change.
I also think a new President, which is undoubtedly going to happen, has a slight variation one way or the other. I won't
talk about which one I think does which, but one gets a little more uncertain and causes us to stand back a little bit and
wait to see how things settle. The other one is a lot more of the same, and probably whether we like it or not, it's
something we can manage because it's the devil we know.
Either way, I don't see any circumstances where bank regulation gets easier or lightens. I don't see a significant place
where it gets any tougher or gets a lot stronger. I do think there's going to be a need for us to particularly respond to this
current issue on culture and doing the right thing and that makes sense to me and that's a place that we'll welcome that
oversight. And, in fact, maybe to the earlier question, if banks are proven for the most part to be doing really the right
things the right way, that might be a very positive catalyst for the American people because they now know that we're
stronger, they know we're safer. They don't know that we intend to be good with that, and if we can prove that over the
course of the next couple years, especially if the economy might get better at the same time, I think we're in a pretty
good place. But for this bank, there's not a lot – we don't spend a lot of energy trying to figure out what's going to
happen next. We have relationships with regulators, both local and national, that we know and trust, and for us it's part
of doing business. And I think it's a normal course of running the bank and we don't fret about it and we don't try to
predict anything.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Well, on this issue of culture, how do you see that coming to the fore? Is that going to
become a special – does that get built into the DFAST? How do you see that happening?

<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah. That's a good question. That's too early to know. I do know and I believe it's known,
that the OCC is conducting a horizontal review, first and foremost starting immediately on unauthorized new accounts.
They're doing that horizontally. I don't know how far it's going, but it's the first. Look at more things like incentive
practices and then what would be, I think, eventually culture. We're thinking of it as culture, and we always have from
the very beginning, but I think that, Nancy, that will find its way probably through more likely the OCC under the
doctrine that they have as they oversee the banks. And then the Fed for the Fed banks will find their own way to
approach it.
I don't necessarily see it going into a CCAR stress test environment at this early stage. I see it being more of a pattern
and practice for the CAMEL ratings and the overall valuation of management and board oversight.
So, for me I think it's just another nuance. So we keep getting different things. It's a spotlight on the stage, right?
Everything is on the stage, but you can only see the stuff the spotlight is on. It's just going to move across and now find
something in the form of culture. I think we're all going to need to put better words around what we do. I think we're
going to have to prove what we do. And I think we're going to have to show sustainability to good practices. And that
does require us to do a lot more record keeping, a lot more auditing, a lot more quality assurance. I'd say it's actually a
pretty good thing because most banks do it very, very well and I think we're going to find out that that's an area of
strength that we can showcase that banks haven't been able to really put their finger on until now. Unfortunately, it
takes a blemish to bring out the issues, but I think you'll be – the American people will be quite pleased with what they
find.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Okay. One other regulatory issue. The fact that the EU seems to be backing away from
Basel, do you think that will change anything? Does that make any difference? Do we not go to Basel IV? What do you
think the impact of that is?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: I don't predict that one, as well, because I do think this one does matter a lot on who's in
position. I think Dan Tarullo's been our best guiding voice on this particular topic, both on what Basel means to the
United States banks and what it means in relationship to the global circumstances. As long as he's in position, I don't
think it goes away and I think he continues to argue the position that America's banks need to be at the highest, best,
strongest position, first and foremost, but in an environment where all the banks have to account for the same general
level of oversight. If Dan were to change positions I think that will have a meaningful impact on whether or not the
position at the domestic banks in relation to the international banks remains the same or not. But I think there's a
general sense across the world that everyone – all the banks should be stronger. They're looking for a governing kind of
a doctrine, Basel seems to be the one that allows everybody to think most banks across the world have generally the
same minimum oversights and we're all getting there at different speeds. But I think it's probably still the best proxy
and I don't think it changes greatly. And I think the verbiage of a speech or a general sentiment that things aren't going
to be adopted or things are going to be changed is just that, it's a small nuance. I think we're all going to stay within the
confines of a general Basel oversight created out of the institutions across the country that have a voice and then
America being probably the loudest.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Okay, thank you very much.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Thanks, Nancy.
