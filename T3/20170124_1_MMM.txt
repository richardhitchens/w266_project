actual results to differ from our predictions.
Please turn to slide four and I'll hand off to Inge. Inge?
Inge G. Thulin
Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I will begin my remarks with a recap of the
fourth quarter, and later in the call, I will provide some comments on our full year performance.
Our team had a good finish to 2016 as we delivered double-digits growth in earnings per share along with strong
margins and a robust cash flow. We also continued to position 3M for the future through our three key levers, while
returning significant cash to our shareholders.
With respect to EPS, we posted earnings of $1.88 per share, an increase of more than 13% year-over-year. Total sales
across our enterprise was $7.3 billion, up slightly versus last year's Q4. Organic growth companywide was 2%, with
three of our five business groups delivering positive organic growth.
As I indicated in our October earnings call, organic growth in Industrial turned positive in the fourth quarter. This
business had a strong finish to the year with 5% organic growth, which was broad based across the portfolio.
Safety & Graphics posted 2% organic growth, with a good performance from personal safety, one of our heartland
businesses as well as from roofing granules.
As we expected, organic growth in Health Care was similar to the third quarter at 1.3%. We expect Health Care to
regain its momentum as we move further into 2017 and as our additional growth investments begin to pay off.
Organic growth in Consumer was down 1%. While this business experienced positive point-of-sales across its retail
customers, it was negatively impacted by inventory reductions throughout the retail industry.
Electronics & Energy closed out the year with another quarter of sequential improvement, posting organic growth that
was down just slightly, while once again expanding its operating margins.
Looking at margins across our entire company, we delivered another strong broad-based performance. Margins was up
more than 200 basis points to nearly 23%, ranging from 30% in Health Care to 21% in Safety & Graphics. At the same
time, we generated healthy cash flow, with a free cash flow conversion rate of 154%.
Our strong and consistent cash flow enable us to invest in the business, while also return significant cash to our
shareholders. And in the fourth quarter, we returned $1.6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share
repurchases.
In summary, we had a good finish to 2016 and I will now turn the call over to Nick, who will take you through the
details. Nick?
Nicholas C. Gangestad
Thank you, Inge. Let's begin with slide five, where I will break down the fourth quarter change in sales. Organic local
currency sales grew 1.6% in the quarter, with organic volume up 1.5%, and selling prices up 0.1%. Divestitures
reduced sales by 0.4 percentage points. This impact relates to the divestitures of non-strategic businesses, further
evidence of our ongoing portfolio prioritization and focus on our best opportunities.

Finally, foreign currency translation reduced sales by 0.8 percentage points. Considering all factors, fourth quarter sales
in U.S. dollars increased 0.4% versus last year.
On a geographic basis, U.S. organic growth increased 1.2%, led by a mid single digit performance in Industrial. Health
Care and Safety & Graphics businesses also grew organically in Q4.
Turning to Asia-Pacific. Organic growth was up 2.4%, with Health Care and Consumer leading the way. This growth
was partially offset by a decline in Electronics & Energy during the quarter. Within Asia-Pacific, organic growth
increased 6% in China/Hong Kong and 3% in Japan. Excluding our Electronics businesses, China/Hong Kong was up
11% and Japan grew 2% organically.
EMEA organic growth declined 2.4%. West Europe was down 1%, as growth in Safety & Graphics and Industrial was
more than offset by declines in our other business groups.
Central East Europe and Middle East Africa declined mid-single-digit year-on-year, impacted by ongoing challenges in
Saudi Arabia and Turkey, which we expect to persist in the near term.
Finally, Latin America/Canada was our fastest growing area, with organic local currency growth of 4.1%. We saw solid
growth in four of our five businesses, led by high single digit growth in Health Care.
At a country level, Mexico delivered strong double digit growth, while Canada was up 3%, and Brazil increased 1%.
Please turn to slide six for the fourth quarter P&L highlights. Companywide fourth quarter sales were $7.3 billion and
we generated earnings of $1.88 per share, a Q4 record. GAAP operating margins were 22.7%, up 220 basis points
year-on-year, which we delivered while making incremental strategic investments of $50 million to drive future sales
and profit growth. On the right hand side of this slide, you'll see the components of our margin performance.
Starting with the benefits. Price and raw materials combined increased margins 50 basis points versus Q4 of 2015.
Market prices for many raw materials were once again favorable year-on-year and our global sourcing team continues
to deliver savings above market. Core price growth was down slightly in the quarter, as we took targeted actions to
drive organic volume growth.
Moving to restructuring, you may recall that in the fourth quarter of 2015, we announced a restructuring plan to
enhance our competitiveness and productivity. The associated benefit from this action boosted fourth quarter 2016
operating margins by 40 basis points year-on-year, in addition to the positive comp related to the Q4 2015 charge itself.
Pension and OPEB expense declined year-on-year, as has been the case throughout 2016. This increased Q4 margins
by 90 basis points. Organic volume and utilization was neutral to margins in the quarter, a marked improvement versus
the headwinds we experienced through the first three quarters of 2016. Improved organic volume growth was a factor
in this improvement, particularly in our Industrial and Electronics & Energy businesses.
Turning now to headwinds. Foreign currency impacts net of hedge gains decreased margins by 20 basis points in Q4.
Legal and other reduced margins by 30 basis points in the quarter, primarily due to higher year-on-year costs from legal
settlements. Incremental strategic investments lowered margins by 70 basis points in the quarter.
As we indicated during our December outlook meeting, we are increasing investments in a number of core platforms to
accelerate growth in 2017 and beyond. At the same time, we continued to take actions in Q4 to better optimize our
global manufacturing footprint, improve service to our customers, and drive ongoing productivity.
Finally, while you don't see it on this chart, Q4 Corporate and Unallocated costs were higher than anticipated, largely
due to the aforementioned legal costs. For the full year 2017, we anticipate Corporate and Unallocated costs will be in
the range of $225 million to $275 million.
Let's now turn to slide seven for a look at earnings per share. Fourth quarter GAAP earnings increased 13.3% to $1.88
per share. As you see, a number of factors impacted our earnings. Growth and margin expansion added $0.16 to per
share earnings in the quarter. Acquisitions and divestitures increased earnings by $0.04 per share, driven by gains on
the divestiture of the PolyMask business within Industrial, along with the sale of non-core intellectual property in

Electronics & Energy.
Foreign currency impacts net of hedging reduced pre-tax earnings by $18 million, or the equivalent of $0.02 per share.
Higher balance sheet leverage led to an increase in net interest expense year-on-year, reducing per share earnings by
$0.02.
Our fourth quarter and full year tax rate came in lower than we had projected due to a combination of increased
benefits from our supply chain Centers of Expertise, along with improved geographic profit mix. The fourth quarter tax
rate was 28.2% versus 29% in last year's fourth quarter, which increased earnings by $0.02 per share.
Finally, average diluted shares outstanding declined 2% year-over-year, which added $0.04 to fourth quarter EPS.
Please turn to slide eight for a look at our cash flow performance. Fourth quarter operating cash flow was $2.2 billion.
Free cash flow conversion was 154% in Q4 and 104% for the full year. For the third consecutive year, free cash flow
conversion exceeded 100%. In the fourth quarter, we invested $436 million in CapEx, bringing our full year investment
to $1.4 billion. For 2017, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion.
Also in the fourth quarter, we returned $1.6 billion to shareholders via dividends and gross share repurchases. For the
full year 2016, we returned $6.4 billion to shareholders, including cash dividends of $2.7 billion and gross share
repurchases of $3.7 billion. For 2017, we expect gross share repurchases in the range of $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion.
Let's now review our business group performance starting with Industrial on slide nine. Industrial posted Q4 sales of
$2.5 billion, leading the company with organic growth of 4.6%. Our automotive OEM business led Industrial,
delivering strong double-digit growth, continuing its consistent track record of outpacing growth in global car and light
truck builds. Advanced materials, automotive aftermarket and our separation and purification business, all posted solid
mid single digit growth year-on-year.
On a geographic basis, Industrial's organic growth was broad-based across all regions, with mid single digit growth in
Latin America/Canada, the U.S., and Asia-Pacific, while EMEA was up low single digits. The Industrial business
delivered strong operating income of $553 million in the quarter, with margins up 260 basis points to 21.9%. The
margin improvement was driven by the gain on sale of PolyMask, past restructuring actions and ongoing productivity
improvements.
Please turn to slide 10. Safety & Graphics delivered another good quarter, with fourth quarter sales up 2.2% organically
to $1.3 billion. Our personal safety business posted solid mid single digit organic growth in Q4. This included double
digit growth in China/Hong Kong, where we continue to experience strong end market demand for our personal safety
solutions. The roofing granules business delivered another solid quarter of high single digit growth, which capped off a
consistently strong year.
On a geographic basis, Safety & Graphics growth was led by Asia-Pacific and Latin America/Canada, which were up
mid single digits.
You may recall in December, we announced the sale of our identity management business. We continued to expect the
divestiture will be completed sometime during the first half of 2017. Safety & Graphics operating income was $270
million in the quarter, and operating margins decreased 100 basis points to 20.8%. Adjusting for the divestiture gains
and restructuring charges that occurred in Q4 of 2015, operating margins increased 120 basis points year-on-year.
Please turn to Slide 11. Our Health Care business generated fourth quarter sales of $1.4 billion. Organic growth was up
1.3%, in line with our expectations. Health Care growth was led by a double digit increase in food safety, followed by
solid growth in both drug delivery systems and medical consumables. Organic growth in oral care was down slightly,
as the business continued to be impacted by soft end market conditions and channel inventory adjustments.
Health information systems also declined organically year-on-year, due to a slower rate of software installations in a
tougher market over the past year, along with the challenging comp against last year's record Q4. Looking ahead, our
customer pipeline is strong. Therefore, we expect growth in health information systems to accelerate throughout 2017.

On a geographic basis, Health Care delivered high single digit growth in Asia-Pacific, with particular strength in
China/Hong Kong, which was up double digits. Latin America/Canada and the U.S. also posted positive organic
growth in the quarter.
Health Care's operating income was $410 million, and margins remained strong at 29.8%. Importantly, we generated
these returns while investing an additional $30 million to enhance growth in core platforms across the business.
Next, let's cover Electronics & Energy on Slide 12. Fourth quarter sales for Electronics & Energy were $1.2 billion,
down 0.6% organically. Organic sales growth was flat in our Electronics related businesses, an improvement over
recent quarters, as end market conditions and channel inventories became more stable.
As we explained at our outlook meeting in December, we are gaining penetration with leading electronics OEMs in
China and also investing to capitalize on the rapid growth in automotive electronics.
Our Energy related businesses declined 2% organically, with growth in our telecom business more than offset by
declines in electrical markets and renewable energy. As a reminder, at the end of 2015, we exited our back sheet
business in renewable energy, which reduced energy-related organic sales by 3.5% in Q4 of 2016.
On a geographic basis, sales in Latin America/Canada grew organically in the low single digits, while Asia-Pacific and
EMEA declined.
Electronics & Energy delivered a strong operational quarter with operating income of $326 million, and margins of
26.9%, up 10.3 percentage points year-on-year. The year-on-year improvement was driven by a few factors that
impacted Q4 margins in both 2015 and 2016.
First, in Q4 of 2015, we incurred charges related to portfolio and restructuring actions, which reduced fourth quarter
2015 margins by 340 basis points. Second, in the fourth quarter of 2016, the business realized a gain from divesting
non-core intellectual property which added 270 basis points to Q4 2016 margins. Adjusting for these items, Q4 margins
increased year-on-year by approximately 400 basis points. Looking at the full year, operating margins were 22.3%, up
120 basis points year-on-year.
I'll finish with our Consumer business on Slide 13. Fourth quarter sales in Consumer were $1.1 billion. And as Inge
mentioned, growth was impacted by channel inventory reductions in the U.S. and to a lesser extent, West Europe. So
from a pure sell-in perspective, our fourth quarter organic growth was down 0.7%.
On the other hand, from a point-of-sale or sellout perspective, our Q4 growth was positive and in line with our
historical trends. So we expect Consumer's organic growth will be back to more normal historical levels during the first
quarter.
Despite these channel adjustments, we posted positive worldwide organic growth in three of our four businesses;
namely, home improvement, consumer health care and home care. The stationery and office supply business, which
was most impacted by channel adjustments, declined year-on-year.
Looking at Consumer geographically, growth was led by a mid single digit increase in Asia-Pacific, while the U.S. was
flat and EMEA declined year-on-year.
Consumer's operating income was $228 million, with operating margins of 20.9%. Margins were down year-on-year
for two primary reasons. One, we rationalized one of our manufacturing sites during the quarter. And two, the business
accelerated growth investments in the quarter.
We continue to see good opportunities to invest and drive growth within the portfolio. In fact, we increased investments
in Q4 in our category-leading Command and Filtrete product lines. Both posted double digit organic growth in the U.S.
this past holiday season.
That wraps up our review of fourth quarter results. Please turn to Slide 14 and I'll hand it back over to Inge for some
final comments before Q&A. Inge?

Inge G. Thulin
Thank you, Nick. The fourth quarter capped a successful year for our enterprise, as we executed a playbook and
delivered a strong operational performance. We increased our earnings per share by 8%.
Margins were up more than 100 basis points to 24%, with four of our five business groups posting margin expansion.
In addition, we delivered free cash flow conversion of 104%, which is our third consecutive year above 100%. And for
the fourth straight year, our return on invested capital was above 20%, coming in at 23% this year. And we achieved all
of this in a year of flat growth.
As you can see, we are executing well and controlling what we can control. 2016 was also a notable year with respect
to our dividend, as we marked 3M's 100 consecutive year of paying dividends to our shareholders. For the full year,
when we combine dividends and share repurchases, we returned a total of $6.4 billion to our shareholders.
Beyond financial results, we continued to build for the future two or three key levers, which are significant value
creators for us. Let me start with Portfolio Management, an ongoing process that is all about strengthening and focusing
our portfolio, which improves our competitiveness and make us more relevant to our customers. These includes
consolidations within 3M along with divestiture of non-core businesses, and we're active in both fronts in 2016.
Portfolio Management is benefiting our customers and 3M, as we now have greater scale and are able to better
prioritize our resources. This includes growth investments and at our December outlook meeting we highlighted an
incremental $100 million we are investing to accelerate growth in our core platforms.
We will now move onto the second lever, Investing in Innovation. In 2016, we invested $1.7 billion or nearly 6% of
sales in research and development, which is the heart beat of our company. This supports both our short and long-term
growth objectives, along with our premium margins of return on invested capital. Last year, we also celebrated opening
of a new laboratory in St. Paul, while earning more than 3,000 patents around the world.
Business Transformation is the third lever, which starts and ends with our customers. Last year, we continued to make
good progress with the rollout of our ERP system in West Europe, which is nearly complete. Within West Europe, we
have now deployed in 11 countries our four largest distribution centers and our supply chain Center of Expertise.
Globally, we now have a total of 16 countries live and a new ERP system, and our three global service centers are also
up and running. We are already beginning to realize productivity gains from Business Transformation, which will
increase in 2017 and beyond. By 2020, it will result in $500 million to $700 million in annual operational savings, and
another $0.5 billion reduction in working capital.
Looking upon our performance in 2016, the 3M playbook is working. From an operational perspective, we are
executing well and delivering premium returns. At the same time, we continued to make investment that will enable us
to capitalize as growth conditions improve. As a result, we are positioned to build on our momentum and deliver
another strong performance in 2017.
Please turn to Slide 15. Here you see our planning estimates for the year, which are unchanged from December outlook
meeting. We estimate earnings per share in the range of $8.45 to $8.80, an increase of 4% to 8%. Organic growth is
expected to be 1% to 3% and we anticipate another good cash flow performance with a conversion rate of 95% to
105%.
With that, I thank you for your attention and we will now take your questions.

<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Hi. Good morning, guys.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Scott.
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Good morning, Scott.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: When I look at my list of companies at least, you guys tend to be obviously about as global as
anybody gets and have a pretty broad supply chain. And so my question is, how do you plan spending when even 2017
– how do you plan spending when you don't have a real great sense of tariffs and trade and how all that could be
disrupted in the next couple of years? Does it play into the planning at all? Or do you just continue on?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Well, as you know – hey, good morning by the way.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Good morning.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: As you know, we are laying out very much a localization strategy in terms of our business with
all subsidiaries around the world. So at this point in time, we continue to lay out the plan as we have talked about. We
are making investment in what we see the most important businesses for us to grow both in United States and overseas
based on that strategy, right? So, by definition, even if we have both global customers and local customers, we need to
make the investment based on what they are and where they are going.
And I would say that when I look upon this quarter specifically, there is some very interesting movements, I think,
coming back a little bit to historic performance relative to growth. We had about 1% growth in developed markets, but
we had 3% in developing markets. So there is type of a movement going also coming back in the developing
economies, which is interesting. And as you heard Nick said, you take China, China was 6% organic local currency
growth all-in, excluding Electronic was 11%.
And when you look upon our five businesses, in China specifically, it was fantastic growth for all of them. We have
Safety & Graphics grow almost 20%; Consumer, 17%; Health Care, 15% and Industrial, 12%. So we need to continue
to invest based on the growth in those segments. So we don't make a change at this point in time relative to the
planning for the year. And as we said in December, we are adding another $100 million this year in order to accelerate
commercialization of products.
But I would say, generally speaking, it's early in the year, as we know, but I saw some trends here that are positive
relative to growth coming. Right. You saw Industrial business group almost 5% growth, and it was broad-based all over
the world. They grew in every geographical area around the world. So very encouraging as I look upon it. And for
Germany, they had positive growth for the third consecutive quarter for us. So I feel more positive as we move into
2017 even if it's early.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Just a quick follow up. When you guys think about – I've never asked this question before. I
don't know why I haven't. But is there such a thing as book-to-bill in Electronics & Energy, or is it too short cycle for
that?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Once again, can you repeat the question?
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Sure. Is there such a thing as like a book-to-bill or something like that in Electronics & Energy
where you can get a sense of which quarter of this year coming up you turn into positive territory? I'm trying to – I
don't know, again, why I've never asked that question before, but I don't think you've ever referenced it. Just trying to
get a sense of which quarter you might see positive growth in E&E...
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Yeah, Scott, let me take that one. We don't have a formal metric that we're measuring
on a book-to-bill ratio in our Electronics business. It is a fairly short cycle. We're working with all of our customers
there to be projecting what the demands are in the future. But unlike some other industries, this is not one where we
have a book-to-bill ratio.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay. That's what I thought, but I had to ask. Thank you, guys, and good luck to you.

Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Julian Mitchell>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Good morning, Julian.
<Q - Julian Mitchell>: Good morning. Just a question firstly on the Consumer business. I don't recall you talking
about the slowdown much at the mid-December meeting. So I wondered if it was something – the inventory reduction
was something that became apparent sort of very late on. And is there any color you could give around sort of days or
weeks of excess inventory in those channels today?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Julian, as far as the Consumer business and the trends we saw throughout the fourth
quarter, much of this differential we saw between sell-in and sell-out occurred in December and in particular, in the last
half of December. In regards to inventory, we don't really see the channel as having excess inventory now. We consider
it a fairly normal inventory channel level in our Consumer channels.
<Q - Julian Mitchell>: Thanks. And then if we look at the margin bridge, it was sort of curious a little bit that the
utilization piece and organic volume was not a contributor. It was flat even though the sales growth performance was
actually pretty good. Was there anything unusual in Q4 that weighed on that specific line in margins that meant the
operating leverage was not as high as it could or should have been?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Yeah, Julian, that's – and I'll just put it in perspective. We've had that particular item
being noticeably negative on our margin for the first three quarters of this year and getting that to be neutral for us for
the fourth quarter with our 1.5% volume, that's the main thing that happened for us in the fourth quarter. There isn't
some particular headwind buried in there. But it was for us a notable trend change from where we've been the first three
quarters.
<Q - Julian Mitchell>: And do you still feel good about the $0.10 to $0.20 of EPS accretion in 2017 from utilization?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Yes, we do, Julian. That component of our EPS walk, as well as every other line we're
still feeling very confident in right now, Julian.
<Q - Julian Mitchell>: Great. Thank you.

<Q - Andrew Kaplowitz>: Hey. Good morning, guys.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Andrew.
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Hi, Andrew.
<Q - Andrew Kaplowitz>: So just to follow-up on Industrial. We know you have significant short-cycle exposure
within Industrial and you did have easier comparisons in the quarter. But I think that said, growth sort of jumped pretty
meaningfully. Maybe you could give us some more color on how much of the improvement was maybe the Energy
component within advanced materials looking less bad, or we know you had the big defense contract ramping up
within advanced materials, versus the rest of the Industrial business improving. And then how do you feel about your
1% to 3% growth forecast now for 2017, given you put up over 4% in 4Q?

<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Well, yes, first of all, it was broad-based growth in Industrial, both in terms of the businesses
and in terms of the geographical area. So there was not one specific business that type of stood out in terms of growth.
Even if you saw, Nick comment on the – again, again the fantastic performance for the automotive OEM business, but
it was broad-based. And it's coming back, I would say a little bit as we have talked about earlier in terms of evolution
of economies. And I think you see now as becoming more output from manufacturing around the world, we are very
early in that process. And if you look upon PMI, United States had a PMI of 54.7 in the quarter; China, 51.4; and
Germany, 55.6. So you think about that in terms of big economies, that will help us as we move forward. And as I said,
it was broad-based.
Now to your second question, how we then feel about 1% to 3% for the year as we came out 5%, feel good. Feel good.
Too early to change that as we sit here today. But generally speaking, I would say feel good about Industrial
businesses. And if you think about in terms of size, this is one-third of 3M. And when we start to get good momentum
in that business, that's helping us a lot, right. So you saw they had good growth, and we talked about that on the last
earnings call that they will grow in Q4 and they did and so it's very good. But I said that's too early to change anything
as we move into the year, right. So let's see after first quarter how we position it.
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Hey, Andy, well just one more detail on that I'll share. We've been talking about this
for a quarter or two that we have some defense contracts we were awarded. And those shipments were going on in the
fourth quarter. Our body-armor shipments added about 150 basis points to the total Industrial organic growth in Q4. So
stripping that out, the core underlying is right around 300 basis points of growth.
<Q - Andrew Kaplowitz>: Okay, Nick. That's helpful. And then, Nick, maybe you've talked about 3M's ability to
achieve, I believe it's 30 basis points to 50 basis points of price versus costs in 2017. You obviously did 50 basis points
in 4Q. But pricing in the U.S. continues to look competitive; it was a bit worse in 4Q than it was in 3Q. You mentioned
sort of going after some additional organic growth. Can you talk about 3M's ability to offset a pretty competitive U.S.
pricing environment with the better sourcing, and with the help of business transformation that you talked about, are
you still confident in positive price versus costs contributing to that $0.20 to $0.50 of organic local currency growth
that you have?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Yeah, Andy, there's a lot of subjects you hit there in one question. As far as the
underlying price growth in the U.S., what we see in our view is our fundamental pricing power is not changing. It's still
very strong. We did in the case of the U.S. take some targeted actions to help drive organic volume growth for us. Also
for the total company – and this is going outside the U.S. – this is a quarter where we saw less pricing actions related to
FX movements. And you see that with our – and that's down noticeably from where we've been in the first three
quarters of this year. So all-in for 2017 we're still expecting the positive core price growth in the U.S. and globally.
Now to the other parts of it, our ability to use sourcing to continue to add to our earnings and to our margin, I laid out a
month ago that we expect between $0.10 and $0.15 of EPS accretion through our sourcing effort and everything we're
seeing now we see that on track. Much of that is being driven not by just pure market prices, but it's now being driven
by our own efforts to be substituting raw materials and taking advantage of our negotiation power.

<Q - Joe Ritchie>: And congrats on the 100 years of paying consecutive dividend. Not a lot of companies can claim

you had some product introductions in the quarter. But you also still have some headwinds on oral care. And I'm just

curious given the headwind is also potentially from the ACA, I'm just wondering, like, what gives you kind of the
confidence that you could really see the momentum pick up as we progress through 2017?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Well, first of all, most of our businesses are doing very well, all right. So food safety is still
growing very well. Drug delivery system did well as well. And then consumables in medical space did well. So if you
take that together, right, there is underlying momentum in the business. We have invested quite a bit in this business for
some time and we stepped it up and they have had big investment starting already second half of 2016. And that now
we'll start to generate growth coming into Q2 and Q3 for the year. And the pipeline, as Nick comment on, the pipeline
for health information system is very strong. So yes, slowed down a little bit in terms of execution and deployment of
those softwares into the hospitals, but the pipeline is very, very strong.
So I will say that when you think about it, generally speaking, we know that with investment in the areas we invest in
Health Care which is around coverage, is around health economics and it's about some research and development.
Specifically, the coverage will pay off rather sooner than later. And, again, we see that the developing economies are
starting to pick up for us. So the confidence is high that we will see the growth coming as we move into 2017.
<Q - Joe Ritchie>: Okay. And then maybe my follow-up question and getting back to price costs for a second. Nick,
maybe talk a little bit about the fact we – it looks like you got about 10 basis points or so on pricing this quarter. We're
moving into more of a kind of commodity reflating environment. And so how does that dynamic going to work as we
progress through 2017 on your ability to continue to get price?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Yeah, Joe, the total posted 10 basis points, if we strip out the FX portion of that, and
then we're looking at flat to down very slightly of core underlying there. As I look at how this progresses throughout
the year, we actually have a pretty steady view throughout the year, Joe, of it not changing much, of just having our
core underlying price growth often in that 30 basis points to 50 basis points. I think the wildcard on there is FX. The
dollar's been moving a lot and that as far as what we post for price growth in the quarters will be volatile in the coming
quarters with some volatility based on what happens with the U.S. dollar primarily in developing markets.
<Q - Joe Ritchie>: Okay. Okay. Got you. Thank you very much.

<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Thanks, and good morning, all.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Steve.
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Morning, Steve.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Hey. Just on – back to the pricing questions. Specifically you mentioned targeted actions
that you took in the U.S. to drive some volume. Can you give us a little more color on what segments you were talking
about, what areas?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Yeah, Steve, it's in particularly isolated places. There's some places in our Consumer
business, where we took actions like that, also in our Industrial business. Those are the most common places where we
took those types of targeted actions, Steve.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay. And was the trigger for that kind of thing competitive actions, was it particular
projects? I'm just trying to get a sense for kind of implications for the broader pricing power in those businesses.
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Steve, we take those actions when we see an opportunity either in the competitive
landscape to take share that we otherwise wouldn't have, or in some cases it's a reaction to where we see pricing
pressure from competitors and we price accordingly to maintain some of the share. So it's sum of both, Steve.

<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay. And then just a more specific question on E&E. Can you just give a little more
sense in display material systems how much was OLED impact to this quarter and what the other kind of impact
besides OLED was?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: The OLED impact, just to put it in perspective, last December when Jim Bauman was
laying out the OLED impact that we felt that would have on 2017 sales, he put a range between $50 million and $150
million of impact. We saw a number impact for total year 2016 right in the middle of that range. And for the fourth
quarter, I would call it very similar to that of – in the $20 million to $30 million range of impact on our total revenue.
Steve, that's the OLED impact on what we're seeing in the Electronics & Energy business.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay. And any major offsets to that?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Yeah. As I mentioned, we are targeting to be increasing our penetration in some of the
OEMs in China, Electronics OEMs in China, and we're seeing some success there. We're also targeting growth in
automotive electronics, and we're also seeing some successes there as well.

Our next question comes from the line of John Inch of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Thanks, everyone. Good morning.
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Hey, John.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, John.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Nick, how did the – hi, Inge. How did the dental business do sequentially? I don't remember you
talking about that when you were describing the puts and takes in Health Care performance. It was under pressure,
right, in the third quarter? Did you see similar trend in the fourth quarter?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Yeah, John, we saw our oral care business down slightly partly from softening end-user
demand and also what we see as continued channel contractions in the oral care business.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Do you have any sense of the underlying – so it's one thing if it's one quarter, because sometimes
dental is seen as a little bit of a canary in a coal mine right for the economy. But now the economy, based on your own
commentary and what other companies are saying, seem to be picking up. So what do you attribute then I suppose the
continuation of the soft dental, like is there a way you could sort of frame what you've seen and maybe provide some
historical context?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah. I think what you saw here in the last quarter – this is Inge – what you saw in the last
quarter of the year, basically two things is, inventory reduction in this channel because it's very much distribution
oriented. And that's based on lower demand in the end market. And I think that was broad-based relative to United
States and West Europe.
Now if you think about both in Consumer and you think about the business like oral care, the supply chain there is very
sophisticated. So what we have to look upon is sell-in and sellout. And I think in those cases what you will see as
demand will, by definition, should go up, and I think facts are telling us that in that industry in oral care, then they will
build up inventory again as you go into the year. But for us, we look upon those businesses. They are very good
partners of us and they are very professional, very, very professional in the supply chain. So they do the right thing in
terms of adjusting their level of inventory if they see a softness. What they are telling us now is, they see demand
coming back as you roll into 2017.
If you move from oral care and go back – and I was not sure that came across. If you take our Consumer business that
was down 1% in terms of sell-in from us, sell-out on our top customers in U.S. was 3%. And 3% that's the historical

base for Consumer for the last couple of years. So from that perspective, I think the retail channel as they saw maybe
some softness for them, generally speaking in the end of the holiday season they did the right thing. They just managed
through their inventory. And for me that's a very professional way of doing business. Our sell-out was the same
indicating for me as we move into 2017 that inventories will be filled back because the demand is there in the end
market. But I think they did the right thing in terms of the retail channels.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Well I certainly gave away your products as Christmas gifts, so don't blame me.

<Q - John G. Inch>: Yes. Yeah, bigger gift bags. Okay.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Just as a follow-up, you mentioned divesting non-core IP in the Electronics & Energy business.
Nick or Inge, could you expand on this, like what exactly is this? And do you have like this reserve of IP that in theory
you could keep divesting to take gains or was this a one-off event? Or just a little more context on what ultimately
happened in that segment, please.
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: John, I think of this as much more of a one-off. There was a particular set of IP that we
had developed and were using years ago. We reached a point where we felt we no longer needed it for our own
business and we were licensing that IP. We chose in fourth quarter to sell that IP and our relationship with that
particular IP we had in Electronics & Energy. To your question of, is it a broad thing that we have a stable of these
we're ready to go with, the short answer is no.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Okay. And then when you say it wasn't core, is there anything you can say about the IP you sold,
like what was it for? Or is it pertaining to anything you downsized or something?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: No. It's something related to our Electronic Material Solutions division and that's about
as deep as I'll go with it. But it really is not related to anything we've divested.

Our next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy of Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Robert McCarthy>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning.
<Q - Robert McCarthy>: Yeah. I guess the first question is in terms of just thinking about your overall explicit
exposure to Energy and kind of the wider implications [ph] and knock on effects (53:20) of your portfolio to Energy,
given what we've seen in the downturn, have you seen any encouraging trends across your businesses that you'd cite to
say with a stabilization in Energy prices you could start to see incremental growth in the back half of this year? Could
you just comment about what you're seeing across your portfolio with respect to that?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah. I think first of all, the answer is yes, we should see an uptick in the end of 2017 in the
Energy space. And we have a very strong solid business into utilities, right. That's a core 3M business. And the fact is,
it's a heartland division. That division will do well. What they have is they have an element of some project-based
businesses. We had talked earlier about ACCR and some pipe coating as well. That had type of a negative effect in
terms of comparison for 2016 and should benefit that business as you move into 2017. The other business that we had a
good quarter here is actually communication, what you will call telecommunication. But communication had a good
quarter for us with 10% growth. It's a smaller business for us, but we did well. So I think the Energy space for us

should improve as we move into 2017.
<Q - Robert McCarthy>: How do we think about the offsets in association with just kind of price costs and raws in
the context of that though?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Rob, as we contemplated where we see our raw material pricing going in 2017, we
took a view of oil in the range of somewhere between $50 and $60 a barrel and that's why we're seeing diminished
impact from market prices on our commodities benefiting us in 2017 versus what we've seen in 2015 and 2016. So
we're anticipating that and taking that into account. Most of our raw material or commodity benefits we're seeing are
going be the result of 3M efforts we're doing to take costs or substitute in lower commodities. So there is an offset there
and we think we've pretty accurately taken the offset on both the revenue side and the cost side into account.
<Q - Robert McCarthy>: And one final one. I mean, obviously, I don't think you provide or disclose where your
CapEx is spent explicitly, although, obviously, anecdotally you do. But just looking at kind of the typical Note 17 in
your 10-Ks, you can kind of see a flavor of where your PP&E is. It's disproportionate in the U.S. unsurprisingly. And
obviously, the PP&E has been growing reasonably well in the U.S. while it's been relatively flat, I would say across the
balance of the portfolio. But could you comment on explicitly your CapEx kind of strategy for the U.S.? Any kind of
metrics you could use? And really, the spirit of the question is, obviously, with the prospect of a change in the tax law
in association with the deduction of capital expenditures in the U.S. potentially, that's the nature of what I'm asking
about.
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Rob, as you look at our total of CapEx, we spent $1.4 billion on CapEx in 2016. A
little more than half of that was spent in the United States. And it goes into a number of things, Rob. It goes into some
of our business transformation investments. It goes into maintaining our capital base. We, of all the areas of the world,
the U.S., we have a very well developed capital base of manufacturing sites and investing in CapEx to maintain that.
Also some expansion in the United States that we've been investing in.
So a little over half of it. Around the world, though, Rob, we are investing in capital, as Inge started out this morning
talking about, we're investing in capital to align with where our customers are and aligning demand. So where we've
been in the last few years we've seen a little less international demand and a little higher U.S. demand and that has
impacted our capital allocation. And going forward, we still anticipate a significant amount of our capital, for the next
year or two, I wouldn't be surprised that it's going maintain being over 50% in the U.S.

<Q - Nigel Coe>: Yeah, just of the investment spending, picked up this quarter relative to 3Q. So just wondering if
maybe you can be a bit more granular in terms of where you're spending. And in particular, you referred to some price
actions to drive volumes, particularly in the U.S. Would that fall under investment spending?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: I'll take the last part of that first, Nigel. The changes in pricing that I talked about, that
would not be part of investment spending. What is included in our strategic investment spending that we called out
that's impacting our margin by 70 basis points this quarter, there's two components. One is us taking actions on
addressing our manufacturing supply chain footprint that we laid out last March at our five-year outlook meeting, that
we've been taking actions and that is part of what occurred in the fourth quarter.
But also what's in that is investments we're making in growth in core platforms within 3M. And that was part of what
we also laid out in December of – in 2017, we're accelerating our investments of approximately $100 million in these

core growth platforms. We started that investment in the fourth quarter of 2016, and that makes up a little over half of
the total of that strategic investments that we laid out for fourth quarter in our margin.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. No, that's helpful. Thanks, Nick. And then a follow-on question on FX. We've seen a fair
amount of divergence in the currency pairs, the key currency pairs, RMB weaker, the real's stronger. How is that
impacting the translation impact – how is that impacting your margins? And the spirit of the question is my
understanding is that your EMs are generally higher margin than DMs. Is that still the case? And is there any
significant margin impact from translation of the currency movements?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Yeah, Nigel, what I've seen over time and what I'm seeing this quarter and into the
future is it's less impacted by that particular mix. How it impacts our margin more dramatically is actually our hedging.
And sometimes it becomes counterintuitive, Nigel, that when the dollar, when we start to have the dollar stronger and
negative impacts on our earnings per share from a stronger dollar, we can for a period of time see higher margins as our
hedging gains step in and boost that margin. We have lower sales dollars from the translation but higher margins. That's
been a more impactful factor on overall margins we post than the mix of where the currencies are strengthening or
weakening against the U.S. dollar.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Right. Okay. I'll follow up offline. Thank you very much.

<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Morning, guys.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Shannon.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Hey. So you – at 1.6%, I mean you're already kind of getting close to the midpoint of
the organic guide for the year. And you've got Health Care clearly way below what you would normally expect to be at
and Consumer is negative. It seems like you feel pretty good about Industrial continuing to be strong. So are there any
other offsets here because it would seem that you'd be tracking closer to the higher end of that organic guide, all else
equal, unless there's something you would expect to slow.
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: For 2017, Shannon, the 1% to 3%, we're still right there. Yes, we like the fact where
we ended in Q4 from an organic growth. But it's also in line with what we were anticipating in total, and it's in line with
where we felt we needed to be for the 1% to 3% that we guided for 2017.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: And we won't like to go ahead of ourself, right? So we – I think it's important just to make sure
that we roll into the year and see more evidence of the positive movement we saw here in the end. But as you said, the
investment we are doing, the oil initiative we have around growth, right? Because you look upon 3M as you see it now,
the efficiency in this organization is incredible. And you see what we do in terms of EPS growth, free cash flow
conversion, return on invested capital. If we can get growth up even more, that will get a very good return for all of us.
So that's why we focus in on it and make sure that we will execute on that. But we will not over-promise anything to
you at this point in time.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Thanks. And then just on Mexico, I mean you talked about – I think you said
double-digit growth there again this quarter. 3M's always been good at kind of monitoring and managing through
different kind of global risk areas. I mean what's your current view there? Are you seeing any change in activity? And
do you do any kind of scenario planning around your position there in particular?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: No, we don't. We have had very strong growth in Mexico for quite some time. And it is an
important local market for us, right? We have been there for many, many years in Latin America. Again, Latin
America, generally speaking have very good growth rate for this quarter and we have been in that part of the world
with our domestic business since 1946, right? We start the operation in Brazil, 1946. We have huge operations there
and it's very much locally driven. And that is our strategy. So 10% growth in Mexico in the quarter is a good result.

Brazil had 1%, so it looked like they're coming back a little bit. But we are not changing anything. As I said, as I start
the call here, our strategy is around localization. And we – if you go back to what I talked about, we never left United
States. We expanded international based on the local market opportunity, right? So I think that's how you should view
3M in the business model that we are using.

Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Jeffrey Todd Sprague>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Jeff.
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Jeff.
<Q - Jeffrey Todd Sprague>: Just a couple things. A lot of ground covered here. First, Nick, I was just wondering
back to the December guide, although the broad strokes have not changed. Are you within the range of all those
individual kind of bucket items that you gave us [ph] down through (01:05:31) pension, tax, et cetera, et cetera?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Jeff, yes. The short answer is yes. A couple I'll just put on the – I'll explain. Pension, I'd
originally guided $0 to $0.10 headwind. Now that the – we have that all locked in, that'll be an $0.08 headwind for the
year. And then on tax rate, since it ended a little lower, we're still seeing a 28% to 29% tax rate in 2017. At that – back
in December I was saying I expected it to be a little bit of a tailwind. It'll probably be more neutral for us for 2017 right
now.
<Q - Jeffrey Todd Sprague>: Okay. And also this is for Nick. Could you just update us on your stranded cash.
Probably all your cash is outside the U.S. or some 90%. But do you tap the brakes near term on share repurchase,
waiting to see if we get some kind of repatriation or something? Or do you kind of proceed as normal on the borrowing
and repurchase tempo you've been on?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Yeah, our total cash, Jeff, is – we have just a little over $2 billion of cash outside the
United States. It's not a large number. I'm sure you're aware of this, Jeff, we've been going through a number of efforts
to be optimizing our global cash position, and we've been managing that global cash balance down, especially our
international cash balance down. So our current capital allocation plan, we can execute that without any kind of tax
reform or any kind of action. And it's really too early for me to comment on if something were to happen of what we
do. We're obviously prepping and preparing and we'll act accordingly to take advantage of whatever kind of legislation
occurs, but I think it's too early for me to comment on how that would change our capital allocation right now.
<Q - Jeffrey Todd Sprague>: Thanks. And just finally, if you wouldn't mind, any color that you could share on
January? Has there been any kind of change in behavior as we slip into the new year, particularly in shorter cycle
industrial markets in particular would be of interest?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Yeah. Just as far as the year is starting, we're not seeing any kind of change in the
trajectory that we were anticipating. It's consistent with what we were expecting when we guided 1% to 3%, and
nothing really changing out of the norm for us, Jeff.
<Q - Jeffrey Todd Sprague>: Thank you very much.

Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Andrew Burris Obin>: Yes. Good morning.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Morning, Andrew.
<Q - Andrew Burris Obin>: I'll ask Jeff's question in a slightly different way about what you're seeing. Inge, I think
you said that there are reasons to get excited, and I was wondering if you could share any anecdotes, obviously without
changing the guidance, that makes you more excited?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah. As I said earlier, when you look upon it in terms of performance for this quarter and the
momentum you have seen after some time where there had been slower growth, right? But if you start to look upon
elements that look positive for you, for me that will be like we had a good quarter in United States, right. United States
grew 5% in the quarter. Japan grew 2% and China grew 11% excluding Electronic. Electronic again was 6%. And we
have had three consecutive quarters in Germany with growth.
If I look upon that and I think about big economies in the world, United States, Germany, Japan, China on the positive
movement forward, I feel better about that. I'm not overly excited because overall you also have some tempering in
Central East Europe and Middle East Africa and that will hold for some time. But I would say that, that's what I see. I
see – I saw Industrial business have a good growth, and then I take those geographical pieces together. Safety &
Graphics continue to have a solid performance. Health Care, I'm convinced will come back for us. And then as I said
on earlier, Consumer, when you look upon sell-in and sellout, it's not a concern.
But I think if you take for all of us, the bigger picture of growth coming in the two biggest economies in the world, then
you add Germany and Japan to that, if you are 3M, which is about technology conversion and demographics shift, they
look slightly better today than it did six to nine months ago.
<Q - Andrew Burris Obin>: Let me just ask a follow-up question. One of your competitors highlighted that they're
seeing a meaningful positive impact from the change in One China policy in China. What are you guys seeing in Health
Care and Consumer in China? Can you identify it? And does it provide any potential upside to your thinking for the
second half of the year?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: It should. It should by definition. And if you look upon those two businesses for us in China
specifically, we had 17% growth for Consumer in the quarter. We had 15% growth in Health Care for the quarter. And
that's a positive outcome. And those business – even if they are smaller for us, if you look upon our portfolio in China,
the two biggest in size for us is Electronics & Energy and Industrial, right, because of the evolution of that economy.
But what will come is Consumer and Health Care. So when you're running them at 15% to 17%, that's a good signal for
us. And we have a huge penetration opportunity there and they are both local domestic markets, right? So no export by
definition.
<Q - Andrew Burris Obin>: And you have the capacity to meet this demand?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Absolutely.
<Q - Andrew Burris Obin>: Thank you very much.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Thank you.

<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Good morning. Lots of questions to ask, just on kind of the forward look here into the
early part of the year. The Street has you guys EPS kind of flat year-over-year but normal seasonality from the fourth
quarter. If we adjust some of these gains et cetera out, gets you to something that's a little bit higher than that, in the
kind of $2.10-ish range. Is there anything unusual about the year-over-year comp that we should be keeping in mind for
the first quarter? Maybe just a little bit of color. I know that the Street basically has you guys flat, but they have you
growing for the year. So the trends out of the fourth quarter kind of change that view to make you feel a little bit better
about being able to grow earnings here in the first quarter?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Steve, for the quarters of 2017, I would call this a remarkably stable year of nothing
particular to call out quarter by quarter to be thinking about. The only thing on the margin that I – on the hedge that I'd
say is strategic investments that I talked about earlier that we started in Q4, those will be more heavily weighted in the
first part of the year. In fact, I expect strategic investments in first quarter to be very similar to what we saw in the
fourth quarter.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Okay. So you expect to grow earnings in every quarter essentially?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: I think, Steve, you're trying to turn me into a quarterly guider here. For the year,
we're...
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: It's a pretty vague question.
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: I'll just leave it...
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Okay.
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: We don't see a lot of differentiation of the core underlying business quarter-to-quarter.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Okay. So when you guys talk about strategic investment, that's, I would assume, outside
of R&D because R&D as a percentage of sales was I think down a little bit in the quarter. That's stuff that is not
considered just R&D I would assume?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Yeah, yeah. The vast majority – the very little of our strategic investments, if any, is
R&D. This is really about commercial – for the growth side of it, it's really about investments we're making in
commercializing what we already have.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Okay. Super. Thanks a lot.
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: And, Steve, just one more point. I'm going to repeat a point from December. Growth
we expect to be largely aligned for the year across most of our businesses, the one exception is Health Care. I just want
to remind you we expect Health Care growth to accelerate as the year goes on.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Okay. Thanks, Steve.

Thank you. To wrap up, the fourth quarter completed a successful year for our enterprise. In 2016, we executed our
playbook and posted strong financial results in terms of EPS and margins, along with free cash flow and return on
invested capital. At the same time, we continued to simplify our organization and improve our cost structure while
