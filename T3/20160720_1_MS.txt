MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Sharon Yeshaya
Good morning. This is Sharon Yeshaya, Head of Investor Relations. During today's presentation, we will refer to our
earnings release and financial supplement, copies of which are available at www.morganstanley.com.
Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause
actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP
measures that appear in the earnings release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our
consent.
I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman.
James Patrick Gorman
Hi. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us. I'll make a few brief introductory remarks, and then Jon would
take you through the numbers. And of course, we both, as always, look forward to your questions.
Our results this quarter reflect solid performance in an improved but obviously still relatively fragile environment. Our
team had several objectives coming into the quarter as follows: managing the uncertain macroeconomic environment,
continuing the momentum we're building in fixed income while preserving stability in our other businesses,
maintaining expense discipline, and obtaining approval for our capital plan under CCAR.
By and large, we met these objectives. And despite the overall lack of conviction in the market, we executed on our
strategic plan and performed well in the areas of traditional strength. We saw continued stability and progress in our

core businesses, with each performing roughly in line with expectations given the environment. We made particular
progress in fixed income and commodities where we generated approximately $1.3 billion in revenue, up significantly
from the first quarter. Jon would take you through each of our businesses in a moment.
On expenses, we remained focused on our cost discipline, both tactically and through Project Streamline. We're now a
simpler organization, and therefore must be leaner and more efficient in our spend. We discussed initiatives that are
currently underway last month at our financials conference and are pleased with Project Streamlines' progress to date.
Our ROE for the quarter was 8.3% and demonstrated progress towards our 2017 target. Finally, we received a
non-objection from the Federal Reserve on our 2016 capital plan. We believe this decision reflects the changes we
undertook, as well as our business mix stability. The approval enables us to increase our dividend to $0.20 per quarter
and a repurchase up to $3.5 billion in common stock over the next 12 months, commencing in the third quarter.
CCAR's outcome reinforces our aim to steadily increase the return of capital to shareholders over time and indeed, it
marks the fourth consecutive year in which we have done so. We were also asked to resubmit our plan due to certain
deficiencies that the Federal Reserve found in our capital planning process. We're working extremely hard to ensure a
successful resubmission towards the end of this year.
On the macro environment, a lot was going on. Britain's decision to leave the European Union created uncertainty that
is likely to persist for some time as the market grapples with the political and economic paths forward. As we've said
publicly, we consider this outcome suboptimal but it did indeed provide us with a live stress scenario. As we endured
record high volumes and spikes of volatility, our liquidity remained strong as systems ran smoothly and our clients
accessed the market quickly and in size.
I'll now turn over to Jon to discuss the quarter in detail. And again, look forward to your questions in a few minutes.
Jonathan Pruzan
Good morning.
As James said, the environment in the second quarter was an improvement over the first. However, we continue to see
macro uncertainty, and with it, periods of heightened volatility. Geopolitical events, including Brexit, have kept market
participants on the sidelines as they wait for clearer trends to emerge. Despite this backdrop, Morgan Stanley delivered
solid results. For the quarter, we reported revenues of $8.9 billion versus $7.8 billion in 1Q. Non-interest expenses for
the first quarter were $6.4 billion versus $6.1 billion last quarter. The increase is primarily driven by increased
compensation expense on higher revenues.
Profit before taxes for the quarter was $2.5 billion versus $1.7 billion in 1Q 2016, highlighting the operating leverage
we had in the business model. Project Streamline remains on track. In mid-June, James highlighted some of the key
initiatives that have been identified to meet our objective of reducing our cost base by $1 billion by 2017. These
initiatives will continue to be carried out through the next 18 months but substantial progress has already been made.
We continue to leverage our global centers of excellence to optimize workforce costs. We have hired 250 employees,
with our objective of hiring 1,250 employees through the end of 2017. Offsetting this, head count has come down in
our metro higher cost locations.
We are 50% complete with our objectives to close four North American data centers, and are on schedule to close the
remaining two by 2017. We continually seek ways to deploy technology to drive efficiencies and automation. To that
end, we just rolled out a cloud-based procurement platform, which will drive future savings through more
straight-through processing and payments and greater intelligence in purchasing decisions. We continue to show
greater discipline around our non-essential travel and have achieved a 50% reduction through the first half of the year
as compared to the first half of 2015.
Turning to Institutional Securities. Revenues were $4.6 billion, up 23% quarter-on-quarter. Non-compensation
expenses were $1.4 billion for the quarter, essentially flat for the first quarter. Streamline initiatives offset costs

associated with rising revenues. Compensation expenses were $1.6 billion. Our ISG year-to-date compensation to net
revenue ratio was 36%. We remain committed to our compensation ratio target of less than or equal to 37% we've set
out at the beginning of the year.
In Investment Banking, we generated $1.1 billion in revenues up 12% sequentially. Year-to-date, we were number two
globally and announced M&A, completed M&A, IPOs, and equity and equity-linked offerings. Advisory revenues for
the quarter were $497 million, down 16% off of a strong 1Q. Dialogue and interest in strategic transactions remained
strong but below the 2015 pace. M&A-announced volumes are running 20% to 25% below last year and we would
expect that to persist.
Equity underwriting revenues were $266 million, up 66% versus 1Q. And debt underwriting revenues were $345
million, up 44% sequentially. Although we saw improvements in underwriting, activity remained below historical
levels. As we have mentioned on past calls, we have a healthy pipeline of transactions waiting to be executed. Issuer
confidence and investor appetite will be critical for the results in underwriting to improve. In equities, we remained our
leadership position and expect to be number one globally with revenues of $2.1 billion, up 4% sequentially.
Second quarter 2016 was a strong quarter across products and regions as we continue to work with our clients through
uncertain times. Cash equities was up sequentially, derivatives remained robust. Prime brokerage continued to be a
steady performer and we improved the efficiency of our balance sheet. Fixed income and commodity sales and trading
revenues were $1.3 billion, up 49%, versus the first quarter. Revenues improved sequentially across credit, macro and
commodities business.
Our credit businesses benefited from a tightening of spreads. In particular, securitized products performed well against
this backdrop. In macro, we provided support to our clients leading up to and through the Brexit referendum, where
prudent risk management contributed to higher revenues sequentially. Commodities benefited from better credit
performance and market conditions, specifically a stabilization in energy credits resulting in an increase in client
activity.
Fixed income RWAs were $124 billion and SLR exposure was $353 billion in the quarter. Other revenues were up
versus first quarter, primarily driven by better credit performance for our held-for-investment and held-for-sale
relationship loans. Lastly, average trading VAR for the second quarter was $46 million, flat to last quarter. VAR was
generally range-bound over the quarter inclusive of Brexit.
Wealth Management performed well in the second quarter with revenues of $3.8 billion, up 4% sequentially. Even
though we have not seen a pickup in retail engagement, this business continues to provide stability against an uncertain
macro backdrop. Total client assets of $2 trillion increased 2%. Debased assets hit a new high of $820 billion. And
flows in the quarter were $12 billion, up from $5.9 billion in the first quarter.
Net interest income was flat sequentially, though up 12% year over year. Lending balances were up $3 billion quarter
over quarter and $11 billion year over year, which has resulted in a significant increase in interest income. This growth
was partially offset by an increase in amortization as a result of a pickup in mortgage prepayment fees as rates declined.
Our bank NII forecast that we shared in May remains unchanged, and we are on pace with our bank growth target for
2016.
Transactional revenues were $798 million this quarter, up 10% sequentially. This improvement was driven by
mark-to-market gains on our deferred compensation plans and not a rebound in activity. As mentioned before,
transactional activity remains subdued.
On expenses, compensation was up 3% quarter over quarter. Our compensation ratio decreased to 56.5%, which
reflects the benefit of our strategy to grow non-compensable revenues. Non-compensation expenses were essentially
flat to 1Q. We continued to invest in digital and our infrastructure to ensure our compliance with DOL.
Our PBT margin for the quarter was 22.5%, up from 21.4% in 1Q 2016. We remain confident we will hit the 23% to
25% pre-tax margin target we set for 2017 despite the slower than expected pace of future interest rate increases.

In Investment Management, revenues were $583 million, up 22% quarter over quarter. Revenues from asset
management fees for the quarter were $517 million, essentially flat versus 1Q. AUM was also essentially flat at $406
billion, a continuation of the trend that we have seen over the last several quarters.
Investment revenues in the quarter improved to $50 million versus a loss in 1Q 2016, driven by improved performance
across a number of funds, including private equity and real estate investments. Investment revenues remained volatile
as global markets and asset prices adjust to the changing political landscape and growth dynamic. Overall expenses
were up 7% quarter over quarter, driven by higher compensation on investment gains.
Turning to the balance sheet, total assets were $829 billion at June 30, up from the $807 billion at March 31. This spot
increase was driven by a high level of activity at the very end of June, primarily due to Brexit as we supported our
clients. We have seen the balance sheet retreat from this high in the first few weeks of the third quarter.
Pro forma fully phased-in Basel III advanced RWAs are expected to be approximately $365 billion, down from $385
billion in the first quarter. Our pro forma fully phased-in Basel III advanced common equity Tier 1 ratio increased to
15.8% versus 14.6% in the first quarter. Our pro forma supplementary leverage ratio for the quarter was 6.1%, up from
6% in Q1.
As James mentioned, during the second quarter we repurchased $625 million of common stock or approximately 23
million shares, and our board declared a $0.20 dividend per share. Last night, we announced that we will redeem all of
the issued and outstanding TruPS by August 18, 2016. The TruPS carry a blended cost of 6.2%. We received approval
to redeem these securities in this year's CCAR.
Our tax rate in the second quarter was 33.5%. Going forward, we continue to estimate a tax rate of 32%.
After a difficult start to 2016, the markets improved in the second quarter. However, the world continues to experience
significant geopolitical uncertainty and with that, the potential for economic under-performance. The Brexit vote and
upcoming U.S. elections have only added to a cloudy outlook.
It is too early to predict how the second half will play out. On the one hand, the political uncertainty casts a negative
shadow over the markets and will undoubtedly cause some corporations to pause over future CapEx and other
expansion plans. And many investors, particularly individuals, remain cautious. On the other hand, the movement in
currencies and the improvement in commodity and some equity prices is leading many clients to begin to position for
what might be a volatile second half.
Our pipelines remain healthy and our businesses well positioned, but whether this translates into near term business is
an open question. As the coming months unfold, we will remain nimble where we see client opportunities while staying
rigorous to our Project Streamline and other expense initiatives.
With that, we will open up the line to questions.
Q&A

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Your
line is open.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Thank you, good morning.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Good morning, Guy.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: First just a question on FICC. Obviously, a very solid result and you alluded to post-Brexit
activity. But generally on – if you could comment on the ability to produce sort of $1 billion-plus quarterly revenue in
FICC despite, as you pointed out, the sale of the oil merchanting and the 25% head count reduction at the end of last
year. Is there any sort of warning on sustainability here that you want to issue? And if not, maybe just give us a sense

for how it is that you could've done a head count reduction that was as significant as it was and still see revenue in that
kind of range.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Hey, Guy, it's Jon. I'll try to tackle that. I think, as you know, when we laid out our plan in
the beginning of the year, we talked about being a critical and credibly sized fixed income business that was relevant to
our clients but also supported our other businesses. And what we said is that we were going to – the goal was to
maintain our revenue footprint that we had had on an absolute basis in the last couple of years. Year-to-date our
performance is at around $2.1 billion, $2.2 billion so it's in line with that revenue footprint. We saw broad support and
broad improvement across all the products, actually, in the second quarter.
I highlighted SPG, tightening spreads helped strong performance and agencies. FX was aided by the volatility we saw
from Brexit. Commodities, clearly better credit performance. We had a much more stable backdrop. Oil prices going
from $38 to $48, versus sort of the wild swings that we saw in the first quarter. So broadly, a very strong performance.
It is only one quarter. In the first quarter when people were talking about our performance we warned that it was only
one quarter. We made a lot of changes that we think will help this business and this will take time, but we've been
pleased with the progress that we've seen to date.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: So should we conclude that...
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: I'll just add – I just...
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Sorry, go ahead.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: I'll just add to it a little bit because obviously FICC is sort of the topic of the day, the
year and the century, it would appear. Listen, my view was that there was a general overreaction to the
underperformance of FICC in the middle of the last year through the first half of the first quarter, and I saw very little
downside risk to the business. When we're running at $500 million, $600 million a quarter, I thought the downside risk
was very small. The upside risk was actually quite high. And that's why we said we thought on a relatively normalized
basis, $1 billion run rate a quarter was entirely reasonable.
The head count we took out at the end of last year, actually, many of our competitors have taken out head count in dribs
and drabs so it wasn't remarkable against the context of what was going on in the market, we just did it at one point in
time. And clearly, we were overstaffed at that point in time. And we came to a fundamental view at the end of last year
to do two things. One is to realign the staff to what we thought was $1 billion-ish run rate business, and maybe it's
more, and we're not going to get ahead of ourselves. Obviously, there's more this quarter. But we don't think it's
materially less than that, to be honest.
At the same time, the second thing we did was to align all of our sales and trading businesses together. And with that
come lots of operational synergies, risk management synergies, overall management client coverage synergies with our
SRM, our Senior Relationship Management program, and I think that wasn't going to evidence itself in the days and
weeks following the realignment, but we felt pretty confident in the months and years following it, it would. And
maybe we're starting to see some of that.
Thirdly, just on the particular mix of our business, obviously we are more credit centric than macro, but we do have a
very good FX business that benefited. You have seen a lot more volatility in rates, and clearly the credit markets, as Jon
said, recovered not just in the core fixed income business but in commodities. So the combination of all of these things
said that, yes, it's a good number this quarter. Are we shocked by it? Not really. We weren't nearly as shocked when
everybody else seemed to be when we were doing $500 million, $600 million. And that's – we're not going to get ahead
of it. We set $1 billion run rate and let's see how it plays out over not each individual quarter but over the next couple
of years.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay, that answers the question quite robustly, thank you. Second big topic of the century in
Wealth Management that we keep hearing about is robo advice. Clearly, fees for advice is the core of your Wealth
Management business proposition. A lot of talk about the application of robo advice to different-sized accounts. How
do you intend to protect the franchise against revenue attrition from this type of incursion, and are there ways that you

can use these types of technologies to your advantage?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Guy, first of all, digital is far more than just robo. And as you've heard us say in the past,
we've been spending significant energy and dollars into investing in our digital platforms in Wealth Management. As
you know, we hired Naureen Hassan to run that effort for us. We think that the right business model and a winning
hand here is a combination of advice and FAs with technology. We've been investing heavily in this area. We've had
some good early progress with some of our mobile apps with some recognition and awards. But there are really three
areas that we've been focused on. One is around data and analytics, so providing our clients with better data and
analysis so they can make more informed and better decisions.
Secondly, efficiencies around automation. That will be helpful not only from an expense standpoint, but also giving
FAs and clients more time to be together and not focused on paperwork and doing other things like that. And then
lastly, most importantly is sort of how our clients interface with us. We have 3.5 million households in our footprint,
with many different investing needs but also many different requirements and idiosyncratic wants and likes. And so we
have been building out a broader platform in terms of how we interface with our clients, whether that's video, whether
that's in person with their FA, whether that's mobile, whether that's text. And we have been doing that for quite some
time. So we have been investing in this area. We have told you it's going to be important to the overall business. We
believe secular trends here are for advice with technology, and that's the business that we're building.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: And again, just to add to this one, because it is a critical question. I think that one has
to take into account that the Wealth Management market in this country is actually extremely diverse. In our own book
of business, only 2%, I think, of our client assets are in households with less than $100,000. We have nearly 800 billion
in households with $10 million or more. So you've got to look at the segmentation. You've got to look at the complexity
of the client needs of which access through distinct technologies is a clear need, but it's by no means the only need for
folks who have got $10 million, $20 million, $50 million.
Portfolio allocation, superior product, access to our underwriting calendar, all of the other things which we bring to the
party, including our intellectual capital through our research. So it's a very important development. The whole digital
development in finance, in my view, it is the most important in the payments sector, followed by the consumer credit
sector followed by the Wealth Management sector. But we're making the investments, as Jon said, through our digital
team that we've hired under Naureen's leadership, and we've made the investments and we'll continue making them.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Great. Thanks very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is open.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Good morning, James and Jon.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Good morning.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: One more on FICC here. You've hit on the increased volatility towards the end of
the quarter leading into Brexit and then coming out of it. Do you think that that opportunity allowed you to over-earn
somewhat in FICC this quarter, or at least present a more unusual and robust revenue opportunity, which is why you
were able to punch above that 1 point – with that $1 billion per quarter run rate? And as we think about that run rate
seasonally, when we look into the back half, should we think about that being lower or is that going to be less seasonal
because of the changes you've made to the business?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Hey, Brennan. So the way we would describe Brexit and the impact, I think in the first
quarter, if you recall, and then through sort of the conference season, we said that January and February were very
challenging markets. March was more stable, a better backdrop for the businesses that we are in, and then that April
and May looked a lot like March. What we saw in June was sort of a continuation of that trend, as we approached the
Brexit referendum, we saw people start to realize the potential impact of this outcome and we saw more risk

management and hedging activity. And then for the couple of days right before and right after we saw heightened
volatility and significant volumes.
I would tell you that broadly speaking, one or two days does not make a quarter for us. It's a much more balanced
business than that, given also all the changes that we made, particularly around the oil merchanting business and some
of the other actions. We would expect less volatility than we have seen in the past, but we're obviously not going to
print $1 billion every quarter on the nose. So we are going to see fluctuations in that number.
I wouldn't say that we over-earned. I would say that the volume helped for a day or two but again, doesn't drive the
overall performance of a quarter. And then we've been pleased with the results. I don't think that the changes that we
made restricted our ability to earn. We weren't constrained in terms of capacity or personnel, and it was a good quarter.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: That's really terrific. And then on the seasonality front, how should we think about
it just from a modeling perspective? Can you give us any help there?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: I think it's a little early to call. I would historically tell you that August has generally been a
pretty slow month, but we're seeing a lot of new trends this year that we've never seen before. So I'll leave it up to you
to make those determinations.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: I would just caution that from my long experience of doing these calls and discussing
fixed income here and observing our competitors, it's pretty hard to model quarter-to-quarter every 13 weeks what the
fixed income markets are going to do. So good luck with that, but we take a slightly longer term view. And again, our
base case is $1 billion run rate a quarter we think is what the business should be producing in this time and
environment, and if it does better than that, great. And that's kind of where we are at.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Thanks. Thanks for all of that color, that's helpful. And then a couple on the
Wealth Management business. Nice to see a recovery here in the margin. As we think about this business a bit longer
term as well, and you think about some of the changes that are coming from a regulatory perspective, how much do you
anticipate your product shelf for commission accounts may be impacted? Could you give us a sense about whether
that's going to shrink and maybe frame up how that might shrink and how that might have an impact on revenues? And
then, whether or not the uncertainty from the fiduciary rule is having an impact on the recruiting market from your
perspective?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Okay, I think the way that I would try to answer that is a couple things. One, as you said, we
had a nice recovery in the margin. That was both driven on the revenue and the expense side. We are confident in our
23% to 25% margin target that we put out there. When we put it out there, we had the draft of the DOL requirement, so
we were informed when we put out the targets. I mentioned we have been investing for the ultimate implementation of
that new rule, and we also saw this quarter some of the Streamline initiatives that are ultimately going to help that
business.
I think we're well positioned for that change. We have the largest advisory platform in the industry. We are making the
investments in digital. We do believe, as a model, Brennan, that we're going to have that people want to – or excuse
me, our wealth clients want advice and they will pay for that advice. What the ultimate mix and shift of products that
they want and that they need is going to be a function of time. But we believe that we are well positioned to continue to
grow this business going forward, even though we've seen lower levels of engagement given the uncertainty in the
market.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Okay, and no color on the impact in the recruiting market?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: I think attrition is clearly running low and it's been like that for a while, so I don't think we've
seen any real changes there.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: No, it's not going to affect it.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Okay, thanks a lot.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Your line is open.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: Hi. Another question related to FICC. The debt underwriting year over year performed the worst
for you guys versus peers. And the question is, is the reduction in FICC on the trading side impacting the debt
underwriting side?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: I wouldn't say that, Mike. I think our debt underwriting business has been a good business
for us. We generally perform better from a quarterly perspective, particularly in markets where we see a lot of the
non-commoditized debt business being robust. In any 13-week period, particularly in low-velocity environments, you
can get some skew if you're not into big deals around the event space. This quarter there were a couple of events that
we didn't participate in on the financing because we were on the sell side from an M&A perspective, so that will impact
the numbers on a quarterly basis. But again, we feel good about this business. I don't think any of the changes that
we've made in fixed income are impairing our ability to do business here, and we are focused on it and we think it's a
good business.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: A separate question. Retail clients went on the sidelines due to Brexit. Have they come off the
sidelines? What are you seeing among retail investors now?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: I think Brexit is only one event. We've seen subdued transactional revenues for quite some
time. If you remember, it really started back in the summer when we saw some wild volatility in the U.S. markets, but
also in Asia and around the world. Those levels have remained low. They picked up a little bit this quarter. It was
benefited from some mark-to-market and our deferred comp. So if you look at the core trends, they remain still quite
low and subdued. So I would tell you that we put up a good quarter despite the low level of engagement that we're
seeing, and we haven't really seen a material pick up just yet.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: I would just add from watching this stuff, I would say the downside risk on the
transaction revenue at this point is low. As Jon said, it was very subdued in the last several months. The upside risk is
whatever it is if clients engage. So I don't think there's a lot of downside from this point on transaction. And we'll just
see how – the macro events are clearly moving investor psychology pretty significantly through this year. And as we all
know, sadly there have been a lot of things in the news.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: And then last question, you had a good quarter but still just an ROE of 8.3%. I think I heard you
reiterate the 9% to 11% target for 2017. So what's left? I guess you have $1 billion of targeted savings for Project
Streamline. How much has been achieved of that and what's left? And just in general, how do you still get to that 9% to
11% ROE from here?
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Mike, I think we have had this question before. But yes, listen, it was an okay quarter.
Honestly, I think it was good in bits. The ROE of 8.3% against the standards that we're shooting for I think was okay. It
feels good in this environment. But the 8.3%, also recall, as Jon pointed out, the tax rate was pretty high this quarter.
And we had the preferred in there this quarter. So you've got a lot of things going on.
Is there upside from here? Obviously, we have a pretty concrete game plan on the quarter going forward around what
we can do in Wealth Management, where rates ultimately will impact the pipeline that we have in the Investment
Banking calendar. And I think the broader changes going on in the global investment banking industry, and I think
Morgan Stanley is emerging from that pack, if you will, as one of the institutions that is strengthening at this point. But
again, we're not speaking to third quarter numbers here, obviously. We're speaking to the outlook of it, as you point out,
over next year, and we stand by the 9% to 11% by the end of 2017.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: And I'm sorry, Project Streamline, what do you have left or what have you achieved?
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Yes, it's still going. There's some very tactical stuff going and Jon might want to talk
about where we are on some of the broader Project Streamline. But we've had – I'd describe the wins so far as being
largely tactical stuff that is easy to execute. The longer-term infrastructure changes are progressing. It's all reporting

into Jon now, so why don't I just let him talk about it?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Thanks. So, Mike, you heard some of the comments in my script about some of the things
that we're doing and the progress that we're making. I think the best way to look at it is both comp and non-comp. On
the non-comp, if you look at year-to-date results, we're down about $350 million versus last year. A good chunk of that
related to these Streamline initiatives in litigation. There is clearly a benefit. Unfortunately, from a lower revenue
number, but there's good progress on the non-comp side. On the comp side, also a reflection of revenues, but as you
heard, the ISG comp ratio year to date at 36% versus I think it was 38% ex-DVA last year, year to date. So good
discipline on the comp and good discipline on the expenses, and we're confident that we're going to be able to hit the $1
billion target.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: All right, thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Hi, thanks, one last one on FICC. I know you're not going to give us the number, but I'm looking
for anything directional. Profitability must have improved a lot given head count is down 25%, RWA is down a lot and
revenues are now up. I wonder if you could help on any soft comments about overall profitability.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: I think you characterized it well.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: No number, okay. In the past, you've had a lot of seasonality in your FICC numbers. Part of that
was that the commodities business and you've since sold oil merchanting. I'm just curious, not for next quarter but just
as a general comment, the pacing of that $4 billion a year target, goal or whatever you want to call it. Will it be a little
bit more balanced than in the past?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: I think you highlight the most important factor. I mean, this is a volatile business, no doubt,
but we had incremental volatility given some of the commodities businesses that we were in so we would expect less
volatility. But again, I think we've answered what our goal is and our target for that business.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Okay, Jon. The nice drop in RWA in the quarter is down 5%, 15% year-on-year, but GAAP
assets had actually increased. I think in your prepared remarks you said something about supporting client activity
related to Brexit. But I'm just curious if you could expand on that a little bit, RWA full and GAAP assets up more than
[indiscernible] (36:56).
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Unfortunately, it's just math. We continue to make progress on our initiatives to take out
some of the higher density, if you will, RWA assets. At the end of the quarter we saw a spike, as you said, supporting
our clients. A lot of that was in sort of low intensity RWA assets and that sort of drives the discrepancy there.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Okay. So the trend of the RWA going down is what we should focus on anyway. And then
maybe last quickie is two quick number ones. In the past, I think the difference between your ROE and your ROTC is
in the range of 130 basis points, 140 basis points. Nothing should change that, right? We should be about that same
spread now? Just because everybody else gives their return intangible, I just want to go apples to apples.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Sure. Again, it's just math. We've got about $9.5 billion of average intangibles and goodwill,
and that's – if you do the math you get that 130 basis points.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: All right, awesome. Thanks, Jon.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Yes, thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Great. Good morning, guys. So a couple more questions on cost. The operating leverage in ISG
was pretty impressive. Is that 35.5% comp ratio even remotely sustainable on a go-forward basis if FICC revenues are
modestly weaker? And then also if you can comment on any cost of implications of fixing the CCAR issues.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: I'll go first. I'll do them in reverse. So on CCAR, as James mentioned, we do have to
resubmit by end of the year. That will take some resources, both dollars and people. I think it's a little too early for us to
try to size that and whether that has an impact on Streamline so we'll come back to you as we get more deeply engaged
in that. We clearly have started the work and are focused on it, and we'll dedicate the appropriate or required resources
that we need to make sure that we are successful in our resubmission.
On the second point, I think the target that we laid out is the 37% year-to-date – excuse me, ISG comp ratio
year-to-date, it's at 36%. I think looking over the total year is more important than any given quarter. But we're also
benefiting from the head count changes that we made in the fourth quarter. And we do think that this is a sustainable
ratio and that we will continue to pay for talent and be able to retain and attract talent going forward.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Perfect, that's very helpful. I'm not sure if I caught this right, but on the cash equities business,
did you say it was up sequentially? Just pretty surprising, given industry volumes were lower. I'm just curious if you
guys think you're gaining share or any particular initiatives that's making you guys walk the general industry trends?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Yes. No, you did hear me correctly. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, we were up. We had
some improved – new issue volumes were up a little bit that was helpful and less volatility. So yes, we were up.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Okay, thank you. And then just a very quick cleanup question. The TruPS redemption, where
does that show up in the income statement?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: We announced it last night. We're going to call – it's going to be – there are two different call
dates, but by the middle of August it will all be gone. As I said, they carry a 6.20% blended cost and you'll start to see
that in the third quarter. Or just the lack of it in the third quarter.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: But just from an income statement geography perspective, where does that kind of show up?
Like in the trading revenues?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: No, that's in interest expense. You'll see it in that line. Although again, it's $2.8 billion on a
stack of $160 billion of secure – or certainly unsecured, and then secured debt. So it will flow through that line. It's
clearly helpful, since the 6.20% we're issuing depending on tenor, issuing debt closer to 3% to 3.5% at this point. The
TruPS had sort of lost most of – certainly all of their Tier 1 treatment and most of their Tier 2 treatment and that was
going to continue to phase out. So it's sort of expensive debt at this point, which is why we obviously redeemed it.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Okay, great. Thank you very much and congrats on a strong quarter.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Your line is open.
<Q - Michael Roger Carrier>: Hi. Thanks, guys. Jon, maybe first question, just on the capital ratios. So your CET1
up to 15.8%, at least in the U.S., obviously at the extreme end. If we do get some opportunity as we get into next year
that you get to release a chunk. When you think about where that ratio is than where your SLR is, and if you are able to
release capital, from a business mix standpoint, do you feel like you guys are where you need to be? And the gist of it
is, if you are able to release the capital, obviously your CET, you don't want to come down, but your SLR will be
somewhat impacted. And then I just wanted to – when you look at the business mix and how you're positioned for that
potential opportunity, do you feel like you're situated relatively well?

<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: I think despite – we clearly put together our business mix and our business model based on
the best sort of estimate of what the future is going to look like. We were very happy that we returned more capital this
year versus last year and we've done it four years in a row. We're going to continue to try to do that. As you've heard
James and I talk about, we are expecting some changes in CCAR. We expect to hear something in this half of the year
about how the G-SIB is going to be incorporated into the stress test, how SLR is going to be incorporated into the stress
test. So I think there are some unknowns out there in terms of which these ratios will ultimately be the binding
constraint. But I think the business mix that we've put together is the right mix. And if we have to adapt it, we will. But
it is the right mix to generate the 9% to 11% ROE that we're targeting.
<Q - Michael Roger Carrier>: Okay, that's helpful. And then just a quick one on the Wealth Management business
with DOL. You guys hit on cost and the margins. And I think James, you mentioned in terms of the transaction, part of
the business still relatively low just given retail engagement. On the flip side, it seems like for the industry we will see a
continued trend and maybe an accelerated trend from commission-based accounts into fee-based accounts. So just
wanted to kind of balance what type of growth we could potentially see on that side, which is maybe more annuity-like
versus the more volatile transaction side of the business. And then for the advisors, do you expect any consolidation in
the industry, and probably away from your type of platform but to other platforms. And then some compensation
pressure, just given the different models out there.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: So I'll try to tackle some of the components of that. As you know, we've seen a very good
trend into fee-based accounts. We're currently at about 40% of our client assets are in fee-base, the $820 billion, which
is a new high for us. We saw acceleration of those flows in the second quarter. I think it's a little early to predict what
DOL is going to do to those flows. There is a scenario that would help accelerate those flows into fee-based businesses,
but again, it's really around client choice and we'll see how that plays out.
We do believe, again, the secular trends and a lot of the driving force behind the merger, the acquisition of the Smith
Barney platform was that people want advice. And they want – and we needed to be of scale. And those are the two
drivers that drove that transaction and we're still of the view that that is the longer term trend here. So it's still got time
to play out. We feel good about the investments that we're making around DOL, but I think it's still a little early to say.
What we have said from a client perspective and a results perspective, we do believe it's a manageable impact.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: And the industry will keep consolidating because this is a high fixed cost industry.
<Q - Michael Roger Carrier>: Okay, thanks a lot.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.
<Q - Matthew Hart Burnell>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question, just I guess an administrative question
on the trust preferreds. Will there be any charges related to the calling of the trust preferreds?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Yes. We highlighted in our fixed income call that on that redemption there'll be some
write-down of some amortized fees and we'll take that. It's not a material number, but there will be a charge for that.
<Q - Matthew Hart Burnell>: Okay, thank you. And then in terms of Wealth Management, the commission of fee
line was down about 4% year over year. Even though you do have positive growth in fee-based client account assets, is
there a mix shift going on, particularly in the fee-based client account asset portfolios that is causing a little bit of
pressure on the asset management revenue line within Wealth Management?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: It's sort of hard to parse through. I mean, I think the primary drivers are really the
underwriting calendar and the sort of subdued engagement levels that have been driving that activity.
<Q - Matthew Hart Burnell>: Okay. And then just finally for me, could you give us an update on the energy exposure
and whether or not that has had any effect on the reported lending balances in the supplement?

<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Sure, so as I mentioned, better credit performance this quarter than last quarter. From a
metric standpoint, we're down to about $13.5 billion in energy loans and commitments. That's down from $14.8 billion
last quarter. That's being driven by paydowns, terminations, and sales. The broad characteristics of that portfolio are
generally the same; i.e., about 60% of that is to investment-grade counterparties, about 30% of that is funded. In terms
of the mix that we've given historically around held-for-investment versus fair value held-for-sale, the held-for-sale fair
value portfolio is down a little bit. It's about 35%. That's obviously being driven by some of the sales that we've made
in that portfolio.
E&P, also a good story there, down to $3.5 billion from the $4.1 billion that we reported earlier. So we continue to
make progress in reducing some of our exposures in that sector. Just as a proxy, last quarter we took about $127 million
allowance for loan loss. We told you back then that a lot of that was being driven by our energy exposures. This quarter
we took a $3 million allowance, so clearly much better performance than last quarter.
<Q - Matthew Hart Burnell>: Sure, thank you for the detail, and then just one follow-up, Jon. You've got about 40%
of the portfolio that's in fair value. How much of the benefit – how much have FICC results benefited from a lower
mark-to-market on the energy portfolio specifically?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: As I said, about 35% of that portfolio is fair value held-for-sale, and that does flow through.
It does flow through the revenue line item, but I wouldn't say it was significant.
<Q - Matthew Hart Burnell>: Okay, thank you very much.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Excuse me, I'm sorry. It's the other revenue line item.
<Q - Matthew Hart Burnell>: Okay, thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Good morning. Can you give an update on the bank effort in Wealth Management?
You had continued good loan growth this quarter. Deposits were down a little bit versus last quarter but still up nicely
year over year. And just how are you feeling about the outlook for both loan and deposit growth going forward?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Sure. So as I mentioned, $3 billion of loan growth this quarter, $5 billion year to date.
Continued good growth there, and I think we feel pretty good about that trend. As I mentioned, our NII guidance that
we gave as part of the fixed income deck, we still feel good about that. On the deposit side, second quarter we usually
see a dip that's being driven by the tax season. So at $150 billion, down $2 billion, that was the primary driver. I think
the investments that we're making into digital and some of the cash management products make us feel good about our
ability to continue to grow broadly our deposit base. And again, I think the bank strategy has been a real bright spot for
us, and we would expect that to continue going forward.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: And then just a couple of number clarification questions. How much were the
mark-to-market gains on the deferred comp in Wealth Management this quarter? And are there offsets on the expense
side, or does that fall to the bottom line?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Yes, there are definitely offsets on the expense side. It's generally pretty – the net impact is
reasonably small, and I wouldn't – we don't break out that number given the relative size.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. And then just lastly, the premium amortization that was a drag within
Wealth Management, what was that this quarter versus last quarter or recent periods?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Again, it was clear as rates dropped this quarter, prepayment speeds increased, and that was
the driver of it. In the first quarter, I think the rates were pretty stable. So again, that was what caused the NII to be flat
this quarter.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.
<Q - James Mitchell>: Hey, good morning. Maybe we could just dig into the RWA decline this quarter. I think you
were down $20 billion. FICC was down $8 billion, so you actually had more outside of FICC. So when I think about
high-density RWA, I think typically that would be more in FICC. So just maybe help us understand where the RWA
decline is coming outside of FICC. And is there more of that to go?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: So I think the $20 billion, another way to think about it is about half of that came from credit
RWAs, and that was a combination of FICC mostly in the securitization area, but also from event lending. Our balances
are down in that business, given the light activity. And then the other half was really around the market RWAs, which
is a function of both the balance as well as the stress VAR, which was down a little bit.
<Q - James Mitchell>: Is that sustainable outside of FICC, the stress VAR and those kind of drivers, or is there more
to go I guess outside of FICC? Because we know your targets for FICC, I'm just trying to get a sense of the non-FICC.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Again, on the non-FICC, the event is going to be driven by activity levels. So I think the
RWA number that we used was in the mid-$350 million. And that number I think is sustainable given what we see in
the in the outlook.
<Q - James Mitchell>: Okay, so it's just going to be episodic?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: It will be and it's going to – but I wouldn't expect to see dramatic movements unless there are
significant changes in volatility. I think the composition of our book, as you said, we are making some minor – we
continue to bring down our FICC RWAs, but we've made a lot of progress there, so I would expect it to be pretty
comparable.
<Q - James Mitchell>: Okay, great. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Thanks very much. In this year's CCAR exam, it looked like your leverage ratio was under
the adversely stressed scenario. It was approaching the lower bound. And obviously that might be exacerbated a bit by
the capital return, although maybe there's some optimism in TruPS. But could you just clarify how you're thinking
about leverage, particularly as it relates to the regulatory regime?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Sure, and I covered a little bit of this in one of my prior answers. I think what you have to
remember, we're managing multiple ratios. We have the risk-weighted asset ratios. We have the leverage ratio. We
have SLR. How that gets incorporated into CCAR is going to be important but I think the critical point to recognize
here is we did increase our capital return this year, and our minimum ratios through the stress tests actually improved
across the board. Both the Tier 1 and the RWA ratios, but also the leverage ratio was up about 30 basis points. So we
continue to accumulate capital and that's really a reflection of the business mix and the de-risking that we've
undertaken.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Okay, thank you for that. And on just another Project Streamline question. Do you – are the
costs being removed more or less coincident with the initiatives, or are the initiatives proceeding? And of the many, I

guess, 200 or so that you've identified, how many of them are in process and sort of how far along – what inning are we
in, in terms of the actual initiatives themselves?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: I think these are being – these are proactive actions that we're taking so I think we're driving
this change. I mentioned the data centers that we're closing, the workforce deployment strategy that we're
implementing. So these are proactive steps that we're taking given the simplification of our business model. In terms of
innings, I would say unclear. We're in the early stages. We've made progress and we're confident on reaching our $1
billion target in 2017.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Nomura. Your line is open.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Hi, good morning. So, Jon, I wanted to follow up regarding some of the questions on capital.
So first on the G-SIB surcharge, it looked like as of year-end you were right on the cusp of the 3% threshold. And
given the reduction that we've seen over the last couple of quarters in many of your more risk-intensive assets, where
do you believe the surcharge is today and how do you think about managing to that going forward, given some of the
opportunities not just to mitigate but potentially to even grow in some of the trading areas as competitors retrench?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: As you said, our surcharge for 2016 is 3%. As we said in the past, we're going to continue to
try to manage and mitigate that if we can. And so if there are opportunities to bring that number down or change that
number, we'll obviously take a hard look at it.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Got it, okay, and one follow-up regarding some of the remarks you made to Eric's last
question. Given that leverage was your binding constraint in the latest exam and that the Fed is incorporating, as you
noted, the tougher SLR requirement, it still looks like to us that even if we include the G-SIB surcharge in full
pre-mitigation, the SLR or leverage could still be your binding constraint. And I just wanted to get a better sense as to
whether the mitigation plans that you outlined are still on track. I believe it was at the early part of the year in the
strategic review of the SLR within FICC, and are there other opportunities that you see to drive that lower given that
that could actually prove to be the determinant of how much capital you need to hold?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Yes. Again, I think we're – I tried to answer this question, clearly not as well as people had
liked. Until we actually see what the new requirements are in CCAR, that question is sort of challenging. We do have
initiatives in place and fixed income to bring down the SLR. We did build capital on the leverage ratio this year versus
last year through the test. How the SLR is incorporated will be a driver of some of the decisions we make going
forward. And the buffer, as you know, is on the risk-weighted asset ratios not on the leverage ratios. So I think we need
to see a little bit more before we can be more precise.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Thanks, Jon. And one follow-up from me on the Wealth Management side. James, at the
Morgan Stanley financials conference, you made a comment regarding loan penetration levels amongst some of your
retail clients. I think the numbers were 2% for mortgage and 16% for SPLs. And the 16% number actually struck me as
a bit high and yet we continue to see really strong growth within that channel. As we think about modeling out the
long-term growth opportunity here, what should we think or what do you believe are reasonable penetration levels that
you can achieve across both of these channels to drive further growth?
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: I don't know that I want to try to put out a penetration on the SPL loans. I actually
don't agree that it's a high number. I mean, it reflects the mix in the business, as you move from single-stock margin
lending to portfolio and annuitized asset base lending the SPL will go up and margin is – you would think would go
down, actually, our margin book has been relatively stable, but the SPL is just a function. We have a lot of wealthy

clients who have positions they don't want to liquidate. They want to invest in other things, they want to use money for
lots of different sources and whether it's purchasing assets or whatever. So I'm not terribly surprised by it and it's
clearly got room to move.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: All right, that's very helpful. Thank you for taking my questions.
