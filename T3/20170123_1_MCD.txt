Stephen J. Easterbrook
Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'm energized by the position we're in today as a result of the progress
we've made the past two years. When we launched our turnaround plan in 2015, we said we first need to get the
foundation right. We focused on running great restaurants, and push harder on the basics including hot, fresh food,
convenience and value. We'll spend today talking about the foundation we showed up last year and upon which we'll
build as we transition from the revitalization phase of our turnaround to strengthening the business through sustainable
growth. We're now in a position to prioritize initiatives, so we can further accelerate our momentum.
2016 was a year of purposeful change. We dedicated ourselves to the actions necessary to be a better, stronger
McDonald's. Our objective was to reinforce our foundation and that's what we did. First, we right sized our structure.
We became leaner, more efficient, more nimble. We flattened the organization so it's easier to quickly share and scale
best practices across like markets and get even closer to the customer.
At the same time, we're building a better McDonald's literally. We recently broke ground on a downtown Chicago
office creating a world-class work environment for our staff and for our franchisees and our restaurant teams who visit
Chicago from around the world for training and development.
Second, we put the right talent in place. Our leadership team blends individuals with deep McDonald's experience, who
are ready to take on more responsibility with new executives who have valuable experience outside of McDonald's and
bring fresh energy and innovative thinking.
We promoted Chris Kempczinski to President of the U.S. Business, and Joe Erlinger to President of the High Growth
Markets, where they have both hit the ground running. We expanded Doug Goare's role to focus not only on the
international lead markets, but on restaurant execution, blending field, adding center leadership.
We expanded Jim Sappington's role to include oversights of all areas of the customer experience, including Digital.
And we've brought in Lucy Brady to lead Global Corporate Strategy. Previously, Lucy was a Senior Partner of BCG, as
she had more than 20 years of experience, driving consumer centered growth strategies.
Third, we sharpened our focus. As we previously shared, we're not managing the business quarter-by -quarter, we're
taking a longer-term view. We started leaning in, looking forward and fundamentally changing McDonald's culture.
We're moving faster, pushing harder and taking smarter risks.
For example, the pace of which we're expanding Experience of the Future around the world continues to quicken. I
recently visited Spain where I was impressed by the way they've started bringing the Experience of the Future to life in
restaurants around Madrid. A rapid deployment model we're applying to the city has enabled us to dramatically
transform the customer experience in a short period of time. And what's happening in Spain is guiding our rollout
strategy in other markets around the world including the U.S.
Across the business, we're prioritizing actions that have the most direct impact on customers. That includes
implementing All-Day Breakfast in Australia, which we pulled from the U.S. playbook. And this is a great
demonstration of the value our new structure brings to the business. Introducing dedicated restaurants start with guest
experience leaders in Canada. And taking important steps with our food and how it's prepared in the U.S., for example,
removing artificial preservatives from our popular Chicken McNuggets. We further elevate our commitment to running
great restaurants, and customers are noticing.
During the course of 2016, we've seen customers' satisfaction measures improve in most of our major markets,
including the U.S. The purposeful changes we're making also resulted in improved financial results. 2016 was our
strongest year of global comparable sales since 2011.
Fourth quarter marked six consecutive quarters of positive global comparable sales, which comes after five quarters of
global declines. Across the business and around the world, we delivered a solid year. Global comp sales were up 2.7%
for the quarter and 3.8% for the year. Operating income increased 7% for the quarter and 11% for the year in constant

currencies.
Earnings per share increased 12% for the quarter and 16% for the year in constant currencies. Restaurant cash flows
grew worldwide and we continued to see all-time highs in many of our major markets including the U.S.
We expected some uneven performance in 2016, and fourth quarter comparable sales were positive in all segments
except for the U.S., where we anticipated a challenging lap due to our successful All-Day Breakfast launch in October
2015. Other markets such as France, Germany and Russia are also working to overcome challenges of varying degrees.
With that context, let's turn to quarterly performance highlights in the markets. Starting in the U.S. where comparable
sales were down 1.3%. The launch of All-Day Breakfast 2.0 is reenergizing customers around our breakfast offerings
and is living up to our expectations. We're also seeing pockets of success in regions that have doubled-down on
affordability by layering McPick offers alongside beverage value.
In an effort to extend that momentum nationwide, we kicked off the new year with a national McCafé beverage value
promotion, which leverages our scale advantages and further complements local McPick offers.
Operationally, we're running better restaurants. Our fourth quarter's customer satisfaction scores were up 5% compared
to fourth quarter 2015, as our lowest performing quintile of restaurants halved the gap to our top-performing quintile. In
addition to creating a better customer experience, the significant emphasis we've placed on these underperforming
restaurants, speaks to the high level of accountability with which we are managing the business.
That said, there's more we need to do to reverse guest count trends in the U.S., and we're prepared to hit harder in 2017.
Chris and the team have a solid plan that you'll hear more about during our March 1 Investor Meeting.
Let's now turn to the International Lead segments. We had positive comparable sales of 2.8% for the quarter and 3.4%
for the full year, driven primarily by the U.K., Australia and Canada. The U.K. delivered another quarter of strong
performance, driven by new food news, a steady focus on core classics and value. In particular, the Great Tastes of the
World food event featured the introduction of sandwiches, which rotate through the market two weeks at a time.
Australia continued its positive momentum, despite intensified competition in the marketplace. McCafe and All Day
Breakfast remain big winners there. Canada is another market with consistently strong performance. It's focused on
hospitality, including the addition of guest experience leaders in restaurant lobbies earlier in 2016 led to the highest
guest satisfaction scores on record for December.
At the same time, the restaurants that have converted to Experience of the Future, numbering 800 in 2016 alone, are
seeing even stronger financial results than those restaurants that have not yet made the switch.
Whilst the UK, Australia and Canada remain strong, we see more significant opportunity for improvement in Germany
and France. In Germany, our actions to improve food quality, enhance the customer experience and take a purposeful
approach to value in 2016 are all resonating the price-conscious German consumer. We still have more runway,
particularly with regard to affordability and we'll continue to drive hard on that this year.
France is seeing initial signs of recovery at the IEO market is returning to a place of stability. For the first time in over
five years, IEO market traffic was positive. The team in France is capturing some of that traffic growth by continuing to
innovate, bringing to light new ways to order, pay and be served; web ordering kiosks and table service are now
available in the vast majority of restaurants.
Let's turn to the High Growth segment, where performance was driven by strong results in China. We saw increases in
comparable sales in the fourth quarter across all markets, resulting in a positive comp of 4.7% for the segment.
For the full year, comparable sales were 2.8%. Notably, China had a strong quarter, with comparable sales of 7.9%. We
ended the year with solid momentum, due in part to contributions from the core menu and the strong value offerings. At
the same time, we found success by continuing to emphasize the convenience we provide to customers through
third-party delivery services and dessert kiosks.

In the Foundational markets, we saw positive comparable sales of 11.1% for the quarter and 10% for the year, with the
very strong performance in Japan and certain markets in Latin America throughout 2016 as well as solid results across
the segment's remaining geographic regions.
As recently as November, I spent time with the team in Japan to experience firsthand how they're executing the
turnaround plan. And the way they balance new food news, value and accessibility supported by a foundation of
running great restaurants.
Whilst we've been creating customer notable change in restaurants around the world, we've continued to enhance
financial value. We said, we'd be forensic with our finances and we have been. First, we're putting more restaurants and
even entire markets in the hands of local owners. We devoted significant energy to ownership changes in 2016, and
those efforts continue this year.
Specifically: Malaysia and Singapore are locally owned as of December. Our partners in these markets bring
experience in running great restaurants with 20 years as a developmental licensee for nearly 100 restaurants in Saudi
Arabia. And both markets will be managed by seasoned McDonald's executives with local experience. This partnership
will create brand excitement for customers and new opportunities for people as these markets continue to grow and
develop.
Earlier this month, we announced a strategic partnership in China and Hong Kong. This structure blends our global
brand with partnership bring deep insight into both markets. CITIC and The Carlyle Group have established records of
success in the region and share our principles and values.
Furthermore, we expect this will be a powerful driver of growth unlocking financial value in the region and enabling
further expansion of the business. We have now either completed or reached agreement of almost all of our more
significant ownership transactions.
Second, we continue to make progress against our G&A target. We've right-sized the organization enabling our market
teams to focus even more of their time and energy on actions that directly benefit customers. Kevin will share more on
G&A in his remarks.
Finally, we fulfilled the commitments to return $30 billion to shareholders over three-year period ending 2016.
Taken together these actions to enhance financial value enable us to prioritize critical investments to support our
long-term strategy, which we'll discuss along with updated long-term financial targets in greater detail in March. Our
focus is on growing guest counts, as we recognize these are the ultimate lifeblood of our business. We've done
significant work to understand how and where to put energy to continue driving profitable results. And we look
forward to sharing that with you in just a few weeks.
We're now fit for purpose and better positioned to build on our success. I'm confident we're a stronger more capable
business today than we were two years ago. We've built a strong base and now is the time to shift our focus to
strengthening and growing the business for the long-term. That said, we will face challenges, some within our control
and others beyond. As I mentioned, we're dealing with varying macroeconomic pressures and general economic
volatility in many markets, including Russia and France.
In Q1, we'll have results that included a leap day, favorable weather in many places around the world and a continued
benefit from the launch of All-Day Breakfast in the U.S. At the same time, I remain very optimistic about our steady
progress to be a better McDonald's as we work to be recognized by customers as the modern progressive burger
company.
As I think about where we were, how far we've come and our potential, I'm convinced we're on the right path to
achieve this ambition. 2017 is the year during which we'll step up and lead as we shift to more of a long-term focus.
Thanks, everyone, and now I'll turn it over to Kevin.

Kevin M. Ozan
Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. By staying sharply focused on our customers, we maintained positive
global momentum while continuing to make further progress on our journey towards building a better McDonald's.
We're pleased with our financial performance in 2016, which reflects broad-based improvements in our operating
performance from the top to the bottom line.
At the top line, our global comparable sales performance of 3.8% represented our strongest consolidated results since
2011, and every segment was positive for the second consecutive year. Our bottom line performance was equally
strong, as full-year operating income grew $600 million or 11% in constant currencies, and earnings per share was up
16% in constant currencies. Both of which exceeded our performance goals for the year.
Steve talked about some of the structural and cultural changes we're making. We're also evolving our financial profile.
So, I'll talk about some of the impacts on our P&L as well as progress on our financial initiatives. Let me start with the
performance drivers for the quarter.
As we evolve to a more heavily-franchised organization, growing sales and the associated franchise revenues is critical
as these continue to become an increasingly significant portion of our overall profitability. For fourth quarter, franchise
revenues increased 4% in constant currencies reflecting positive global comparable sales and the impact of expansion
and refranchising. I'm encouraged by these results, particularly considering some of the challenging industry trends in
comparison against last year's fourth quarter comparable sales, which were our strongest in more than three years.
Franchise margin dollars reached $1.9 billion for the quarter, a 4% increase in constant currencies, and contributed over
half of our growth in consolidated operating income. Our solid margin performance reflects sales-driven improvements,
led by results in our major markets.
The operating results are a demonstration of the benefits of our refranchising strategy, which include creating a stable
predictable royalty stream and reducing G&A and capital levels over time. And our refranchising strategy enables us to
reduce our asset exposure and enhance our ability to more quickly grow our restaurant base at the market potential.
While company-operated margins continue to represent a smaller component of our global operating income, what's
important is that we continue to drive higher restaurant profitability as we optimize our company-operated restaurant
portfolio in the ongoing contribution to our bottom line.
For the quarter, company-operated margins improved 170 basis points over the prior year led by China and the U.S.
We benefited from a benign commodity environment in 2016, although we continue to experience labor inflation in
many markets around the world. Menu pricing is one way to help mitigate some of these cost pressures.
We ended 2016 with a 2.8% price increase in the U.S., relatively in line with food away from home inflation of 2.3%;
for comparison, the International Lead markets average price increases of about 2%.
We're mindful of the disparity between grocery store inflation and food away from home. So we'll continue to carefully
balance strategic pricing decisions with our focus on growing guest counts.
Shifting gears now to an update on our financial targets. While we've been focused on customer noticeable change in
the restaurants, over the course of the last year we've also applied rigor and discipline towards meeting our cash return
to shareholders, refranchising and G&A targets.
As Steve mentioned, 2016 marked a completion of our three-year $30 billion cash return to shareholders. In nearly
one-third of our current market capitalization, this achievement as well as our recent 6% dividend increase serves as a
vote of confidence in our business and the sustainability of our significant cash flows. In addition to the achievement of
our cash return target, I want to provide some perspective on the notable progress we've made around refranchising and
G&A.

Starting with our global refranchising efforts. From the beginning of 2015 through the announcement of our strategic
partnership with CITIC and The Carlyle Group earlier this month, we've made significant progress on our refranchising
goals. By mid-2017, we expect to have refranchised over 3,500 restaurants towards our goal of refranchising 4,000 by
the end of 2018.
The China Hong Kong transaction, which is expected to close mid-year, is the most significant transaction of our
refranchising efforts, resulting in the sale of more than 1,750 company-owned stores.
From a strategic standpoint, this transaction puts more of our restaurants under local ownership and blends our global
brand with local partners who bring deep knowledge, insight and resources into both markets. We will retain a 20%
ownership stake in the business in order to continue supporting and participating in the growth of both China and Hong
Kong.
From a financial standpoint, this strategic partnership will enable us to more quickly unlock our growth potential in
China as we pursue accelerated expansion and innovation while spending no ongoing capital and limited G&A
resources.
The new enterprise is slated to open over 1,500 restaurants over the next five years, reflecting a much quicker opening
pace than the 1,200 new openings achieved in the previous five years. With more than 2,400 restaurants today, at this
pace, China will quickly become the second largest McDonald's market in the system.
With a total enterprise value of around $2 billion, we currently expect cash proceeds of about $1.5 billion. Following
the transaction, our income stream will consist of royalties on 100% of the restaurant sales in China and Hong Kong, as
well as our 20% share of the enterprises earnings. Initially, the net impact of this transaction will be somewhat dilutive
to our operating income. However, we expect to return to a similar income level in a few years.
For perspective, remember that today China and Hong Kong represent less than 5% of our consolidated operating
income. From an operating margin, financial return and free cash flow perspective, the transaction will be immediately
accretive as we will not make ongoing capital investments in these markets. We're currently finalizing our plans for the
cash proceeds and we'll provide an update at our Investor Meeting in March.
In addition to the China Hong Kong transaction, there're several other smaller transactions which are in various stages
of the refranchising process. We'll provide additional information on these and future transactions, as appropriate.
We're also committed to being more efficient with our G&A spending. From a qualitative standpoint, the objective of
our G&A and capital discipline is to focus our resources and talent where it matters most, on customer facing activities
that drive business growth.
At the same time, we're evolving to a more efficient globalized system that better leverages our size and supports rapid
testing and scaling of initiatives that address these growth opportunities. We've made meaningful progress towards our
goal of reducing our net G&A levels by $500 million by the end of 2018 from our 2015 plan of $2.6 billion.
Our actions over the past two years have resulted in realized savings of more than $200 million, exceeding our original
expectation of $150 million in savings by the end of 2016. These actions include redesigning our entire organization to
eliminate layers and increased spans of control resulting in head count reductions in both the corporate staff and across
our business segments, more centralization of non-customer facing business processes, and executing against our
refranchising targets, which will significantly reduce market level G&A spending.
For perspective, our year-end earnings release separates base G&A which reflects the impact of these actions from
incentive-based compensation. This more detailed disclosure provides visibility into the base G&A savings achieved
during 2016. Partially offsetting these savings, in 2016 was higher incentive-based compensation, reflecting financial
performance that exceeded internal targets which are primarily based on operating income and earnings per share
growth. The improvements in our sales, restaurant profitability and G&A spending resulted in a near record high
operating margin of 31.5% for 2016, up from 28.1% in 2015.
So as we look to the future, we'll leverage our recent success and build upon it. We're financially stronger than we were
a year ago. We're making steady progress on our financial initiatives and we're seeing better operating results.

We're confident that we're on the right path. In March, we look forward to providing more detail about our global
strategy, the initiatives we're investing in and how they'll enable us to deliver sustained long-term profitable growth for
our system and our shareholders.
Thanks. Now I'll turn it over to Chris to begin our Q&A.
Q&A
<A - Chris Stent>: Thanks, Kevin. We will now open the call for analyst and investor questions. [Operator
Instructions] We'll come back to you for follow-up questions as time allows. The first question is from David Palmer of
RBC.
<Q - David Palmer>: Thanks. Good morning. Quick question on the traffic per store. It looks like it's been down for a
few years now. I think it might be down 10% since 2012 when you eased away from that dollar menu at least
domestically. Cash flow seems like it's strong per restaurant though, and in this morning's release you said that the
company is going to continue to focus on traffic. Could you perhaps elaborate as to why traffic declines can perhaps
reverse this year and what that focus will mean? Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Easterbrook>: Yeah. Thanks, David. No, you're actually spot on. It's not a one-year trend. It's been
slightly longer. It is something that dominates our conversation as we plan our business and certainly the
Owner/Operators are very mindful of it as well, particularly here in the U.S. actually.
This is all about getting the balance right. I mean the cash flow growth through 2016 was phenomenal for our U.S.
Owner/Operators. And frankly there never has been a better time to be an Owner/Operator in the McDonald's system
than there is right now. And part of the discussions we're having certainly Chris Kempczinski and his leadership team
with the Owner/Operator leaderships is how and where do we reinvest that strength in the business back on behalf of
the customers. So, I guess, two things that you will see more of through, through the course of this year that we believe
will sort of correct the guest count trends.
One is around the investment and the experience of the future. So that is something that we've had a great success in
many of our more mature markets around the world where we're really investing front of house to put more choice
control in the hands of customers where it's around how they order, what they order, how they're served, how they pay.
So that's something where we have a great track record around the world and we're looking to deploy that aggressively
in the U.S.
And the other piece where we still have got to fight harder is on value. The McPick menu really does work well for
customers whether it's the McPick 5 or the McPick of that more value end, whether it's 2, 2.50, but that alone isn't
winning us the market share price of the value end. So you'll have seen at the start of this year that we have had an
aggressive McCafe beverage value also, which is $1 any size coffee or $2 on the small specialty McCafe beverages.
You can expect to see us be more competitive at value end through the year.
I mean it's been encouraging in the way that has resonated the customers as we've entered the new year. And our
experience when we analyze the regions that have been most successful around the U.S., the three or four top
performing regions over the last year or two are those that have managed to combine the national value platform with
the more local aggressive, whether it's beverage or food led value and price offers. So we're lifting that, learning it and I
think all the right people are engaged in right conversations and customers will benefit.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question is Matt DiFrisco from Guggenheim.
<Q - Matthew DiFrisco>: Thank you. My question is with respect to the International Lead markets and the franchise.
I'm just looking at that and I know you did a pretty good strong comp there of 2.8% positive. I'm just curious why that
wasn't maybe providing a little bit more leverage on the franchise side. It looked like that franchise margin came back a
little bit. Can you talk about the dynamic or some of the pushes and pulls that might have resulted in the little bit more
modest margin pressure than you saw in the third quarter where it expanded modestly?

<A - Kevin M. Ozan>: Yeah, Matt. It's Kevin. Thanks for the question. We generally get pretty good leverage from
comps on the franchise margin side as more of those costs obviously are fixed certainly than on the company-operated
side. A couple things on the franchise margin, specifically in the International Lead markets. A little piece of that is as
we reduce some of our refranchising, we are generally selling lower volume restaurants with potentially lower margins.
And so, in the near-term it impacts the franchise margin percent a little bit on those International Lead markets.
And then, the other thing that we do see certainly is some of the occupancy costs internationally, specifically some of
the leads costs continue to pressure a little bit margins, but the franchise margin certainly more than McOpCo margin is
driven by comp sales. They're definitely a top-line game and as long as we can continue to drive positive comp sales,
we should be pretty good on those margins being healthy.
<A - Stephen J. Easterbrook>: Matt, there's one other thing I would add to that which is we talk about a very unique
business model and relationship with the way we have with our Owner/Operators around the 20-year franchise and that
the mutual benefits of investing together.
2016 was probably a peak year, actually, for some of the co-investment programs that we have been doing hand in hand
with our Owner/Operators in those lead markets where we will put up some of the support to enable them to accelerate
some of these investments.
Now we're seeing it on the top-line, we're seeing it on our bottom-line so we know it makes sense. And as the lead
markets begin to get towards the end of their cycle on this reinvestment, that gives us a chance then to focus our
attention here on the U.S., which you can expect to see as well.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question is from Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer.
<Q - Brian Bittner>: Thank you. Thanks for taking the question. Just want to follow-up on David Palmer's question
from earlier. These solid cash flow metrics for store have been really good despite the traffic declines you've seen in the
business. And I think the obvious reasons are, the average check growth has offset the traffic declines for the comp.
And then the food commodity deflation has helped boost the margins.
And so, you kind of talked about restoring traffic when you responded to David's question. But my question is, how
exactly do you keep the average check up in 2017 and going forward, given that you like to price more towards food at
home, which is in deflation and the fact that you're focusing more on value and price offers?
<A - Stephen J. Easterbrook>: So, Brian, what we've typically seen around the world – and it's a very astute question.
So, I mean, it would seem like an obvious trait, but the reality is, what we've seen around the world, the more
customers we drive into our restaurants the greater the top line growth and the greater the cash flow growth. So, if that
impacts margin percent a little and it may do, but actually the dollar amount or the euro amount or the yen amount on
the bottom line, both for the company and for the Owner/Operator improves. It is a delicate balance. I mean 2016 was a
lovely cycle for the cash flow with commodities at an all-time low, and probably as aggressive as we'd want to be on
pricing.
I think you'll see us just carefully bring pricing back more in line with food away from home, which we begin to see
now, but the reality is, this is not a new discussion for us in our business. Again, going back to the 20-year franchise
agreement, we all know that for the benefit of our Owner/Operators businesses over the long-term, you got to be
serving more customers more often. So that's where we've returned to, but we know we can grow profitably and cash
flow can grow alongside that.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question is from David Tarantino of Robert W. Baird.
<Q - David E. Tarantino>: Hi. Good morning. Steve, just continuing on the theme of asking about the U.S. business.
It seems like the hallmark of the McDonald's system has been built around speed of service. And it seems like over the
past several years, McDonald's may have gotten a bit slower. So, can you talk about where you are as a system in terms
of speed of service and how you're thinking about that as part of your traffic-driving program, especially as you sort of
tie in Experience of the Future, which includes some customization elements. So, any thoughts there would be helpful.

<A - Stephen J. Easterbrook>: Yeah. No, thank you. Thanks, David. Speed of service has declined slightly. It's a
handful of second slower by the end of 2016 than we were by the end of 2015. So, I guess, there's a number of things
we're trying it. So, you'll hear me talk about or heard me refer in the past around net simplification, where if we are
going to introduce new menu items and new ideas, we've got to reduce the complexity by at least if not more than the
same amount.
So, our operations teams, particularly in the U.S., are deeply focused on that. And simplification isn't just on the menu,
it could be on different operational processes, could be the use of technologies takes on the manual work out the way.
Simplifying just the merchandising all the way through to training programs in the restaurants and making them more
efficient and more effective. So, there is a number of different pillars to our simplification efforts.
With regard to Experience of the Future, I think this absolutely addresses the speed of service issue in a way that
consumers are in control of. So, if you wanted to – maybe you enter a restaurant, you're with your family and you want
to spend a little more time ordering at the self-order kiosk and you want to custom – you can dwell for as long as you
want placing your order, getting it right, enjoying the moment together. And then at a point in time you'd be able to just
be able to go and sit at a table and we'll bring it out to you.
If you want that front counter speed of service in the traditional way, effectively, I would see that speeding up because
effectively some of the larger orders will not be there at the front counter, and they'll just be the more grab and go type
customers. So, and similarly on the drive-through, as we develop and continue to invest in technology and we get our
order ahead and our order and pay capabilities through the app, better defined by through the course of this year, then a
lot of the elements of the McDonald's Express that can slow it down, not just for you but maybe the customer behind
you in the line, are taken out of it. So, we believe we can have technology do a lot of that heavy-lifting, and, A, the
experience will be better, and, B, the service time will improve as a result.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question's from Nicole Miller Regan of Piper Jaffray.
<Q - Nicole M. Miller Regan>: Thanks. Good morning. In the U.S., when you think about grocery store deflation, if it
were to lessen, do you expect to have more guests that were eating at home return that would account for increases in
guest traffic? Or would you expect to have more pricing power to use with the current guests you have? Thanks.
<A - Kevin M. Ozan>: Hey, Nicole. Thanks for the question. Yeah, we do expect kind of the food at home, I'll call it,
deflation to ease or not be as favorable as it was in 2016. The IEO industry is still projected to be relatively muted in
2017. But I think what it does is, as you know, we look at various factors when we look at pricing. We'll look at food
away from home inflation and food at home inflation, and competitors to determine the right kind of approach to our
pricing. I think it gives us an opportunity to potentially gain some customers back that are right now eating at home.
Again, as Steve mentioned earlier, we do have to be careful on the pricing side. With balancing price increases with
continuing to grow guest counts. And so, we will take a close look to make sure that we don't get too far ahead on our
pricing at the expense of guest counts. But certainly if grocery store prices continue to rise or aren't as favorable in
2016, we view that as a positive for some of our traffic.
<A - Stephen J. Easterbrook>: Nicole, it's just a different perspective on the same question actually is, typically,
clearly, we've always been part of the food away from home market. You may have noticed, we've been curious here as
to whether there's an opportunity for us to serve the food at home market as well. So, we have initiated very, very early
stages just a small pilot test done in Florida to see whether home delivery could be something that helps to address
consumer demand, both at home as well as us meeting their demand when they're away from home. So that doesn't
necessarily answer your pricing equation, but we're curious as to whether the demand that's there for food at home is
something that we could also play a part in.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question is from John Glass of Morgan Stanley.
<Q - John Glass>: Thanks very much. Question about the SG&A. First just the specific one is, your sense of timing of
when you're going to get the full $500 million changed? I think initially you'd said most of it in 2017. Maybe the
refranchising has changed that a little bit. And then, so 2017 versus 2018 quantity.

And then secondly, is it right to think that $2.1 billion is the right number, or is there going be some reinvestment in the
business or growth in SG&A over time? It sounded like, Steve, from your language in release that we're redirecting
some capital in G&A spending towards strategic initiatives. So, I'm wondering if you're shifting a little more to putting
more money back into the business, and therefore the $2.1 billion isn't the right anchor point for G&A in 2018.
<A - Kevin M. Ozan>: Thanks, John. Couple pieces of that question. One, I'd say, we are on track certainly with our
original plans for 2016, if not potentially a little bit ahead from a timing perspective. We'll give a little more update at
the Investor Meeting in March as far as kind of how we think about G&A through 2018 as well as going forward. The
one other piece I would say is, when we gave that target and we have not changed on this, is, it's a net-savings target.
Meaning that it contemplates a reinvestment within it. So, we're not going to say that we're saving money and then
reinvesting it all so that you don't see kind of a net reduction in G&A. You should expect to see a net reduction in G&A
that also incorporates what we need to invest in the business in order to grow.
<A - Stephen J. Easterbrook>: Yeah, John, just to tag on any comments you've heard me say previously. I'm firmly of
the belief that we do have sufficient resource given that the targets that Kevin outlined. A part of the culture that we are
embracing here is to create a heightened level competition for those resources. If you have a limited pool of capital and
that limited pool of G&A, only the best and biggest ideas get funded. So, whether that's the market level or corporate
level. And I was on the receiving end of that when I was a Managing Director back in the UK. And you had to fight for
your capital. You had to demonstrate you could deliver better returns than the person in the market next to you. Not in
an antagonistic way, but it was a performance-based environment. And as we have heightened accountability across our
business that's part of it. So I think we don't see those numbers going back up again. I think there's sufficient resource
for us to deliver the great growth that we're planning.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question's from Andrew Charles of Cowen.
<Q - Andrew Charles>: Great. Thank you. Looks like in 4Q you made some nice strides in the refranchising initiative,
but your gains were little light relative to the average in the first three quarters of 2016. So, just wondering can you
speak as to the geographic mix of stores to your franchise whether the proceeds for store in 4Q relative to what you did
in the first nine months of the year? Thanks.
<A - Kevin M. Ozan>: Yeah, Andrew. So the refranchising is impacted by a couple things. One, it depends on where
we're refranchising obviously, but it also depends on whether we're refranchising individual stores or potentially, what
I'll call, entire markets kind of developmental licensee. What you will have seen in 2015 and for a large piece of 2016
is that a lot of the refranchising would be in our markets, in the Foundation (sic) [Foundational] segment as well as a
little bit in the High Growth segment, and a couple of the markets in the International Lead segment where we're doing
more of our conventional franchising.
It does get impacted by the mix of stores within every country as well as how far along each country is in their
franchising journey, if you will. So, some that have more ways to go, let's say, may get higher proceeds at the
beginning as they're selling some higher volume stores. As they get near the end of their refranchising, they're now
selling generally lower volume restaurants and then wouldn't have the same level of proceeds. So, you can see
relatively a relative swing from quarter-to-quarter or from year-to-year depending on the mix of which countries are
actually selling the restaurant.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question's from [ph] Greg Frankfurt (47:00) of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q>: Hey, guys. Can you talk a little bit about remodeling, particularly in the U.S. where you stand the kind of returns
you are seeing on the remodeled stores, and I guess how you view it? Do you view part of the investments maintenance
capital, some of it as growth capital? I guess, how do you look at that sort of cost and return framework?
<A - Kevin M. Ozan>: Yeah. Thanks, [ph] Greg (47:25). Right now, we are a little over half way through the
restaurants that being modernized in the U.S. As you know, we're certainly much farther along in most of the
international countries where we're certainly more modernized and are just now investing in the experience of the
future aspects of it. In the U.S. a lot of our restaurants need to have both the experience of the future element as well as
the remodeling perspective.

Page 11 of 13
In general, in the U.S., we have seen kind of 5% to 6% sales bumps as we remodel a restaurant or bring it up to
modernized standards. That's relatively consistent around the world. It ranges a little bit, but I'd say kind of a 5% to 6%
sales above market is a pretty good threshold that we use. And the U.S. you'll hear some more plans as we get into our
March 1st Investor Event. But we are planning to continue to modernize the U.S.'s state over the next few years.
<A - Stephen J. Easterbrook>: And, [ph] Greg (48:36), just to add to that. I mean, Kevin's absolutely right.
Maintenance spend is largely the responsibility of the Owner/Operator. So, we will have maintenance spend in our
small pool of McOpCo restaurants but fundamentally our capital investment and our co-investment is on growth
initiatives and that will be customer facing, either it gives us a chance to enhance the menu or enhance the experience.
But we're very much growth focused in how we invest directly or co-invest our capital dollars.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question's from Jeremy Scott of CLSA.
<Q - Jeremy Scott>: Good morning. I just want to talk a little bit about the store consolidation in the U.S. First, how
many stores would you estimate are expected to come off the system over the next three years to five years? And then,
just in the context of the guest count discussion, and to what extent is McDonald's exposure to weakening retail trade
zones impacting traffic? Is there a new equilibrium point for store penetration in the U.S.?
<A - Stephen J. Easterbrook>: So, the eating out market Jeremy is huge. And we see IEO as modest, very modest
growth potential. But a gentle growth potential over the next handful of years. That puts you into a market share fight.
And but that's still having a relatively small percentage of that overall informal eating out market, there's plenty of
customers out there eating out. We just need to fight harder and make sure that we earn the right for more of them to
turn our way. So I believe there's guest count growth potential there if we do the right things.
With regard to the new restaurants, I don't know if Kevin has any more details other than mine. But, we are typically a
net growth company. We've had one or two years over the last decade where we have looked to address the portfolio
when we've chosen to take a particular project and just deal with the title, the locations which are no longer appropriate
for us. But I don't see that being a contraction, frankly.
<A - Kevin M. Ozan>: Globally certainly you'd see several probably net – near the thousand restaurants that we've
been on track, I'll say. In the U.S., you wouldn't see a lot of growth over the next couple of years as we'll probably
focus most of our investment dollars on the Experience of the Future and remodeling as we talked about.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question is from Brett Levy of Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Brett Levy>: Good morning. Can you provide for us a little bit more updates on the technology front?
Specifically, what you're expecting out of the U.S. as you expand out your mobile and your mobile ordering? And also
if there's any reference points you can give us from either Scandinavia, Australia or France that provide any
background for what kind of sales lifts or returns you're expecting? And how are you quantifying what's the success on
it? Thank you.
<A - Stephen J. Easterbrook>: Yep. Thanks, Brett. Well, I mean the quantification is satisfied customers and growth
in sales and transactions. So I mean we've got absolute hard measure expectations because we're investing significantly
in technology as are our Owner/Operators.
Just to give you some texture here in the U.S. for example where we've launched – the global mobile app launched here
in the U.S. We've now had 18 million downloads. We've had over 11 million of those are registered users. And the
month of December, 2016, saw the greatest contribution to sales via the app that we've seen yet, and that has been
growing month-by-month-by-month.
It's still – it's noticeable now, but not material, so clearly our ambition is to make that a material number. Elsewhere
around the world, we are testing different elements of food technology that we can incorporate together. So for
example, order-and-pay – for example, whether it's through the Internet or through the app, we're testing that. We're
testing curbside check-in where if you can pull up into the parking lot, you can actually pull up into a dedicated bay
where you can just scan your order and we can bring it out to you. Plus also, a lot of the in-restaurant technology is

maximizing the consumer benefit of the self-order kiosks.
Again, you can just check your preorder and just scan it at the kiosk and sit straight down and get the table service, and
also to help support on that is around the whole area of CRM and loyalty where we have a huge opportunity.
Again, at launching, there are others who are further ahead than us. But this is one we've got to get it right. It's better to
be right than to be first to market. And so we're investing a lot of time and effort to best understand what resonates
most of the customers in terms of appreciating their business, and encouraging them more often.
But ultimately at the moment we're focusing on the experiential side, order, pay, curbside check-in, and just making
that experience smoother, easier, more convenient. And then we'll stop building reward mechanisms into that over
time.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question is from Jason West of Credit Suisse.
<Q - Jason West>: Yeah, thanks. Just one quick follow-up and then a question. On the G&A targets, Kevin, I just
wanted to confirm if that includes or excludes the movement in incentive comp that we've seen since you originally
gave those targets. And then a bigger picture question on the March 1 meeting. If you guys – I know you don't want to
give details, but just what's the kind of purpose of the meeting? Is it just to lay out the 2017 guidance? Or is there more
in terms of longer term targets and things like that that you're going be discussing at that meeting? Thanks.
<A - Kevin M. Ozan>: Thanks, Jason. Let me start with the G&A, just to give perspective. As most companies do,
total incentive comp is higher or lower in any given year depending on the company performance. So you'll see in our
earnings release, we split out incentive comp, so you can see that phenomenon, if you will. And you'll see that in 2015,
we incurred a little over $300 million of incentive comp. That was at below targeted performance for us.
In 2016, you'll see that we have a little over $400 million of incentive comp and that was significantly above target
performance for us. So certainly depending on our performance in a year and that's generally operating income growth
and EPS growth, that line could swing from one year to the next.
Having said that, a couple points I want to make. One is, going into 2017 and as you would imagine, we reset that
number to 100% as we go into plan every year, not knowing where we'll end up, obviously. As we go into 2017, so I
mentioned that, in 2015, we had over $300 million, and that was at below target performance. Going into 2017, our
plan at 100% total incentive comp will be less than $300 million. So we're saving some incentive comp on our base
plan because we have less people, obviously.
Second, the other thing I just want to make sure that everyone's focused on is, our focus is really on growing operating
margin. And that – while we are focused on saving G&A and making sure we're efficient, I'm not 100% certain that
everyone in the industry classifies all the costs exactly in the same line item within a P&L. And so we're focused on
operating margin because that's kind of the bottom line of how efficient are you at bringing your total revenues down to
the bottom line, so just wanted to make those few points related to the G&A. And the operating margin as I mentioned,
we grew that substantially in 2016 from 28.1% to 31.5%.
Related to the March 1 Investor event, there'll be a few components of it. One, we will talk about 2017 guidance. As
Chris mentioned, we normally have an outlook section that gives you 2017 guidance in there. We didn't have that in
there this time because we thought we could give you half the story without all the context, and so it would be easier to
do this all at once on March 1. And so part of it will be 2017 outlook, if you will. But it'll also be talking about our
longer term strategies and long-term financial targets and how we expect to get there. And so that's where a chunk of
the time we'll be spent on March 1 at that Investor event.
<A - Stephen J. Easterbrook>: Hey, Jason, just to add to that. We're confident and we're excited about where we've
got the business to over the last two years. And we're certainly confident and excited about the plans we've had. I mean
just to be clear, we're planning growth, like-for-like growth in every major market around the world in 2017 and
beyond. And we want to share the other – find the best way that we can share that excitement and build the creditability
and the confidence in – that you can match our confidence with excitement. So rather than just listen to a plan, we
thought it would be fun to have you to actually experience the plan.

So this will be certainly some content, some meaningful content on the day, but also, this will be an experiential day for
you as well, where we can take people through some of the components that we believe are customer driven, will drive
that guest count growth, we'll talk about drive business growth, drive profitability. But it'll be a varied and fun day and
something – somewhat unique, I think at Investor Day, so we looking forward to it a lot.
Chris Stent
Okay. We are near the top of the hour. So I will turn it over to Steve who has a few closing comments.
Stephen J. Easterbrook
Thank you, Chris. And given this is Chris's last earnings call with McDonald's, I'd like to take a moment to personally
acknowledge Chris and the significant role he has played, not only building and leading a first class IR team but also
the trusted advisor to Kevin and me. On behalf of everyone at McDonald's with whom you've worked and coached over
the years, Chris, thank you very much. We wish you all the best in your new endeavors. And again, thanks to everyone
else for joining us this morning.
So in closing, I want to reemphasize how encouraged I am by the progress we've made. 2016 was a year of purposeful
change. We've built the foundation that's enabling us to transition from turnaround to longer term growth. We remain
focused on the basics of running great restaurants, whilst at the same time driving operating growth, building brand
excitement and enhancing financial value.
As a result, we're now in a position to prioritize initiatives that will further strengthen our business. We look forward to
talking more about our plans in March. As we step up and lead in 2017, I'm energized about the opportunities ahead
and eager to continue our journey to serve McDonald's as the global leader of the IEO industry. Thanks to all of you.
Have a great day.
