Thank you, Lee. And good morning and welcome everyone to the earnings call for our first quarter 2015. I'm going to
start on slide two. So the highlights are there. We earned $3.4 billion after-tax in the quarter, which is up both on a
linked quarter and year-over-year basis. We continued to work to drive growth in all our core businesses. We're
beginning to see it overcome the runoff with non-core portfolios in many areas. At the same time, we continued to
focus on managing expenses carefully. As a result, we are beginning to see more predictable earnings with more
improvement expected ahead.
Both capital and liquidity remain at record levels in our company. We expect to return more capital to shareholders this
year than we had in the past. Revenue on adjusted basis was $21.9 billion for the quarter. From the top of the house,
revenue remains challenging in an environment with below trend economic growth and rate environment which comes
from that. In addition, we remain faithful to our customers' strategy with strong risk management and risk appetite to
ensure we do not repeat the outsize credit losses of the past. With that said, we're seeing our core business stabilizing
across the drivers of the revenue.
This quarter we saw continued growth in our Wealth Management revenue and rebound from the fourth quarter in
trading revenues. In our loan and deposit areas we saw continued core growth albeit subject to continued spread
compression.
Our expense management efforts continue. Year-over-year expenses, excluding litigation costs, are down 6.0%.
Including litigation costs, year-our-year expenses are down 30%. We continued to see our efficiency efforts drive
forward beyond New BAC through our simplified and improved program. We also continued to see progress on LAS
expenses. As proof of our efforts, for the quarter we ended with our head count at a little under 220,000 full-time
employees, a reduction of 4,000 employees for the quarter, about 2% and 19,000 employees year-over-year or 8%. For
the quarter this reduction came to about 35% from LAS and about 65% from the rest of the company.
To put it in a broad context, we are approaching employment levels where we were in early 2008, prior to bringing in
over 100,000 people from Countrywide and Merrill acquisitions. We're doing that through the investments we are
making in technology to reduce costs and they continue to take hold. And we will continue to drive this effort even as
the economy continues to improve and rates rise, helping keep balance to our operating leverage.
During the last year, even while we were reducing those costs and head count, we continued to invest in the
client-facing growth capacity in this company. We've added financial advisors in U.S. Trust and in Merrill Lynch
focused on building for the future. We've added commercial bankers in all our Global Banking areas to help fill in our
franchise. We've added new financial centers in areas of opportunity and we continue to invest in products and
innovation as well as efficiency. A simple example is in our consumer mobile banking space where we now have 17
million mobile banking customers, up over 2 million from last year.
Turning to slide three, you could see what we simply need to do. Each of the four core lines of businesses on the left
hand part of the slide earned above our cost of capital for this quarter. In addition, the aggregate earnings for all those
businesses were $4.4 billion after-tax. The LAS segment had a much smaller loss this quarter showing we are making
progress.
The other areas on the right-hand side of the slide is affected this quarter by the impacts of retirement-eligible incentive
costs and the market-related NII adjustments, which affected the top of the house earnings. Their book there distributed
business over the quarters. What this shows is that we need to keep working LAS to get it to breakeven and the other
will take care of itself in subsequent quarters.
Turning to slide four with regard to CCAR. As previously disclosed, we received a conditional non-objection to our
capital plan. We received the approval for our request to capital actions that we requested in our original submission: a
dividend of $0.05 per share and $4 billion of stock repurchase on the relevant periods. As you can see, the cushion we
have increased from about $2 billion last year, under the tightest constraint, to over $22 billion this year. In both of
those cases, under the tightest constraint after all capital actions.
These quantitative results bode well. However, the conditional approval is an area with which we are focusing and
we're focusing our energy for the September re-submission and beyond. Our efforts are well underway. We are

bringing additional resources to task. We simply have to be the best at CCAR to meet our shareholder objectives in our
company.
To ensure that we achieve that success, I've asked Terry Laughlin to lead our efforts. As many of you know, Terry
helped us clean up the mortgage issues over the last several years. I can assure you that our board and management are
extremely focused on our re-submission and our core process improvement for CCAR 2016 next year. Terry has
retained the team of external experts, increased the internal staffing to ensure we're successful. We've had in-depth
discussions with our regulators regarding the particular specified issues that we need to remediate with the
re-submission and we're focused on getting that done by September.
With that, I'll turn that over to Bruce.
Bruce R. Thompson
Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start on slide five. As Brian mentioned, we recorded $3.4
billion of earnings in the first quarter or $0.27 per diluted share. That compares to $0.25 a share in the fourth quarter of
2014 and a loss of $0.05 if we go back to the first quarter of 2014.
I'd like to note a few items as you review these results. Both first quarter periods include $1 billion in expense for the
annual cost of retirement-eligible incentives awarded. This was $0.06 in EPS impact in each of the first quarter periods.
The first quarter of 2015 also includes a negative market-related adjustment to net interest income of $484 million for
the acceleration of bond premium amortization on our debt securities that's driven by lower long-term rates. That cost
us $0.03 in EPS during the quarter. The other large item that's worth noting as you look at the comparisons is the
outsize litigation amount of $6 billion in the first quarter of 2014.
I'd like to spend just a moment on total revenue comparisons. Our first quarter of 2015 revenue on an FTE basis, if we
exclude the market-related adjustment to NII and a small DVA adjustment, was $29.9 billion during the quarter. If we
compare that to the fourth quarter of 2014 and adjust for the same items, revenue was up $1.7 billion or 8%. And that
8% increase is attributable to a rebound in sales and trading results as well as higher mortgage banking income, and is
offset somewhat by lower net interest income, mostly from two fewer days during the quarter.
If we compare back to the first quarter of 2014 and we further adjust for $800 million in equity investment gains as a
result of monetizing a single strategic investment in the year-ago period, revenue is down a couple hundred million
dollars or 1%, and that's from lower net interest income and lower sales and trading results.
Total non-interest expense during the quarter was $15.7 billion and included $1 billion in retirement eligible costs as
well as $370 million in litigation expense. I will go through the comparisons from an expense perspective. It's several
slides back.
As we look at provision for credit losses during the quarter, they were $765 million and included $429 million in
reserve release versus $660 million in the fourth quarter of 2014.
Preferred dividends during the first quarter were $382 million. And as you all look to update your models given the
preferred issuances that we've had, the majority of which pay semiannually, as you look at preferred dividends, they
should be roughly $330 million in the second and fourth quarters and $440 million in the first and third quarters going
forward based on our existing preferred footprint.
Go ahead and move to slide six on the balance sheet. Our balance sheet was up slightly to $2.14 trillion, and that was
driven almost exclusively by cash balances associated with the deposit growth that we saw during the quarter. We
continued our focus on balance sheet optimization for liquidity as we continued to shift some of our discretionary
portfolio first-lien loans into HQLA-eligible securities.
Loans on a period-end basis were down modestly, reflecting good core loan activity in both our Global Banking as well
as our Wealth Management segments. That was more than offset by seasonally lower card balances in our discretionary
consumer real estate area as well as runoff portfolios.

Deposits were up $34 billion or 3% from the end of the year. And some of that obviously has to do with seasonal tax
activity. We issued $3 billion of preferred stock in the quarter that benefited regulatory capital. And as you look at
common shareholders' equity, you can see it improved, driven both by earnings growth as well as improved OCI. As a
result of those factors, tangible book value increased to $14.79, 7% higher than 12 months ago, and our tangible
common equity ratio improved to 7.5%.
The last point that I would note is that we did add a slide in the Appendix as we updated our capital allocations across
the segments coming into 2015, and the returns that we show you are reflective of those updated capital allocations.
Let's go ahead and flip to slide seven and go through loans. I think from several calls, we're asked frequently about the
decline in reported loans, which are down modestly again from the fourth quarter levels, as you can see on the upper
left-hand chart. I want to make a few points though as we go through this. As we've discussed many times, much of the
movement in loans has been driven by two pieces of non-core loans. The first relates to shifts in our discretionary
mortgage loan levels that are used to manage interest rate risk and predominantly recorded in the All Other unit. Many
times based on the investment decisions that we make, these loans are replaced with debt securities on the balance
sheet.
The other component as you look at loans to consider is the runoff that we have within our LAS unit, which are mostly
home equity loans. As these home equity loans go away, it enables us to reduce our operating costs as we have less
work to do. As you can see, over the past five quarters these non-core loans have declined approximately $59 billion. If
you adjust for that $59 billion though, and I'll go to that upper right-hand box, you can see that actually our loans have
actually increased by $21 billion from the first quarter of 2014. The bottom chart on the slide provides the mix of this
loan growth across our primary businesses. And you can see within our Wealth Management area, we've experienced
strong demand in both consumer real estate as well as securities based lending, and that's led to year-over-year loan
growth within that segment of 10%.
Within Global Banking, we saw a modest growth on a year-over-year basis, but importantly we saw a significant
pickup in activity in the first quarter of 2015 relative to the fourth quarter of 2014. Over that timeframe, loans were up
$6.7 billion or 8% on an annualized basis.
If we move to slide eight and take a look at regulatory capital, this quarter the standardized transition reporting includes
the switch from reporting RWA under the general risk-based approach to Basel 3, and the capital number includes
another year of phase-in for capital deductions. With those changes, our CET1 ratio was 11.1% in 2015 under the new
reporting.
If we go ahead and look at Basel 3 regulatory capital on a fully phased-in basis, our CET1 capital improved $6 billion
during the quarter and was driven by earnings, lower DTA, lower threshold deductions, as well as an improvement in
OCI. That translated under the standardized approach to our CET1 ratio improving from 10% in the fourth quarter to
10.3% in the first quarter of 2015. While under the advanced approaches, the CET1 ratio improved from 9.6% to
10.1%.
As you know, from our 10-K disclosure, we're working with our banking regulators to obtain approval of our models in
order to exit parallel run. Our regulators have requested modifications to certain commercial and other credit models in
order to exit parallel run, which we estimate would increase our advanced approaches RWA and negatively impact the
CET1 ratio that we show here by approximately 100 basis points.
If we look at supplementary leverage, we estimate that at the end of the first quarter of 2015, we continue to exceed the
U.S. rules applicable in 2018. Our bank holding company SLR ratio was 6.3%, and in our primary banking subsidiary,
BANA, we were at 7%.
If we turn to slide nine, long-term debt at the end of the first quarter was $238 billion, down $5 billion from the fourth
quarter of 2014. In the lower left box, you can see that from a maturity profile perspective, we have $16 billion of
parent company debt that matures during the balance of 2015, and we'll be opportunistic as it relates to refinancing that
indebtedness.

Our global excess liquidity sources reached a record level of $478 billion this quarter and now represents 22% of the
overall balance sheet. The increase from the fourth quarter reflects the deposit inflows as well as the shift from
discretionary loans into HQLA securities.
Within the liquidity, our parent company liquidity remains quite strong at $93 billion, and our time to required funding
is at 37 months. During the quarter, we did continue to increase our liquidity coverage ratios at both the parent as well
as at the bank levels. And at the end of the first quarter, we estimate that our consolidated company was well above the
100% fully phased-in 2017 LCR requirement.
On slide 10, net interest income on a reported FTE basis was $9.7 billion, down a couple hundred million from the
fourth quarter of 2014, driven by two fewer interest accrual days during the quarter as well as some spread
compression. If we exclude the previously mentioned market-related adjustment, NII of $10.2 billion was largely in
line with our expectations and lower than the fourth quarter of 2014 given two fewer interest accrual days.
Modest improvements in net interest income, mostly from lower funding costs in the quarter, were offset by some of
the continued pressures that we saw in loan and securities yields as well as balances and new assets coming in at lower
long-term rates. This drove the adjusted net interest yield to 2.28%.
If we look at the movement down in rates during the quarter, our balance sheet did become more asset sensitive
compared to year end such that a 100 basis point parallel increase in rates from the end of the quarter would be
expected to contribute roughly $4.6 billion in net interest income benefits over the next 12 months. Slightly more than
half of that $4.6 billion is on the long end, and just under half is based on the short end.
On slide 11, if we move to expenses, non-interest expense was $15.7 billion in the first quarter of 2015 and included
roughly $370 million in litigation expense. The first quarter of 2015 once again did include $1 billion in annual
retirement-eligible incentive costs, consistent with what we saw in the first quarter of 2014.
Litigation expense during the quarter included FX and RMBS items and was significantly below what we saw a year
ago, which included the cost of the FHFA settlement. While we're on litigation I do want to make sure that you noticed
this quarter that we did get one step closer on our Article 77 settlement, as the appellate court approved the Bank of
New York Mellon settlement in all respects. And I would also note that the deadline for further appeal at this point has
past.
If we exclude litigation and retirement-eligible costs, our total expenses were $14.3 billion this quarter, down nearly $1
billion from the first quarter of 2014 driven by three factors: continued progress on our LAS initiatives, our New BAC
cost savings as well as lower revenue related incentives within Global Markets. Relative to the fourth quarter of 2014,
the expense level on an adjusted basis is up about $0.5 billion on higher revenue-related incentives mostly for the
improved sales and trading results on a linked quarter basis.
Our Legacy Assets and Servicing costs ex-litigation were $1 billion. They improved approximately $100 million from
the fourth quarter of 2014 and more than $500 million if we go back to the first quarter of 2014. And we remain on
track to hit our Q 14 (sic) [Q4 2014] target that we laid out for you of $800 million in LAS costs ex-litigation once
again in the fourth quarter.
Beyond the LAS business, our teams continue to do very good work in optimizing our delivery network as well as our
infrastructure, and as you can see head count was down 8% over the course of the last 12 months.
If we look at asset quality on slide 12, reported net charge-offs were $1.2 billion in the first quarter versus $900 million
in the fourth quarter of 2014. I do want to note that the first quarter of 2015 included a net impact of approximately
$200 million in losses associated with the DoJ settlement that was previously reserved for. And that was offset in part
by recoveries from certain NPL sales. Our Q4 2014 included similar items but with the net adjustment positively
benefiting net charge-offs to the tune of about $163 million.
If we adjust for all these impacts, our net charge-offs during the quarter were $1 billion, which is slightly lower than
what we saw in the fourth quarter of 2014. Our loss rates on the same adjusted basis were at about 47 basis points in the
first quarter of 2015, consistent with what we saw in the fourth quarter of 2014, and both our consumer delinquencies

as well as our NPLs declined from fourth quarter levels. On the commercial front, we did see a slight pickup in
reservable criticized exposure from the fourth quarter of 2014 as we bounce off comparatively low levels.
The first quarter of 2015 provision expense was $765 million. We released $429 million in reserves. Most of those
reserve releases were in our consumer real estate portfolio. While we did see a modest increase in reserves in the
commercial space that was associated with the strong loan growth that we saw during the first quarter.
If we could flip to slide 13 on Consumer Banking, hopefully last week you all saw that and had a chance to review the
filing of our recasted segment results. We mentioned to you during the last earnings call that we made changes in
segment reporting where we moved the home loans into our Consumer Banking segment from CRES [Consumer Real
Estate Services], which left our Legacy Assets and Servicing as a standalone segment. We also moved the majority of
business banking from Consumer Banking to the Global Banking segment which is how we manage the business. All
of these changes have been made retroactively.
Let's go ahead and walk through then the business segment results starting on slide 13 with Consumer Banking. The
results show solid bottom-line performance with earnings of $1.5 billion which is up slightly from the year ago quarter
and down seasonally from the fourth quarter of 2014 which tends to be a better consumer spending quarter. Business
generated a solid 21% return on allocated capital. Total revenue was lower compared to the first quarter of 2014 from a
decline in net interest income, two-thirds of that decline in NII was a result of pushing out and the allocation of a
portion of the market related NII adjustment to the deposits business. Our noninterest income was stable compared to
last year reflecting good growth in both mortgage banking as well as higher card income but was offset by a portfolio
divestiture gain last year of roughly $100 million in the first quarter.
Expenses were managed tightly. Noninterest expense declined from the fourth quarter of 2014 as we continued to
reduce our financial centers and the associated cost driven by consumer behavior patterns shifting to more digital. The
number of mobile banking customers continues to increase. We ended the quarter at roughly $17 million and the
activity from these customers' accounts for roughly 13% of all deposit transactions.
Page 14 we've added some additional slides here to give you a sense as to some of the trends that we're seeing in the
business and key drivers. You can see we remain a leader in many aspects of our Consumer Bank doing business with
nearly half of all U.S. households. If we look at fees compared to the first quarter of 2014, card income was up
modestly despite some affinity portfolio divestitures over the last year. Our card issuance remains very strong. Our
balances did decline as our customers began to pay down holiday spend balance levels and our net charge-offs remain
low at 2.8% and risk-adjusted margins remain high.
If we move to mortgage banking income, it was up 60% as originations for the company ramped up during the quarter.
Year-over-year, first mortgage originations were up 55% to $13.7 billion while our home equity line and loan
originations increased 62% to $3.2 billion. The revenue improvement was driven by these increased volumes as well as
the mix of first lien originations that was 76% weighted towards overall refinance activity. In looking forward, the
pipeline remains strong, up 50% from the end of the year.
Moving to service charges, service charges were down versus the fourth quarter of 2014. This fee line continues to be
muted as more of our customers take advantage of our reward plans and are opening accounts with higher balances. We
also continue to reduce the number of less profitable accounts serviced and migrate customer activity to more
self-service channels. As a result, we're getting the same or slightly better account fees and debit interchange from
fewer accounts which is allowing us to reduce our infrastructure. Expense is declining and if you look at cost of
deposits it's dropped from just less than 2% in the first quarter of 2014 to 1.87% in the first quarter of 2015.
And lastly, as you can see while we're bringing down our overall head count in this business, I want to note that we've
been increasing our sales specialists in the financial centers and their sales are driving client balances higher. For
example, our deposits are up 5% from the first quarter of 2014 and our brokerage assets are up 18%.
If we move to slide 15, Wealth Management; it generated earnings of $651 million during the quarter. If we compare
this to the first quarter of 2014 there's a $78 million decline as the solid fee growth that we saw during the quarter was
offset by lower net interest income and higher expense. Once again the allocation of the market related NII adjustment

drove the decline in NII which more than offset the benefits that we saw from solid loan growth. Our asset management
fees continued to grow driven by strong client flows and higher market levels. Our noninterest expense increased from
the first quarter of 2014 as a result of higher revenue related incentives as well as investments in client facing
professionals.
Our pre-tax margin was 23%, down last year largely impacted by the decline in net interest income. Return on allocated
capital remained strong at 22%.
If we look at the activity in drivers within Wealth Management on slide 16, you can see our asset management fees
continued to grow and are up 10% from the first quarter of 2014, but this was partially offset by some of the
sluggishness that we've seen in transactional revenue within the brokerage line. We do continue to be an employer of
choice in this business, increasing financial advisors by more than 850 individuals over the course of the last 12
months. Our client balances climbed to over $2.5 trillion, up $12 billion from the fourth quarter of 2014 driven by
strong client balance inflows.
Long-term AUM inflows of $15 billion for the quarter were positive for the 23rd consecutive quarter. And as I
mentioned earlier when we discussed loans, we continue to experience strong demand in both our securities-based in
residential mortgage lending areas of the business reaching a new record level in loans during the quarter.
On slide 17 our Global Banking earnings during the quarter were $1.4 billion which generated a 16% return on
allocated capital. Earnings were up 6% from the first quarter of 2014 as the decline in net interest income was more
than offset by lower expense as well as improved provision expense. As we look at NII, the year-over-year decline was
driven by three things, the allocation of the market related to NII adjustment, which I've touched on in previous
segments, the push out of the firm-wide LCR requirements, a good chunk of which goes to Global Banking as well as
some year-over-year compression in loan spreads.
Our provision expense was lower than the first quarter of 2014 by $185 million as we did not build reserves to the same
magnitude as we did in the first quarter of last year. Noninterest expense was down 8% from the first quarter of 2014
driven by three factors, lower technology initiative spend, lower litigation, as well as lower incentive costs.
Moving to the Global Banking metrics on page 18. We chart the components of revenue which shows stability across
the quarters with the exception of NII as I just mentioned. Our investment banking fees companywide during the
quarter were $1.5 billion, down 4% from the first quarter of 2014. I would highlight, during the quarter we recorded the
highest level of advisory fees since the Merrill merger, up 50% from the first quarter of 2014. This helped to offset the
drop that we saw within our leveraged finance business as a result of the regulatory guidance that was implemented
during the first half of 2014.
Equity underwriting was also up nicely, up 10% from the first quarter of 2014. And as you look at the balance sheet,
loans on average were $290 billion, up modestly on a year-over-year basis, but if you looked linked quarter, as I
mentioned earlier, we had a fair bit of momentum ending the first quarter with balances up $7 billion on a spot basis
from the fourth quarter of 2014.
$7 billion improvement was broad-based. We saw middle market utilization rates at levels that we've not seen for six
years at this point, so we feel good about that. And within commercial real estate we saw a linked quarter improvement
as well.
On slide 19, Global Markets, we earned $945 million on revenues of $4.6 billion in the quarter. That was an 11% return
on allocated capital during the quarter. Our earnings were up nicely from the fourth quarter of 2014 but down from the
first quarter as our revenue was down 7% excluding net DVA and FVA. The decline from the first quarter of 2014 was
driven by lower FICC sales and trading results.
On the expense front, noninterest expense was modestly higher year-over-year as we had $260 million in litigation
expense in the quarter. Ex-litigation, expenses were down 7% on reduced levels of revenue-related incentives.
If we look at the Global Markets metrics on slide 20, sales and trading revenue of $3.9 billion ex-DVA and FVA, as I
mentioned was up nicely off fourth quarter of 2014 levels but down 5% from the first quarter of 2014. FICC sales and

trading was down 7% on a year-over-year basis while equities was effectively flat with the year-ago period.
Within the macro-related product areas like FX and rates there was a solid return in volatility and client trading activity
in the quarter while the credit spread traded products area experienced lower activity in line with lower issuance levels
during the quarter. And as you look at and we lay out a mix between macro and credit in the upper right-hand box, and
you can see that our activity tends to be more heavily weighted towards credits spread trading given the position that
we occupy within the issuer market. And the last point I would make on markets, our asset levels were fairly flat while
VaR was below the level that we experienced last year.
Slide 21, Legacy Assets and Servicing, you can see we saw improvement in revenue and expense trends compared to
both periods within Legacy Assets and Servicing. The loss in this segment narrowed to less than $240 million. Revenue
improved as both rep and warrant was down $156 million from the year-ago period and we had a more favorable MSR
hedge performance. Those two factors were partially offset by lower servicing fees as we continued to reduce the
servicing portfolio.
Non-interest expense, ex-litigation, was $1 billion in the quarter, once again improving approximately $100 million
from the fourth quarter and more than $500 million since the first quarter of 2014. Importantly, our 60-plus day
delinquent loans were 153,000 units. That was down 36,000 units or 19% from the fourth quarter of 2014.
If we move to slide 22, All Other, All Other reflects a loss of $841 million and that includes once again the impact of
the annual retirement eligible incentive costs as well as some of the market related NII impact. If we compare this
quarter to the first quarter of 2014, revenue is lower by about $683 million and that was driven by nearly $700 million
in equity investment gains in the first quarter of 2014 compared to essentially nothing in the first quarter of 2015. And
it was partially offset as well by the absence of payment protection costs this quarter compared to about $141 million in
the prior-year quarter.
From a modeling perspective, the effective tax rate during the quarter was about 29%, and as we look out during the
balance of 2015, we'd expect the tax rate to be roughly 30% absent any unusual items.
So I would just wrap up the prepared part of my comments that as we end the quarter, we end the quarter with record
capital. We end the quarter with record liquidity. We'll begin our $4 billion share repurchase program this quarter. The
team is very focused on addressing our CCAR resubmission. Expense management remains a key focus across the
company. Our businesses are showing good activity, including a pickup in lending across several businesses in the
company. Credit quality remains strong, and we remain well positioned to benefit in a rising interest rate environment.
And with that, we'll go ahead and open it up for questions.

[Operator Instructions] And we can take our first question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Hey, thanks very much. So, Brian, very impressive commentary at the beginning of
the call on head count getting back to 2008 levels before CFC and the Merrill Lynch acquisitions. The one question we
get continually from investors is what's left to do on the expenses. You've already got the core expense number coming
into the $13 billion range. So can you give us some sense as to where you go from here on expense management? And
is it steady as she goes, or is there room to become even more efficient?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Right, a couple of things. One is, if you parse the expenses, Betsy, into three basic buckets,
the litigation expense bucket, which you're seeing come down to more reasonable levels. And then there's a cost to that
litigation, the external legal fees and stuff, which we'll continue to see lift in which is in the expense numbers. Then
you have the second bucket, LAS. We're at the $1 billion level. And as Bruce said, we expect to get that down to $800
million and keep moving that to lower numbers over into 2016.

And then you get into the baseline. And I think that the thought on the baseline is even as we reduce the head count, we
continue to reinvest in sales capacity. So just in our consumer business, head count down year over year, but we have
1,000 more salespeople roughly out there selling. And so the idea is to continue to drive salespeople into the businesses
at the same time we're taking out Wealth Management et cetera.
So when you think about the broad expense base, there are adjustments always in the first quarter, second quarter just
because of revenue and stuff in terms of the aggregate amount. But we'll continue to pare away. You can look linked
year-over-year quarters over the last four years you continued to chip away, this year it was 300 head count on the core
base. We'll continue to work at that. But I'd say that a lot of it we're trying to make sure that we create the investment
rate, continue to grow the franchise and their size. This is a matter of holding expenses relatively flat as revenues start
to pick up with expected increase in rates and the economy continue to grow. If that changed, we have to go
aggressively and push down the core also.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Okay.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: And so we manage it every day, and you can see the head count is the leading indicator
because that head count reduction in the quarter really benefits us in the second quarter.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Got it. And then just separate topic on GWIM, and maybe you could give us some
commentary around how you're thinking about the impact of the fiduciary language that's been coming out of the
Department of Labor and also how you deal with the competitive threats coming from Silicon Valley, including some
of the robo-advisor efforts.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: On the first question, John Thiel, who runs Merrill Lynch for us, largely we're affected by
the discussion of fiduciary standards because remember, U.S. Trust is actually a private bank and operates under the
fiduciary standards in most of its activities. So John Thiel does the lead in our business, who does a great job for us, has
been clear. We believe that doing what's in the best interest of our customers is absolutely the right thing to do. And
while this rule has just come out yesterday afternoon and frankly, Betsy, to get prepared for your questions this
morning, I haven't spent a lot of time examining it in detail. But from a basic standpoint, we've been clear that we see
the industry moving and we expect to help move it there.
On the robo advisor, I think that the clear segment match for us in that area in terms of what Schwab and other people
are talking about is really in the Merrill Lynch business, which is below the Merrill Lynch cutoff, for lack of a better
term. So John and his team drive people $250,000 in investable assets free to invest, which is net worth's $0.5 million,
$1 million and up range of the client and then Dean Athanasia and his Preferred team drive this business below that.
And if you look in our information, you'll see that that business has got about $118 billion of brokerage assets. It's
growing faster than the industry. Year-over-year I think the assets are up 18%. The number of accounts is up. The sales
levels are up. And so that's really the automated rebalancing portfolios and stuff like that, and we're driving that
through as a core execution. And by the way, they also refer tens of thousands of customers a year up to Merrill Lynch
at the same time, so we're trying to have the best of both worlds.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Okay, thanks. You've been a leader there, so I appreciate that color. Thanks.

less than that?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think what we wanted to disclose, Matt, is that I think that we're coming out of the
disclosure that we had in the 10-K, there were a lot of questions. And you're absolutely right that what we disclosed
today was the requested amount from our banking regulators to exit parallel run. That was the ask on their behalf.
Discussions continue, but we didn't want to put out there what the ask was.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. In terms of timing of a conclusion on that?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think those things are always hard to predict, but we're obviously working hard to get
through it over the next quarter or so.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. And then just related, obviously capital build was very good this quarter, up
50 basis points, so you essentially got half that back already. But assuming that 100 basis point hit goes through, are
there additional RWA levers to pull or model adjustments in the future that we can think about?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Now you asked a very good question, which is that to the extent that there's an adjustment
in the RWA, you obviously as you look to refine and improve your models always have the ability to work hard to get
that back, but there's obviously a lot of scrutiny with respect to models. But your point is spot on as there would be the
opportunity as we work through and look to refine, improve, and become better with our models to get some of that
back over time.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: And, Matt, in the broader context, we have flipped the binding constraint in our company
to some degree with a move to advanced. And so therefore, continue to look the balance sheet, what mix of businesses
and how you approach the businesses, changes again because standardized was a constraint we are focused on and was
our binding constraint. Now it's going to flip to Advanced, as you can see in the numbers and that then just expect us to
be as aggressive and as adept at thinking through how we mix the businesses right to make sure that we are focused on
that constraint now that it's become a binding one.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you.

And we can take our next question from Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Thank you very much. On your Legacy Asset Servicing, in your discussions you said that the
loans went down from 36,000 loans in the quarter. Did you sell any loans in the quarter?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: There was some servicing of loans that was moved as well as the outright sale of some
non-performing loans. So there was some inorganic activity. But as you look at those reductions, it was very strong
from both organic as well as inorganic. And I'd say the other thing that we're seeing, Paul, is just less new
delinquencies coming in than what we would have expected. So you've got the benefit of less coming in, you've got the
benefit of working through some of what you have, and then we're supplementing that with moving additional out.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: I know one of the things out there is what we're seeing or hearing is that there's a strong market
right now for people wanting to buy either re-performing or non-performing loans. Are you going to use that as an
advantage to start moving this stuff off your books quicker?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: We have been using it as an advantage. If you go back and look at the results, Paul, I
think we were one of the first out there that started to move those loans in the first half of 2014. We've been
aggressively doing that both to take the risk of the loans off as well as to move the servicing. And I think if you look at
the impact of that and how it flows through different things, you really get a good sense when you look at some of the
CCAR results where the loss content that we had, particularly within both first mortgages as well as home equity, has
come down. So we've been at that for some time at this point.

<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Paul, I think overall remember that as you get further and further removed from the crisis,
what's left over even though at the time when we set up LAS or set up some of these non-core portfolios would have
been a product or service you didn't want to continue. Seven years later you're seeing the customers are left over and
paid. And so there's a good bit, but also we want to make sure we measure the economics of the portfolios. Now that
they are much smaller, the risk is way down. And so we judge that really on the basis of who the customer is and
whether we want to roll them into the core loans in our company and then also what the economics of the outside are.
So I wouldn't expect us to change our course there. We're just going to look opportunistically at how to keep moving in
the right direction. On both servicing and assets we own too because remember, Paul, there's also the servicing side of
this even though we don't own the assets, there is a strong bid, even the agencies are moving to move some portfolios.

And we can take our next question from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Hey, good morning.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Good morning.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: I just want to follow up on the capital discussion. You guys had pretty good progress on the
Advanced approach up 50 basis points quarter-over-quarter but the gap between Standardized and Advanced is still
very large. And I guess if you have to go through with the 400 basis points I guess about 120-basis-point gap versus
your peers that are less than half that. I guess is the big difference operational risk because of the larger litigation you
face over the last couple of years? And how do we think about that coming down and getting more in line with the
peers? Is that just a time sort of as you get further away from that, those op risks come down or how else do we think
about the trajectory of the closing of the gap?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Your point is exactly right which is that as we talked about last quarter that the op risk
relative to the total Advanced RWA was upwards of 30%. That's obviously higher than our peers. It's something that
we're working hard on to be able to drive down. And to your point the question is when are you able to get benefit from
declining litigation trend as we wrap up the legacy matters and that does take some time. Obviously the last two
quarters from a litigation perspective have been much lighter than what we experienced going back several years.
So it's up to us to continue to work that and to look to convince people that the level of op risk capital should come
down given the resolution of the matters. And I'd just highlight that once again whether you look at Article 77, there
was an Ocala litigation matter that was wrapped up as well as on the RMBS front with settlements that we got through
this quarter, we're roughly 99% of all threatened or filed litigation with respect to RMBS. So we continue to work
through that and drive through that and ultimately the benefit from that should be lower op risk capital from an RWA
perspective.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Right. And sorry, is it a negotiation process on the models with regulators? Or is it, could it
be sort of a step function? Or is it really just time value as you move further away? I'm just trying to understand the
process.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think in all these cases, clearly that we work closely with our supervisors on all
model-related activity. And as you look to make changes that are to the good you obviously need to work through your
regulators to get those put through.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Okay, fair enough.

<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I think as you think forward remember, you saw a good capital build this quarter and we'll
continue to build. But remember that we keep on the course of earnings that we expect and the issue wasn't CCAR last
year when we went for the ask, you have to remember we came off a really low just nominal earnings environment and
so we retained a lot of capital between now and next time we can actually ask to change the capital position of the
company and we have a big cushion. So we'll close this gap relatively quickly and then we have a longer-term question
of what you're saying, which is as op risk runs off how do you get that reflected ultimately in your capital requirements
and same with the models and the other upside.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Right. And to your point the stress test is based on Standardized, not Advanced.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Yes.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: But just one quick follow-up elsewhere. On the FICC revenues, just can you talk about the
trajectory over the quarter? Did it improve in March? It sounded like some of your peers have talked about a slow start.
Did it get any better in March? Or how do we think about the trajectory through the quarter?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I'm always hesitant to comment on results given that we're nine days into the new quarter.
But I think if you look at what we saw from both, I would say both a sales and trading as well as an overall investment
banking fee perspective that January on the margin was a little bit slower than what we would've expected and we saw
activity and momentum build up throughout the quarter to where – if you had to grade which of the three months of the
quarter do you feel best about, it was clearly March. And like I said, we're only nine trading days into the new quarter,
but we've not seen anything change directionally. Some of the activity that we saw in March we've continued to see in
April.

And we can take our next question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
<Q - Glenn Paul Schorr>: Thanks very much. A quick question on proposal eight in the proxy. I mean I don't think
the regulators want it to happen. I don't think it should happen. I assume you've been doing a lot of the work on this
along the way for the last couple of years. But curious why the board is so against shareholders voting for it and what
you actually have to do if it does get the yes vote?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I think, as I think you read the response in the proxy, Glenn, you'll see this is a core board
duty and they do look at it periodically and think about the optimal company structure, capital structure. So the idea to
have a special element around it is really – the whole board looks at it and that's who should look at it. So and then the
technical terms of what the request is are a little hard to understand when you think about how a company really
operates. But we do look at the question of do we have the optimal business mix? Is it optimal for shareholders and the
board will look at it continuously and we'll continue to look at?
<Q - Glenn Paul Schorr>: Okay. I appreciate the comments you made on the increased asset sensitivity. And if I
remember the numbers correctly it sounds like more of the increased sensitivity came out on the long end. So I guess
my question is, it's great you make a lot more money if the curve shifts up 100 basis points but I think a lot of people
are more fearful of what happens if we get into a flattener environment. So is it as simple as you capture at least half
the benefit by short rates going up and if we're in a flattener that's where it ends?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think a couple things, Glenn. The first is that becoming – in many respects we were at
$3.5 billion – $3.6 billion at the end of the year, and we went to $4.5 billion – $4.6 billion this quarter. Keep in mind a
chunk of what you see as far as becoming more asset sensitive is just the FAS 91 that we lost during the quarter, so I'd
keep that in mind. And to your point, you're exactly right. If you looked at where we were at year end, I think we were
just over in the $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion benefit from short rates moving and that has not changed materially. So to
your point, the asset sensitivity is based almost solely on long-term rates and given the deltas that we saw change from

We'll take our next question from John McDonald with Sanford C. Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Hi, Bruce. Just to follow up on that. In terms of if rates kind of stay pretty flat, what
kind of outlook would you have for the core NII if we take the $10.2 billion this quarter as a jumping off point? Do
have any room to lower the debt costs from here? Or how would you expect the core NII to trend if we don't see too
much movement on rates?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: It's something we spent a lot of time on, John. When we got to the end of the first quarter,
we looked at it and said during the balance of 2015 what's the impact that we would see if in effect we rolled a spot
throughout 2015, which just means that you don't get the benefit of the curve as we go through. And if you look at that,
it's roughly a couple of hundred million dollars a quarter relative to $10 billion of NII. So we think that we've done
between the debt footprint, deposits, and if you actually look at the clean yields during the quarter, Q4 to Q1, that we've
done a pretty good job of managing this exposure in what's been a tough environment. But to your question, there's
probably a couple of hundred million dollars a quarter in risk if you rolled a spot.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Got it. And that couple of hundred million over a couple of quarters, right?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: It'd be about $200 million per quarter over the next three quarters.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Got it. And that's just kind of core leakage from new stuff coming on at lower yields
and you're not investing much in a low rate environment?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: That's correct.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: And continuing to shorten the balance sheet every time we get a chance to.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And then just switching gears, Bruce, on the credit side, do you see the net
charge-offs kind of bouncing around $1 billion per quarter level? Or is there room for those to come down? Or is that
kind of stabilizing? And how should we think about reserve releases from here relative to the $400 million or so you
did this quarter?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: A couple things on that. I'd say that we continue to see, John, if you look at within the
consumer space and overall consumer credit, the first quarter typically, all other things being equal, is the toughest
consumer quarter in the first quarter. So I think there's probably a little bit of room there if we continue to see what we
see in the economy on the consumer side. The tougher piece of it's probably to judge commercial because, outside of
what we see in the small business lending, there really haven't been many charge-offs and we'll just have to see how
long that benign environment covers.
On the reserve release for the quarter, the one thing I want to make sure that we point out is that while we released
$400 million plus of reserves, $200 million of that was from the DoJ where with the mailings you had both charge-offs
in reserve release. So as it relates to just from as you look at the provision perspective, realize that which impacted the
provision was more or like $200 million.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. So that should be something – the jumping off point is more or like a $200
million reserve release number?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yeah, and I think we've said that we clearly expect reserve releases to moderate. So we'll
have to see as we roll into the quarters but I think you're directionally right on your charge-off number and we'll see if

there's anything left in the reserve releases as we go through the second and third quarters.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. Last quick thing from me. In terms of rep and warrants, the slide 26, I'm not
sure if you mentioned this already, Bruce. There was a pickup in the claims, the new claims this quarter. It showed a
big increase. Just what's the driver of that? Why would those show up now? And any color you can provide on whether
that's a concern or not?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think you need to go down to – and we laid out in the footnote but if you start up in the
new claim trends, if you recall, there's a case going through where the statute of limitations on rep and warrant claims
in the ACE case was found that the statute was six years and if you look at the claims that you see up in the new claim
trends, you can see virtually all of those claims were in the pre-2005 through 2006 area. So absent any tolling a good
chunk of those are going to be time barred. The other part that I would – the other point that I would mention is if you
go down to the footnote, you can see that the vast majority of these claims were put in with no file worked on
whatsoever, or no individual loan work that was done. So I think there continues to be obviously activity on that front
but there's not a lot of work being done as those claims are being filed.

We'll take our next question from Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Good morning.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Good morning.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: So, Bruce, I just wanted to touch on the preferreds for a moment. So I saw that you
completed another $3 billion of issuance in the quarter but seeing as you're already at the 150-basis-point target
contemplated under Basel 3, whether it's fair to assume that you're now full on pressed at the moment and we shouldn't
expect any additional issuance?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think you're absolutely right that we got the bucket filled up this quarter. I think the only
thing that's out there is depending on exactly where we come out from an overall RWA perspective as we exit parallel
run that beyond 2015 could there be a couple of billion dollars more preferred sometimes during 2016. That's a
possibility. But you're absolutely right that based on where we are from an RWA perspective, the bucket is filled up, so
we don't see much if any at all in 2015, maybe a little bit in 2016 but not much.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Excellent. Thanks for clarifying that, Bruce. And I suppose since you mentioned RWA, one
thing I just wanted to clarify I believe it was relating to your response to Jim where you noted that for CCAR it only
contemplates the Standardized approach but I just wanted to know if that determination had been finalized, since some
are speculating that the Advanced approach could be incorporated within the CCAR exam going forward?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yes. There is an open question out there that you're absolutely right that for the different
CCAR submissions that went in, in 2015 that those submissions are against the standard ratios. And as an industry, we
just don't know the answer if we will test under just Standardized in CCAR 2016 or if advanced will be brought in. I
think that's an open question that's out there for the industry.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: And do you have a sense at least for the moment as to what the impact would be on RWAs
if they were to incorporate the advanced approach versus the Standardized?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think if you look at the numbers, you can see the difference that we have within our
numbers. As to Advanced, I think the open question that's out there as you look at moving to Advanced in a CCAR

scenario is that under Advanced you hold capital for op risk and then there's the open question if you go to stress test
under Advanced, what do you do with respect to CCAR and those op risk litigation type items. And like I said, that's an
open question for the industry.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Right. But would it be fair to expect that because it is, the advanced calculation is more
pro-cyclical in nature that the RWA is calculated under a period of stress would be higher versus the Standardized?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: There's no question that there's a pro-cyclical aspect of it, that intuitively I think you're
right but until you understand exactly the completeness and the entire picture of what you're looking at, I just don't
want to speculate.

We'll take our next question from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kenneth Michael Usdin>: Thanks, good morning. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the
investments in brokerage services business. The metrics continue to look very strong as far as assets gain but the
growth rate on year-over-year basis looks like it slowed considerably. Any context you can provide around revenue
generation? And is there a potential catch-up that we should see or expect going forward based on either markets or just
activity levels?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: From a high-level that team has continued to invest in growth and there's a couple of
things driving that. One is, they're adding more core advisors, so within the last 12 months I think we added 120
experienced advisors and we added almost 900 advisors total. So in that there's a carry cost to bring those up but that's
good for the future.
The second thing is there's a little bit of a business mix issue which is that the investment management side of the
business continues to grow, but we've seen weakness in the brokerage transactional side just as the business gets
repositioned and that sort of year-over-year is enough to hit you. And then third frankly is that the NII that Bruce
pointed out earlier, just the way we allocate and we won't let businesses take an excuse for intercompany allocations
but the way we allocate year-over-year a big chunk of the NII loss is just due to the way we allocate out the impact
from the markets and the less NII.
<Q - Kenneth Michael Usdin>: Okay. And then secondly, just extending that to some of the other consumer fee lines,
card income flattish and service charges down a bit, is this customer-behavior driven or an additional repositioning in
there? And can you talk about growth expectations on the consumer side as well?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I think as Bruce talked about earlier, if you think about the couple of broad things, one is
as we continue to drive to be the core checking account for households, we're seeing higher sales, we're seeing higher
primary sales but with that comes less fees in a sense but the average balances are higher. And so what you're seeing is
a lower – a flattening of the fees charged on accounts overdraft and other fees while you see an increase in the
consumer balances which in this environment were something but will be worth a lot more as rates rise because these
are core checking accounts. So there is some elements of how the business has been shifted based on our priority of
making sure that we just don't have a lot of checking accounts, we have a lot of core checking accounts and that's
caused it.
So you're seeing a far faster growth in balances and actually a slight decline in total checking accounts out there. When
you put debit fees and other fees plus the interest rate together which is the core checking revenue it's actually a little
better picture. But that's the kind of the story there. On the credit card fees, it's basically we've absorbed most of the
compression on the interchange at this point in the rebates we give. So really year over year you had a bit of loss there
because of the divestiture of a big affinity program, two big affinity programs that hurt us and you should expect to see

that a little bit more in line with our spending growth going forward, which has been about 3% – 4%.
<Q - Kenneth Michael Usdin>: Okay. And then last one just, Bruce, you mentioned on the discretionary portfolio and
the switch out to HQLA. Can you give us a sense of just how much more of that mix shift we should expect, or at some
point do you get to a point where the loan portfolio finally starts to bottom out?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think a couple things, so that the shift to the discretionary portfolio you probably have
about $5 billion of that in each of the second quarter and the third quarter of this year, and at that point that work is
done. I would say as you look at just discretionary mortgage balances and what you're seeing from a payments for the
old stuff that was put within the investment portfolio, you're probably looking at before what the new is that we put on
within the business that you're in the $10 billion to $14 billion type runoff in each of the next couple quarters. Realize
all that net interest income doesn't go away because there's reinvestment of that and there are new loans coming in, but
you do have probably two more quarters where we'll move stuff into securities, and obviously there does continue to be
a runoff of that portfolio as well.

We'll take our next question from Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Thanks very much, just one quick question on the legal expense that was incurred in this
period. Are those issues now – the FX and the RMBS, are those issues now settled or are they ongoing?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: The RMBS piece I quoted, there were both amounts in litigation for things that were
settled as well as accruals during the quarter. And once again, Eric, I go back to that from an RMBS perspective at this
point, we're 98% or 99% of threatened or filed claims on original UPB that we're through. So that's where we are with
the RMBS.
With respect to the FX piece, I think if you go back and look at where we said that we were in October, that we
resolved the matter with the OCC. The top-up that we saw in the quarter related to FX with respect to other banking
regulators. And there was also the resolution and we're working through the final documentation of the civil piece of
the overall FX work. And that's all included within the litigation reserve during the quarter.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Okay. And so just so I understand that last point, the civil component, is that with the DoJ
or some other authority?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: No, the civil piece with respect to a class-action type matter, not the DoJ.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Oh, I see. Okay. But that was contained within the accrual in this period?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: That's correct.

<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: What are your financial targets for 2015 and 2016?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Mike, as we said, our goal is to continue to drive towards 1% return on assets and
depending on where we end up with capital between 7.5% and 8% tangible common equity ratio. That would translate
into a 13% down to 12% return on tangible common equity. In this quarter we moved up to where we have our return
on tangible common equity was 8%., and our return on assets was 64 basis points. So we're two-thirds of the way to
that goal.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And what timeframe do you expect to get then?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I think if you adjust our earnings this quarter for a couple things, the FAS 123, the FAS 91,
and then continue to think of LAS normalizing, you see us get close to that goal. And that should happen between now
and the end of 2016 because we just keep chunking away at LAS, as we described to you.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: So is that your specific financial target too? What's your target for 2015 when it comes to your
financial metrics?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Mike, I think the way you asked that is we basically have to give you our earnings
estimates for 2015, and we just don't do that. But our targets long term we told you each time you've asked us is the
same, 1% return on assets and a 12% to 13% return on tangible common equity based on where we think our tangible
common equity ratio will settle out.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay. I guess when I look back at 2014, I ask myself the question did Bank of America meet its
financial targets, and I have trouble because I'm not sure if you had a specific targets just for the year 2014 as opposed
to your longer-term targets.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: We made $4 billion and change last year against the expectations by you and your
colleagues of, I don't know, $15 billion. So clearly, we didn't meet the financial targets due to the litigation we took last
year.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay. Let me just ask a separate question then. Glenn Schorr brought up Proposal 8 in the
proxy. And I guess my reaction is why not give more information on the trade-offs of the business model. One of your
competitors gave three slides on this topic at their Investor Day. They weren't asked to do this, and they had some
higher ROE and ROA. So more information I think would be good. And in the proxy it says that your board believes
that the proposal would not enhance stockholder value. If that's the conclusion of the board, I guess why not share some
of the insights of the board to investors?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: The insights we have when you look at the returns on page two or three of the material
show that the core businesses return above our cost of capital. And the mix between them and the revenue synergies
and the diversity we get have been there. But let's back up. What a lot of people are looking at here, Mike, is can you
simplify your company to make it tighter. We started that in 2010 with about – I don't know – $4 trillion of assets,
we're down to $2.1 trillion. We started with about $70 billion in capital or $80 billion in capital. We're up to $140
billion. And we started by getting rid of 60 operating businesses. And so we've done a lot of simplification.
What's really left, and this is one of the reasons why our Markets business is more constrained in its growth prospects
potentially than some other people's because we keep it to about a third of the franchise in terms of size. So that
Markets business is really focused on driving the value of our issuer-side customers going to the market and then with
our investor-side customers providing sources of capital for that. So it's a very synergistic basis. So we'll continue to
provide insight. But if you look at it, the businesses return above their cost of capital. And then if we put them out there
the question would be what would we look like after, and we'd have capital we can't deploy and we'd have less earnings
power.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: All right. If you can share additional insights into that conclusion in addition to what you just
gave, that would be great at least in the future. Thanks a lot.

And we can take our next question from Nancy Bush with NAB Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Good morning, Nancy
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Good morning.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: I have sort of one straightforward question and one that's more existential. I'll ask the
straightforward one first. Brian, could you just restate your position on paying or raising the dividend? I know the
CCAR this year has distorted that a bit. And if you could, just state how you feel about dividends versus buybacks.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I think number one on terms of we received approval for what we had asked for, which is
$0.05 a share dividend and $4 billion of stock buyback in the CCAR. And we had to be conservative in that ask,
leaving aside modeling and other questions but just had to be conservative in the base ask, because if you think about
our run rate of earnings was such that we are coming off a $4 billion plus earnings quarter, we had to keep our head on
in terms of how we're accumulating capital and make sure we earned the capital before we paid it out.
The second thing is that the $22 billion cushion shows that based on all the work to CCAR we have a strong cushion
going forward. So the key for us to be able to increase the dividend and continue to push forward is to get that
normalized earnings stream in a couple of quarters, $3 billion plus of earnings we're getting. Long term we expect
many times our ultimate goal is to take about 30% of our recurring earnings to pay it out in dividends and then use the
rest for capital management. At this price, we'd be buying stock back. And if there's a different scenario where our
multiple to book and earnings multiples are higher, we might pay additional dividends, but the goal would be about
30% payout ratio of recurring earnings as we get there.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Okay, thank you. The second one is this, and this is maybe a little bit more difficult to
answer. You had a good trading quarter, but we've seen one of your competitors have a much better trading quarter.
And I know that there is a mix issue there. But also as I look at the composition of your businesses there, have you sort
of derisked the trading desk to the point where you can't really take full advantage of the volatility in markets? And I'm
wondering if you see that as the case, and secondly, if there will come a time when you're able to do some risking there.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I think, Nancy, what you asked is really the core question which is if you look a few years
ago we put a core capital Global Markets out as a separate reported segment to ensure that people saw that that was a
less volatile earnings stream than people perceived and it was not the earnings stream in the Global Banking segment;
i.e., Investment Banking, which you can see the fees move up or down but relatively stable, and clearly the loan book
in the treasury services. So we tried to sort the businesses so people could see what we're doing in Global Markets.
Based on our capital and based on our view of how the franchise fits together, we keep that business to about a third of
our total size. Its total balance sheet deployed is under $600 billion and has been for years. That then requires Tom and
the team to make a series of choices how to deploy that based on our appetite for risk expressed by VaR, our appetite
for size expressed by the $600 billion which other people have far bigger balance sheet deployed to business and that
then does limit their ability to take risk and do certain things.
So there is a mix issue based on this quarter and other quarters we've performed better relatively and that's the issue.
But from a core standpoint, it's not an existential question at all. It is an actual determination we made to have our SIFI
buffer lower, to have our overall risk lower and demand the company which is really customer focused on the core
banking middle markets franchise and the foreign investors. It's still be big enough to be very impactful, number one
research house in the world and have $3.5 billion, $4 billion of revenue on a given quarter. We had to basically
optimize around size, capital, capital deployment business and then risk we're willing to put in the P&L and that's
where we ended up and that's resulted in us having 100 basis points less SIFI buffer requirement than other people.
And we think that's balanced because with our book of business we increased that. We got to carry that 100 basis points
across the whole franchise, not just the market's business and that extra capital in our balance would really increase the

capital requirements that really not needed for our core banking business.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: So basically you're happy with the trading desk as it is.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Yeah, I mean, no. We're always never happy because we always want to do better. I mean
let's not – but on the other hand it's fair to say that we're not unsatisfied when we make almost $1 billion after-tax in the
quarter where they were – where they had a couple of big elements. This mix in the macro businesses which we are
positioned in on purpose, and then secondly, remember core part of our business we're still adjusting to which was the
leveraged finance transaction business which you can look at is down really dramatically year-over-year as we adopted
the guidance and what was acquired. That through the numbers now and then we'll build back based on that business
doing it the way that meets the regulatory standards. So happy, we're never happy with any business. We're always
pushing them to do better but given the constraints there's an understanding I'd say more than happiness of where we
ended up.

We'll take our next question from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Hi, good morning, guys. A quick follow-up on the op risk questions. So if we still
have pending settlements out there on a few of the remaining sort of large issues, could that lead to op risk at least
sustaining at elevated levels? And could it even potentially cause a little bit of an uplift there?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think at this point we've walked through and as we said on the last call that we are at the
level that we need to be from an overall op risk perspective. And to your point, if we look at the last two quarters
relative to when that op risk capital was set, we've seen fairly sizable declines in overall litigation expense. So you
obviously work through that but our belief over time is that number should be less, not more, but we need to deliver
that to the shareholders.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: From your lips to God's ears but if we still have some potential settlements, my
only point is that it might take a little while before we end up seeing that come down. Isn't that somewhat reasonable?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Let's make this very quick. Just as we said, there's a bid ask on the RWA related to
commercial credit factors in models. There was a bid ask in operating risk. We closed that out and we've actually
moved our RWA to the number that was asked. And then from then, we just look at it very simply. Think about the last
four quarters versus last year and just picking up the third and fourth quarter, you have a complete change in the
amount of litigation expense that's gone through the enterprise and you'll see that keep rolling through. It'll take a while
for that to average out but basically assume that we've agreed to an amount which was requested to bring out op risk
and we put that through last quarter.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Okay. Thanks. And then we've seen some high-level turnover in your equities
business. Can you comment maybe on what's driving some of those departures, any potential implications, and what
you're doing about it?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: We've had some retirements, people worked in the business for 25 years, Henry
[Mulholland] and the team. It's just the ebb and flow of the business. I don't think there are any major issues going on
there. I think that [ph] Doug Allen (1:20:04) and the team have done a good job and stabilized that business and
brought it back. We continue to work on the prime brokerage side to make sure that we can be positioned to restart that
engine of growth. Now we had to hold the business back where we got the operating platform in place to where we
wanted to [indiscernible] (1:20:19) not this past fall but the fall before. So I think you shouldn't read anything into that
other than the usual ebb and flow of people deciding to do other things.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Okay. Thanks for that color. And then last one from me. Following up on Ken's
question, it sounds like the FA head count adds are sort of biased a little more to the junior side. So should we count on

a bit of a headwind from that on your productivity metrics in GWIM? And maybe could you also comment on the
recruiting environment currently and if you still think that comp may moderate as some of those deals with FAs from
crisis levels sunset?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: The average deal last year I think was – for the highest end producing FAs, which there
were 100 of them, 120 of them, the average deal was like 1.27 times trailing 12 months or something like that or
slightly less than that. And don't hold me to those exact numbers. Think of it conceptually. So the rumors about these
payouts are probably far in excess. The reality is only 120 people or so. So take whatever number. So let's broaden out
the productivity question. The productivity per advisor in our business is extremely strong and has sort of structurally
been strong for many years and continues to increase. You wouldn't mind alluding that to get faster long-term growth
prospects for the business and broaden out the business and that's what John and the team are doing. Whether it goes
down or not is really going to be a factor of how fast the revenue stream grows and it's been outgrowing that impact of
investing in the lower-end business.
But we aren't – yeah, so I would say it's going to go down or up based on the added younger advisors. But let's flip that
and say that the way we think this business has to drive where our competitive advantage as a franchise is the linkage
from preferred to Merrill Lynch Wealth Management and the interaction between the financial service centers and the
people that come in there and the tens of thousands of people that get referred into Merrill is a competitive advantage
for Merrill. And we will continue to drive that. And part of that connectivity is we're now putting Merrill team-based
brokers in the branches to work with clients and ultimately move physically onto the team in the offices. So we got a
lot of programs going. They seem to be working very well. It could dilute the productivity a little bit but it would be
immaterial because the strength of the core franchise is so strong.

And we can take our final question from Jeff Harte with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Good morning, Jeff.
<Q - Jeffery Harte>: Good morning, guys. A couple from me. First of all, you mentioned the commercial utilization
rate being up a lot. Can you give me some or give us some idea of how much of that is energy complex driven versus
maybe coming from other less stressed industries?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Most all that given that the number I quoted was within the commercial bank, that's
almost exclusively outside of the energy space, so it has nothing to do with anything distressed. It's just core
commercial clients drawing more. Those numbers bottomed out in the low 30%, and they're now up in the high 30%.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: In particular, when we say commercial, that's middle market, general middle market for us
not the corporate bank where the energy exposure would be. So it's back to basically where it was, not the highest point
because it ran up right before the crisis, but if you look back it's higher than it was in say four and five at this point or
right on it, so you're starting to see a normalization of that borrowing, which is good news because that means that
people are borrowing the money to do something.
<Q - Jeffery Harte>: Okay. And looking at the balance sheet, can you talk a little bit about the plans, kind of the level
of excess cash? I mean 22% of assets in cash, or 7% plus SLR ratio it would seem awfully tough to generate ROE or
ROA with that much of the balance sheet sitting in cash. Is there something you can do there?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think the first thing as you look at that you have to consider as that as we went through
with the different regulatory metrics we needed to get to that, that the last metric that we needed to solve for and we
wanted to get behind us was the satisfaction of where we needed to be from an LCR perspective in 2017 at both the
bank level as well as the parent. And we're to the point where we've gotten to that point. So from an overall liquidity
HQLA perspective, we feel very good about that progress.

As you look at on a go-forward basis, obviously the big focus and the reason as a company that we're looking to drive
the loan growth that we have is to basically take the excess deposits today that are within the investment portfolio and
release them from the investment portfolio into core loan activity to do more with our clients. So as you look at the
changes in mix and the balance sheet as far as the build that you've seen with cash, I think we're at the point where from
an overall balance and where we need to be with the different metrics that we've satisfied that at this point and it will be
more of a normal course on a go-forward basis.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I think generally thematically if you think about as we see rules come up we try to get in
full compliance as fast as possible even though there is delayed dates and then you can then work back at how to
continuously improve the way you get there. But the first you've got to do is get over the hump because it affects every
other aspect of the franchise. And so I think the LCR is another case that we got over the hump 2017 is two years away
and we're on compliance and then the idea is that you keep, to figure out how to work the dials to make it more and
more shareholder friendly over time, but the first thing you want to do is show you can do it.
<Q - Jeffery Harte>: Okay, thank you.
