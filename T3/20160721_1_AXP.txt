MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the American Express Fixed Income Conference Call.
At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.
Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Kerri Bernstein, Vice President of Global Funding and Debt Investor
Relations. Please go ahead.
Kerri Bernstein
Thank you, Noah. Welcome. We appreciate all of you joining us for today's call. The discussion contains certain
forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects which are based
on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results
to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's presentation materials and the
company's reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information relating to comparable GAAP
financial measures may be found in the presentation materials as well as the earnings materials for prior periods that
may be discussed, all of which are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We encourage you to review that
information in conjunction with today's discussion.
Today's discussion will begin with David Yowan, Executive Vice President and Corporate Treasurer, who will provide
a capital and funding update including some key points related to the company's financial performance. Once Dave
completes his remarks, we will move to a Q&A session.
With that, let me turn the discussion over to Dave.
David L. Yowan
Thanks, Kerri, and good afternoon. Thank you for joining us. We intend to use today's call to provide an update on our
funding, liquidity and capital management activities.
Before we turn our focus to our balance sheet, I wanted to take a few minutes and summarize our second quarter
earnings released yesterday afternoon. While I recognize you may have seen them, I thought it might be useful to you
to repeat some of our key messages as our reported results were a bit complex, although not unexpectedly so from
several discrete items.
As you can see on slide two, earnings per share for our second quarter was $2.10. The items that made results
somewhat complex included a $1.1 billion pre-tax gain from the sale of a Costco co-brand portfolio, a continued
slowdown in Costco-related volumes leading up to the date of the sale near the end of the second quarter as well as the

$232 million pre-tax restructuring charge related to our ongoing cost reduction efforts as well as an elevated level of
investment spending. Looking beyond these discrete items, underlying results were solid and consistent with the
outlook we provided at our Investor Day in March.
Beginning now with the summary of our financial results on slide two, billed business increased by 3% year-over-year
during Q2 and was up 4% versus the prior year on an FX-adjusted basis. Revenues decreased by 1% versus the prior
year and increased 1% on an FX-adjusted basis.
As you know, our agreements with Costco ended on June 19 and we completed the portfolio sale and related transition.
Primarily due to Costco-related impacts, we did see a sequential decline in billed business and revenue growth rates
versus the first quarter in line with our expectations.
On the expense side, revision and rewards were both modestly better than our expectations as write-off rates have
remained steady and growth in rewards has been slightly slower than growth in billed business. As expected, marketing
and promotion expenses continued to reflect an elevated level of investment spending. While operating expenses were
also impacted this quarter by the Costco gain and by the restructuring charge, underlying expenses remain well
controlled.
Net income was up 37% versus the prior year due primarily to the gain from the Costco portfolio sale. The gain was
offset in part by the restructuring charge and the continuation of the elevated level of spending on growth initiatives
that we expect to maintain for all four quarters of 2016. Our share repurchase activities helped drive a 7% reduction in
average share count versus the prior year.
Net income for the quarter, combined with the decline in average shares, outstanding drove EPS of $2.10 which was
48% higher than the prior year. Since we have provided our 2016 EPS outlook excluding restructuring charges, EPS
adjusted for the $0.16 restructuring charge was $2.26. These results also brought a reported ROE for the 12 months
ended June 30 to 26%.
I will next provide a brief update on a few elements of our business that have been a particular interest among fixed
income investors.
Turning to loan performance on slide three, our loans on a GAAP basis were down 13% compared to Q2 2015,
reflecting the sales of the Costco portfolio this quarter and the JetBlue co-brand portfolio in the first quarter.
To better understand the underlying trends, the loan data on the right side of the slide excludes the Costco and JetBlue
portfolios from the prior year and adjusts for changes in FX. Adjusted worldwide loan growth of 13% is consistent with
the first quarter and continues to outpace the industry. We continue to see opportunities to increase our share of lending
from both existing customers and high-quality prospects without significantly changing the overall risk profile of the
company.
Moving to credit performance on slide four, our lending credit metrics have remained relatively stable on a year-to-date
basis. Overall, our credit performance is slightly better than our expectation at Investor Day that write-off rates would
begin to trend up a little bit, given the seasoning of our loan portfolio.
As part of the Costco portfolio sale, we retained approximately $250 million of loan balances from that portfolio, which
related primarily to cancelled accounts. These balances are not expected to have a significant impact on provisions as
they are already reserved for at higher levels. But they did increase our delinquency rate by about 10 basis points
during Q2 and will impact our reported write-off rate over the next two quarters.
Slide five compares our lending write-off rates and slide six our lending delinquency rates to major U.S. card-issuing
competitors. And as you can see, our performance in both metrics remains best in class.
Turning to the provision in slide seven. Total provision decreased by 1% versus Q2 as you can see on the left-hand side
of this slide. But this result reflects the impact of the fact that the Costco portfolio had been accounted for as held for
sale and credit costs were not recognized within provision expense but rather through a valuation allowance within
operating expenses.

When you exclude those credit costs from the prior year, as we do on the right side of this slide, adjusted provision
increased by 13% consistent with loan growth and our Q1 performance. Consistent with our comment at our annual
Investor Day in March, we expect both continued growth in loans as well as some modest upward pressure on our
write-off rates due primarily to the seasoning of loans related to new card members, which will contribute to an
increase in provision going forward.
Slide eight is designed to provide you with a roadmap for the principal balance sheet management regulatory
requirements that the company is subject to across liquidity, funding and capital management. I think you'll find most
of these are familiar to you. A couple of callouts I would make would include LCR in which we became required to
measure and comply on a daily basis beginning July 1. Prior to then and since January of last year, we have been
measuring and compliant on a month-end basis.
With respect to NSFR, while the rules are not finalized and the effective compliance date a few years away; we do not
currently anticipate a need to make any significant changes in our funding strategy as a result of this rule. While we are
currently an advanced approaches bank with respect to Basel like the global CIFIs; with respect to resolution planning,
we are a so-called Wave 3 filer.
Slide nine describes our longstanding strategy for managing capital in which we target a strong and flexible balance
sheet, ensure we can support our business requirements and distribute excess capital to shareholders.
Slide 10 provides a recent demonstration of one of the pillars of a strong and flexible balance sheet. The Fed recently
released its CCAR 2016 stress modeling results. Our operating performance under the severely adverse scenario
remains distinguished among industry participants.
The left-hand side of the slide shows that we are cumulatively profitable over the planning horizon as compared to
losses for the median participant and for the industry as a whole. In fact, in this year's results, we were in dollar terms
the most profitable firm among CCAR participants in the severely adverse scenario and one of only a handful of firms
modeled to remain cumulatively profitable over the forecasting time horizon.
Of course, this is under a hypothetical scenario which yields hypothetical results. But we think it does demonstrate the
strength of our business model. On the right-hand side, we show our minimum stressed capital ratios relative to
industry medians. Our post-stress pre-capital action CET1 ratio at 11.4% is in the top quartile of all industry
participants.
Slide 11 shows our preliminary second quarter capital ratios and sets them next to the prior quarter's ratios. You can see
that the three risk-based ratios, CET1, Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital, all increased sequentially by
90 basis points. Our capital base was relatively flat quarter-over-quarter. We distributed through share repurchases and
dividends 96% of the capital we generated during the quarter.
Risk-weighted assets declined as a result of the Costco portfolio sale, offset in part by seasonal and year-over-year loan
growth. The GAAP asset-based leverage ratios were little changed as the Costco loans were replaced with cash on our
balance sheet at quarter end.
I remind you that these ratios are determined using the Basel standardized approach, including the transitional elements
that are being phased in over time. The fully phased in risk-based ratios are roughly 60 basis points lower than our Q2
reported ratios.
Slide 12 provides a time series of our capital ratios and payout ratios. In the top part of the slide, you can see, beginning
in Q4 of 2014, the impact of our preferred share issuances that brought and maintained our Tier 1 ratio roughly 120
basis point higher than our CET1 ratio. You can also see how the greater-than-100% payout ratios along with seasonal
patterns caused a decline in our capital ratios in the second half of last year and how the capital requirement reduction
from the Costco sale caused them to increase in the second quarter even with a 96% payout.
Slide 13 provides a roadmap around our principal funding sources, our principal contingent sources of funding along
with our principal funding entities, all of which are unchanged. Our strategy with respect to funding programs is to

maintain scale and relevance across deposits, secured borrowings like ABS and unsecured funding from the capital
markets and bank credit facilities.
Our contingent sources remain largely unchanged. Over time, beginning before the great financial crisis and continuing
after it, the overall size of contingent resources has increased. More significantly, the mix of those resources has
changed with a much more significant portion held in the form of on-balance sheet unencumbered assets such as cash.
Thirdly, with respect to funding, the secured financing facilities we maintain that utilize our ABS trusts are placed
between the funding and contingent liquidity sources on this page as they operate both as a source of working capital to
fund seasonal and other short-term business-as-usual needs as well as a term liquidity resource if needed.
At the bottom of the slide, we show our principal funding entities. As you know, the majority of our unsecured debt is
issued by CREDCO which is the primary source of funding for much of our international businesses. The two U.S.
banks rely largely on deposit funding and our lending ABS trusts. Parent company maintains access to the unsecured
debt markets and also issued our preferred stock and subordinated debt.
Slide 14 shows you our overall funding stack as well as changes in the mix among our major funding sources. The
overall level of funding is primarily a function of our overall business needs and liquidity requirements. The mix of
funding is in large part a function of the geography of maturities and changes in business requirements among our main
funding entities. For example, growth in our international businesses funded by CREDCO would create a funding need
at CREDCO.
Our U.S. retail deposit programs are shown on slide 15. U.S. deposits have grown rapidly since their launch several
years ago as they replaced maturing debt and other institutional funding. We have slowed that rate of growth over the
last few years.
The rate of growth more recently has been driven by the business growth requirements of our U.S. consumer and small
business franchises. We expect that third-party deposits will decline as they did sequentially this quarter as we absorb
and utilize the proceeds of the Costco portfolio sale.
Slide 16 combines the term maturities across CDs, asset-backed securities and our unsecured debt.
Turning to slide 17, we provide an update on ABS. We remain committed to the ABS market as a source of
cost-effective financing. Capital markets funding plan for the year contemplated the Costco portfolio sale and our
current issuance plans continue to include up to $3 billion of ABS issuance this year.
As a reminder, we maintain two trusts within our ABS programs. One holds charge receivables and the other holds
loans. As part of the Costco portfolio sale, we removed co-brand loans and receivables, added additional accounts to
the lending trust and issued two relatively small series of certificates that provide additional credit enhancements to
certain outstanding series. Rating agencies have affirmed the ratings for the outstanding certificates after considering all
these changes.
On the next two slides, I'll share with you some more specific details on the lending trust as that is where the vast
majority of those actions were taken. As many of you are aware, the lending trust was established in 1996 and contains
U.S. Consumer card member loans. I would draw your attention to the middle of the page where you see that the
lending trust has approximately $25 billion in receivables compared to $13 billion of debt outstanding. With
approximately $12 billion of seller's interest, we continue to have significant issuance flexibility.
Moving on to slide 19, we provide the performance trends for the lending trust. You'll note the very stable performance
of the trust metrics. June metrics derived a modest benefit from the addition and removal actions we took during June
related to the Costco portfolio sale. We don't view that benefit to be permanent and would expect that these metrics to
trend back towards their historic levels. As I discussed earlier, we continue to enjoy best-in-class credit performance.
Let me conclude with a few key points on slide 20. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet. The most recent
CCAR results reaffirm the resilience of our business model under a hypothetical severe stress scenario and our 2016
funding plan contemplated the Costco portfolio sale. That plan includes issuing between $3 billion and $7 billion of
