MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Holly and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome
everyone to Avon's First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any
background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
I'll now turn the conference over to Adam Zerfass, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Zerfass, you may begin your
conference.
Adam Zerfass
Thank you, Holly. Good morning and thank you for joining us to review Avon's first quarter 2016 results. I'm here with
Sheri McCoy, Avon's CEO; and Jim Scully, Executive Vice President, COO, and CFO. Sheri will make some opening
remarks including her perspective on our overall performance and our progress on our transformation plan. Jim will
then take you through first quarter results. We will then have our usual Q&A session.
During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures which we believe to be useful to
investors although they should not be considered superior to the measures presented in accordance with GAAP. A
reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP measures is included in our earnings
release located on the Investor Relations section of our website.
Our call will also contain forward-looking statements that concern our business and financial strategies including our
transformation plan, cost actions and savings, as well as outlook, performance trends, and the impact of foreign
currency, taxes, and tax rates. These statements involve risks and uncertainties, which are detailed in the cautionary
statement available on our Investor Relations website and in our SEC filings.

I will now hand the call over to Sheri.
Sheri McCoy
Thank you, Adam. Good morning and welcome to Avon's first quarter 2016 earnings call. As you'll hear today, we've
made meaningful progress against our transformation plan and results for the quarter are in line with our expectations
with constant dollar revenue growth of 3% excluding Liz Earle and an adjusted operating margin of 4.2%. As expected,
we continued to experience significant impacts from FX. However, I will note that we saw some easing of FX trends
late in the quarter.
This morning, I'll start by sharing my perspective on our first quarter performance. I'll then provide an update on
progress against our transformation plan including how the partnership with Cerberus is working. Next, Jim will
provide details for the quarter; and lastly, we will open the call to Q&A.
As you know, Avon Products, Inc. now has all of its commercial operations outside of the United States. As we
consider the new structure of the business, we saw there was an opportunity to provide better insight and clarity on the
underlying performance of the business.
So, before I review the quarter, let me share changes in how we report our segments. We have four reportable
segments: EMEA; Europe, Middle East, and Africa; South Latin America; North Latin America; and Asia Pacific. And
together, they make up the total reportable segments.
In addition, we captured the impact of items such as the Venezuela deconsolidation and Liz Earle historical results in
the section titled other operating segments and business activities. Also starting this quarter and moving forward, we'll
be reporting Ending Representatives trends as we believe this can be a helpful indicator of future performance.
Now turning to first quarter performance: On an overall basis, the quarter landed in line with our expectations. First
quarter revenue was $1.3 billion, up 3% in constant dollars excluding Liz Earle. For total reportable segments, Active
Representatives which is a reflection of orders placed was down 1%, roughly in line with our expectations.
Ending Representatives, which reflects the number of representatives with the ability to place an order, was up 2%. I
continue to be pleased with the trends we are seeing in Ending Representatives as this is the 5th consecutive quarter
where we are seeing positive growth.
At the same time, our teams remain focused on driving improved activity. Average order was up 3%, and price mix
was up 5%. Our adjusted operating margin was 4.2%, down 230 basis points primarily due to FX which had an
approximate 550-basis-point impact.
From a geographic perspective, I'm very pleased with the performance of our top 10 markets which represent
approximately 70% of revenue. The teams are fighting with inflation, working on improving mix, making progress on
representative engagement initiative, making our model more social and mobile, and strengthening the brands through
our Beauty for a Purpose positioning.
We have very strong operational teams in our top markets. And collectively, these markets are growing revenue faster
than the company average. Our top markets are also outpacing the company average on Ending Representatives growth
trends.
Jim will speak to our new reportable segments performance in detail. But I thought it will be helpful to provide my
perspective on four top markets: Brazil, Russia, Mexico, and the U.K. Let's start with Brazil. Consistent with our
expectations, constant-dollar revenue was up 1% when excluding the impact of the IPI tax which will anniversary this
month. Additionally, we're incurring more VAT-like taxes at the state level, which we refer to as MVA tax. These
additional MVA taxes had a 3-point hit on the gross revenue this quarter.
In Brazil, average orders grew based on pricing actions index. However, this was offset by a modest decline in Active
Representatives. In the current environment with suppressed consumer spending, representative activity levels were

lower as her customers are purchasing less frequently.
To increase activity levels, we are balancing our pricing actions particularly on our high-unit movers which drive
activity. And in light of the economic environment, we are also taking a more balanced risk-based approach to bringing
in and on-boarding new representatives.
For perspective, Ending Representatives in Brazil were down fractionally this quarter versus prior year. As I said on
our last quarterly call, we anticipate that Brazil will continue to be a challenging environment given the political and
economic situation. We've a strong team in place and I'm confident in their ability to maintain underlying health of the
business while keeping our representatives engaged to enhance activity drivers. For the year, we continue to expect
Brazil to be relatively flat with some ups and downs over the course of the year.
Turning to Russia, the team posted another strong quarter with 25% constant dollar revenue growth, driven by an
increase in active representatives and an increase in average orders due to pricing actions. For the remainder of the
year, we expect the Russia team to drive continued strong constant dollar revenue growth based on the strength of their
representative base.
Mexico delivered a solid quarter with 2% constant dollar revenue growth driven by average order. The team has
continued to strengthen their merchandising and marketing and has been working to improve the health of the field to
improve on-boarding and training. We continue to expect Mexico to deliver solid performance for the year.
The U.K. delivered 4% constant dollar growth for the quarter, driven by strong average order. I was in the U.K. a few
weeks ago and was impressed with the marketing execution on their key innovation launches. The team is also making
progress in strengthening the field which has been an area of focus for the past several months. This has resulted in an
increase in the number of sales leaders. We have important work ahead to bring the total representative count to a more
consistent level. As I said last quarter, we anticipate that the U.K. will deliver flat to slightly positive growth by
year-end.
Before I turn to category performance, I want to provide some perspective on Asia Pacific as it fell below our
expectations. Asia Pacific now accounts for roughly 10% of total revenue. Philippines, our largest market in the region,
delivered flat revenue growth in local currency. Philippines' growth slowed this quarter versus recent quarters, and this
is attributed to lower activity due to a change in campaign cycles coupled with the timing of the Easter holiday. I
recently visited the Philippines and I feel good about the operational plans the team has in place.
In the case of China, as we said at Investor Day, we continue to evaluate strategic options. The remaining Asia Pacific
business has some smaller markets where we are taking actions designed to improve revenue growth. In total, we
expect Asia Pacific revenue growth to be under pressure for the remainder of the year.
From a category perspective, Beauty was flat overall in constant currency. However, when excluding the impact of Liz
Earle and the IPI tax, Beauty grew 4%. We posted 4% growth in Fragrance, 2% growth in Color, 9% when we exclude
IPI. We saw a decline of 6% in Skincare, although Skincare results were flat when excluding the impact of IPI and Liz
Earle. Fashion & Home grew 4% versus the prior year.
I'm really pleased with the Beauty innovation and new product execution we saw in the first quarter. In particular, our
True Perfectly Matte Lipstick was launched across most markets and has exceeded our expectations. Perfectly Matte
innovation is based on the consumer insight that women want a true matte finish that won't dry her lips. We have novel
patent-pending technology and strong competitive plans. And we had outstanding marketing executions that included a
really clever campaign in the U.K. that claims superior performance versus a leading department store brand. This
resulted in U.K. sales nearly doubling projections, and in Brazil, we sold 8 million units over the initial two-months
offering alone. Perfectly Matte was Avon's strongest global lipstick launch in six years.
An important thing to note, Perfectly Matte went from concept into the hands of our representatives and consumers
relatively quickly. In Avon's models, strong innovation in color is important as the color category opens the door to
bring in new representatives. And at the same time, a strong pipeline of color innovation makes it easier for existing
representatives to delight her customer and entice new consumers, all of which drives activity and engagement.

Generally, I'm pleased with the underlying performance of the company in the first quarter and looking forward, I'm
confident that we will continue to deliver improved performance. And based on the strength of our Ending
Representatives trends, particularly in our top markets, we are on track to deliver 1% to 2% growth in Active
Representatives.
Turning now to the three-year transformation plan that we shared with you in January; an important first step in this
plan was the separation of the North America business, which we successfully executed in March. I will say I'm really
pleased with the work both North America and corporate Avon associates did to complete this work in such a short
time.
And our partnership with Cerberus is going well. In addition to the management of the North American business, they
are proving to be both a catalyst of change and a source of operational support for API. As we shared at Investor Day,
Avon and Cerberus completed an intensive due diligence process. The depth of knowledge that the service team gained
from that process has been really valuable as it has allowed them to start making an impact relatively quickly. Key
members of the service operations teams are partnering with API leaders in the project management office. I'm very
pleased with the additional level of accountability and operational expertise this is bringing to our transformation work.
With the North America separation now complete, our organization is fully focused on executing against the
transformation plan for our core business which has three components: driving costs out of the business; investing for
growth; and improving our financial resilience.
We've already achieved a number of key milestones that we set for ourselves in 2015. We've identified and are
executing against the full $70 million of cost savings that we committed to for 2016. We announced in mid-March that
we'd identified $50 million of the $70 million in savings through our operating model work, which I'll discuss in a
moment. And in addition, we also expect to realize an additional $20 million in savings primarily from efficiencies in
enterprise supply chain and sourcing.
As we announced in mid-March, we have made significant changes to our operating model and organization design that
supports it. The key changes to our operating model include bringing corporate closer to our commercial markets
through elimination of most of our regional infrastructure, revising our commercial businesses to further ensure
consistent roles and responsibilities and best practice sharing, streamlining our corporate infrastructure, and better
aligning expenses to where our revenues are generated.
Implementation of the new operating model is going smoothly to date. We also announced that we will be transitioning
Avon's corporate headquarters from New York to the U.K., which will help bring our corporate and commercial
businesses closer together. This work is well under way. The operating model and headquarter move required a
significant change in how our associates work together and I am pleased that people are engaged and working well to
ensure that we align processes and build for the future.
Now turning to investing in growth; as I discussed earlier, our top markets are growing revenue in local currencies,
which provides us with a solid foundation to build on as we increase investment in our brand and representative
proposition. We intend to fund our growth agenda through a combination of the benefits of our cost reduction efforts
and pricing actions. Specific to pricing, we will continue to price with inflation and maintain a disciplined approach.
Additionally, innovation in our product portfolio will allow us to improve price mix.
For Avon representatives, our pricing strategy also improved their earnings. Coupled with the improvements in the
service model, we believe this will help us deliver on our growth strategy of having more women earning more through
Beauty. As it relates to the service model, we continue to make good progress on our IT agenda, including completion
of several additional Phase I order management system implementations in EMEA.
Turning to financial resilience: We've made improvement on our net debt which has been reduced by $412 million
compared to last year and we continue to focus on de-leveraging our balance sheet. All in all, it was a busy and
productive quarter, and I'm pleased with the magnitude of progress on many fronts. I am confident we will continue to
make good progress as we move forward aggressively to drive out cost, invest in growth, and improve our financial
flexibility.

We are positioning Avon as a growth company and that's how we're managing the business. Our teams are focused and
engaged. And as I traveled to some of our key markets over the past couple of months, including attending our World
Sales Leader Recognition Conference in Asia Pacific, it's clear that our people share a renewed sense of energy and
commitment to Avon.
I'll now hand it over to Jim to take you through a detailed review of the quarter. Jim?
James S. Scully
Thank you, Sheri, and thanks again to all of you for joining the call today. As you heard from Sheri, our first quarter
results were in line with our expectations, and we've seen progress on key aspects of our transformation plan. We've
identified the right plan to position Avon for a long-term profitable growth and to achieve our long-term targets.
For today's call, I will first take you through the changes we've made to our financial reporting and disclosures. Then I
will review our first quarter results, followed by an update on our progress on our transformation plan. With regards to
the reporting changes, while these changes were made for various reasons, including accounting conclusions associated
with control of our Venezuela business, we believe all of the changes will enhance transparency for investors to assess
the performance of our business.
You can find the details of these changes in our Form 10-Q and highlights in our press release. That said, I wanted to
take you through a summary of the changes. We've included a new performance metric, change in Ending
Representatives, which is expected to be a useful indicator of our revenue performance. We made several changes to
our segment reporting structure. First, to align our geographies with our new operating model, we made changes to our
reportable segments which now include Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, South Latin America, North Latin
America, and Asia Pacific. The subtotal of these reportable segments reflects the performance of the core business and
is included in the earnings release.
Second, we are now reporting the following in other segments and business activities: Venezuela operating results
which we deconsolidated as of March 31, 2016; the historical results of the Liz Earle business that we sold in July of
2015; royalties for the use the company's name and trademarks in certain countries; and product sales to our recently
sold North America business.
The third change made to the segment reporting structure is the methodology of allocating global expenses to the
segments. We are no longer allocating global expenses to the segments with the exception of global marketing
expenses which will be allocated based on a percentage of actual sales. Global marketing expenses have been allocated
to the segments in order to ensure comparability and because these activities are more directly aligned with the
commercial operations.
Finally, to simplify disclosure of the profit of our segments, we will now use a measure of profit referred to as segment
profit and segment margin, which is similar to the previously used measure called regional adjusted operating profit
and adjusted operating margin.
This segment profit measure aligns with the measure used by us internally to assess segment performance. Use of this
profit measure will reduce the need for reconciliations to the U.S. GAAP measure. We issued an 8-K this morning that
includes historical quarterly financial information of the new segment's reporting structure.
The last change I wanted to take you through is the decision to deconsolidate our Venezuelan operations as of March
31, 2016. Over the past six years, we have significantly devalued our Venezuelan operations driven by the country's
actions with regard to its currency. This has led to Venezuela becoming less material to our consolidated results.
In fact, you may recall that in February 2015, we began using the SIMADI exchange rate which caused roughly a 70%
devaluation of our reported Venezuelan business. Now, given the lack of exchangeability between the Venezuelan
bolivar and the U.S. dollar, which we feel is other than temporary, we concluded that we should no longer consolidate
our Venezuelan operations.

For first quarter 2016, operating results from Venezuela, both revenue and expenses, are included in our first quarter
2016 consolidated operating performance but will not be included in future periods beginning in the second quarter of
2016. Also, as you will note in our disclosures in the Form 10-Q, as a result of a deconsolidation of Venezuela, we
recorded a non-cash after-tax loss of approximately $120 million in the first quarter of 2016. The loss was comprised of
net asset that was written off of $39 million and the historical cumulative foreign-currency translation adjustments of
$81 million recorded within shareholders' equity.
Turning to our first quarter results, note my comments will focus on adjusted results. Our GAAP results, along with
reconciliation tables, are included in our press release issued earlier today. Reported total revenue declined 16% due to
the negative impact of foreign exchange but increased 2% in constant dollars. And excluding impact of the divestiture
of the Liz Earle business, our constant-dollar revenue rose 3%.
Total revenue from reportable segment declined 15% due to the negative impact of currency but rose 2% in constant
dollars. Active Representatives within reportable segments were down 1% as the growth in EMEA was more than
offset by decline in the other reportable segments, most significantly South Latin America.
Average order grew by 3% in our reportable segments and price mix rose 5% as we continue to benefit from pricing.
Ending Representatives within reportable segments increased 2% driven by growth in EMEA, partially offset by
decline in other reportable segments most significantly South Latin America.
Adjusted gross margin declined 130 basis points to 60.3% driven by a 420 basis point negative impact from foreign
currency. This impact was partially offset by the favorable net impact of pricing and mix as well as lower supply chain
cost.
Adjusted operating margin declined 230 basis points to 4.2%. The Brazilian IPI tax negatively impacted the results by
approximately 80 basis points. Excluding the impact of this item, adjusted operating margin would have decreased
approximately 150 basis points. The decrease was primarily driven by foreign currency translation and transaction cost
which negatively impacted our results by approximately 560 basis points. These negative impacts were partially offset
by the favorable net impact of pricing and mix as well as the continued benefits from cost savings initiatives.
The effective tax rate from continuing operations was impacted by the deconsolidation of the Venezuelan operations.
This impact was partially offset by the recognition of a benefit associated with the implementation of foreign tax
planning strategies.
The adjusted effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2016 was negatively impacted by the country mix of earnings and
the inability to recognize additional deferred tax assets associated with current period losses in various jurisdictions.
Based on the country mix of quarterly earnings as well as the cost of recording taxes associated with the repatriation of
cash on lower pre-tax earnings, the adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be volatile on a quarterly basis. That said,
the current period adjusted provision for income taxes in dollars was essentially flat as compared with the same period
last year but on lower pre-tax earnings.
Adjusted EPS was a loss of $0.07 per diluted share compared with $0.03 of adjusted earnings per diluted share a year
ago. As I mentioned, currency had a significant negative impact on the year-over-year comparison of EPS of
approximately $0.13 per share.
I will now provide more details on the results by reportable segments starting with EMEA. Reported revenue declined
2%, while constant dollar revenue rose 11%. Growth in Active Representatives continued to drive top-line results as
the underlying fundamentals remained strong. Average order also increased and contributed to the growth. Ending
Representatives increased primarily driven by growth in Russia and South Africa, partially offset by a decline in the
U.K.
The EMEA segment margin was (sic) 13.2%, up 120 basis points. The results benefited from revenue leverage, cost
savings, and pricing actions. These benefits more than offset the negative impact of currency transaction cost of
approximately 500 basis points.

In Russia, constant dollar revenue rose 25% driven by growth in Active Representatives and by higher average order
from the benefits of pricing. Constant dollar revenue in the U.K. was up 4%. The results were driven by higher average
order, resulting from growth in the Fashion & Home business, as well as successful new product launches. While the
overall constant-dollar revenue trend has improved, Active Representatives declined in the quarter. While revenue was
up in the first quarter, we expect the U.K. to deliver flat to slightly positive revenue growth by year-end, as Sheri
mentioned.
Moving to South Latin America, reported revenue declined 28% while constant-dollar revenues declined 2%. Constant
dollar growth was adversely impacted by approximately 4 points due to the Brazilian IPI tax. Excluding the impact of
this item, constant dollar revenue would have grown approximately 2%, driven by higher average order from pricing
actions. Active Representatives were down 3%, primarily driven by declines in Brazil, Ecuador, and Argentina due to
the challenging economic conditions in these markets. Ending Representatives decreased primarily driven by Brazil.
The South Latin American segment margin was 5.4%, down 610 basis points from a year ago. The IPI tax in Brazil
negatively impacted adjusted operating margin by approximately 250 basis points. Excluding the impact of this item,
adjusted operating margin would have decreased approximately 360 basis points and was primarily due to the negative
impact from foreign currency of approximately 600 basis points.
In addition, bad debt expense increased, primarily due to the macroeconomic environment in Brazil and Argentina.
These negative impacts were partially offset by the favorable impact from pricing and mix as well as lower supply
chain cost.
Turning to Brazil: Constant dollar revenue declined 7%. The IPI tax negatively impacted constant-dollar revenue
growth by approximately 8 points. Excluding the impact of the IPI tax, constant dollar revenue grew approximately 1%
driven by higher average order which was partially offset by decline in Active Representatives.
As Sheri discussed earlier, this market continues to be impacted by a difficult macroeconomic environment. In
addition, the tax environment in Brazil remained challenging. While we anniversary the IPI tax in May, there have been
additional VAT-like taxes we refer to as MVA taxes that have gone into effect in various states in Brazil in the latter
part of 2015. The additional MVA taxes have had an approximate 3-point drag on Brazil's growth rate in the first
quarter of 2016 and will continue to affect the growth rates for the remainder of the year. However, we expect Brazil to
be relatively flat for the year, given the actions we are taking.
Moving to North Latin America, reported revenue declined 11%, while in constant dollars, revenue grew 2%. The
growth was driven by higher average order which was partially offset by a decline in Active Representatives. Ending
Representatives decreased, primarily driven by Mexico. The North Latin America segment margin was 13.9%, up 140
basis points, driven by improved gross margin which benefited from the favorable impact of pricing and mix.
In Mexico, revenue grew 2% in constant dollars, driven by higher average order due to the strength in the Fashion &
Home business. Active Representatives declined primarily driven by actions to improve the quality of orders, such as
adjusting our minimum order value and refining return policies.
Moving to Asia Pacific, reported revenue declined 17% while constant dollar revenue was down 10%, driven by
declines in most markets led by China, which I'll come back to shortly. The region's Active Representatives declined
10% while average order was relatively unchanged.
Ending Representatives decreased driven by declines in most markets, partially offset by growth in the Philippines.
Constant dollar revenue in the Philippines was relatively unchanged as the growth in average order was offset by a
decrease in Active Representatives due to lower activity. Active Representatives declined due to a reduction in the
number of sales campaigns as well as the timing of the Easter holiday.
The Asia Pacific segment margin was 10.8%, down 270 basis points. The decrease was primarily driven by de-leverage
on fixed costs given lower revenue. The negative impact of currency transaction costs and unfavorable price mix also
contributed to the decline. These impacts were partially offset by a lower advertising spend, primarily in China, and by
a lower supply chain cost.

In regards to the business in China, while we saw a sizeable decline on a percentage basis, the relative size of the
business is small. That said, we are focused on optimizing our business to capitalize on the significant opportunity that
exists given our strong brand, innovative products, and high quality assets. We continue to evaluate strategic
alternatives for this business.
Moving on to cash flow, operating activities during the first three months used $13 million more than the prior year.
The year-over-year comparison benefited as last year's results included a $67 million payment to the SEC in connection
with the FCPA settlement that did not reoccur this year. Cash flow used by operating activities increased primarily due
to lower cash-related earnings which were negatively impacted by foreign currency, a contribution to the pension plan
for corporate U.S.-based associates, and higher purchases of inventory.
In the first quarter, working capital improved seven days operationally compared with a year ago. Accounts payable
improved 13 days operationally as we continue to benefit from our focus on renegotiating payment terms with our
vendors. However, inventory days were five days worse operationally, primarily driven by actions to protect service
levels in North Latin America, as well as additional purchases to support Fashion & Home growth in EMEA.
Now, turning to the financial and operational aspects of our transformation plan. As we discussed at our Investor Day,
we are focused on significantly reducing and aligning our cost structure while improving the overall financial resilience
of the company. We launched our three-year transformation plan which included our partnership with Cerberus and
completed the carve-out of North America on March 1.
We have targeted cost reductions of $350 million, $150 million related to changes in our operating model and $200
million in savings related to our supply chain. As we realize these cost savings, we plan to reinvest for growth in media,
social selling and IT initiatives.
Starting with the operating model; our goal is to drive out $150 million by eliminating redundant regional layers,
further reducing the corporate center, shifting cost out of the U.S., and establishing partnerships to lower [indiscernible]
(33:23) costs.
Within supply chain, our goal is to reduce overall cost by $200 million by rationalizing our manufacturing capacity,
optimizing the distribution network as the global manufacturing footprint evolves, and reducing costs related to
transportation, physical warehousing and distribution. Finally, with respect to sourcing, opportunities exist to
harmonize our direct material purchases to generate greater scale and purchasing power.
In regards to savings from the operating model, we announced in March that we are reducing 1,700 head count as well
as eliminating 800 open positions. We expect to realize approximately $50 million in savings in 2016 from these
actions. In addition, we expect to realize approximately $20 million of savings in 2016 from supply chain and sourcing
initiatives. This puts us on track to deliver against our goal of $70 million in savings for 2016.
In addition to aggressively reducing costs, we've also made significant progress improving our financial resilience. Net
debt improved from last year by $412 million, reflecting the use of proceeds from the divestiture of Liz Earle to pay
down debt, as well as the receipt of $335 million in net proceeds from the Cerberus transaction. We remain focused on
the balance sheet and plan to repay $250 million of debt in 2016.
We will continue to focus on executing the key priorities we shared with you on our call in February. As a reminder,
our 2016 priorities are: continue to drive/improve overall performance in our top 10 markets; deliver 1% to 2% Active
Representatives growth, as well as continue to improve the Ending Representatives trends; invest in the brand with
Avon's Beauty for a Purpose positioning; price with inflation while monitoring our top 10 markets closely;
communicate a resolution for our China business; continue to make significant progress on the service model evolution;
complete our IT infrastructure transition to HP for all markets; complete the sale and separation of North America;
reduce $70 million of cost in 2016; and continue to improve our balance sheet including repayment of $250 million of
debt, improving working capital, laying out our tax planning strategy and evaluating opportunities to hedge currency
exposure.

Throughout the first quarter, we have made progress against many of these priorities. As we look forward, we expect to
make additional progress against these key priorities while directing our resources to grow Active Representatives and
drive our top line. We continue to expect to deliver improving top and bottom line trends as we move through the year
as we benefit from pricing and our cost savings actions.
This will drive free cash flow to levels consistent to last year while absorbing cash charges required to execute the
transformation plan. Above all, we remain committed to driving high quality, sustainable earnings growth, which we
expect to deliver through executing our transformation plan.
With that, we will turn it back to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of the call.
Q&A
Operator
Please note, you'll be limited to one question and a related follow-up question until all callers in the queue have posed
their question. Please note, once you have asked your related follow-up question, your line will be muted once again.
[Operator Instructions] We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from
Lauren Lieberman. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Lauren Rae Lieberman>: Great. Thanks so much. It's Barclays. I wanted to ask a little bit about pricing. First,
relative to Brazil and the tax environment, so you're calling out IPI as still being a drag and then when you talk about
the additional value in these additional taxes you've said, you expect to kind of offset them or deal with them through
actions you're taking.
So, I'm wondering if your broader approach to pricing to try to get more pricing in the business model than has
historically been the case is also relevant in how you're planning to manage through this kind of onerous tax
environment in Brazil with this new wave of taxes?
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Thanks, Lauren. As we look at pricing from a holistic standpoint, there are a couple of things that
are going on in Brazil. Certainly, we're dealing with inflation. We're dealing with devaluation and then we're dealing
with the regulatory issues with additional taxes, whether it be the cosmetic tax, IPI, or the additional state taxes.
As we are looking at the business, the team's done a nice job of covering inflation and covering IPI. We have not
to-date been able to deal with the MVA taxes because they are state taxes and they're coming in from different states.
And as you know, we have a brochure that covers the entire country.
So, as we look at that, one of the things that we'll see over time is as we anniversary the IPI tax that will help us and
we'll be able to see the pricing year-on-year, but we will continue to look at how we deal with the impact of MVA
through price where we can. But at the same time, we're trying to balance that, so that we're keeping representatives
engaged.
So, we'll monitor that. We're also obviously continuing to look at supply chain costs and other things to get our cost of
goods down, but we will also make sure we're keeping the representative and the consumer engaged.
With that said, we have taken more price than we have done historically, and that's enabled us to get to where we are
today. I don't know Jim if you want to comment anymore on that?
<A - James S. Scully>: No.
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Okay. Thanks, Lauren.
<Q - Lauren Rae Lieberman>: Okay. And if my line is still open, the follow-up. If you're able to get pricing over
time to help offset these taxes, I understand why you would want to talk about the business and say, look ex the tax,
this is what we believe kind of underlying health of the business is, but if you're going to be pricing over time to cover
that, then shouldn't we be including the tax in understanding the business result?

And also, aren't your competitors dealing with it as well? So, it's sort of overall drag on category growth and industry
growth not something that's really a one-off.
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Yeah. I think part of it is on IPI specifically, we are calling that out. We haven't really – we've
been dealing with MVA; in fourth quarter, we weren't calling out because we see that as business as usual, so over
time, it will normalize. As it relates to IPI, we do see our competitors actually calling that out as well. We are more
impacted, and I think I said this a couple of times given the portfolio that we have with skincare and color. But as that
goes away in May, we will not be talking about the IPI tax, and we'll give you some color on MVA, but, again, that's
the cost of doing business, and we'll continue to look at that moving forward. So, I think it will normalize coming
through the second half of the year.

And your next question comes from Wendy Nicholson. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: Hi. With Citigroup. My question has to do with sort of the upcoming move to London,
and what impact that is having on the organization, how many people are going to be relocating, all that kind of stuff.
And then sort of related but tangential is, have you made any more progress or updates – I know you've talked about
evaluating China, but are there other markets that you are considering exiting completely like you have over the last
couple of years? Thanks.
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Sure. As we look at the move to the U.K., first, I will say that the organization is really aligned
and focused on what we refer to as a fresh start. We've had a lot of moving pieces with the sales in North American
business, the development of the transformation plan. I think people are very excited about that. As we look at the U.K.
headquarters move, the important thing is to make sure that we actually get close to the business and that we're making
the decisions together in an area where we actually are running the business.
As it impacts the specific associates, obviously, we've been communicating and working closely with them. We have
some associates that will be going to Rye. We have others that are going to Stockholm particularly to get the synergies
between our R&D and marketing folks. And then we have others that are moving, as an example, some folks in finance
are moving to Poland because we have capabilities there. We have some folks that are moving to Brazil to do that. And
then, we have a smaller portion of folks who are actually moving to the corporate headquarters. So, we are dispersing
the people that are in the New York office, but it's based on making sure we're getting the expenses where the work is
done and making sure that we have that synergies. So, we're working closely with associates and senior management.
There will be people in the U.K. as well as in New York who will be going back and forth to ensure that we continue
on this transition, but it's a really important time for us. And I have to say I'm very pleased with the organization and
their receptivity to the level of change that we're driving and the support that we're getting as we're working together.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: And then the follow-up I had was just on that, the question about the market before you
close me off, the other thing is you didn't mention Turkey. Can you just comment on Turkey's performance in the
quarter? Thanks.
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Turkey during the quarter? I don't think we've commented on that, but Turkey did grow and it is
going well. And I will say, one of the things that we're seeing is that we're dealing with particularly some areas in – as
we're dealing with the political crisis there, we have some of our representatives particularly on the Syrian border
pulling back a bit but we did see growth in the quarter. I give the team a lot of credit given the issues that we're dealing
with.
As it relates specifically to China, we have work underway and we'll update you as we go. And as it relates to other
markets, we continue to evaluate that and as we have more information, we will update you.

Your next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Faiza Alwy>: Yes. Hi. This is Faiza calling in for Bill. It's Deutsche Bank. So, I just had a quick question, Jim.
First, I just wanted to clarify the cash flow expectations for the year. I just wanted to confirm that you said that the
operating cash flow in fiscal 2016 is going to be in line with the operating cash flow in fiscal 2015. And then, just if the
cash balance at the end of 2016 is going to be higher than the cash balance at the end of fiscal 2015.
And then, Sheri, if I could just ask you sort of your decision process around why did you decide to move from Active
Reps to Ending Reps and why do you think that's a better metric for the business? Thank you.
<A - James S. Scully>: So, it's Jim. So, what I said on cash flow is I referenced free cash flow, which is cash from
operation minus CapEx, will be relatively consistent to last year, which was essentially flat. And I said that would
include our ability to absorb the cash charges related to the restructuring for the transformation plan. I don't want to
comment on cash at the end of the year.
<A - Sheri McCoy>: As it relates to Ending Reps and Active Reps. We actually will report both. Ending Reps gives an
indication of people in the business that are able to place an order. Active Reps gives an indication of the number of
orders placed and their activity level.
It's really important to make sure that we have women still coming in and staying with our business. And that's why we
want to look at Ending Representatives; and Actives, on the other hand, making sure that they continue to place orders.
Both are important.
But one of the things that we've been monitoring is Ending Representatives over time, and if we go back to late 2013,
early 2014, we were seeing declines in that number of about 5% to 6%. We're now seeing positive trends of plus 2%.
What that says is if our base is healthy, we need to make sure that we're making it active and easy for them to place
orders but it's important for us to look at both of those. The point is if we only look at Actives, many times, you will see
a fluctuation because a campaign cycle moves, we have a holiday and things change and therefore they are not able to
place as many orders because the number of campaigns doesn't fall within that quarter. Ending is a more normalization
to see the number of representatives we have. So it's important for us to look at both. But I know if our Ending Reps
aren't trending in the right direction, it's much harder for us to get to the activity level, and that's how we look at the
business. And so we felt also down the road, if we take out campaign cycles and we go more online and we look at that
what's going to be more important for us to give you a measure of the health of the field by people coming in and then
we'll give you a measure of activity but it may not be an Active Rep order piece by campaign. We might look at it
because of the way we've placed through e-commerce etc. So over time, we want to make sure we measure Ending as
well as activity. Hopefully, that was helpful.
<Q - Faiza Alwy>: Yes. Thank you.
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Okay.

And your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj. Please state your affiliation then pose your question.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Hey, guys. I'm from Bernstein. I had a few questions. One is, if you could please just break out the
organic sales growth by beauty, and then fashion and home, excluding just Liz Earle. So not IPI, just Liz Earle, because
right now it still looks like the two things that are really driving your growth, it's really mentioned in the press releases
and in your prepared remarks, are fashion and home. And then pretty meaningful kind of massive pricing in Russian
and Argentina. So I don't know how we should feel about the stability of that. So that's just one question.
The second one is, I think the difficulty a lot of us have, and I don't frankly know how you resolve it, but it is still pretty
messy, and I understand you're going through a transformation, you're trying to fix things. But even the kind of

financial signposts you are giving us are relatively messy with a lot of variability. So it is tough for us to actually audit
this idea that the transformation is on track and it's improving. So I don't know if you can give us a better sense of your
financial signposts. Now, within that, obviously this end representative is a metric you are using. We've had trouble in
the past trying to correlate any Active Rep measure or, in this case, a new metric to your kind of go-forward sales
growth. And I'm trying to figure out whether you guys have done that analysis, what the correlation is. Does it look any
better for this metric in terms of go-forward? Because historically rep growth has not changed because – or rep growth
hasn't driven sales growth because there are so many other factors, like size of purchase, campaign numbers, et cetera,
et cetera. And if you do find a correlation, how should we feel about this metric going forward? Because except for
really Russian, and it sounds like South Africa too, but except for really meaning Russia, all the other regions are down
on this metric. I get the 2% overall are down on this metric. So those two, please? Then I have a follow-up.
<A - Sheri McCoy>: I will take a stab at discussing the category piece and reps and then I'll turn it to Jim relative to
the financial part. As we look at the category growth for Beauty, your question was if we don't exclude IPI, Beauty
would still be up 2%. We see strong growth in Color and Fragrance in many of our markets. The area where we
continue to see challenges in Skincare and that's really driven by Brazil and China. But overall, we are very focused on
that. That's an important part. That's the equity of the company and we continue to make sure as we're going through
and having our reviews with the market, we are focusing on Beauty's growth.
As it relates to Ending Representative, it is more correlated with the results. I can't say for a fact that we've done a true
regression analysis. So as we're looking at the trends curves, we can see that that's much more in line. Obviously,
average order plays a role, so it's not the only indicator but it is closer than an Active Rep component to it.
As it relates to the actual – you were referencing the segments in looking at from where things lie. If you look at it from
a total perspective, what I've said is that from a quarterly perspective, we've seen that Ending Representative, this is the
fifth consecutive quarter where we've seen growth. We continue to see positive performance.
You also see a very different picture between Active Rep and Ending Reps and that's because we're bringing more
people in. What's really driving the – in the case of North Latin America, it's really Mexico and we have some specific
things that we did there to improve the quality and, therefore, are driving that. I'm not overly concerned about where
we're going to see it. We will see all of it. We've seen – we see that because we see that in our top 10 markets, we are
outpacing growth on an Ending Representative basis.
And so over time, we will see that growth. I think the area that will continue to see some challenges, frankly, is in
South Latin America because we have challenging situation in Argentina and certainly Ecuador now with the
earthquake and some import restrictions, we're seeing a significant impact on our representative base.
Brazil, we continue to feel positive about, but again the – as we know, the consumer environment there is difficult. So,
as I look at it, I do think the trends are indicative of what we're going to see in the future. I feel very good about it, and
we'll continue to monitor it moving forward.
<A - James S. Scully>: And Ali, as it relates to what I would consider to be a complicated series of changes that we're
going through, I think we tend to agree that between discontinued ops in North America, the deconsolidation of
Venezuela, the impact of Liz Earle, the change in the segments, that it is difficult.
We are trying to give you better clarity, some of the changes that we made in terms of introducing reportable segments,
as well as the other segment and business activity, trying to get the core. And then also to Sheri's point, in terms of not
only providing the segments but also what's going at a lower level in some of the key markets to try to give you an
understanding of what's going on at the organic level of the business.
We'll continue to try to improve. The other thing we want to do is make sure that we were very clear in some of the key
priorities this year that we're tracking against, and making sure that we give you progress reports on each of these calls
to those key priorities because, as we go through this transformation, I think it's important to keep us – hold us
accountable to the details of that level.

<Q - Ali Dibadj>: So, I appreciate you guys are at a complex time right now. If I try to pull out of that complexity and
kind of look longer term trajectory, particularly in Brazil, one of your largest direct sellers opened up a store. There's a
lot more competition in that marketplace. Everyone is complaining about each other's competition in the direct selling
world and otherwise, and clearly the tough macro situation. But just from the convergence perhaps of direct selling and
retail selling that this large competitor has suggested, what does that tell you about the maturation of direct selling in
that marketplace and the competition, and kind of the hopes for long term – again, out of the complexities of the short
term – but of the long-term growth in that marketplace for your business as it stands today?
<A - Sheri McCoy>: We still see strong performance in direct selling, Skincare and Color still purchased significantly
through, as well as Fragrance. As we look at our position, we're very focused on our representative base. I think that's
critically important, to be clear, that we are supporting them during these difficult times.
We've maintained share. Some of our other competitors are losing share, which also – we see [indiscernible] (53:44) as
an example coming into direct selling, again, indicating that direct selling is a good place to be. So, we still feel very
strongly about it. I think it's really important that we're clear with our representatives that we are supporting them
through this difficult economic time.

Your next question comes from Steph Wissink. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Stephanie Schiller Wissink>: Thank you. Piper Jaffray. Sheri, I have a question just as a follow-up to your
comments on the roll-out of technology. I'm curious if can give us an update on where some of those mobile and more
integrated technologies are from a system-wide rollout?
And then Jim, if you could help us on the cadence of the savings this year? It came in a little bit more lower than what I
would've expected Q1. I'm just curious if you can help us concentrate where you expect the bit chunks of savings to be
over the next couple of quarters. Thank you.
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Sure. As it relates to social selling, most of our businesses have mobile apps already in place, so
we're all over Facebook. We have a lot of technology on that front. Where we're focusing is on the back office on our
more order management systems. And so in first quarter, we implemented the back office portion in places like Turkey
and South Africa.
We are on track to implement the representative-facing side of our order management system, too, in Brazil in second
half of the year. So we're making very good progress. We have a map for our top 10 markets and we can track where
we are relative to the plan. It's a three-year plan. It does take time, but we're making good progress.
<A - James S. Scully>: Yes, as it relates to the cost side, I actually think we've made very good progress because we've
gotten to the $70 million target that we set out earlier this year. Having said that, that will be back-end loaded as these
actions that we're taking will roll out during the back half. I do think it's worth repeating what we said in February,
which is that we did expect the profit comparisons to be weaker in the front half versus the back half, really due to the
pricing actions that were taken and also the fact that we start realizing the cost benefits in the back half.

thumb, if you could, for quantification? And in that context, I'd just like to better understand the benefits of relocating

tax advantages played into the decision. So, can you help us with that, and as you do, maybe talk about how any of the

changing rules coming out of treasury may impact some of your initial assumptions. That will be very helpful. And
then if I could, I got a quick follow-up afterwards. Thanks.
<A - James S. Scully>: Okay. So as it relates to tax, I think it may be important to kind of take a step back and really
kind of remind people of the four key factors, which really drive the majority of the volatility within our tax rate. I
mean number one, it's really the country mix of our earnings. Two, importantly, it's the inability for us to recognize tax
benefits in some countries where we have current period losses, and we're not in a position to record the benefits of
those since we're in a valuation allowance situation. So, the third is we also are recording the cost of withholding tax,
taxes associated with the cash repatriation of bringing it back to the United States, which we cannot fully get credit for
in the U.S. And finally, the absolute level of pre-tax earnings.
So let me kind of give you guidance that you would ask for, which is, as I said in my prepared remarks, the current
period adjusted provision for income taxes in dollars was essentially flat as compared to the same period last year, but
on lower pre-tax earnings. I think if you were to look at history over the last several quarters, I think you'd find that the
adjusted provision for income taxes in dollars is in a relatively tight range, while there is a wider range in pre-tax
earnings. So, I think that is something worth looking at.
I think as you mentioned the UK move, I think as you heard earlier, there's a number of initiatives underway as a result
in not only the operating model changes, but also as it relates to the headquarters in the UK and as it really relates to the
operating model and the move to the UK. It's really about moving the corporate function closer to the commercial
markets, and as Sheri alluded to, it's a very small group of people actually going to the UK.
I think the bigger relocation of capabilities is to our markets within our footprints including, as Sheri mentioned, Brazil,
Poland and Buenos Aires. These moves not only leverage the key markets, but also help realign our cost base by
getting cost out of the U.S. into those markets.
And finally, as it relates to the transition to the UK at the corporate headquarters, it's really about leveraging the team
that we have in place there. In addition, it allows us – all these actions allow to mitigate some of the FX pressure that
we face as well as avail ourselves of tax planning and attributes that we have. So I'm not going to quantify any of the
benefits and as it relates to the treasury stuff that's going on, that's really more related to inversions, and this is clearly
not an inversion.
<Q - Stephen R. Powers>: Okay. That's all very helpful. Thank you. And then just really quickly, I know we're out of
time, but can you just confirm just the accounting, assuming as you go forward, assuming it is not anti-dilutive, we
should be assuming that the preferred stock that you've recently issued will be additive to the diluted share count in the
coming quarters, just given that you've got unpaid dividends that you have not accrued. That will all show up as more
dilutive shares, again assuming it is not anti-dilutive. Is that correct?
<A - James S. Scully>: I guess the answer – the short answer to your question is yes. We do the calculation to
determine if it's not anti-dilutive and if it's not then we would add the shares.
<Q - Stephen R. Powers>: Perfect. Thank you.

And your next question comes from the line of Javier Escalante. Please state your affiliation then pose your question.
<Q - Javier Escalante>: It's Consumer Edge Research. Good morning, everyone. My question – I have two quick
questions. One, the understanding the royalty stream, if any, coming from Cerberus as they license the Avon brand in
the U.S., whether that is already contributing in Q1? And if not, how much would that be on an annualized basis?
That's question one.
Question two has to do with this digitalization that you are doing. I mean I understand that a consumer interface
apparently is already is up and running in the top 10 markets and the service model is more patchy, But if you could
help us understand what kind of real benefit once you go on, on both ends has in the business? So if there is any market

that already has both the consumer side and the logistic side done, if you can give us the growth rate of that, that would
be helpful relative to, say, prior and after the implementation of the change. Thank you.
<A - James S. Scully>: So, as it relates the North America, the relationship, there is no royalty. It was a royalty-free
perpetual license, but we do retain 19.9% in that business. So it's not a royalty, but we do participate through the
minority interest that we hold in that business.
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Yeah. And Javier, as it relates to the digitalization, where we'll further have is in our Eastern
European countries, where we've seen very good progress. The benefit, I think you're really raising the question of
what's the benefit of it. The benefit from a representative standpoint is it's easier to place an order, it's easier to track,
she has the option, she has the choice to be able to have something delivered to her, delivered to her customers. So it's a
choice. The benefit is that we keep more representatives engaged. And ideally over time her earnings power is greater.
Those are the markets where we see that benefit. I don't have a before and after because it has been an evolution.
What we see though, is if you take a market like Poland, we have continued to see strong consistent performance
year-on-year. And that's because they continue to be very, very consistent in their representative base and engaging
customers. So, as we look at that and as we get some of our bigger markets more on track, we'll be able to track it
better, but again, I think it's that whole thing of making it easier for her to do business. If you go back to the history of
the company where many years ago you had the first representative, Mrs. Albee, train going around doing that, it then
went into door-to-door, then went to people bringing it to the office. It's really around – it's critical to our model and the
health of our model to make it easier for her to do business and make it easier for her to engage.
And so as we look at representative engagement and customer satisfaction, it's stronger in some of those markets. Over
time, we expect that that will continue and allow us to continue to be competitive and drive growth for the long term.
<Q - Javier Escalante>: But you plan to track the before and after, I would imagine, right? Hello?
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Yes. Right now, in the UK, we've introduced what we refer to as the choice model where
representatives can actually put on Facebook their own stores. We're tracking that. We're able to see how that's
performing. I think it's about 30,000 people that have signed so far. So we're monitoring that and we're looking at is she
getting higher orders than people that are doing [indiscernible] (64:10). So, we'll be able to get more granular
information on that.
<Q - Javier Escalante>: And then, to get an idea of the turnaround markets, could you compare them? You mentioned
that in your prepared remarks that the top 10 markets, it was either the local sales growth was faster, or the Active
Representatives, the engagement was better, or it was the Ending Reps were better. Could you actually quantify that for
us? So basically we can now, okay, the top 10 organic sales were at 4%, say, and whatever is left declined 5%. But
would it be very helpful for us to know that the places where you're focusing resources and attention of management is
actually gaining traction? Thank you.
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Yes, I'm looking to my folks around the table as to whether we're actually disclosing that
information. So, on Ending Reps, I can give you a perspective. The Ending Rep rate of growth was about double what
we – for the top markets versus we thought for the base. And so I can give you that perspective. We aren't actually
quantifying the top 10, but I will be able to give you color relative to the performance on the base business.

And your next question will come from the line of Olivia Tong. Please state your affiliation then pose your questions.
Olivia, go ahead. Your line is open. That question has been withdrawn. Your next question will come from the line of
Linda Bolton Weiser. Please state your affiliation then pose your question.
<Q - Linda B. Weiser>: Hi. B. Riley. I think when you were discussing cash flow performance you mentioned
working capital and some change related to service issues in North Latin America. Could you elaborate on what those
service issues were? And I assume that means Mexico. Thanks.

<A - James S. Scully>: Yes. So, what I mentioned was that inventories were slightly up and it was not necessarily as a
result of service levels. It was in anticipation of trying to avoid service levels and it was really related to the Fashion &
Home business, which we source through China. So, to avoid any potential delays given the strategy of going after
Fashion & Home, the team did build up inventories in Fashion & Home to avoid any potential service risk as a result of
that strategy.
We are happy with the payables performance, but when we look at the inventory, it was related to NOLA and Mexico
and also some Fashion & Home in EMEA. So, we're digging into that to make sure that we can get those levels down
over the remaining portion of the year.
<Q - Linda B. Weiser>: Okay. And then can I just ask also about cash flow? You mentioned there was this
comparison with regard to the FCPA payment in the first quarter. Are there any unusual comparisons in the remaining
quarters of the year that are worth highlighting that would affect the comparison on cash – on operating cash flow for
the remaining quarters? Thanks.
<A - James S. Scully>: No. It was just a $67 million payment last year, and then also the pension that I called out this
year. Those are the ones, we don't anticipate any in the future quarters.
<Q - Linda B. Weiser>: Okay. Thanks a lot.

And your final question today will come from the line of Mark Astrachan with – please state your affiliation then pose
your question.
<Q - Mark S. Astrachan>: Yeah. Thanks, and good morning everybody. It's Stifel. Wanted to understand your
thoughts on Avon's product positioning longer term. It seems over the last year or so macro challenges in your biggest
markets like Latin America and EMEA favored trade-down in your categories, and yet Avon has under-performed the
beauty market. Curious if you disagree with that.
And then on a go-forward basis, as I think FX and macro improves, those consumers presumably begin to trade back
up. And I'm wondering as you position the business longer term, can you sort of offer those consumers the higher-end
products that you think that they will be desiring?
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Sure. So our strategy is to make sure that we have offerings at value, mass, and then sort of the
mass [indiscernible] (68:45) positioning. And so our strategy is to move people up the curve as best as we can. What
we've seen is that, in some cases, particularly in Brazil, which we're monitoring very closely, is we're not even seeing
consumers trade down, per se.
What we're seeing is the category contract. So one of the things that we're doing – and we're doing well from a share
perspective, but we need to make sure that we're continuing to have offerings at all levels. So we have our Korres
brand, which is a higher position brand. It's doing quite well. We're just rolling that out now and we're able to garner
the price and drive that positioning. Avon brand is obviously mid-tier, and then we have some of the lower-value
positioning, particularly in some of our personal care areas that are really important for us to drive volumes.
So, we see ourselves as making sure that we are with the consumer and – middle-class consumer. We obviously want to
trade up. In some cases, we're doing it with other brands. But we're also looking at how we reposition our brand to
make sure we continue to drive that. But I'm not seeing as much as a trade down as I'm seeing people opting out and
changing their behaviors relative to how they're driving categories, particularly in Skincare. That's probably the most
notable area where we do see that difference.
