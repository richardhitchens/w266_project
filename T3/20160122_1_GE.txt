Let me start with some thoughts on the macro environment and GE's fit in it. For the last few years, I've talked about a
slow growth and volatile economy. This is still my view. In the fourth quarter, across our own large Industrial footprint,
orders grew by 1% organically and our backlog is at a record of $315 billion, up 7% organically. Our biggest Industrial
business, which is Power, had organic orders growth of 29% in the quarter. I have a difficult time reconciling this with
the mood that is in the markets. Clearly, oil pricing is a concern and will have an impact. But our organic orders growth
in the Middle East were up 14% in the quarter, so economic activity is ongoing.
I know there is a concern about emerging markets in total, but our organic growth was up 7% in the quarter ex-Alstom.
And our business in China grew slightly organically in the year and backlog grew by 11%. So we're seeing a lot of
economic volatility, but there is still enough business out there for GE to hit its goals.
The GE team had a good quarter in a volatile environment. Total operating EPS was $0.52, up 27%; and Industrial EPS
was $0.47, up 27%. Orders were up slightly and organic growth was down slightly versus a year ago. Total Industrial
margins expanded by 80 basis points. And 2015 CFOA grew by 8% to $16.4 billion. Industrial profit expanded by 3%
organically.
We hit or exceeded all of our goals in 2015. Organic growth was up 3% with 80 basis points of margin expansion,
leading to 7% organic profit growth. EPS was $1.31, up 17%. We achieved this despite having $0.05 of FX headwind.
The Verticals hit their plan and Capital returned $4.3 billion to the parent. Our cash and free cash flow execution was
ahead of plan.
We've returned $33 billion to investors, including the excellent execution with Synchrony. We also executed a massive
amount of portfolio change in the year. GE Capital exits are ahead of plan with $157 billion of signings to-date. The
impact of Alstom was flat on EPS, slightly better than expected. Alstom had an impact on several segments and Jeff
will take you through those results. But on balance, we like what we see in Alstom.
And last week, we announced the disposition of Appliances to Haier for $5.4 billion. This will create an attractive gain
and allow us to significantly increase our restructuring targets in 2016. So we are committed to our 2016 framework in
the face of macroeconomic volatility.
Now, for orders, orders grew by 3%, which was up 1% organically and, as I said earlier, our backlog is $315 billion, up
7% ex-Alstom. Alstom added $29 billion to our backlog. Services grew by 5%, which was up 3% organically. And
equipment grew by 2%, which was down slightly organically. Service orders were strong. Power Gen service orders
grew by 13% ex-Alstom and commercial Aviation service orders were up 14%. Healthcare service orders were up 3%
and Alstom orders were $2.6 billion.
We had some nice wins with Alstom in China on the Hydro business, several combined cycle gas turbine power plants
with richer GE content, and the Hinkley Point nuclear steam turbine in the United Kingdom.
On the product side at GE, we also had some solid highlights. Two I will call out. Power booked 12 H turbine orders in
the quarter. And we now have 33 in backlog. In addition, we have another 49 technical selections. And in Healthcare,
our MR orders grew by 18% in the quarter and our Bioprocessing grew by 16% in the quarter, so great results by those
businesses.
Globally, orders were generally positive, growing 8% in total and 12% in the growth regions. As I said earlier, we had
strengthened the Middle East and ASEAN and India. And Latin America was also decent. Including Alstom, China was
up 15% in orders in the quarter, and backlog grew by 16% to $21 billion. Order pricing was up 0.9% in the quarter, and
we have good pricing momentum in both Aviation and Power. So overall, our backlog and orders pricing gives us high
visibility as we approach our organic growth targets in 2016.
So let's talk about the execution of the team and what you saw in the segment results. Overall, the team executed in a
tough environment. In the quarter, organic growth was down slightly, but for the year, organic growth was up 3% with
seven of eight segments growing. Service remained steady, up 5% in the year and 4% in the quarter, organically.
The Oil & Gas team, I'd really like to call out, because I think they executed very well in 2015. With a 7% decline in
revenue, their organic operating profit grew by 1%, and this is ahead of what we said last year. Our team executed on

restructuring, they improved their value gap, and they invested in their core franchise. And we expect the team to
continue to execute in 2016.
Looking at revenue in 2016, let me just give you a few metrics and some things to think about. We primarily ship from
backlog, so orders and backlog growth matter. In 2015, six of seven businesses grew backlog, some substantially.
When we do our analytics around convertible backlog in business performance, we see a path to 2% to 4% organic
growth for 2016, even with a very difficult oil and gas market. The most robust part of our business is service. Service
backlog grew by 16% in 2015, and we expect another year of 20% plus growth in our digital applications. Both these
support sustain growth and services.
We had another strong quarter and year in margins. For the year, Industrial margins were up 80 basis points at the
segment level and 110 basis points overall. Services were up 40 basis points and equipment was up 20 basis points. We
continued to make good progress on value gap, up more than $450 million on the year and cost productivity. Mix was
favorable in the quarter, and in addition, we have solid momentum for cost out. Again, due to the Haier Appliances
gain, we can do a record level of restructuring in 2016 to fortify our framework. Specifically, we believe we can
execute on an incremental $1.7 billion in the year, which should yield incremental benefits.
Last year, we discussed a new compensation plan that was aligned with investors and delivered results. I'm convinced
that this incentivized our team to deliver superior results in 2015. And we have set our 2016 targets to drive our
framework. Our strategy and business models paying off, and we believe we can deliver strong performance in the face
of economic volatility.
Now, for cash. CFOA grew for the year by 8%. Industrial free cash flow grew by 4%, and total free cash flow grew by
14% to $13.5 billion. Total year core Industrial cash flow ex-Alstom was $12.6 billion, up 3%, and total year free cash
flow conversion was 85%, in line with our expectations. GE Capital dividends were $4.3 billion for the year, and we're
still on track for $18 billion in dividends to the parent in 2016.
The balance sheet is very strong and the price for Appliances was a pleasant surprise. The business had been improving
and there was strong interest in the business. At a price of $5.4 billion, it gives us more than $1.3 billion of incremental
cash. For capital allocation, we returned $33 billion in the year including Synchrony, and looking at 2016, we're still on
track to return $26 billion to investors in dividend and buyback.
So before I turn over to Jeff, let me reflect a little on the Alstom results. We've integrated two months of revenue, all of
the deal related costs, and the impact of the joint ventures, all for the first time. There is inherent complexity as we go
through it so bear with us, but in general, I would say the business and our outlook and our execution are on track and
we're still excited about Alstom.
Jeffrey S. Bornstein
Thanks, Jeff.
I'll start with the fourth quarter summary. Revenues were $33.9 billion, up 1% in the quarter. Industrial revenues,
including corporate, were up 3% to $31.3 billion. You can see on the right side that Industrial segments were down 1%
reported and down 1% organic. Alstom revenue of $2 billion in the quarter was offset by $1.3 billion of foreign
exchange and dispositions of $700 million.
Industrial operating plus Verticals EPS was $0.52, up 27%, and that's driven by Industrial up 27% and Verticals flat.
The operating EPS number of $0.31 includes other continuing GE Capital activity including headquarter run-off and
other exit-related items I'll cover in more detail shortly. $0.26 of continuing EPS includes the impact of non-operating
pension, and net EPS of $0.64 includes discontinued operations. The total disc-ops impact was a positive $3.7 billion,
driven by the $3.4 billion gain from Synchrony and earnings from the businesses held in sale.
As Jeff said, we generated $16.4 billion of CFOA for the year. That's up 8%. Industrial CFOA was $12.1 billion, down
1%, but up 3% when you exclude Alstom CFOA and taxes associated with the disposition of Signaling.

The GE tax rate was 5%, bringing the total year rate to 14%. The tax rate in the quarter was driven by the Appliances
transaction moving into 2016, tax benefits associated with integrating our existing service business with Alstom's
business in Switzerland, higher tax benefits principally on the Signaling gain we had in the quarter, and legislation
making the U.S. research credit permanent. The reported GE Capital tax rate in the quarter of 39% reflects a tax benefit
on a pre-tax loss. The tax rate for the Vertical businesses was a negative 13%, reflecting reduced income at EFS and
international tax benefits that will diminish as we complete the GE Capital exit plan. Going forward, as we complete
the exit, we expect GE Capital Vertical tax rate to be approximately 10%.
On the right side of the segment results, as I mentioned, Industrial segment revenues were down 1% reported and down
1% organic, with foreign exchange and dispositions offsetting Alstom. The foreign exchange was a $1.3 billion drag on
Industrial segment revenue and a $163 million impact on Industrial segment op profit. The Power, Renewables and
Energy Management businesses were impacted by the Alstom acquisition, and I'll walk you through the impact on the
next page.
At the December outlook meeting, we said we would present Industrial results including corporate operating costs. On
that basis, Industrial op profit for the quarter was down 6% reported, but up 3% organically on strong corporate cost
performance. To give you context on the quarter, organic revenue at down 1% was a little over $1 billion lower than we
expected. This was driven by Power, lower by about $350 million on expanded scope in BOP, aero and reciprocating
engines that did not close in the quarter, about $400 million in Renewables on lower wind turbines, which I'll cover
more on shortly, and $300 million of softness in Oil & Gas and $100 million of softness in convertible orders in our
Energy Management business. Most of the $1 billion was timing, and we expect it to convert in 2016. For the full year,
organic revenue was up 3%.
What's laid out on this page is the impact of Alstom on the Power, Renewables and Energy Management businesses.
You can see the reported op profit of the businesses in the first column, the impact of Alstom in the middle column, and
the op profit and the Vs excluding Alstom on the right. Power on a standalone basis would have been down 5%.
Renewables would have been down 54%, and Energy Management would have been up 4%. The outsized impact of
Alstom and Energy Management business is due to the JV structure of Digital Energy in the Alstom Grid business.
We contributed positive earnings from Digital Energy to Alstom's business that had negative earnings. Remember that
this is a 50:50 JV, and we consolidate 100% of the revenue but record only 50% of the earnings. In the case of Energy
Management, the 17% organic V reflects the organic performance for the Power Conversion and Industrial Solutions
business, which is how we report organic for this segment going on. The organic V, including Digital Energy, would
have been plus 19%.
In the quarter, the EPS impact of Alstom was breakeven, with a pre-tax loss of $234 million in the segments and an
additional $160 million of deal costs and accounting items at corporate, offset by positive tax benefits. Revenue was $2
billion and orders were $2.6 billion. As we look to 2016, no change to the guidance we gave you of $0.05 of EPS from
Alstom.
Next, I'll do the earnings walk as we've been doing for the last number of quarters, so you understand the dynamics
clearly on what's going on in earnings. Starting with the first column on the left and working down, Industrial operating
net income was $4.6 billion and Vertical income was $438 million, for total Industrial plus Verticals operating earnings
of $5.1 billion.
On the other GE Capital line, we incurred $2.1 billion of costs in the quarter. This was driven by restructuring charges,
the preferred dividend payment, headquarter run-off, operating expenses, and excess interest costs. We also took an
impairment of about $800 million related to the Homer City power plant asset, which I'll cover more on in the GE
Capital page.
As a result, total operating earnings were $3 billion. Including non-operating pension costs, continuing earnings were
$2.6 billion. We had $3.7 billion of income in discontinued operations, principally related to the Synchrony gain.
Adjusting for these items, net earnings for the quarter were $6.3 billion. In the center and the far-right columns, you can
see the associated EPS numbers and the variance versus prior year.

On the next page, Industrial other items for the quarter, we had $0.04 of charges related to Industrial restructuring and
other items that were taken at Corporate. Charges were $567 million on a pre-tax basis, with $160 million of those
charges related to the Alstom deal costs and accounting items. We also had $1 billion of Industrial gains of the quarter,
which equated to $0.08 of EPS at the transactional tax rates. The pre-tax Signaling gain was $622 million and the
Appliance break-up fee was $175 million. Additionally, we sold our Embedded Controls business in Energy
Management and our Clarient business in Healthcare.
On the bottom of the page, you can see the total year restructuring gains profile. We incurred restructuring charges of
$0.12 and had gains of $0.11, for a net charge of $0.01 for the year. This was $0.02 better than we communicated in
December, driven by about $0.01 of lower restructuring, primarily Alstom-related, and slightly higher gains, driven by
predominantly tax, at the transaction level.
For 2016, we expect gains in restructuring to largely offset for the year. However, there will be a quarterly variability in
the timing. As Jeff mentioned, we signed the Appliances transaction, which we expect to contribute about $0.20 of gain
midyear this year. That combined with some smaller transactions should yield gains of about $0.25 in 2016. We will
use this opportunity to continue to invest in improving the Industrial margins and costs. This will benefit us not only in
2016, but will position us well for 2017 and 2018.
Now I'll go through the segments, starting with the Power business. With the combination of Alstom into the Power
segment, we have reorganized some of the sub-businesses, so I'll take a minute to walk through these changes. First, the
Thermal business was renamed Gas Power Systems. This business includes gas turbines and steam and generators for
combined cycle applications. And additionally, we moved the equipment side of our aero turbines business to Gas
Power Systems.
Second, the Power Services business includes our PGS business and services related to HERO turbines. The
Distributed Power business now includes just our reciprocating engines and the service businesses for Jenbacher and
Waukesha. Additionally, as you know, we have a standalone Steam business that we acquired from Alstom.
Moving to the financial results, orders in the quarter of $9.6 billion, including $1 billion of Alstom orders, grew 40%.
Excluding Alstom, orders were $8.6 billion, up 25%, with equipment orders up 46% and services up 8%. Within
equipment orders, Gas Power Systems was higher by 60% ex-Alstom. The increase was driven by orders for 55 gas
turbines versus 41 last year and expanded scope including BOP for a large Saudi 7F order. In the fourth quarter, we
took new orders for 12 H turbines versus two last year, five units in the U.S., four in Pakistan, and three in Asia. Our H
backlog now totals 33 with an additional 49 technical selections, for a total of 82 units.
Aero turbine orders were down 14% on 43 units versus 50 units last year, and Distributed Power engines were lower by
12%, with weakness in Waukesha gas compression partly offset by strong orders in Jenbacher. Equipment OPI was
strong at 6.7%, driven by H turbine demand.
Service orders excluding Alstom grew 8% on higher installations, growth in multiyear contracts, and strong upgrades.
AGP sold 42 for the quarter versus 26 a year ago, bringing total year orders on AGPs to 119. Alstom orders, as I
mentioned, totaled $1 billion, including two steam turbines and six HSRGs, one in conjunction with GE orders.
Ex-Alstom, equipment backlog ended at $8.3 billion, up 15%. Service backlog grew 4% to $53 billion. And total
Power backlog ended the year at $62 billion ex-Alstom and $77 billion with Alstom.
Core GE revenues were $6.2 billion, down 10% and down 7% organically. Equipment revenues were down 25%,
driven by fewer gas turbine shipments, foreign exchange, and lower balance of plan. In the quarter, the business
shipped 28 gas turbines versus 44 a year ago. Total year shipments were 107 units. Lower units and lower BOP were
driven by no repeat of the large Algerian deal in the fourth quarter of last year. Service revenues were up 1%, driven by
Power Services, up 8%. AGPs were 35 in the quarter versus 24 a year ago, bringing total shipments to 104 for the year.
Strength in Power Services partly offset lower Distributed Power service, down 15%. Alstom revenues in the quarter
totaled $917 million with $255 million from equipment and $662 million from services.

GE core operating profit was $1.7 billion, down 5%. The decrease was driven by lower volume and partially offset by
positive value gap. Margins improved 140 basis points in the quarter. Alstom operating profit was a loss of $80 million,
reflecting operations, deal cost, and accounting adjustments. Given the scale of the Alstom consolidation on our first
close, things went reasonably well.
The core business came in a little lower on revenue than expected, driven by the timing of BOP and aero engine
shipments. However, orders were better than expected on strong demand for both H and F products, particularly in
Saudi and Pakistan.
2016 is a big execution year with the Alstom integration shipping approximately 24 H turbines and executing on our
product cost strategy. In total, we expect to ship 110 gas turbines and 125 AGPs with 60% to 65% of these units
shipping in the second half of the year in 2016.
Next, I'll cover Renewables. Total renewable orders were $2.5 billion in the quarter, up 1%. Excluding Alstom, orders
were $2 billion, down 18% and down 10% ex-foreign exchange. We took orders for 827 wind turbines versus 1,251 a
year ago in the quarter. The decline was a result of lower U.S. orders partly driven by the strength in the fourth quarter
of last year related to the PTC extension. This year, the PTC extension includes a multi-year phase-out.
Orders were also impacted by the shift from the 1.x product line to the new 2.x and 3.x products that drive fewer units,
but more megawatts. Additionally, we had three deals delayed to 2016 for a total of 240 turbines or about $550 million
of orders. Orders outside the U.S. were up 19% ex-FX and down 2% reported with strength in Europe, the Middle East
and South Asia. Backlog in the Renewables core business ended at $7.1 billion, up 27% year-over-year. Alstom
renewable orders were $469 million in the quarter, with a large Hydro win of $400 million in China at the Three
Gorges project. Alstom added $5.3 billion of backlog to the Renewables business.
Renewables revenue for the fourth quarter totaled $1.9 billion, lower by 16% and down 8% ex-exchange. The legacy
GE business had revenue of $1.9 billion, down 20% reported and down 12% ex-foreign exchange. Core unit shipments
were 847 in the quarter versus 1,081 last year. This was lower than expected as two deals for 165 turbines pushed into
2016.
Operating profit ex-Alstom was $125 million, down 54%. The decline was attributable to lower volume of 234 units,
negative mix from the new 2.x product as we come down the cost curve and foreign exchange. Alstom op profit was a
loss of $69 million. In 2016, we expect to ship about 3,050 onshore turbines, including 250 of Alstom wind units. As
Jeff discussed earlier, 2016 organic revenues should be high-single-digits to low-double-digits, depending on the mix
of units shipped. Core op profits should be flat to up slightly as the businesses focus on improving the cost curve for the
new 2.0 and 3.0 megawatt product launches, and delivering $100 million of Alstom cost synergies
Next on Aviation, global passenger air travel continues to grow robustly, up 6.7% November year-to-date. Both
domestic and international markets are strong, particularly, in the Middle East and Asia Pacific. Air freight volume
grew 2.3% November year-to-date. Orders in the fourth quarter of $6.8 billion were down 16%. Commercial engine
orders were down 47%, as expected. We booked $1.9 billion of engine orders, including $100 million of GE90, $600
million in GEnx orders, $400 million of LEAP CFM orders and $500 million CF6 orders. Commercial equipment
backlog ended the year at $29.5 billion, up 11%.
Military equipment orders of $353 million in the quarter were higher by 2 times on a large Navy F414 order. Service
orders were higher by 9% with strong commercial spares orders, up 10% to $39 million a day and CSAs were up 24%
in the quarter. Military services were down 20%. Services backlog ended the year at over $116 billion, of 15% versus
last year.
Revenues of $6.7 billion were up 5% with commercial equipment revenues down 5%. We shipped 59 GEnx units
versus 77 last year, driven by schedule. We have no delinquencies to Boeing. Military equipment revenue was down
1%, and services revenue was up strongly at 18%, driven by commercial services up 24%. Operating profit grew 12%
on strength in services, positive value gap and good cost productivity. Operating margin rates improved to 160 basis
points.

The Aviation team delivered another solid execution year. For the year, revenues grew 3%, operating profit grew 11%
and margins expanded 160 basis points. Our share on each of our engine platforms is very strong and the LEAP launch
remains on track for midyear. We expect another solid year from David Joyce and the team at Aviation.
Next is Oil & Gas. The segment continues to operate in a very difficult environment, and we continue to be focused on
being hyper-competitive on new opportunities and very aggressive on the cost structure. For the fourth quarter, orders
of $3.3 billion were down 35% and down 28% organically. Equipment orders were down 52% or 44% organically. All
segments had lower orders driven by delays and reduced CapEx spending with the exception of our Downstream
platform, which grew orders 51% reported and up 84% organically.
For the other segments on a reported basis, Subsea was down 49%, TMS was down 78%, and Surface was down 65%.
Service orders were down 17% and down 13% organically. On a reported basis, TMS was down 24%, Surface was
down 29%, Subsea was down 35% and M&C was down 8%, partly offset by Downstream, which grew service orders
by 20%.
Not included in orders but included in backlog, TMS signed four new long-term service agreements, totaling $1.5
billion in the quarter. Total backlog ended the year at about $23 billion, which was down 9% versus last year and down
4% ex-exchange. Revenues in the quarter were down 16% reported and down 6% organic. Foreign exchange reduced
revenues $437 million in the quarter. Equipment revenues were down 21% reported and 12% organically. By business,
Surface was down 49%, TMS down 18%, Subsea down 15%. Organically, TMS was down 8%, Subsea was down 5%.
Service revenues were down 9% and flat organically, with M&C down 5% offset by TMS up 22% organically.
Operating profit in the quarter was down 19% and down 7% organic. Foreign exchange in the quarter was a $93
million headwind. The business continued to deliver on cost reductions and deflation, which partially offset the
negative volume and price. Margin rates were down 70 basis points. On an organic basis, margins contracted 10 basis
points. The business executed an early and aggressive cost-out program beginning in 2014, delivering $600 million of
cost-out during 2015. For the year, revenue in op profit were down 5% and up 1%, respectively. And organic margin
rates actually expanded 90 basis points.
For 2016, our best view for revenues in op profit continues to be down 10% to 15%, most likely, at the bottom end of
that range, given the outlook for the industry and our view of volume and price. Our base plan at December outlook
called for $400 million of cost-out in 2016 to get to the $1 billion run rate over 2015 and 2016. We are working another
$400 million of additional cost-out reductions to offset the likely lower volume and price pressure. We expect the first
half to be tougher year-over-year versus the second half. Lorenzo and his team have executed very well in 2015 and we
expect that business will continue to outperform on a relative basis in 2016.
Next up in Healthcare, orders of $5.2 billion were down 4%, but up 1% organically. Geographically, orders in the U.S.
were down 1%, Europe was down 8% and up 4% ex-FX, and the Middle East region was down 4% and up 5% ex-FX.
China was down 6% reported and down 3% ex-FX. Tenders in China continue to improve slowly. Year-over-year,
tenders were flat after several quarters of contraction.
In terms of business lines, Healthcare Systems orders were down 6% and down 1%, excluding exchange. The U.S. was
down 2%, driven by lower molecular imaging and X-ray on tough comparisons offset partially by strong MR, up 33%,
and ultrasound up 5% on new product upgrades. Europe was down 8% reported, but grew 5% ex-foreign exchange.
Europe was up 5% ex-FX for the year and has seen six consecutive quarters of organic growth. China orders were
down 11% reported and down 9%, excluding exchange. Our current outlook for 2016 is for orders growth in China as
government tenders begin to rebound.
Life Sciences continue to perform very well. In the fourth quarter, orders grew 2%, up 8% ex-exchange. Within Life
Sciences, bioprocess grew 16% ex-FX with strength in Korea, China and the U.S. Healthcare revenues were down 3%
reported and up 3% ex-FX. Healthcare Systems revenues were lower by 4% reported, and up 3% ex-FX, and Life
Sciences revenues grew 6% excluding exchange.
Operating profit was lower versus the fourth quarter of last year by 4%, excluding exchange and lower by 8% reported.
Volume growth and cost productivity were more than offset by price and higher growth investments. Margin rates

contracted 100 basis points in the quarter.
In 2016, we expect John and the Healthcare business to improve operationally in terms of earnings and margin rates.
Our outlook is for the Life Science business to continue to grow strongly and profitably, and for the HCS business to
execute the digital transformation and aggressively reduce products and service costs.
In Transportation, North American carloads were down 6.4% in the quarter, driven by very weak car-loads in coal,
down almost 20% and petroleum down 13%. Intermodal volume was also down 1% in the quarter. For the year,
volume was down 2.2%, driven by commodities, with intermodal higher by 2%. Lower volume and operational
improvements have improved velocity on the rails on average 2.4 miles an hour. That's up 10% versus last year.
For our business, orders in the quarter were very strong, up 66%, to $3.2 billion, driven by equipment orders up 113%.
We took our largest order ever of 1,000 locos in India and also secured an order for 100 Tier 4s in the U.S. Service
orders were down 6% ex-Signaling on lower overhaul volume, driven by increased parked locos.
Revenues were up 2% reported and up 11% ex-Signaling. Equipment revenues were higher by 17%, 27% organically,
principally driven by locomotives partly offset by services, down 8% on lower overhauls. Op profit was higher in the
quarter by 18% ex-Signaling, and up 8% reported. Increased loco volume, value gap and productivity drove earnings
higher. Margins improved 100 basis points reported and 120 basis points, organically.
The Transportation team delivered a tremendous year. Excluding the Signaling sale, they grew revenue 7%, operating
profit 16%, and improved margins 150 basis points. They launched and delivered 425 Tier 4 locomotives on time, on
cost, and the performance has significantly exceeded customer expectations.
2016 is going to be a more challenging year with softer demand in the U.S. and in the commodity markets. We shipped
985 locos in 2015 and expect to ship about 800 in 2016. The team is executing an aggressive cost plan to address the
lower volume. We expect the business to be down mid-single-digits on op profit in 2016.
On Energy Management, as I mentioned earlier, describing results for Energy Management is complicated by the
contribution of our Digital Energy business to the Grid JV. For financial reporting purposes, we'll report 100% of the
Grid JV's orders and revenues, but only report 50% of their earnings. Going forward, we will report results on this
basis, but all our organic calculations will include only Industrial Solutions and the Power Conversion business.
Orders in the quarter were $2.6 billion, up 15% reported. Of the $2.6 billion, $1.1 billion was from the Grid business
with Alstom contributing $716 million and Digital Energy business contributing $342 million. Digital Energy orders
were down 10% reported and down 8%, organically. Power Conversion orders were down 17% and down 11%,
organically, on no repeat of large renewable orders in the fourth quarter of last year.
For the total year, Power Conversion orders were very strong, up 19% organically. Industrial Solutions orders in the
quarter were down 17% reported and down 11% organically, driven by foreign exchange and dispositions. North
America demand in the quarter was weak across all Industrial Solutions segments.
Backlog for the quarter ended at $11.7 billion. Reported revenues of $2.4 billion were higher by 20%. Grid Solutions
revenue totaled $952 million, inclusive of $393 million of Digital Energy revenue. Industrial Solutions revenues were
down 8% and down 4% organically. Power Conversion was down 6%, but up 9% organically.
Reported op profit for the Energy Management segment was $33 million, which includes the effects of establishing the
Grid JV and Alstom's results. Before the effects of Alstom, as I covered earlier, Energy Management earned $118
million of op profit, up 4%, driven by productivity and the gain on sale in our meters business, partly offset by lower
Industrial Solutions volume. The contribution of our Digital Energy business to the Grid JV combined with the Alstom
Grid operating results equaled the loss, which we recorded at 50% or $5 million.
Next, we announced last week, and Jeff spoke about it earlier, we have an agreement to sell our Appliance unit to
Haier, which we expect to close midyear. Fourth quarter results for both Appliances and Lighting had revenue
essentially flat. Appliance revenue was up slightly from last year, and Lighting saw flat revenue and growth
organically. LED growth in the quarter was 28%.

Operating profit for the segment was up 28%, with very strong performance in Appliances, up 51% on strong cost
performance, and up 4% organically in Lighting, but down 10% reported driven by foreign exchange. The Appliance
team had a strong year, essentially doubling profits and expanding margins significantly. They've also done an
outstanding job managing the business through this disposition process.
Lastly, I'll cover GE Capital. Our Verticals businesses earned $438 million this quarter. That's up 7% from prior year,
driven by operations and higher tax benefits, partially offset by lower gains. Portfolio quality remains stable, and the
Aviation portfolio finished the quarter with zero delinquencies and only two AOGs.
Working down the page, GE Capital Corporate generated a $2 billion loss in the quarter, principally driven by
restructuring and other charges related to the GE Capital transformation, preferred dividend payments, excess interest
costs, including the costs associated with the debt exchange we completed in October, and headquarters operating
costs.
In the current quarter, we took an impairment of approximately $800 million on our Homer City coal-fired power plant
in the U.S. related to a decision to exit the investment over time. This investment was not strategic to the Verticals
go-forward business, and this action will align its portfolio more closely to the GE Store going forward, discharges
within the framework of the $23 billion charge to affect the GE Capital transformation.
Discontinued operations, which now includes the Consumer segment, generated earnings of $3.7 billion, primarily
driven by a $3.4 billion gain associated with the Synchrony split-off as well as the earnings and gains from
discontinued operations. Overall, GE Capital reported $2.1 billion of earnings, and we ended the quarter with $167
billion of ENI excluding liquidity. The Verticals entered the quarter with $79 billion of ENI excluding liquidity. Our
liquidity levels remained very strong at $91 billion.
Our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio was 14.5%, which is up 80 basis points from the third quarter after paying dividends
of $3.9 billion during the quarter, bringing our total dividends in 2015 to $4.3 billion.
Asset sales remained ahead of plan, and we ended the year with $157 billion of signed deals and $104 billion of deals
closed.
Overall, Keith and the GE Capital team have executed ahead of schedule on all aspects versus the plan we shared with
you back in April. We expect to be largely complete by the end 2016 and are on track to file for SIFI rescission in the
first quarter of this year.
And, with that, I'll turn it back to Jeff.
Jeffrey R. Immelt
So let me end by going through our operating framework. This is the framework I showed in December. We have no
change; we're increasing our goals for disposition cash. I know a lot's happened early in the year, but 2015 closed about
where we thought it would.
So let's start with organic growth of 2% to 4%. We finished 2015 with $315 billion of backlog.
Earlier I outlined how we achieved those goals even in the face of a tougher oil and gas market. We have broad
business and geographic diversity. And service, which is 80% of our earnings, should continue to grow by 3% to 5% in
2016.
We had two months of Alstom in 2015, and so far so good. We think our synergies are achievable. And with the
Appliances transaction, we're now looking at the ability to fund incremental restructuring. In addition, this gives us
upside to our disposition cash for the year.
All of our goals for GE Capital remain on track. Our dispositions are a year ahead of plan. Capital dividends are the key
to returning about $26 billion to you this year, and we plan to file for SIFI de-designation later this quarter.

We're acting to get more out of this economy. We're aggressively managing our cost structure to capitalize on deflation.
We have a very strong balance sheet with substantial cash. We have the ability to finance our industrial products, which
is a huge advantage. Our diversity in both regions and markets allows us to outperform single-purpose competitors.
We can move production to the lowest-cost regions and capitalize on currency or excess capacity. We have all the
elements to help ourselves in a tough economy, buyback capacity, substantial restructuring funding, and services
growth. And we've continued to invest. Our long-term commitments for R&D, globalization, and investments like
Alstom have built a huge backlog.
So just to recap some of our highlights for 2016, double-digit EPS growth, returning $26 billion of cash, Alstom
integration, digital execution, there's really a lot of value here in GE.
So, Matt, now let me turn it back over to you for some questions.
Matthew G. Cribbins
Thanks, Jeff. Operator, please open up the line for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Scott Davis with Barclays.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: Hi. Good morning, guys.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Scott. Good morning.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: One of the things that's changed in the last couple months is just the severe currency
devaluations we've seen in some of the emerging markets out there. But your order book in EM seems to be pretty
good. Are you pricing – can you just give us a sense of – current and past, are you pricing contracts in U.S. dollars? Are
you pricing them in local currency, or is there a mix? Just a little color there.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Oh gosh, maybe I'll do a little bit on the geographic side, Scott, and then I give you a sense.
We had a very strong fourth quarter in the Middle East. That was a lot driven by Power. Pricing actually was pretty
good on those transactions for the quarter. I'd say on balance, the pricing we've experienced on Power, Rail, Aviation,
usually those show up in the pricing, in the backlog and the order book. So I don't think we've seen really any
diminution of pricing in the emerging market orders. As you know, guys, our stuff is lumpy. So there are big
transactions, but we don't see any of that. I don't know, Jeff, would you add to that?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Just a couple things. So what we do in China, there has been very little – albeit a little bit
more lately, the differences in exchange between the U.S. and China are pretty de minimis. A lot of our businesses, like
Aviation, are dollar-based. And then obviously in Oil & Gas and Energy Management and a number of other
businesses, we do work in local currency. And so Brazil where we're in Brazil, and Europe in the euro, we've had a
little bit of a currency impact, and that's what you hear us reporting when we give you reported versus organic.
On the orders front, I don't think we've seen that big of an impact. And when you look at orders in the quarter,
particularly in Power, orders price has been very, very good, very strong, particularly on the H turbine, largely because
we're selling out slots.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: Yes, that makes sense. And then just moving to Oil & Gas, how does $30 oil impact your
2016 outlook? And I guess what I mean is that you have – 2015 was pretty amazing with the cost-out. You haven't seen
decremental margins at all in that business. Is that sustainable? Are there breakpoints in oil prices, or it's just not
sustainable anymore to maintain that type of drop-through?

<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: So again, Scott, what I would say is that just on a macro comment, there are still a lot of
efficiency opportunities we have on our Oil & Gas business, both in the supply chain. And so I think what Jeff talked
about earlier in terms of the ability to do incremental restructuring, it's still out there. And then I would just again
segment our business into project-based business where we're still in execution mode, and that's probably 70% or 80%
of our total revenues. And then businesses like Drilling & Surface that are probably the most susceptible as oil pricing
goes down to $30, where trying to stay ahead on the cost curve is going to be very difficult in the future, and we just
need to be flexible at a $30 environment, the one we see today. But that's a very small portion of our overall Oil & Gas
business.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: I would just add, I'll just expound a little bit on what Jeff said. So if you think about the
business, our long term, more contractual and project-based stuff, Turbomachinery, Downstream and Subsea, that's
about 65% of our revenue in 2016. And of those revenues, more than 70% of those are in backlog. If you add the M&C
business on top of that, which tends to be more flowing convertible, but it's about roughly 50% exposure to Oil & Gas
and 50% to non-Oil & Gas. That's 85% of revenue. And when you add M&C, you've got about a little bit north of 65%
of next year's revenues in backlog. So to Jeff's point, the real short-term exposure today, anyway, as we look at it is
Surface and Drilling, and they are very susceptible to volatility around what they see for convertible demand in any
period of time, but it's 15% of the revenue.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: But again, Jeff, I'd come back and – because of Appliances, guys, we have $2 billion-plus of
restructuring that wasn't in our plan when we stood in front of you in December.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: So let me just go through that, and I was going to go to Oil & Gas. So the way we think
about it, within the range about 10% to 15%, everything else being, we may be at the lower-end of the range, we may
be closer to down 15%. We came into the year, we told you we had a plan to take $400 million of cost out on top of the
$600 million of cost out we delivered in 2015 for a total of $1 billion over the two years, 2015 and 2016. We're now
going after an incremental $400 million on top of that.
So now we're trying to deliver $800 million of cost-out in 2016, and Appliances is an important part of our ability to do
that. So we're going to invest more aggressively in 2016 in restructuring the Oil & Gas footprint than we even did 2015.
And so that gives us, Scott, some ability to moderate potentially if revenues are even lower or at the lower-end of the
range that we can moderate the impact on profitability.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: Sounds like Appliances was timed just right. So good luck. Congrats, guys,
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Thanks.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: I'll step off, thanks.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Thanks, Scott.
Operator
The next question is from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Julian Mitchell>: Hi, thank you.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Julian. Good morning.
<Q - Julian Mitchell>: Good morning. Just a quick question firstly on Alstom. The core business, as you say, lost
money on the EBIT line in Q4. You've talked about $200 million of core Alstom profit in 2016. How quickly do you
think the business goes back to profits? Or is it sort of a second half turnaround on the core Alstom business?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: I think that we expect – we're off and running on the synergies, as we speak. Having said
that, most of those synergies, most of the improvement in core operations is going to happen with – will accelerate over
the course of the year. I think we feel very good about the guidance we gave you in December around the outlook for

Alstom in 2016, a $0.05 contribution. That today feels very solid.
And I'd go back to what we said about 2015 on that call. We came in almost line item by line item, virtually right on
top of what we told you. We're a little better in tax than we estimated, but the other elements of the costs and the
operations we talked about on that call is exactly where we came in, and it ended up also in the fourth quarter, ended up
being essentially breakeven with tax or zero drag on EPS. So I think right now we're on course and the benefits and the
improvement will accelerate, as you would expect over the course of the year.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: I would echo what Jeff said, Julian. Look, as you guys can see, this is a large, complicated
transaction to get it integrated, but when we look underlying in terms of customer response and geographic
opportunities and things like that, I think this is everything we thought it would be. So now we've just got to get out
there and execute.
<Q - Julian Mitchell>: Great, thanks. And then, just a quick follow-up on Healthcare. The profits there were down, I
think, about 9% in the second half of 2015. You're guiding profits up in 2016. What is it that's really swinging there
from the second half to the next 12 months?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Look, I think, Julian, when I think about healthcare in 2016, this should be low- to
mid-single-digit organic revenue grower with margin enhancement. That's what investors should expect in Healthcare.
I think when you look at the second half of last year, we allowed the business to spin incrementally on NPI to make
some changes in their IT business to invest more. So basically, I think, we allowed them to increase their spending in
the second half. That should be opportunities when we look in the future, better VCP, better NPIs, and I expect
Healthcare to have a decent 2016.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: We're going to deliver a better product cost profile in 2016.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Yes.
<Q - Julian Mitchell>: Great, thank you.
Operator
Next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi.
<Q - Andrew Kaplowitz>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Andrew.
<Q - Andrew Kaplowitz>: Jeff, can you talk about your ability to grow margin for the company in 2016? If you look
at 4Q, you had 110 basis points of gross margin improvement ex-Alstom, despite declining organic sales. Your value
gap and mix give you 100 basis point of that improvement. So given higher margin services orders are growing faster
than equipment and raw material costs are coming down, could you sustain the 100 basis points you saw in the quarter
from mix and value gap as you move forward?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: So great question. Our goal, what we've told folks is year-on-year, we have a target to
improve margins 50 basis points. That's true as well in 2016. So the geography of where that improvement comes from,
I think, will be largely the same. I think value gap will contribute a little bit less in 2016 to the margin expansion. I
think variable cost productivity or productivity general or product cost, if you will, will contribute more.
And then, corporate and SG&A will also contribute in 2016. So we're still on the 50-basis-point march at our profit
down through corporate costs or industrial margins, but the mix between what value gap contributes and what we get
out of productivity is going to change a little bit.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: I would also say, guys, last year was the first year of our IC plan, what we call the AIP.
More than half the businesses have gross margin targets. They all have margin targets. This has been really a good
driver of these results, and we think we've set the bar appropriate in 2016 to get the same kind of benefits.

<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: And then I would say on mix, you mentioned services growth for equipment, that's
important actually. There's no question about it. We need our big service businesses, PGS and Aviation to grow and
deliver what they – because we have these product launches. So we've got the H turbine coming next year. We got a
little over 100 LEAP engines launching next year, and we got the 2.x and 3.x wind turbines going. So continuing the
momentum in services is very, very important to the overall story.
<Q - Andrew Kaplowitz>: Jeff, if I could just follow up on service for a second, your organic service orders slowed
slightly in the quarter from 4Q versus 3Q, but still good at 3%. You guys are guiding to 3% to 5% service growth. Can
you talk about the sustainability of your service business, especially, in Power in the current environment? And how
much is Digital really helping? Because I mean, it seems like robust growth there.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: I would start again with the Digital focus, which is growing 20%-ish, not just in Power, but
in other businesses. But we also have very targeted programs in all of our businesses to go after the age installed base,
Alstom brings unique capabilities to the Power business. Aviation, guys, we're still seeing good revenue passenger
miles. There's lots of opportunities for our Aviation business to continue to grow. Healthcare is actually after several
years of flat revenue in services has actually grown 3% or 4% the last few quarters.
So we're very programmatic on the service side. I think we see that continuing into next year with Digital being the
number one number driver. And at the end of the day, I think in an environment like this, this is the ballast for the
company is the installed base.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: The only thing I'd add, Jeff, is the upgrade. So we think we'll do at least 125 AGPs next
year and everyone in the businesses is really pushing on the upgrade.
<Q - Andrew Kaplowitz>: Thanks, guys.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Great, thanks.
Operator
The next question is from Andrew Obin with Bank of America.
<Q - Andrew Burris Obin>: Yes. Good morning.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Andrew, good morning.
<Q - Andrew Burris Obin>: Just a question on restructuring. Now that you have this extra $0.20 from the Appliances,
I'm sure you did have some restructuring built into your number before because you're expecting Appliance sale in the
middle of the year. But given that the gain brings restructuring and you have a lot more restructuring this year, does
that mean that there is more cushion to the numbers? Or does that mean that the core guidance is actually reflecting
more macro headwinds?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Okay. So in our core plan, we expected to draw about $1.7 billion pre-tax of restructuring
in 2016. We will double that with Appliances. And so we'll do a lot heavier restructuring. First of all, we're going to try
to accelerate a lot of what we're going do in Alstom in 2017 and 2018 as much of that as we can actually we're going to
try to accelerate. We're going to do more, as I mentioned earlier in Oil & Gas and every one of the businesses we're
going to do more around the product service cost footprint of the company.
So it does both things. When we spend that incremental money, there will be some amount of benefit in 2016, but
maybe even more importantly, it's a great base to work from for 2017 and 2018, and will help us continue to deliver
these margin improvements that you've seen.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: I would add, Andrew, look, I'm going to say the same thing today that I said a year ago.
Every one of our businesses has a very detailed incentive compensation plan that internally just like last year rolls up to
more than we talked about externally. And that's the way we've run the place. That's the way we continue to run the

place. And I just – I look at the ability to do incremental restructuring as a good opportunity for us to continue to
deliver good results.
<Q - Andrew Burris Obin>: And just a follow-up question, are you guys seeing any signs of stabilization in China,
because that seems to be a big concern? I apologize if I missed your marks in the beginning.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Yes. Look, I think for us, the first thing I'd say there's no one China, right. I don't think
macro anymore when I talk about China; I think micro. I think about Aviation, Healthcare, Power, Mining. That's how,
I think, everybody has got to start thinking about China. Now Aviation remains supers strong, right. I think on the
Power side, it's going to become a gas – more predominantly a gas turbine market. It's been cyclical, but I like how
we're positioned in the future in China there.
And the third business is Healthcare. Healthcare's had a tough couple of years. I think the sense of our team is that we
feel that stabilizing. By tough, I mean it's gone from up 10% to 15% to maybe flat to down slightly, right. So our team,
I think, has seen some signs of stabilization there. That to me is the swinger, let's say, on China. But Aviation is super
strong, even today.

The next question is from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Joe.
<Q - Joseph Alfred Ritchie>: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Good morning.
<Q - Joseph Alfred Ritchie>: So maybe following up on Andrew's question slightly differently. I guess, as you go
into 2016 and then look back into 2015, Industrial EBIT grew very low-single-digits this past year. And as we head into
2016, there are a lot of headwinds, whether it's orders down, mix is becoming a bigger headwind. And then, clearly, Oil
& Gas pressures are intensifying. And so what I'm trying to understand is how much of the incremental improvement in
Industrial segment EBIT is going to be driven by the restructuring actions that you're taking?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Well, let me go back and try to help you with that in terms of what 2015 was. So in the
fourth quarter, our restructuring efforts delivered a little over $220 million of benefits. And those are restructurings that
started in 2014, and some of them were executed in 2015, et cetera. And for the year, that was about $1 billion of value,
if you will, against margins.
In 2016, we'll roll forward, and based on what we did in 2015 and the benefits realizing in 2016 and the incremental
spend in 2016, I mean, everything else being equal, we would expect that or more, and more, to flow to Industrial EBIT
in 2016. And, yes, it's part and parcel about remaking the competitiveness of this company around products and service
cost. And it's critically important. And our track record, I think, over the last couple of years, of these businesses,
delivering back to margin improvements based on the restructuring spend, I think, has been, on balance, very good.
<Q - Joseph Alfred Ritchie>: That's fair, and it has been good, and clearly, should help provide a tailwind for 2017
and 2018. Maybe, one follow-up question, Jeff. Just a reminder on the $35 billion, the composition of the $35 billion
dividend from the asset sales and leverage, and has that changed all, just given that asset prices have come down a little
bit at the start this year?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: No. So Keith and his team have done an absolutely remarkable job executing against this
plan. As you know, Jeff mentioned, I'll just reiterate a little bit, just to give a baseline to everybody, $157 million of
Signings, $104 billion of asset closings in 2015. In 2016, we'll sign something on order of magnitude of another $50

billion in deals. We expect more than half of that to happen hopefully here in the first half of the year. And we'll close,
we'll get wire transfers for about another $100 billion of closings in 2016.
And so far, we're tracking slightly better on a price to tangible book, what we presented on – in April of next year. And
we think, everything else being equal, as we sit here today, with $50 billion of Signings to go, all of which are in
process, that we're going to end up at or may be incrementally slightly better on the price to tangible book, when we get
through the end of this process, hopefully at the end of 2016.

The next questions from Steven Winoker with Bernstein.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Thanks and good morning.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Steve.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Hey. So you've covered a lot of ground, but one of the things on page four, the
simplification SG&A costs being flat in the fourth quarter, just maybe run us through the dynamics there in terms of it
coming down off of the prior savings you've been seeing in quarter after quarter there?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Sure. So we had $224 million of SG&A structural cost out in the quarter. That was down
7% year-over-year. For the year, we were down about $800 million, or about 6%. And the reason you see it as not
contributing to the margin performance is because that $224 million came out at about the same rate as volume came
down in the quarter. So it's not that we didn't get cost out, we absolutely did. It's not that we lost any momentum. $224
million is about the middle of what we've been each of the last four quarters, actually probably closer to the last eight
quarters. It's just that volume was down and so it didn't contribute.
We expect it – we expect – I think we said in December, we expect to improve SG&A to sales in 2016, and so you
should expect it to show up on that line as contributing to the margin expansion in 2016, as it did for 30 basis points
this year.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay. Sounds good. And then, if I – just want to clarify on the pricing again. When you
pointed the 3.8% in Power and you talked about the HA turbine driving a lot of that, you guys are – how are you
thinking about like-for-like pricing versus mix? That HA is all like-for-like pricing? It's not driving the mix?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Yes, Steve, that's all like-for-like.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: All like-for-like.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay. All right. And then...
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: [indiscernible] (1:05:51). Go ahead, I'm sorry.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: No, go ahead.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: I was just going to say, I think what the team has done in this H launch is pretty
remarkable. So all the growth in the heavy-duty gas market is this class of turbine. The gigawatts that get added over
the next couple years, 75% of that's going to come from this class of turbine. They've gone from no share to a very high
level of share. And this is about $300 million of price in the quarter on the H, and it's effectively we're selling slots out.
So it's been a terrific story.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay, I'll pass it on. Thanks, guys.

The next question is from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Jeff.
<Q - Jeffrey T. Sprague>: Good morning. How are you?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: How are you?
<Q - Jeffrey T. Sprague>: Great.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Good.
<Q - Jeffrey T. Sprague>: Hey, just back to the whole restructuring dynamic and understanding the bridge into 2016.
So I think your guide for 2016 roughly implies about $19 billion in segment OP if we use the December construct. So
just building off $18 billion in 2015 with over $1 billion in restructuring savings and Alstom of $600 million, is that
how we should be thinking about it? So you have core erosion elsewhere in the portfolio of $400 million or $500
million?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: I don't think so, Jeff.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: I don't have that reconciliation in front of me, Jeff. We'll get back to you on that. But
here's how we've thought about the bridge. When we go from 2015 to 2016, we will get incremental restructuring
savings. As a V, we earned $1 billion of restructuring savings in 2015. We think we'll be better than that in 2016, but it
won't be $1 billion better than it was in 2015. We'll get margin expansion and organic growth at 2% to 4%. And the
only decrement, if you will, as you describe it, is we are overcoming the launch costs and the launch margins associated
with the LEAP and the H – the wind turbines, et cetera, et cetera. So we will grow – we'll grow op profit next year. I
don't have the bridge exactly in front of me at the moment.
<Q - Jeffrey T. Sprague>: Okay.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: But segment by segment, Power is up ex-Alstom.
<Q - Jeffrey T. Sprague>: Right.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Renewables up ex-Alstom; Aviation up; Healthcare up; Transportation I think we said down
slightly; Energy Management up. So segment by segment, Jeff, I think it tracks to the positive operating profit growth
for next year.
<Q - Jeffrey T. Sprague>: Okay, roughly $19 billion is a good place to be, though, on the segment side?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Yes.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: I think that's...
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Yes, $19 billion, it's roughly $19 billion.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Yes.
<Q - Jeffrey T. Sprague>: Okay, great.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: A little better than $19 billion.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Yes.

<Q - Jeffrey T. Sprague>: And then just back to the macro, can you give us a little bit of sense on how much of your
backlog is in Middle Eastern areas or areas where you've got really resource pressures on government budgets and the
like?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: I think, Jeff, let me just – I don't have the...
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: We don't have a regional split on backlog. Now obviously our Power business, obviously,
from a power generation perspective, has got a big backlog associated with the Middle East. Our Oil & Gas business
has a backlog that's associated with West Africa, Brazil, and the Middle East. We have a big backlog in Aviation
associated with the Emirates, Qatar Airlines (sic) [Qatar Airways], et cetera. I don't think in the case of Power or
Aviation that we have concerns about our Middle East backlog in any way, shape, or form.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: I was going to reflect on that to a certain extent. I think, Jeff, we've always talked about the
resource-rich regions being more or less $30 billion or something like that for the company. But in the fourth quarter,
we had a record orders quarter in Saudi Arabia. Our business in Latin America has – because again, demand for
electricity has grown 8% last year, good Aviation backlogs, things like that. So I think the diversification of the mix of
businesses we have is still pretty positive, even in regions like Saudi Arabia.
<Q - Jeffrey T. Sprague>: Right, and then maybe just one last one. The order price index info was helpful. I wonder if
you could share with us the price impact on revenues in the quarter.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Yes.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: So give me one second. So in revenues in the quarter, we had price of about $150 million.
About $100 million of that came from Power. Aviation was strong as well. And then, as you would expect, Healthcare
had negative price of roughly $100 million. Most everybody had modest positive price.

The next question is from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Deane Dray>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Deane.
<Q - Deane Dray>: Hey. I just had a couple of cleanup questions here. Just to go back to the Appliances deal, we've
gotten a lot of questions about this that the deal you struck with Haier significantly more favorable than Electrolux,
gain of $0.20 versus $0.06. How did the deal all come together? I know they're not directly comparable, but just give us
a sense on how it played out.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Again, Deane, I think we followed the process with Electrolux until December 7, so that ran
its course. That gave us the ability to look to see what other outcomes would be important for the business. There was a
tremendous – after December 7 there was a tremendous amount of interest in the business. I think what you have to
keep in mind is that the EBITDA of the business is better over the – while we were in the process, the multiples in the
industry improved while we were in the process. And I think what we always knew was true about the Appliance
business is that it had a favorable position in the North American market that was valued by people on the outside, and
that's what we saw in the 30 days post December 7.
I would add, Deane, we wanted to move quickly because the business had been for sale for two years, and it's just there
was a real reason for us to get this transaction and we're pleased with the way it turned out.
<Q - Deane Dray>: Congratulations on that, and just a last question for me, I know you're out of the quarterly
guidance business. But given the expectations of the higher restructuring, and they won't be timed with gains, what do
the first quarter dynamics look like with regard to gains and restructuring?

<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: So today, we think we're going to have about $700 million of restructuring in the first
quarter. We'll have some very modest, very modest gains in the first quarter. So we'll have naked restructuring in the
quarter of between $600 million and $700 million pre-tax in the quarter.
Do you want me to do the full first quarter? So here's what I'd say. When you look at the profile for the year, when we
talked about gas turbines and Power Systems, I mentioned the fact that a lot of our volume was in the second half of the
year. The first quarter in the Power business, we're going to be down significantly on gas turbines. Last year we had the
tail end of Algeria and we had some Egyptian shipments in the first quarter. So even though we're going to be up on
shipments year over year for the total year for Power Systems, the first quarter is going to be light on gas turbines year
over year.

The next question is from Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Shannon.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Good morning. Hey, Jeff, maybe a little more on the core margin expansion in the
Power business, the 140 basis points. You talk about positive value gap and mix. Maybe a little more color there,
what's really driving that?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: A big part of it is the strength in their service businesses. PGS was very strong in the
quarter. That was important. We also shipped fewer gas turbines year over year in the quarter. From a mix perspective,
that certainly helped them expand margins in the quarter, the 140 basis points. The value gap was really strong.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Just some context here, guys. Our organic growth for the total company in the fourth quarter
of 2014 was up 9%. Organic growth for Power was up 20% or something in the fourth quarter last year. And that was a
lot of the Algerian shipments that we had that were product shipments in 2014. So kind of, to Jeff's point, we had, let's
say, much more difficult comps from a revenue standpoint but much easier comps from a margin standpoint, when you
compare fourth quarter of 2015 to fourth quarter of 2014.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay, that makes a lot of sense. And then just on corporate costs, I mean, you've got
some benefits there in the quarter. I know it's an initiative that you're working on. I mean, are we kind of at a
reasonable run rate now or is there a lot more to go there on 2016?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: No, we're going to be down in 2016. So we finish the year at $2.1 billion of corporate
operating cost. We gave you a range of $2.0 billion to $2.2 billion. We're running the place to the bottom of that range,
and no, we're not close to the end of what we're doing around corporate.

The next question is from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Nigel.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Thanks. Good morning, guys. We're getting a little bit late here so I'll keep this brief. So just on –
back on the restructuring, obviously, huge number for this year, Jeff. Should we – you've got $0.08 in next year, 2017,
for Alstom restructuring. Should we assume that the bulk of that $0.08 comes in to this year?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: I don't think it will be the bulk of it. We are going to try and move as much of the
restructuring into 2016 as we can. All of that restructuring, you don't just write a check and then get the benefits. It's
actually all kinds of execution around it. So we're going to try to execute as much of the restructuring list, actions, if
you will, that were planned as 2017 actions. We're going to try to do as many of those in 2016 on top of what we
already planned as possible.

<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay, that's helpful.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: I would say, Nigel, with this amount of restructuring this year, we're going to get some
benefits yet this year. The bulk of them are going to come in 2017, but we'll still get some restructuring actual benefits
in 2016 just based on the quality of the projects we've got.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay, that's helpful. And then just quickly on the – you gave me a little bit of color on 1Q, and
obviously 4Q is noisy with some of the project delays and also Alstom accounting. I'm just thinking on 1Q, do you still
feel that still some of the – some backlog push-out into the back after the year and to what extent do we still have some
of these accounting issues on Alstom in 1Q?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: We're going to continue – we're not done purchase accounting, okay? So from an
accounting perspective, we've owned the company for two months. So we've done a significant amount of work getting
the initial purchase accounting done, but we're not complete yet. And that really – I'm hopeful that we'll be done with
all that in the first half of this year. And I think in terms of how our volume lays out, I mean, we're a little more
back-end loaded this year maybe than we were last year, just the way the order book wants to play out.
But I would say to a certain extent, guys, things like just the change in PTC probably pushed some wind turbines from
2015 to 2016. That's unforecastable, but it's generally a positive. So again, I think, by and large, we feel pretty good
about how our backlog lays out and the integrity of the backlog. Again, we are not though Pollyannaish about the oil
and gas market and kind of, we need to be fast on our feet as it pertains to how that business rolls out the rest of the
year.

Great, thank you, Jeff, a couple of quick announcements before we wrap up. The replay of today's webcast will be
available this afternoon on our investor website. We're going to host the Healthcare Investor Meeting in New York City
on March 11, and our first quarter 2016 earnings webcast will be on April 22. Jeff?
Jeffrey R. Immelt
Yes, Matt, thanks again. Thanks again, guys. I think it was – given the first time we closed Alstom, this was more
complicated than we like. Again, that will get better as time goes on. So it took us a long time to work through it, but I
think if you stand back and look at 2016, we've got a lot of self-help in place with restructuring, big backlog, share
repurchase, and we feel good about double digit earnings growth, about returning a lot of cash back to investors, and
about really continuing to drive our strategy into the future. So we feel great about the company, and we look forward
to having more conversations. Great, Matt, thanks.
