MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Darla, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome
everyone to the Q4 and full-year 2015 sales and earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent
any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Teri Loxam. Please go ahead.
Teri Loxam
Thank you, Darla, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Merck's fourth quarter 2015 conference call. Today I'm
joined by: Ken Frazier, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Davis, our Chief Financial Officer; Adam
Schechter, President of Global Human Health; and Dr. Roger Perlmutter, President of Merck Research Labs.
Before I turn the call over to Ken, I want to point out a couple of items. First, you will see that we have items in our
GAAP results such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs, and certain other items. You should note that
we've excluded these from our non-GAAP results and provided a reconciliation of these items in Table 2 of our press
release. We've also provided a table to help you understand the sales results in the quarter for the business units and
products, which can be found in Table 3 of our press release.
Second, I would like to remind you that some of the statements we make during today's call may be considered
forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation

Kenneth C. Frazier
Thank you, Teri. Good morning. Thank you all for joining the call today.
2015 was a year of considerable progress and execution for Merck. We continued to focus on the most exciting
scientific and commercial opportunities in front of us, advancing our pipeline, securing new product approvals, and
launching expanded indications for key products. I am pleased that our operating performance across our research and
commercial organizations, including rigorous cost management, enabled us to exceed our EPS commitments in 2015.
Despite strong currency headwinds, we were able to deliver growth in 2015, and we expect to deliver growth again in
2016. In fact, 2016 represents the first year in several years in which Merck's new product sales growth, driven
primarily by ZEPATIER, our new hepatitis C product, and KEYTRUDA are expected to contribute meaningfully
above the impact of the products that are losing exclusivity.
To ensure continued progress, it is imperative that we remain focused on three priorities. First, we must innovate across
all aspects of our business that we can pursue and deliver the most promising medical breakthroughs. Second, we must
execute in our labs and in our markets around the world to deliver results by prioritizing resources to the highest growth
areas, key markets, and customers. And finally, we must adapt our culture and business model to evolve as the world
changes around us. Specifically, this includes driving the success of our key inline brands, including JANUVIA,
launching new indications for KEYTRUDA in more tumor types, and launching ZEPATIER, which received approval
from the FDA just last week. We also anticipate several important pipeline catalysts this year, which Roger will discuss
in more detail shortly.
Augmenting our pipeline with the best scientific and medical innovations also remains a key priority for us, and we are
eager to continue to aggressively seek attractive external opportunities that can further bolster our scientific leadership
while complementing the current assets in our pipeline.
In closing, in 2016 we will build upon the strong foundation we established last year. We will continue to invest
resources to launch and grow our strongest brands, support the most promising internal assets, enhance our pipeline
with the best available external science, and maintain a balanced and differentiated portfolio, all with the goal of
delivering long-term growth and shareholder value.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to my colleague, Rob Davis.
Robert M. Davis
Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone.
As Ken referenced, 2015 reflected another solid year of operational performance at Merck. We delivered full-year
revenues of $39.5 billion, which was in the upper part of our original guidance range despite a slightly higher than
expected foreign exchange impact for the year. In addition, as a result of our continued focus on transforming our
business model, we were able to deliver full-year non-GAAP EPS of $3.59, $0.12 higher than the upper end of our
original 2015 guidance range. We also returned over $9 billion to shareholders through dividends and share

repurchases.
This strong performance was driven by our continued focus on prioritizing our resources to our highest growth areas
and reducing net cost by more than $2.5 billion versus 2012, while investing in key inline brands, including JANUVIA,
maximizing launches such as KEYTRUDA, and strategically investing in R&D and business development to drive a
pipeline that will deliver long-term results.
Now, let me turn to some specifics for the fourth quarter, and my remarks will focus on our non-GAAP financials. In
the fourth quarter, we delivered a leveraged P&L, with growth excluding exchange on both the top and bottom lines.
Total company revenues were $10.2 billion in the quarter, a decrease of 3% year over year, including seven percentage
points of negative impact from foreign exchange. Excluding the impact of exchange, fourth quarter revenues grew 4%.
It's worth mentioning that approximately $110 million of our foreign exchange impact on revenues in the quarter was
due to a devaluation of our operations in Venezuela, where we began using the SIMADI rate in the fourth quarter.
Given the current and expected conditions in that market, we anticipate continuing to use the SIMADI rate for our P&L
in 2016.
In addition to solid results for Global Human Health in the quarter, which Adam will discuss in a few minutes, the
Animal Health business also had a good quarter, with sales growing at 8% excluding exchange. Sales of companion
animal products, led by BRAVECTO as well as swine products, accounted for the majority of the growth.
Turning to the other parts of the P&L, non-GAAP gross margin was 74.8% in the quarter, an increase of 20 basis points
year over year. Full-year gross margin increased 150 basis points to 75.4%. Lower discards and foreign exchange drove
the overall improvement in margin percentage.
We continued to manage expenses in Q4, with decreases in both marketing and administrative costs as well as R&D, as
operational efficiencies more than offset our investments supporting key products and new launches. On a full-year
basis, we delivered operating expenses in line with our guidance, with meaningful savings in marketing and
administrative expenses more than offsetting modest increases in R&D.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 16.4%, resulting in a full-year tax rate of 21.7%. The quarterly
and full-year rates reflect the benefit from the renewal of the R&D tax credit.
Taken together, we earned $0.93 per share on a non-GAAP basis in the fourth quarter, delivering 13% growth
excluding exchange on the bottom line and significant P&L leverage.
Now let's turn to guidance and our outlook for 2016. Given the continued strength of the U.S. dollar against virtually all
other currencies, we anticipate foreign exchange will have a meaningful impact again in 2016. We expect revenues to
be $38.7 billion to $40.2 billion using mid-January exchange rates, which reflects an approximately three percentage
point negative impact from foreign exchange. Excluding the impact of exchange, we expect low to mid-single-digit
revenue growth in 2016, as new product launches more than offset the impact from generic and biosimilar competition.
Our guidance range also assumes negligible revenues from Venezuela compared to $625 million in the full-year 2015.
We expect non-GAAP EPS to be $3.60 to $3.75, which also reflects an approximately four percentage point negative
impact from foreign currency at mid-January rates. 2016 EPS growth would be in the mid to high single digits
excluding the impact of exchange. On a GAAP basis, we expect earnings between $1.96 and $2.23. Our non-GAAP
EPS guidance assumes 2016 product gross margin will be roughly flat compared to 2015.
In addition, we expect operating expenses to be generally in line with prior year. We will continue to invest in direct
selling and promotion to support new product launches while reducing administrative expenses as we continue to focus
on our operating model. We remain committed to delivering a leveraged P&L, and we will monitor our new launches
and key products throughout the year and flex resources as appropriate.
Regarding tax, we expect our full-year non-GAAP tax rate to be in the range of 20.5% to 22.5%, which included the
benefit from the recently renewed R&D tax credit.

Finally, we project average diluted shares outstanding of 2.78 billion for 2016, reflecting a decrease versus the prior
year, as we continue our share repurchase program.
The fourth quarter was a strong finish to a solid year of execution. We expect this momentum to continue into 2016 as
we further innovate in our labs, invest behind our launches, and continue our focus on disciplined resource allocation
and continuous productivity to deliver a leveraged P&L and shareholder returns.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Adam.
Adam H. Schechter
Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. This morning I'll provide highlights on Global Human Health
performance for the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2015. My comments will be on a constant currency basis.
Total sales reached $34.8 billion in 2015, reflecting growth of 4%. In the fourth quarter, sales reached $9 billion and
also grew 4%. Excluding Cubist and divestitures, Human Health sales grew 2% in 2015.
Moving now to priority franchise updates, I'll start with the JANUVIA franchise. The JANUVIA franchise grew 7% in
2015, driven primarily by volume increases. However, in the fourth quarter, U.S. revenue was impacted by a significant
reduction in channel inventory following the buy-in that we saw in the third quarter. It's important to note that
underlying volume maintained growth of about 3% in the U.S. in the fourth quarter.
Despite increased pricing pressure, we expect to grow the JANUVIA franchise in 2016 ex-exchange. We have
maintained a high market share of about 75% in the U.S. and 65% globally. Volume increases in the U.S. and
internationally, physician and patient experience with our medicine, and macro trends that support a growing market,
all reinforce our confidence in JANUVIA.
Moving to hospital and specialty care, our hospital acute care business grew 11% in 2015, excluding Cubist. Sales in
the fourth quarter reached more than $600 million and grew 7%. Performance was driven by our antibiotic and
anti-fungal treatments, as well as by BRIDION in the international markets.
In addition, we are currently launching BRIDION in the U.S. While it's still early, customer feedback is very positive
on this new product that uniquely reverses the neuromuscular block following surgery.
We are also excited to be launching ZEPATIER for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection in the U.S. and
Canada. ZEPATIER offers a competitive profile and high cure rates, with 12 weeks of therapy for the vast majority of
patients in a one-pill once-a-day treatment. ZEPATIER is differentiated versus other options, including consistent
dosing regardless of cirrhosis status, renal impairment, or use with PPIs and other acid-reducing agents. We believe our
payer and pricing strategy will maximize ZEPATIER revenue and market share, as well as broaden and accelerate
patient access. We are enthusiastic to be back in this important market, and our teams are rapidly deploying to
capitalize on this opportunity.
Moving to vaccines, the vaccines portfolio grew 3%, with sales of $5.7 billion in 2015. In the fourth quarter, sales
reached approximately $1.7 billion and grew 5%, on strong performance for GARDASIL. GARDASIL growth was
aided by timing of public sector purchases in the U.S. of about $50 million, and timing of government purchases in
Brazil in the fourth quarter. GARDASIL 9 now represents approximately 90% of sales in the U.S., as our teams have
executed well on converting customers to 9-valent vaccine.
ZOSTAVAX sales declined 11% in the fourth quarter, resulting from a very weak flu season in the U.S. We continue
to work to educate customers on the reimbursement for ZOSTAVAX and to invest in direct-to-consumer advertising
for this important brand.
Finally, I'd like to spend a few moments commenting on the continued launch of KEYTRUDA. In the fourth quarter,
sales were approximately $215 million, driving strong full-year sales of more than $560 million. Our performance was
driven largely by the refractory melanoma indication in the U.S., as well as ongoing launches in more than 40 markets

ex-U.S. In late 2015, we received approval in the United States for first-line treatment of advanced melanoma
regardless of BRAF status. The sales force is launching this indication as we speak.
Looking into 2016 and beyond, we remain enthusiastic about the potential for KEYTRUDA across markets and across
cancer types. We are building a critical foundation for PD-L1 testing in lung cancer as we launch in second-line. We
believe this will help to set the stage for when a first-line indication is achieved. We have now demonstrated overall
survival benefits for KEYTRUDA versus standard of care in both lung cancer and melanoma, which strengthens our
belief that KEYTRUDA has the potential to become foundational to the treatment of cancer over time. With more than
200 clinical trials and more than 100 combinations in over 30 tumor types, we see the potential to drive significant
growth for KEYTRUDA over the long term.
In summary, Global Human Health delivered a solid performance in 2015. In 2016, we will continue to prioritize
resources, focusing on JANUVIA, hospital acute care, vaccines, and important product launches, including ZEPATIER
and KEYTRUDA. The strength of our underlying business, the continued execution of our strategy, and the launch
opportunities before us, position us well for the year ahead.
Now I'll turn the call over to Roger.
Roger M. Perlmutter, M.D., Ph.D.
Thanks, Adam. I'll provide a brief update on our progress on key programs during the fourth quarter, and will note
opportunities for further advancement in 2016.
The fourth quarter was an important one for KEYTRUDA. Our U.S. label was updated to include data from our
KEYNOTE-006 study in melanoma, demonstrating that KEYTRUDA treatment is superior to ipilimumab, the prior
standard of care in the first-line treatment of advanced melanoma, as judged by improvements in overall survival and
progression-free survival. Data from the KEYNOTE-002 study, in which KEYTRUDA treatment proved superior as
judged by progression-free survival to traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy, was also added to our label. Hence in the
United States, as in Europe, our KEYTRUDA label documents the superior effect of this treatment for advanced
melanoma as compared with other interventions.
Also in the fourth quarter, we presented data from our KEYNOTE-010 study, demonstrating that KEYTRUDA
provides superior overall survival as compared with docetaxel treatment in non-small-cell lung cancer in patients with
PD-L1 expression of 1% or more. This study was presented at the ESMO [European Society for Medical Oncology]
Asia meeting, simultaneously published in The Lancet, and has already been included in NCCN [National
Comprehensive Cancer Network] guidelines for lung cancer treatment. These data have also been submitted for review
in the United States and in Europe.
Looking ahead for KEYTRUDA, 2016 promises to be a very exciting year. We'll see data from our KEYNOTE-024
first-line non-small-cell lung cancer trial comparing treatment with a range of cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens to
KEYTRUDA monotherapy by midyear. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival. Our KEYNOTE-055 study,
which evaluates response rates in head and neck cancer following KEYTRUDA monotherapy in patients who have
failed both platinum agents and cetuximab treatment, will also provide important new data.
Looking still further ahead, there are multiple opportunities for filings in other tumor types, including bladder cancer
and classical Hodgkin's lymphoma, depending upon the results that we observe. As we have noted, the KEYTRUDA
development program is exceptionally broad, with registration-enabling studies underway in more than a dozen tumor
types.
We do view KEYTRUDA as providing a foundation for the next-generation treatment of malignant disease. Along
these lines, we're also studying combinations with cytotoxic agents, targeted therapies, vaccines, and other
immunomodulatory agents.

In 2015 we gained access to a Phase 1 cCAM-directed antibody program, which complements our internal clinical
programs to target GITR, IL-10, and many other axes. In all, we have more than 100 combination studies underway, as
Adam mentioned.
A few weeks ago we announced the acquisition of IOmet, through which we will gain access to a set of IDO1 and
TDO1 small molecule antagonists. We have previously presented data in collaboration with our colleagues at Incyte
suggesting that KEYTRUDA may be fruitfully combined with their IDO1 inhibitor, and a Phase 3 study using this
agent will soon begin enrolling patients with melanoma. Our acquisition of IOmet will permit us to explore the utility
of IDO1 inhibition much more broadly.
Last week we announced the approval of ZEPATIER in the United States. ZEPATIER was the subject of two
Breakthrough designations and was evaluated promptly via Priority Review. A key strength of ZEPATIER is the fact
that it can be used without dose adjustment in patients with chronic renal failure, a group that suffers from increased
rates of HCV infection.
Going forward, in 2016 we expect to complete Phase 2b and initiate Phase 3 studies for new regimens that include
MK-3682, a uridinal nucleoside polymerase inhibitor, and MK-8408, a next-generation highly-active NS5A inhibitor.
These programs emphasize our commitment to complete care of patients with HCV infection, where the goal should
certainly be to cure as many patients as possible using appropriate and effective regimens.
Our 2016 plan includes numerous other approvals and filings. And as we have announced previously, bezlotoxumab,
our therapy designed to reduce recurrences of Clostridium difficile-associated enterocolitis, received Priority Review
designation from the FDA with a PDUFA date in July. In 2016, we expect to complete our Phase 3 program and our
filing for ertugliflozin as both single-agent and in combination with JANUVIA, and we will obtain adjudicated data
supporting the filing of odanacatib.
We'll have the opportunity to review Phase 3 data from our inactivated varicella-zoster vaccine in immuno-comprised
populations and from our Phase 3 program studying letermovir as prophylaxis for cytomegalovirus activation in
patients receiving bone marrow transplants. In collaboration with our colleagues at Bayer, we'll begin a Phase 3 heart
failure program for vericiguat based on Phase 2 data that we presented last year. And we will also have a chance to see
important early clinical data from our collaborations with NGM Pharmaceuticals in metabolic disease and from
Moderna in the vaccine space. It will be a busy year.
Now I'll turn the call over to Teri.
Teri Loxam
Thanks, Roger. We're going to be moving on to Q&A. We would like to try to get to as many questions as possible this
morning, so I'd ask that you try to hold your questions to one or two each.
Thanks, Darla. We can go to Q&A.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays.
<Q - Geoff Meacham>: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I have a couple for Roger on
KEYTRUDA in lung. So the first question is for the first-line data this year, how mature do you think the OS [Overall
Survival] data will be, and will that matter to regulators or the competitive landscape?
And then on the KEYNOTE-010 study, how much do you think it will play a role when it comes to – the overall
survival data will play a role when it comes to looking at the PD-L1 minimal expressers when you think about that sort

of testing as a lever going forward vis-à-vis competition with Bristol? Thanks a lot.
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter, M.D., Ph.D.>: Geoff, first of all, with respect to first-line, the primary endpoint of the
study is progression-free survival. In these studies, we do permit crossover. It's really necessary to do that in these
studies. And so you're really comparing the early versus late access to KEYTRUDA. That's understood.
Progression-free survival is an accepted endpoint. So I think that's where we'll be with respect to first-line.
And with respect to the KEYNOTE-010 study, I'm not sure exactly what you mean by PD-L1 minimal expressers.
What we showed in the KEYNOTE-010 study, of course, was that there was a treatment effect in the 1% expressers as
well as in the high expressers. We have noted that in PD-L1 negative populations with non-squamous non-small-cell
lung cancer, it's not at all clear that there's a benefit in the risk of patients who receive PD-1 directed therapy. And that's
true for every agent that's been studied, not just our own agent. So I think it is important to be looking at PD-L1
expression in order to decide who in fact should be treated with these agents. Adam may have some other thoughts
about PD-L1 expression in the second line.
<A - Adam H. Schechter>: The only thing I'd add, Geoff, is that if you look at reimbursement broadly in the U.S.,
right now we're being reimbursed for PD-L1 positive. So it's irrespective if it's 1% or above 50% for the vast majority
of plans. So we're seeing reimbursement already for anybody that shows up as PD-L1 positive.
<A - Teri Loxam>: Next question, please, Darla?
Operator
It's from Tim Anderson with Bernstein.
<Q - Timothy Minton Anderson>: Thank you, a question on ZEPATIER. Payers and your competitors in this space
talk about long-term contracting. Knowing where your net pricing is coming in, or at least I think I know where it's
coming in, and knowing the positioning of the product, which has some reasonable attributes, can you just talk about
what we should expect in 2016? Consensus has I think around $600 million. I know you don't guide on individual
products normally, but give us some guidance here, if you can, especially in the context of trying to bump what could
be a high prevalence of long-term contracts.
Second question on 4-1BB, Pfizer made some positive comments yesterday. One of the products they've been studying
was your drug, KEYTRUDA. But I'm wondering about the longevity of that deal and whether they could kick you to
the curb potentially now that they have their own PD-L1.
And then just a third quick question, does KEYNOTE-024 have an interim analysis? Bristol's first-line trial does not.
<A - Teri Loxam>: Adam, why don't we start with you on ZEPATIER, and then we can move to Roger for the other
two.
<A - Adam H. Schechter>: Sure, Teri. Let me give you some context, and then I'll try to answer the question
specifically on how we're thinking about the pricing, reimbursement, and contracting strategy. First of all, I agree with
your comment that we do have a competitive product and we have high cure rates. And if you look at our clinical trials
in GT1 patients, it was 94% to 97%. If you look at GT4 patients, it's 97% to 100%. So we start off by showing we have
very good efficacy with the product.
I also believe we have some important differentiation with the product. Our dosing is not affected by the presence of
compensated cirrhosis. If you look at the competition, they have to change their dose there. You can use us with any
degree of renal impairment. If you look at the competition, particularly in certain patients with renal impairment, they
can't be used there. And also you don't have to adjust our dose for acid-reducing agents such as PPIs. So I think those
are some things we feel good about in terms of differentiating our product versus the competition in the marketplace.
I think what we did was develop a real deliberate and I believe innovative pricing strategy to try to maximize the
product and increase the number of appropriate patients treated. But the first thing I want to say is we want to be

competitive across all segments, and we want to look at public, private. We want to work with managed care
organizations and government agencies, et cetera, et cetera. So we plan to be competitive across all segments. And I
believe that the strategy that we implemented could accelerate access to patients in certain segments where access
frankly has not been as broad to date, including those patients with medical needs in Stage 4 and Stage 5 CKD.
So as I said, we don't give guidance for individual products, but we will provide updates as we go through the year.
We're just launching it right now. The product is not available in the marketplace yet but it will be in a matter of days,
and then I'll provide updates as we go through the year to give you a sense of where we are.
<A - Teri Loxam>: Great. And, Roger, do you want to address the 4-1BB and KEYNOTE-024 interim?
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter, M.D., Ph.D.>: Right. Tim, so on 4-1BB, just first in context, as you know, there are just a
huge number of combinations that potentially can be studied. We're studying 100, and 4-1BB is one of those. The
expectation is that we're going to see a lot of opportunities to combine KEYTRUDA with other drugs. We're already
seeing those and have talked about them, for example, in combination with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, with
immunization with TVEC, the oncolytic virus. And of course, we're doing our own studies with other checkpoint
inhibitors and other immunogens.
We're very pleased with our collaboration with Pfizer on 4-1BB. I believe that the plan is assuming that it's accepted, to
be able to present some of those data at ASCO. And our expectation is that if it turns out that there's a good opportunity
there that we'll continue to collaborate. So I'm not really terribly concerned about not being able to take advantage of an
important opportunity to help patients.
With respect to KEYNOTE-024, the study is of course being continuously monitored by a data monitoring committee.
But importantly, here we are in February. ClinicalTrials.gov I think has the end of June. So we're getting close to the
end of the study anyway. And my expectation is that we'll have the opportunity to see the data in not too long a time
and can use that as a basis, potentially assuming the data come out correctly, as a basis for filing.
<A - Teri Loxam>: Thanks, Roger. Next question, please.

It's from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you very much. Ken, a first question for you. At our CEO conference earlier last month,
you talked about your increasing desire to be more aggressive with M&A now that you have a strong scientific team on
board, thanks to Roger. Given the fairly significant derating of the biotech space since that conference, I would think
you are absolutely licking your chops. Can you talk about the M&A landscape? And most importantly, when do you
think the buyers and sellers start to come together?
And then a question for you, Roger, I think to Roger. It's again on KEYTRUDA and the first-line study. Can you size
the opportunity? How large is the highest PD-L1 expressers in the front-line lung market? And when will we see the
study that targets the entire PD-L1 patient population in front-line lung? Thanks very much.
<A - Kenneth C. Frazier>: Thanks, Jami. Let me start by just reiterating what I said before. Business development
remains a critical part of our strategy because we need to pair both our internal work with the best external innovation
opportunities. And we're looking to augment our Phase 2 as well as our early-stage pipeline with these kinds of
partnerships and collaborations and bolt-on acquisitions.
As it relates to the re-rating of the biotech industry, of course we're very focused on value-creating opportunities. Our
team has looked at this very carefully, and we are very active and looking for opportunities in oncology and other
therapeutic areas where we can build our pipeline. So I can just assure you that we paid attention to what's happened in
the marketplace, and we are looking very actively to reach the right kinds of deals, whether they're M&A or
partnerships or collaborations, to advance our pipeline.

<A - Teri Loxam>: Great. Roger, you want to...
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter, M.D., Ph.D.>: Jami, on the first-line opportunity, the size, just to remind you and
everyone, our approach has been to ask the question of whether or not we can identify populations that would benefit
especially from the treatment of KEYTRUDA. And we chose to use the PD-L1 expression as a marker for that. It's
turned out that that is a marker. And the reason, of course, is not because specifically that PD-L1 is the counter-ligand
for PD-1, but rather because PD-L1 is a marker for the presence of an immune response. And that PD-L1, as a result, is
telling us that there already is a pre-existing immune response that can be enhanced by the addition of KEYTRUDA.
The KEYNOTE-024 study looks at those that are PD-L1 high. And what we've done in all of our studies is that we
have looked at the PD-L1 high, those with proportion scores above 50%, and then looked at those that are expressing
PD-L1 above 1%, and also looked at those that appeared not to be expressing PD-L1, as we move across the line. So,
for example – and we published in the New England Journal that there was, in general terms, in the KEYNOTE-001
study in melanoma, in general, that those patients who were expressing more PD-L1 had better responses. We similarly
published data in the KEYNOTE-010 study recently showing that responses were better in the highest PD-L1
expressers, again reflecting immune status.
The KEYNOTE-024 study looks at those that have the highest PD-L1 expression. It was about 25% of the first-line
patient population. The KEYNOTE-042 study will go on and look at patients who have the 1% cut point. And we'll
begin to see the data across the entire first line, so we'll have an opportunity to look at that.
Frankly, from a biological perspective, I really can't understand why it would be any different in the first-line
population from what we've previously shown in other tumor populations because, again, PD-L1 expression is a
reflection of immune activity.
<A - Teri Loxam>: Thanks, Roger. Next question, please, Darla?

Your next question is from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.
<Q - Christopher Schott>: Great, thanks very much for the questions, just two here. First, can you elaborate on
JANUVIA sales in the quarter? I guess, how much did destocking impact results? And maybe more broadly, just latest
thoughts on the SGLT-2 impact on the DPP-4 classes, as you talk about growing JANUVIA in 2016?
And then a follow-up on HCV, can you just comment specifically on how much you see price driving share and
broader adoption of these agents in this space? Just a lot of focus on how the price dynamics play out here. I know
you're not going to – specific comments. But just generally speaking, do you see price as a lever that is relevant to the
space going forward for you guys? Thanks.
<A - Adam H. Schechter>: Hi, Chris. This is Adam. Let me start off with the JANUVIA franchise, because I think it's
important to give some additional context. I want to start by saying we're really pleased that JANUVIA grew 7% in
2015. And if you look at our underlying performance in fourth quarter, it was similar to the other quarters in the year.
What you saw in fourth quarter was volume growth in the U.S. of about 3%, which was about the same as what you
saw the quarter before and so forth.
What happened was, there was significant channel reductions that followed the third quarter buy-in, which I noted on
the last call was more than $100 million. And as you may recall, last quarter, the U.S. grew 22% for JANUVIA, and
that's why I noted that there was buy-in and we would expect to see buy-out. So when you look at fourth quarter, I
would look at the underlying performance, which remains similar to the other quarters, and I think we had a good year,
with JANUVIA showing 7% growth versus prior.
When you look at 2016, despite increasing pricing pressure that we'll see in the United States and the biennial price
declines that you see in Japan, we expect to grow the franchise globally when you exclude exchange. And what that
means, with regard to EMPA-REG, we don't see a significant impact in 2016. In fact, if you look at the earliest data

that you can look at, we're seeing market share shifts within the SGLT-2 class, but we're not seeing shifts between
classes, between DPP-4s and SGLT-2s. We'll continue to monitor that closely. We'll see when there's label changes or
if there's potential guideline changes. But at this point in time, we feel confident that there should not be a significant
impact in 2016 from the SGLT-2 class.
So let me answer your question on ZEPATIER. I already stated that we think that we have a competitive product
profile, and that's where it all starts. You have to have a competitive product profile to be successful in the marketplace.
Our efficacy is good. We think we have strong differentiation versus the competitors. So price is always a lever that
you can choose to utilize, but you don't necessarily have to utilize it nearly as much when you have a differentiated
product that you think you can bring to market. So we'll continue to keep you updated on ZEPATIER as we move
forward, but we're going to do everything we can to optimize and maximize that brand.
<A - Teri Loxam>: Thanks, Adam. Darla, let's go to the next question, please.
Operator
It's from Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Yes, thanks. First for Rob, looks like you're guiding to a currency effect on the bottom line that's
more extreme than the top line in 2016. So can you just help us understand that relationship for 2016 and for Merck in
general, and comment on what share count you're factoring in to guidance for the year?
And then for Ken, going back to the aggressive deal strategy you described, what are your latest thoughts on deals like
the Cubist deal and whether those are the kinds of deals you're looking to sprinkle in as well? It sounds like you have a
scientific and pipeline focus. But what about deals that leverage or build out certain commercial verticals you have, and
whether you'd do those deals again? Thanks.
<A - Robert M. Davis>: This is Rob. Good morning, Gregg. So, on your question, we are seeing a little bit more
pressure to earnings than we are in sales from foreign currency. The biggest single driver of that is really how our
hedging is flowing through on a year-on-year basis. Recall that in 2015, we flagged in prior quarters we have received a
meaningful benefit from hedge gains as a result of the positions we took. And that benefit declines as you look from
2015 into 2016, assuming constant rates, basically because of the fact that a lot of those hedges are in place and just the
gains on them are smaller. So that impact does cause a little bit more of the leveraging effect you're seeing between the
top and the bottom line. Other than that, we generally see a proportional move between sales and earnings, but that's the
biggest single driver.
And then to your question of what we're looking at from a share count, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're
assuming 2.78 billion shares as an average for 2016, which is a reduction from where we were in 2015.
<A - Kenneth C. Frazier>: And, Gregg, thanks for the question on M&A. Let me start by saying that the Cubist deal
actually has been a good deal for us, as you can see from this year's results. It also positions us well in the antibiotics
space, a space which is a priority space for us going forward from that standpoint. But I also want to reiterate what I've
said, which is that our main focus going forward will be to augment our Phase 2 and early-stage pipeline. So our focus
is on getting the best external science because we believe that's how we can drive the greatest long-term value. So I
would say going forward, our main focus will be more on those kinds of scientific acquisition deals than on things that
augment necessarily our commercial stable.

<A - Teri Loxam>: Yes, we can.
<Q - Seamus Fernandez>: Okay, great, so just a couple of quick questions. Ken, as I just listened to your comments,
one of the things that I'm trying to better understand is can you give us a little bit of the history of Phase 2 and
earlier-stage deals where Merck has successfully brought forward a product like that into development? When I look at
the deal history, Schering-Plough is really one of the acquisitions that was quite successful with regard to gaining
access to KEYTRUDA, having your BACE inhibitor advance forward. Can you just help me understand why the
smaller acquisitions are really the way to go? Obviously, you guys identified those assets, but it actually came from a
larger deal and was clearly value-generating.
And then separately for Roger, Roger, where I'm a little perplexed on the timing, if I look at the development of the
front-line lung situation, it seems like studies that finish faster in immuno-oncology consistently show a less robust
result. So can you help me understand how the KEYNOTE-024 study has an opportunity to successfully complete
earlier than expected and before some of the other competitor studies that are out there?
And then my final question, just for Adam, when you look at – I think you guys have been really respectful basically
not saying that you're going to win but that you will have a foundational product in KEYTRUDA. When other
competitors claim and state that they're going to win, particularly from a third or fourth or fifth position, how likely is
it, given what you have seen historically, that that is a realistic possibility, particularly in a space where new standards
of care are being created? Thanks.
<A - Kenneth C. Frazier>: Okay. Let me first start with your first question, Seamus, which is a perspective on how
early-stage deals have created value for Merck. And I would start by saying that at Merck we've always been focused
on being a company that strives to develop really strong insights into human biology, and that has helped us to find
things earlier on that have actually become important. So some examples are FOSAMAX, which was licensed in, or
COZAAR. Or in my own experience when I was on the legal side, the work that we did to get access on the DPP-4
technology through a German company called Probiodrug. When those deals were done, people don't necessarily sit up
and take notice of them, but JANUVIA was a result of that deal, which was done a number of years ago.
And so what we have found in the past is the best way for us to create value is through those insights early on that
allow us to acquire the kinds of things that you heard Roger talk about, NGM and Moderna. Our goal is to find those
kinds of things before there's a bidding war, to apply our scientific knowhow, our development knowhow, our
molecular – I'm sorry to say, our medicinal chemistry knowhow, and to bring forward the kinds of molecules like
sitagliptin that can actually be pretty important contributions to human health.
<A - Adam H. Schechter>: So with regard to KEYTRUDA, I'll answer your question next. I've always said that I
believe that this market is going to be a very large market and that there's room for multiple competitors. I also believe
that there will be certain competitors that do really well in one tumor type and another competitor might get data in a
different tumor type first, and therefore you'll see differences based upon tumor type. It's not too different than if you
look at the anti-TNF field, where you have multiple products. One might do better in GI, the other might do better in
rheumatoid arthritis, but they all tend to do very well and grow very fast.
At the same time, I believe building a wall of data is important. And when you look at the size and the magnitude of
our clinical trials and when you look at the number of tumor types that we're studying, I think we're going to be in a
very good position over the long term. And it's hard to think about late entrants coming in and having a strong position
once you have that wall of data built. So I think the strategy that we put in place is the right strategy over time, and I
think over time you'll see us in a leadership position.
<A - Teri Loxam>: Thanks, Adam.
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter, M.D., Ph.D.>: Seamus, I'm not sure exactly what you mean by faster studies giving less
robust results. Just to outline again our strategy with respect to – broadly with respect to these tumor types, as I
mentioned in response to Jami Rubin's question, is that we've gone in and said let's look at the patient populations in
which we expect to see the best results, and those are the PD-L1 highs in the current formulation. It's not the only

biomarker that we have, and in fact we've evolved other better biomarkers, we believe, but it's one that's useful.
In those patient populations, because a higher percentage of the treated patients in principle should respond, the result
will be faster, but it shouldn't be less robust. In fact, in many cases it will be more robust simply in terms of the efficacy
window. So that's the basis for why the KEYNOTE-024 study, which is reading out in midyear, has a good chance of
succeeding. We don't know what the data are, but we're eager to see the data on PFS. And thereafter, the populations
will broaden through KEYNOTE-042 and through a whole variety of other studies that we're doing. So that's the
general strategy, and I think it's a good one because it focuses on those patients who need these therapies most.
<A - Teri Loxam>: Thanks, Roger. Next question, please, Darla.
Operator
It's from Andrew Baum with Citi.
<Q - Andrew S. Baum>: Thank you, a couple of questions, please. First for Roger, some of your competitors are
beginning to make investments in cancer neoantigen vaccine platforms to address the non-immunogenic tumor subsets,
which are obviously sizable. I'm unaware that Merck has such a collaboration right now. Obviously, it involves
logistical complexities above and beyond what an off-the-shelf solution might [ph] share point (46:25). I'd be interested
in your appetite to move into that treatment modality.
And then second, a question for Ken, obviously, pharma is being positioned as a rogue industry in light of the pricing
issues within the U.S. To what extent are you seeing some of the negative attention on reimbursements spill over into
other areas? I noticed an uptick in investigations from the DOJ, the SEC, the HHS. Do you see any additional risk there
for the industry as a function of [ph] exclusivity (47:00) – almost certainly driven by political motives? Thank you.
<A - Teri Loxam>: Thanks, Andrew.
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter, M.D., Ph.D.>: Andrew, with respect to neoantigen vaccine strategies, again, this is –
conceptually the idea is okay, we've introduced checkpoint inhibitors now, and we can get good responses in a
significant percentage of patients. But in a large number of patients, on more than half, we actually don't see a
response. So why don't we see a response in those patients? And one possibility certainly is that there isn't enough
pre-existing immune response. And if we could stimulate that through, as you say, a neoantigen vaccine, things might
go better. We're interested in those kinds of strategies.
We of course have used other vaccination strategies. I'd point out again the oncolytic virus strategy, which appears to
have some traction. And we are looking at the question of whether or not it's possible to use neoantigens. And one of
the issues is, as I'm sure you realize, that introducing a bespoke therapy where each patient receives a unique
neoantigen cocktail will be very challenging from an industry perspective. So we're looking for those situations where
there might be groups of neoantigens that could be used and would be able to improve responses in a large set of
patients.
<A - Kenneth C. Frazier>: Okay. And with respect to the political and regulatory and legal issues around pricing
pressures, obviously, the whole issue of pricing and affordability for patients is a significant one, and it's a challenge
that we have as a society. I think it's unfortunate that that debate is being amplified and in some ways distorted by some
of the political rhetoric, especially having to do with the presidential election cycle. So from a pharma standpoint, as
Chairman of PhRMA [Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America], we continue to work to educate
constituents in Washington DC and around the country on how pharmaceuticals actually help reduce costs in the
overall healthcare system as well as the impact that they have on individuals as well.
Now the reality of the world is, as we've seen, when there are these headlines, you tend to get Congressional hearings
and you tend to have states' Attorneys General writing letters and things of that nature, and I take those things very
seriously. But I also think that the most important thing that we can do as an industry is to continue to price our
products consistent with the value that they provide to our customers and to continue to try to educate, again, people

It's from Tony Butler with Guggenheim Securities.
<Q - Charles Butler>: Yes, good morning. Thank you, Teri, a couple of brief questions for Roger. One is an
interesting BD solution with IOmet, given some early data that you presented at STSI [Scripps Translational Science
Institute] in melanoma. But the real question is do you actually have data in-house that an IDO and/or a TDO inhibitor
in combination with KEYTRUDA would have utility in tumors outside of melanoma?
The second question is around GITR. Will we see KEYTRUDA-GITR combos this calendar year at a clinical meeting?
And forgive me, Teri, but Adam, quickly on REMICADE non-U.S., do you actually have countries which are actively
switching patients onto the biosimilar today, or is that simply new patients who go on an anti-TNF inhibitor? Thank
you very much.
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter, M.D., Ph.D.>: Tony, so with respect to the question of whether IDO1 inhibitor data exist
outside of melanoma, we have a lot of data that we've generated in combination with Incyte. In order to really know
whether you have evidence for combined efficacy, you'd have to have detailed, really, comparisons between
monotherapy versus combination therapy, and those kinds of data don't exist really anywhere. Those really have to be
done in robust Phase 2 or certainly Phase 3 studies, and we're moving forward with that. But we're interested in
pursuing the field in more detail. And in order to do that, we really need to have access to a whole range of different
compounds. And that's really what drove the IOmet deal. We're pleased with our interaction with Incyte, but we need to
be able to look at a broader range of starting materials.
And for the GITR data, we are doing combination studies right now, GITR in combination with KEYTRUDA.
Depending on how enrollment goes and how much data we have, we hope to be able to present some of that data this
year.
<A - Adam H. Schechter>: And then, with regard to the question on REMICADE, if you look at share by volume, we
had about 85% share in the fourth quarter. That came down from about 90% share that we had the quarter before. So
we're definitely seeing biosimilar business wins for new patients, and the percent of new patients is going to only grow
over time. So right now, about 10% to 20% of the business per year is new patients.
We are seeing substitution of existing patients in some smaller markets, such as the Nordics. At this point in time, we're
not seeing it in the larger markets. But we continue to anticipate that the impacts of biosimilars is going to accelerate as
we go into 2016, as there's more and more new patients coming into the market and they become a larger percent of the
sales.

<Q - Alex Arfaei>: Good morning and thank you for taking the questions. Roger, on the KEYTRUDA
KEYNOTE-024 first-line study, and forgive my ignorance on this. But can you provide the rationale why PFS was
selected as the primary endpoint, given that it has not been a reliable endpoint with anti-PD-1s in general? Basically,
I'm trying to assess the risk for this trial. Could we see a situation where PFS is not significant, but overall survival is
eventually significant, which would actually be similar to what we've seen in more advanced setting?

And the follow-up for Rob, what's driving the 14% FX headwind in Animal Health? Obviously, it's more significant
than what you're experiencing overall, and masking solid operational growth. Is this mostly Venezuela, and when can
we expect this to moderate? Thank you.
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter, M.D., Ph.D.>: Alex, it's Roger. On the PFS endpoint, if you look at the KEYNOTE-010
study, I think that's a good model for you to look at, because you look at overall survival and you look at PFS. The PFS
has a ratio that's really excellent. And you can see progression-free survival for both doses, and for PD-L1 high, as well
as PD-L1 1% population. So, again, I don't really see why first-line should look any different from second-line in that
kind of setting. And we should therefore be able to see a PFS signal. And you can do the power calculations, based on
the hazard ratio of less than 0.6 that we saw in that study. So that looks pretty good. And we can't know until you do
the study, but that's really what it ought to look like, I think.
<A - Teri Loxam>: Next question, please.
<A - Robert M. Davis>: I think there was...
<A - Teri Loxam>: Sorry, one more part.
<A - Robert M. Davis>: Alex, the other part of your question on Animal Health, the reason you see a higher FX
impact in Animal Health is primarily due to the fact that the sales of Animal Health relative to our Human Health
business are even more weighted outside of the United States, pretty significantly outside of the United States. So it's
really just the proportion of the sales coming from markets exposed to currency more than anything else. Venezuela did
have a nominal impact on Animal Health, but it's not the driver. It's just general trends across all currencies.

In addition to that, I think we developed a good pricing strategy that's going to help ZEPATIER be successful in the
marketplace. What we did was, we priced our list price to be competitive with the market's current net prices are. And
our list price makes us competitive across all segments, and I think it could potentially help us in some currently
underserved segments. I think also lower list prices could potentially have a positive impact on out-of-pocket
medication costs for some patients. There's some patients in Part D where the list price does matter, in terms of the
out-of-pocket cost, and I think it could be beneficial for us there.
I wouldn't read into our discounting strategy based upon our initial pricing strategy. What we intend to do is to compete
in all segments of the market, and to have an appropriate discounting strategy that allows us to have access.
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter, M.D., Ph.D.>: And Dave, it's Roger. On odanacatib, back in May of 2014, I talked about
odanacatib because we had the early results memo available for the Phase 3 study, and noted that odanacatib had hit the
three critical endpoints in osteoporosis. Namely, it reduced vertebral fractures, non-vertebral fractures, and it reduced

fractures at hip. And I said at the time that the benefit/risk profile for odanacatib appeared favorable. And so it's a novel
oral therapy that does what it's supposed to do in terms of reducing fractures, actually quite dramatically, quite
impressively. In terms of clinical vertebral fractures, it's really the best that I've seen, and I've been doing this for a
while. So it looks really quite good.
One of the things that we pointed out when we presented these data at the end of 2014 was that there was a larger than
usual discrepancy in adverse experience reporting for investigators versus central review. And in order to resolve that
problem, we undertook an adjudication process, and that adjudication process has taken much longer than we imagined.
We worked with FDA to define that process and we've worked with an external organization to go through it. It took all
of last year. We are nearly done. We want to get these data in and have the opportunity to file it. But I don't think
there's any question that odanacatib does what it's supposed to do. We just want to see those data pulled together

And your next question is from Mark Schoenebaum, Evercore ISI.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to talk a little bit about your
BELSOMRA launch. Scripts are doing fine. We're curious about the performance, though, above or below your
expectations at this point? And really quick, is there anything in the pipeline that investors are ignoring?
<A - Adam H. Schechter>: So with regard to BELSOMRA, I think we started off with a really good launch and we
had nice growth. It then flattened a little bit. We ran direct-to-consumer advertising, and we saw an increase again in
TRx volume. We've since seen it flatten a bit, and we're working right now on augmenting our digital capabilities and
our online capabilities.
At the same time, we're working with physicians to understand that at 10 milligrams, which is the start dose, if it isn't
effective that they should titrate the patient to 20 milligrams. So I would say that we were off to a good start. I'm not
pleased that it's currently flat at this point in time, but we're working on that.
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter, M.D., Ph.D.>: And, Mark, with respect to the pipeline, your colleagues are always telling
me that based on our current share price, it appears that the pipeline is being completely ignored because there's almost
no value that is ascribed to it. And it surprises them that here we have a really major effort in Alzheimer's, for example,
and don't get an enormous amount of credit for that. When you tick through all of those Phase 3 opportunities, some of
which I mentioned that are coming forward as well as the large number of Phase 2 programs in the early space, I can go
through them one after another, I think we have an enormous opportunity here and would love to have the opportunity
to talk about it in more detail.
<A - Teri Loxam>: Thanks, Roger. I think unfortunately we're out of time, so I'm going to just turn it over to Ken for
some final comments.
Kenneth C. Frazier
Okay. Again, thank you for joining us this morning. We're pleased with the growth that we saw through continued
execution in our key areas, including diabetes. We're looking forward to additional growth. I think if you look at our
2016 guidance ex-FX, you see we expect to grow low to mid-single digits. I think it's important to look at our EPS also.
We continue to be very rigorous in our cost reductions, and we are able to provide guidance here that again will allow
us ex-FX to grow mid to high single digits. So we're pleased that we're back in a growth mode, and we're very excited
to have opportunities to launch important products like ZEPATIER and KEYTRUDA. So thank you for your attention
this morning. We look forward to talking to you in the future. Bye-bye.
