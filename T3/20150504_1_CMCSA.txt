Thanks, Jason, and good morning everyone. We're very excited to tell you about our first-quarter which we're really
pleased with. But I'd like to start briefly with two non-earning topics. Today, I appreciate everyone adjusting the time
of the call because unfortunately, a number of us have to attend the funeral of our great friend Larry Smith. As most of
you know, Larry was co-Chief Financial Officer for Comcast for nearly 18 years and when he joined the company we
were a small regional cable company and when he retired, we were the largest cable operator in the country, but we
were so much more. His integrity, his passion, his friendship area hard to put into words and are very tough for all of us
right now, he meant so much to Philadelphia and non-profits and he has one of the most spectacular family. So on
behalf of all of us at Comcast, we want to celebrate his life and say thank you for a special man.
I also would like to say a word on Time Warner Cable. At Comcast, we have great products and technologies and we
were excited about bringing these capabilities to additional cities. The government ultimately didn't see it the same
way. Fortunately, we structured the transaction in such a way that avoided unnecessary risk for shareholders in the
event that the regulatory outcome did not go our way.
It was equally important to make sure our focus remains squarely on solid execution of our existing businesses which
we did. As you can see in the first quarter, we're off to a terrific start in 2015 with very strong progress at both Cable
and NBCUniversal. Our consolidated operating cash flow increased 7.6%, in addition we generated $3.2 billion in free
cash flow which is a new quarterly record for the company.
We have a number of material growth drivers, many of which accelerated in the quarter. Our performance continues to
reinforce our strategy of consistently and prudently investing in new products, technologies and the customer
experience. And so to reflect our confidence, we're today adding $2.5 billion to our existing buyback program for the
year. In total, this now represents a plan to repurchase $6.75 billion in our own stock in 2015.
So now let's go deeper into first-quarter results which demonstrates our great momentum. Starting with Cable, we're
responding to a tough competitive environment with real product leadership including accelerating the rollout of our
X1 Platform, our cloud DVR and offering the fastest Internet speeds.
Our strategy is clearly resonating. In the first quarter we added 199,000 customer relationships, a 61% improvement
from the prior-year. At the same time, we increased our revenue per customer relationship by a healthy 4.7%. At
business services, we once again saw over a 20% growth in revenue.
Our products are constantly improving as we invest in our network, the best platform, the most robust content lineup
and as we transform customer service.
In broadband we recently launched a symmetrical 2-gig service for residential customers who demand the absolute
fastest speeds in the market. We're also testing DOCSIS 3.1 and expect to begin rolling it out in 2016.
Meanwhile recent studies confirm that the XFINITY wireless gateway continues to be the industry's fastest device
delivering speeds of more than 700 megabits. Added all together and the result is a terrific proposition for our
customers which was demonstrated once again by an industry-leading 407,000 broadband net adds in the first quarter.
In terms of our platform and content, the reaction to X1 from customers continues to be fantastic as we scale the
deployment resulting in lower churn, more outlets collected and an increase in overall viewership. We are so pleased
with this product and our focus is to get it into more of our customers' homes and so we've accelerated the rollout again
this year. And we look forward to realigning these benefits across a larger percentage of our subscriber base.
We are also transforming customer service. So all told, our Cable business had a great first quarter and Neil and his
team have built a foundation for a very strong 2015 and beyond. A number of us are on their way to Chicago for the
INTX convention and there you will see a number of exciting announcements, many of which around customer service
and innovation.
Over at NBCUniversal, Steve and the team delivered another set of excellent results. First quarter operating cash flow
increased by 14%, our Cable Networks continue to deliver the majority of the operating cash flow at NBCUniversal
while parks, broadcast and film are driving great growth in the business, each having an outstanding quarter.

We're excited about the progress we've made at Broadcast with some notable highlights in the first quarter. Super Bowl
XLIX which aired on NBC was the most-watched television program in U.S. history and the highest rated Super Bowl
since 1986.
SNL's 40th anniversary special was NBC's most-watched primetime entertainment special in more than 10 years and
The Voice continues to rank as the top five rated broadcast show. The turnaround has really taken hold and we've
sustained the momentum as NBC remains number one in primetime for key demos.
Film turned in a terrific performance, thanks in large part to the tremendous success of Fifty Shades of Grey which had
the highest worldwide opening in history for any R-rated film. As we turn our attention forward, we're excited by the
fast start in the second quarter with Furious 7 setting records as the first Universal film to ever reach over $1 billion in
worldwide box office during its first run. And there's more to come with the large film slates still ahead for the balance
of the year.
But the biggest highlight of all may have been at the Theme Parks where among other drivers the continued enormous
success of our new Harry Potter attractions in Orlando contribute to over 50% growth in operating cash flow in the first
quarter. Notably, to experience the full breadth of attractions in both our parks in Orlando, Universal Studios, Florida
and Islands of Adventure, nearly 80% of visitors chose the higher value park-to-park tickets.
Additionally, sales of season passes were at an all-time high. Finally, our diversified cable networks remain our largest
source of operating cash flow at NBCUniversal. And operating cash flow increased again this quarter. Highlights were
in sports at CNBC which continues to see a big pickup in primetime's ratings as well as at E! where The Royals is the
number two rated new cable drama in cable TV this year.
Turning our attention to the new venture we recently announced, establishing a strategic company with a management
team led by Michael Angelakis that will focus on investing and operating growth companies. We did this in such a way
it allows us to invest in opportunities that can be important drivers of strategic and financial value creation for our
company. I'm personally excited for Michael and look forward to what this will bring for Comcast.
We're currently engaged in a search for a new Chief Financial Officer and while these are big shoes to fill, I have
complete confidence that we will find an incredible replacement. We fully expect that it will be a smooth transition as
Michael moves into his new role and new a CFO comes on board.
Altogether, this is an exciting time at Comcast as we have such a great company, an exceptional set of assets and a
team that has consistently delivered, including this first-quarter, strong operating performance.
Michael?
Michael J. Angelakis
Good morning, everyone, and thank you, Brian. We're off to a terrific start in 2015 with solid financial results across
the company which demonstrate a consistent focus on execution and profitable growth and on the fundamental strength
in our businesses.
Let me begin by briefly reviewing our consolidated financial results on slide four. First quarter consolidated revenue
increased 2.6% to $17.9 billion. For comparison purposes, if we exclude the $376 million of revenue generated by the
Super Bowl this year, as well as the $1.1 billion of revenue generated by the Sochi Olympics in the first quarter of last
year, consolidated revenue increased a healthy 7.2% reflecting strong organic growth in our Cable business and an
exceptional performance at NBCUniversal.
Consolidated operating cash flow increased 7.6% to $6 billion, however, when we exclude the Time Warner Cable and
Charter transaction related costs in both the first quarter of this year and last year, our consolidated operating cash flow
grew a very strong 9%. Free cash flow generation was also healthy for the first quarter with an increase of 12.7% to
$3.2 billion and a free cash flow per share increase of 16.8% to $1.25 per share in the quarter. This growth was
primarily driven by increased operating cash flow and improvements in working capital which were partially offset by

higher capital investment.
Earnings per share for the first quarter increased 14.1% to $0.81 per share versus $0.71 per share in the first quarter of
last year. Again for a clear comparison, when you exclude gains on sales and acquisition-related items, our normalized
EPS increased a solid 16.2% to $0.79 per share.
Now let's review the results of our individual businesses starting with Cable Communications on slide five. Our Cable
Communications segment continues to focus and execute well and we are pleased with our first quarter performance of
strong revenue and operating cash flow growth along with solid customer metrics. Cable Communications revenue
increased 6.3% to $11.4 billion, reflecting strong growth in high-speed data, solid growth in video and continued
strength in business services. As more and more customers take multiple services, total revenue per customer
relationship and our total number of customer relationships are two critical metrics that we use to evaluate our progress
and improvements.
Our objective is to focus on profitable growth by striking the right balance between financial growth and customer
growth and we believe we delivered on this balance during the first quarter. Total revenue per customer relationship
was $140 per month in the first quarter, a 4.7% increase that reflects a higher contribution from business services,
customers upgrading to higher levels of service, customers subscribing to additional products and rate adjustments.
As Brian mentioned, we increased total customer relationships by 199,000 in the first quarter. We continue to focus on
bundling our products to provide the most value to our customers. At the end of the first quarter, 69% of our customers
took at least two products and 37% took three products compared to 36% at the end of last year's first quarter.
Moving on to the individual product results, in the first quarter we lost 8,000 video customers. This reflects a difficult
comparison to the first quarter of 2014, when our Internet Plus offering was relatively new, as well as the competitive
environment that has expanded and intensified. While competition pressured connects this quarter, we are encouraged
by the trends we see in the overall video business, which includes lower churn and outstanding X1 results. Our X1 net
adds continued to accelerate more than doubling compared to last year's first quarter and accounted for nearly half of
our video connects. X1 customers now represent more than 25% of our Triple Play base.
In high-speed Internet we, again, delivered impressive subscriber results, adding 407,000 new customers in the first
quarter, an increase of 6% year-over-year and the best result in the past two years. We continue to gain share as we
differentiate our product with speed enhancements as well as the fastest in-home Wi-Fi with our advanced wireless
gateways. Approximately 65% of our residential high-speed data customers now have one of our new wireless
gateways.
In addition, Voice remains a valuable component of the bundle, as our Voice customer base grew by 77,000 in the first
quarter. This reduction in Voice net additions reflected X1 availability that was mainly focused on Triple Play
customers in the first quarter of 2014, making for a somewhat difficult comparison.
As we look at our service categories, we reported strong video revenue growth of 3% in the first quarter, the highest
rate of growth in two years. This growth reflects an increasing number of customers taking advanced services and rate
adjustments. As I noted previously, we have been very focused on striking the right balance between customer growth
and financial growth, and this clearly is demonstrated in these results.
High-speed Internet continued to fuel Cable revenue growth in the quarter, with revenue increasing 10.7%, the
strongest rate of growth in over four years, driven by continued growth in our customer base, rate adjustments and an
increasing number of customers taking higher-speed services. At the end of the quarter, 68% of our residential
high-speed Internet customers received at least 50 megabits service. Voice revenue declined 1.5% in the first quarter as
growth in our customer base was offset by a modest decline in ARPU.
Moving on to Business Services, first quarter revenue grew 21.4% to over $1.1 billion, making, again, the second
largest contributor to Cable revenue growth. Not only did the revenue growth rate accelerate sequentially, but the
absolute dollar growth we delivered in the first quarter is the highest in the business's history. Our performance in the
small end of the market was especially strong, with growth driven by an expand in customer base and rate adjustments.

At the same time, the contribution from the mid-sized businesses continues to increase. There's clearly tremendous
opportunity here for our company as we have captured approximately a 25% share of the small end of the market and
less than a 10% of the mid-sized business segment.
Cable advertising revenue decreased 0.7% during the first quarter, reflecting lower political revenue. Excluding the
political revenue, our core cable advertising increased 1.3% for the quarter.
Please refer to slide six. First quarter Cable Communications operating cash flow increased 6.2% to $4.7 billion,
reflecting a consistent margin of 40.9% compared to last year. This is terrific financial performance as we effectively
managed higher programming costs, an increase in the advertising, marketing and promotional expenses and additional
expenses to support the accelerated deployment of X1 and Cloud DVR to our customers.
Programming expenses increased 7.8% in the first quarter, driven by increases in retransmission consent fees and
higher sports programming costs. We also continue to increase the amount of content we provide our customers across
all our multiple platforms.
As I mentioned before, we expect full-year programming expense to grow at a similar level to 2014's growth of about
8%. In addition, advertising, marketing and promotion expenses increased 10.9% for the first quarter reflecting higher
overall media spend and continued investment to more effectively target customers and enhance our competitive
position in both our residential and commercial businesses. We remain very focused on expense management and
believe that we can continue to effectively offset these increased expenses within an improving product mix as we add
more high-speed data and business service customers and upgrade existing customers to higher levels of service as well
as implement modest rate adjustments.
So our Cable Communications business has lots of opportunities and is performing well both financially and
operationally. The team's focus is exactly where it should be, on improving the customer experience, having
best-in-class innovative products and continue to deliver strong financial and customer results.
Now. let's move on to NBCUniversal's results which are presented on slide seven. For the first quarter of 2015,
NBCUniversal's revenue decreased 4% reflecting a difficult revenue comparison with the Sochi Olympics in the first
quarter of last year. However, excluding any impact from the Olympics as well as the $376 million of revenue
generated by the Super Bowl this year, revenue increased a strong 7.9%. NBCUniversal's first quarter operating cash
flow increased 14% reflecting great results at Broadcast, including a profitable Super Bowl and impressive growth at
Theme Parks.
Now, let's review the individual business segments at NBCUniversal. For the first quarter, Cable Networks generated
revenue of $2.4 billion, a decrease of 5.9% compared to the first quarter of 2014, again due to difficult comparison with
the Olympics last year. Excluding the Olympics, revenue increased 4.9% driven by a 4.8% increase in distribution
revenue and a 4.3% increase in advertising revenues. While we continue to invest in sports rights and original
programming, Cable Networks' operating cash flow was relatively flat at $898 million in the quarter as lower revenues
were offset by lower operating expenses which reflect the absence of programming and production costs associated
with Olympics in 2014.
In the Broadcast Television segment, the success of the Sochi Olympics last year drove a difficult comparison again
and as a result revenue decreased 14.2% to $2.2 billion in the first quarter. This was partially offset by a very successful
Super Bowl this year which contributed $376 million of revenue. Excluding the impact of both the Olympics and Super
Bowl, Broadcast revenue increased 5.5% reflecting a 5.5% increase in advertising and higher retransmission consent
fees. Importantly, Broadcast's operating cash flow increased 48.9% to $182 million for the first quarter.
Filmed Entertainment is also off to a strong start in 2015. First quarter revenue increased 7% to $1.4 billion as content
licensing revenue increased 15.7% reflecting strong titles such as Ted and Bourne Legacy entering the free TV window
and home entertainment revenue increased 3.6% driven by a larger number of films available compared to last year. In
addition, despite three fewer releases this quarter, theatrical revenue only declined by 1.3% due to the successful box
office performance of Fifty Shades of Grey. As a result, film operating cash flow increased 1.7% to $293 million
reflecting the higher revenue partially offset by increased marketing costs to support the highly successful premiere of

Furious 7 in early April.
Our Theme Parks had another remarkable quarter as revenue grew 33.7% to $651 million and operating cash flow
increased 54.6% to $263 million reflecting higher guest attendance and per capita spending at both parks. Orlando is
experiencing tremendous growth from the continued momentum of Harry Potter Diagon Alley which opened last
summer. The increases in attendance, per caps and park-to-park ticket sales have accelerated Orlando's operating cash
flow growth. At the same time, the Despicable Me attraction continues to drive healthy attendance and per capita
increases at the Hollywood Park.
Let's move to slide eight to review our consolidated our segment capital expenditures. Consolidated capital
expenditures are tracking to our investment plan and increased 19.2% to $1.7 billion compared to the first quarter of
2014 driven by increased investments at cable.
At Cable Communications, first quarter capital expenditures increased $300 million or 26.2% to $1.4 billion, equal to
12.6% of Cable revenue versus 10.6% in the first quarter of 2014. The increase primarily reflects higher spending on
CPE, driven by the accelerated deployment of our X1 Platform as well as additional investment as we launch our cloud
based initiatives and our continued investment in network infrastructure to increase our networks' capacity.
As announced at year-end, we expect that for the full year of 2015 Cable's capital intensity will increase to
approximately 14.5% of Cable revenue compared to 13.9% in 2014, as we plan to continue the aggressive deployment
of X1, expand our cloud DVR services, deploy additional wireless gateways to enable our customers to receive the
fastest in-home Wi-Fi and continue to invest to expand our business services area.
All of these initiatives are part of our growth-oriented strategy that we expect to generate attractive risk-adjusted
returns. This is very much evidenced by the success we continue to have with our X1 rollout. We accelerated our X1
net additions in the first quarter, and as the deployment has expanded, the customer benefits we have highlighted
continue. More customers are subscribing to DVRs and taking additional outlets. There's increased VOD usage and we
continue to see reduced voluntary churn levels among these customers.
First quarter capital expenditures at NBCUniversal declined by $23 million to $268 million primarily reflecting
decreased investments in facilities, partially offset by increased spending in the Theme Parks as we build new
attractions, including Harry Potter and The Fast and Furious attractions in Hollywood. As I mentioned in February, we
expect that NBCUniversal's 2015 capital expenditures will remain relatively stable at last year's level with over half
directed to our Theme Parks segment as the investments we are making in parks are clearly generating strong returns
and drive increased attendance and per capita spending.
Now let's move on to slide nine, please. As I mentioned earlier, consolidated free cash flow increased 12.7% to $3.2
billion in the first quarter, reflecting growth in consolidated operating cash flow and improvements in working capital,
partially offset by higher capital investment. We are executing on our 2015 financial strategy and increased our return
of capital to shareholders by 1.3 billion or 104% in the first quarter to $2.6 billion, consisting of share repurchases
totaling $2 billion and dividend payments totaling $572 million.
And as Brian mentioned, today we are increasing our prior share repurchase plan in 2015 from $4.25 billion to $6.7 5
billion. Combined with the dividend increase of 11% that we announced earlier this year, our total return of capital to
shareholders will increase by over 40% in 2015. We came to this conclusion based on the optimism and confidence we
have in our business, illustrated by the strong results we are reporting today and we remain committed to returning a
significant percentage of our free cash flow to our shareholders each year.
So let me wrap up by saying we are very pleased with our performance this quarter. We've had a tremendous start to
the year with strong operational and financial results that confirm our strategy of consistently and prudently investing
in new products, innovative technology and customer experiences across the company at both Cable and
NBCUniversal. We're committed to continuing this momentum and believe our strong portfolio of complementary
businesses work well together and leverage each other's capabilities, and this will continue to generate profitable
organic growth and yield positive results.

Now, let me turn the call over to Jason for Q&A.
Jason S. Armstrong
Thanks, Michael. Brent, let's open up the call for Q&A, please.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jessica Reif, Cohen with Bank of
America. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Jessica Jean Reif Cohen>: One for Brian and one for Steve. Brian, given the extremely disappointing turn of
events which subjectively, I'll just put my two cents in, it seems like you guys are being penalized for investing in your
network and being successful at that but regardless, given the current situation, can you give us your top three priorities
for the company at this point from an operational perspective and any comment you may have on strategic direction
with or without M&A?
<A - Brian L. Roberts>: What's your question for Steve? Well, I think...
<Q - Jessica Jean Reif Cohen>: Okay. So for Steve, I guess it's kind of a two-parter. The Theme Park numbers, I don't
think we've never seen theme park at any company grow that quickly. So if you could just maybe highlight what your
five-year plan is for the attractions and hotel rooms. And the second part is on the Cable Networks. Given the
environment which is obviously much tougher than when you bought the company, how are you positioning the Cable
Networks, I guess, in two ways, one, if the world goes to skinny bundles how are you positioning the company for that?
And given the upfront next week how are you guys thinking about approaching the market given the changes in
advertising from both programmatic buying, from measurement issues, et cetera, et cetera?
<A - Brian L. Roberts>: Okay. Well, there's a lot of stuff in there, Jessica. So let me begin by just saying that of
course we're disappointed, but it was a unique kind of one-off situation as we all replay what happened and proud of
the company, proud of the effort but really, really we've moved on. And so my top three priorities start with execution
and if you look at this quarter, if you look at last year, and I hope if we look the future, it won't always be perfect but,
Neil, congratulations for really the whole team staying focused in a very trying situation. The announcements that we'll
make at the convention about service, about organic growth, those are the priorities. Really X1, what else can it do?
How can we roll it out faster, get it to more customers?
And I look at towards Steve, also great quarter and I think setting us up for record performance in film and you just
can't say enough great things about what's happening in the theme park business but the core television side, the upfront
coming advertising, Steve can talk about some of the priorities and details, but if I had to pick one thing, I would say, is
continue to make the experience, if you're a Comcast customer, better all the time and that's across the board and I think
we're doing that and have been doing that and we have a real plan to execute in the future.
So in terms of other things that could come along, I believe we have a very special company in so many different
businesses. We're always open-minded. We've always been, however, I think, extremely disciplined and focused on
building shareholder value. And right now, we're back to the work and there's nothing that I could think of that we don't
have on our plate that I'm excited about. Steve?
<A - Stephen B. Burke>: So if you go back to four years ago when we bought the company, the Theme Parks were
making about $400 million a year and right after we showed up Blackstone, we had a buy-sell agreement, with buy-sell
situation with Blackstone and we ended up buying out their 50% of the Orlando parks for about $1 billion. If you move
forward to today, this year, the Theme Parks should do over $1.3 billion in operating cash flow. We're only a third of
the way through the year so we'll see how the rest of the year goes, but they're off to a very, very good start. And we

see the theme parks now as a very big and very important part of our company. They're about 20%, 25% of our
operating cash flow and we see many, many years ahead of us of growth.
Our strategy is very simple. We're going to invest in great attractions, probably about one a year at each of our major
theme park locations. We think we have a fantastic creative group led by Mark Woodbury. They're coming up with
really cutting-edge, great very modern terrific attractions. And then we also think in Orlando, that we are significantly
under hoteled. Guests who stay on property tend to stay – their length of stay in the theme parks increases by a day and
we did a study that showed us that we can have many more hotel rooms than we have. So we recently opened a lot of
hotel rooms, but you'll see a very significant hotel build out in Orlando over the next five or so years.
And we think if you look at our company holistically with Illumination, led Chris Meledandri, making great animated
films that can travel to the theme parks and all the other things that come out of our movie studio, that we have the
ability holistically to create great IP and see that IP go into our theme parks and help drive the future. So theme parks, I
think when we first showed up, were something that came with the rest of the company and now they're right at the
core of what we're all about and, we think, provide a tremendous growth opportunity.

Your next question comes from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Craig E. Moffett>: Good morning. And then, first, my condolences to Larry's family and to everyone there. Can
you talk a little bit about two of the biggest opportunities that you had discussed with Time Warner Cable, the
opportunity to really approach the enterprise segment and the opportunity to potentially do something with wireless?
How do your plans change now that you don't have the scale associated with TWC and the New York and LA markets?
Are those still really a nationally-addressable opportunities for you or do you scale back and think of them now as more
regional opportunities?
<A - Neil Smit>: Hi, Craig. This is Neil. On the enterprise space, we've already begun working with a number of
enterprise players in the financial industries and the food industries and a number of others, so we've built that
capability. We're working with some cable – other cable operators to fill in some of the territory that we don't have to
serve the needs of the larger customers, but we've got a channel, if you will, already established, so we think there's lots
of upside opportunity there.
In the wireless space, we've been spending a bit building out our Wi-Fi network. We've got 8.6 million hotspots. We
have the MVNO agreements with Sprint and Verizon. We don't have anything to announce right now. We're still
working on our wireless strategy and how that will manifest itself, but we feel that Wi-Fi is a very strong and powerful
asset that we will be looking into the best way to leverage going forward.
<Q - Craig E. Moffett>: Can you give any kind of timeframe around when we might see those opportunities start to
show up in the numbers?
<A - Neil Smit>: No. I think it's premature to do that.

<Q - Philip A. Cusick>: Hi, guys. Thanks. I guess focused on the buyback, should we look at the additional $2.5
billion as a catch-up in any way, or can we think about this as sort of a normal capital return?
<A - Michael J. Angelakis>: Morning, Phil. It's Michael. I really wouldn't look at it as a catch-up in any way. I think
we do this, as you know, annually, we look at where we think the stock price is. What our capital investment plan is,
where we think our leverage is and I think the $2.5 billion simply reflects a balance of a couple items. One is we firmly
believe the stock is undervalued, so, therefore, having a buyback makes a lot of sense. I think two, we really have a
pretty robust capital investment plan, so the way I look at it is we're playing offense. And I would say number three, we
are at the high end of the range with regards to our leverage target. We're coming in approximately at year-end where
we think we want to be approximately two times. So when you put all those factors together, those are the numbers that
we think make sense. And I think we'll address 2016 next January or February.

Your next question comes from the line of John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: Okay. Thanks. Maybe a follow up to Craig's question for Brian, given what you heard from
the FCC, are swaps, even if they don't increase the footprint of Comcast, off the table at this point? And then
secondarily, I think plan A with Charter, it looked like Comcast may benefit from some spins from a potential
Charter/Time Warner Cable deal, at this point does it look like any – that those are impossible as well and any increase
of the footprint can't happen at this point? Thanks.
<A - Brian L. Roberts>: At this point, we're not focused on the either of those two scenarios you just outlined. I don't
know what is or is not possible. Each time you go, it's a unique conversation. But right now, I think we like our
company, its assets and we don't have any conversations in that regard.
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: Okay. If I could just ask a quick follow up for Neil, in the prepared remarks you guys talked
about increasing competition in the video market. It looks like AT&T has pulled back a bit on the U-verse side. Where
is the competition, at least from traditional video providers coming from at this point? Thanks.
<A - Neil Smit>: I think Q1 was a fairly aggressive quarter from a discounting perspective. There were a number of
orders out there with gift cards and discounts on the Triple Play and the Double Play that were lower than what we've
seen. However, we felt we competed well. Really what drove our video numbers, a big driver there was improved
retention, especially on the non-pay side. So we're getting better quality customers and retaining them. So we feel good
about the video quarter, highest growth rate in a couple of years and we didn't chase low-end subs.
<A - Michael J. Angelakis>: Let me just pile on a little bit, obviously over the last 12 months telcos continue to
overbuild us. And right now we're at about 56% over build by the telco community. That number was just under 50%
12 months ago. So to put on 199,000 customer relationships and perform the way we did across the board with having
increased promotional capability – increased promotional competition as well as more overbilled, I think the Cable
team just did a great job.

<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Thank you. Good morning. Brian, could you spend a couple more minutes just talking
about the investment company you're forming with Michael inside of Comcast? And since it's consolidated, we won't
be able to see at least obviously the investments and the returns out of the gate. So how do you think about what that
company invests in versus Comcast? And how do you think about generating returns from that investment? And then I
wanted to ask a question to Neil on customer segmentation. I think you've probably already now passed your video sub
base with more broadband subs and since we're whatever, a month and a week past the quarter and you were pretty
close at quarter end. How do you think about targeting the broadband-only households? And thinking differently about
bundles as we move more towards an Internet-led television world over time?
<A - Brian L. Roberts>: Okay. Let me start. I am thrilled with the partnership with Michael, and we'll definitely find
ways to give reports as it progresses. But if you go back to life before Comcast, the track record was stellar returns for
many, many years. And projects that are in and around our space but not directly in the center of what Comcast would
do by itself. So we, by virtue of relationships or by the nature of things we can do for companies, we see a lot of
opportunities that we don't execute on that have proved to be some fantastic returns and some not so fantastic returns.
If you're lucky enough to have someone who can build a management team, like Michael will, hopefully, and I believe
with outstanding judgment, we will find a way to add to the returns that Comcast is otherwise getting for shareholders.
I think it will create potential for businesses down the road that Comcast may want to own outright. So we think we
thought that all through. It's been very much part of the structure. We think we have a really great deal for the company
side. And I think Mike has a chance to now build a fleet, entrepreneurial organization that is in an enviable situation
compared to many of its other kinds of companies out there because I don't think there's anything quite like this. So
we're very excited and wish him incredible success on behalf of all of us.
<A - Neil Smit>: On your Broadband question, so Broadband has in fact surpassed video in terms of the number of
subs. It's a less mature market, so we think there's room for growth. We believe we're increasing share and the market is
growing. We do target HSD to satellite video households, where we can use HSD as a foot in the door and then expand
the relationship from there. The on-campus product and Internet Plus are examples of where we're segmenting the
market, on-campus being the college student and Internet Plus being the millennials with either a – in case of Internet
Plus, it's a relatively high-speed video product with B1 and a premium. And in the case of the campus product, it's a
streaming service to the dorm room, in effect.
The other thing I'd say about broadband is the Wi-Fi network continues to build out and that opens up opportunities to
other products like streaming video to any IP device in the home or to the XFINITY Home product, we now have over
500K XFINITY Home customers and that business is really starting to catch on.

Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Jayant with Evercore. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Vijay Jayant>: Thank you. Just wanted to focus on new competition on the digital front. Now that you're back to
execution on your asset base. Can you talk about any aspirations of deploying a virtual MSO nationally and I think
there's been some press reports of some branded standalone over-the-top products that NBC was contemplating, but
sort of with that but also within the ecosystem do you think that you need to repackage some of the ways the products
are bundled à la how FiOS is trying to do that. Is that even legal? And just the fact that in both sides of the equation,
any thoughts there? Thank you.
<A - Brian L. Roberts>: Let me start if I might, Neil, and then kick it to you. I don't think we have any news today on
any of those matters. I think the ecosystem is always evolving. We are really smart people; we have got a lot of great
assets. But we're a facilities-based company that has proved to be a tremendous business and creates new products all

the time. NBC has international assets that's constantly looking at how the world is changing and what are
opportunities. And then there is relationships that we have with content companies that want to give customers more
access on the go, in the home, on new devices. And then you have new content players who just want to get their
content more broadly seen on new platforms and I think we're doing some of all those things. And we'll have more to
talk about as we go forward, but right now, getting X1 rolled out I think is still the best opportunity in the company in
very short run and that's what we're pretty focused on. Neil?
<A - Neil Smit>: Yeah, I'd just echo that the X1 acceleration is core to our plans, we still see voluntary churn rates
20% to 30% lower, VOD buy rates 20% to 30% higher, higher DVR penetration, more additional outlets, so the ARPU
per X1 customers is significantly better than the legacy systems. In terms of over-the-top, we feel, as Brian said, very
comfortable in our footprint, we've got a lot of penetration still to go and we'll be focusing there.

Your next question comes from line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Brett Joseph Feldman>: Thanks for taking the question. You've come out and stated your opinion that you think
Verizon's custom TV product is a violation of the programming agreement you have with them and you can take any
extra step of actually suing, saying explicitly that they're not allowed to it include ESPN in programming tiers. And so
my question is is that the same problem that you see with the product and then could you just elaborate on what your
options are for enforcing your contractual rights?
<A - Brian L. Roberts>: Let me start and kick it over to Steve. I don't think we have any new statements to make
today. I think you've characterized the situation of the market. We'll just have to see what each company pursues in
their conversations or any actions they make, but I think NBC has put out its own press release. Steve, do you want to
add to that?
<A - Stephen B. Burke>: No, I think you said it well. Nothing more to say.
<Q - Brett Joseph Feldman>: All right. Thanks for taking the question.
<A - Jason S. Armstrong>: All right. Thanks, Brett. Next question, please?

Your next question comes from line of Marci Ryvicker with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Marci L. Ryvicker>: Thanks. I have two. First for Steve, a lot of the diversified companies have restructured the
businesses and taken some big write-offs mostly related to programming. I assume that NBCUniversal is in a different
position because you've been working on all of this for the past couple of years. So I just wanted any commentary or
color on how NBCUniversal is positioned at this point? And then the second question is for Brian or Michael, the $4
billion for the new venture, where is that capital coming from? Is it a reallocation of resources or is it coming out of
free cash flow? Thank you.
<A - Stephen B. Burke>: So if you look at the activity that has taken place at NBCUniversal over the last four years,
we've made major, major changes at all levels of the organization. Restructuring the company, grouping like businesses
under business heads and then once you do that grouping, going through and making sure that you eliminate
redundancy and inefficiency. If you look at Cable, we now have all of our cable entertainment under Bonnie Hammer.
For example if you look at ad sales, we used to have different ad sales groups for broadcast, cable and digital. They're
now all operating under Linda Yaccarino.

Mark Lazarus has all of Sports, so he has NBC Sports, NBC Sports Network, Golf, all the regional sports businesses.
So we've put like kind groups together, and I think that has the benefit of giving you more management leverage and
putting those businesses together realizing synergies. It also sometimes allows you to take costs out of the business
because you've got people who were doing essentially the same thing who are now part of a group. So we've done a lot
of that and we're going to continue to do that, by the way. We, I think, are constantly looking at ways to make the
business more efficient. But we've done a lot of that already.
<A - Michael J. Angelakis>: Let me talk about write-offs for a second, which I think, Marci, putting a finer point on
your question. We're constantly evaluating the assets that NBC is producing on the content side, and frankly constantly
taking some write-downs to the extent that they're unsuccessful. So it's not like we do it every couple of years. We've
done it right from the start, and it's sort of a constant evaluation process the company goes through.
<A - Brian L. Roberts>: And I think the capital allocation question, I want to echo what Michael said earlier on the
buybacks and our view of the health of the company's financial position. And I think as we look to invest, my first
observation is the $4 billion doesn't go out the door in one day. It can't happen any quicker than a couple years without
a new conversation, but I think it'll probably even be longer than that. So I don't think it will really have a material
change of trajectory of how we're running the company. And I think the way I look at it is we're planting seeds for
future growth accelerators for the company and really optimistic to do that.

Your next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: I have two questions, one for Mr. Burke. We've been surprised, given the strength of
the dollar, how the international visitors into Orlando have been. As you look at the patterns down at the parks, do you
anticipate the strong dollar becoming a headwind for you in six or nine months? And then second, for Mr. Angelakis,
should we be delevering your balance sheet? Because when I look at the amount of cash flow that you have, and if I
hold your leverage constant given your EBITDA growth, I can't figure out what to do with that cash. So I don't know if
I should be moving towards the low end, like in other words 1.5 turns of leverage? Or what I should be doing with that
cash? Maybe it's all related to this new investment company? But any color would be helpful. Thank you.
<A - Stephen B. Burke>: So the strong dollar is obviously affecting any of the dollars that we're bringing back to the
United States from the movie and television businesses that we distribute around the world. And despite the strong
dollar, we've had the most successful film in our history with Fast and Furious 7, which actually the benefit of which is
in the second quarter not the first quarter. But we're currently standing at over $1.4 billion in worldwide box office, and
that would be pretty significantly higher if the dollar wasn't so strong.
As it relates to Orlando, we've really seen no impact from the strong dollar. It's very difficult to tell, because our
attendance is up so dramatically. When your attendance is up 25%, it's basically coming from everywhere, including
international. And we have very, very strong Latin American business and European businesses. So we lap ourselves
with Harry Potter this summer and would anticipate that the overage or the increase in attendance to decline, but we
don't think that international is going to be the kind of drag that is noticeable because we're on such a run and we're sort
of growing the overall business, and a piece of that is international. But a big piece of that is local domestic and far
away domestic as well.
<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: Okay.
<A - Michael J. Angelakis>: Jason, I'll take the cash point. I think you know, we really don't provide multiyear sort of
forecast on where we think cash is going. But the reality is the company is generating cash. We're providing the vast
majority of it back to shareholders in both the form of dividends and buybacks. And we increased the dividend about

11% a few months ago, and now we're continuing to increase the buyback pretty significantly. So as we go forward, I
think that's sort of an annual review. The annual review is where do we think free cash flow is, where do we think
leverage should be, where do we think our overall dividend and return of capital should be.
I really don't see the investment area that you mentioned having any materially impact on return of capital or leverage.
We are an A rated credit and I do think now we'll probably end the year approximately at two times. And as we go
forward, could we deleverage just a little bit organically as we have over last four years? Sure. But I don't anticipate
any large change or swings.

Your next question comes from the line of Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Kannan Venkateshwar>: Thank you. Just a couple, the first on now that Title II is the new state of the world, if
you can lay out for us how you see that framework affecting broadband pricing going forward or what you can or
cannot do with this new framework now. And secondly, given the big base of subscribers that you have on 50 megs or
more, how have you see the consumption patterns change? As you've upgraded more and more customers to these
higher speeds, are people spending more time on over-the-top content versus linear? If you can help us with that, that'll
be very useful. Thanks.
<A - Neil Smit>: Yes, this is Neil. On Title II, it really hasn't affected the way we've been doing our business or will do
our business. We believe in an open Internet. And while we don't necessarily agree with the Title II implementation, we
conduct our business the same way we always have, transparency and non-pay peering and things like that. I think how
it will emerge remains to be seen. We've been flexible in our packaging with HSD. We've invested significantly in our
capacity and will continue to do so. And that includes both the – we launched a 2 gigabit speed, 2 gigabit symmetrical
speed recently, we're rolling that out across 18 million homes by the end of the year and we've got the fastest in-home
Wi-Fi router. So the broadband in terms of pricing, we remain market flexible. We are always balancing rate and
volume and packaging in different ways. So we'll be in tune with the market's the way I'd describe it.
<Q - Kannan Venkateshwar>: And the consumption patterns on broadband?
<A - Neil Smit>: Consumption patterns continue to go up. We increased 40% to 50% of our capacity, consumption
going up at that amount per year and we haven't seen a dramatic change in that, but we'll continue to invest. We
doubled our capacity every 18 months and we don't see that slowing down in the near term.

<A - Michael J. Angelakis>: Re-trans has been very helpful. I believe the number for 2015 is approximately $500
million. So that's just been a great tailwind for NBCUniversal. I think going back four or five years ago when we
acquired the company, the number was in the single digit millions of dollars and now that number is approaching $500
million. So that's certainly helping and importantly dropping to the bottom line. That was an important factor that we've
talked about internally is making sure that, yes, we're investing significantly in programming across the board, but that
some of those dollars can increase profitability.
<A - Brian L. Roberts>: Again, we don't have any new news or even new focus today. I do think, as Steve said, the
international results at NBCUniversal have been really strong and part of what's helping our growth, so clearly we now
have products, we have opportunities internationally that we never had before. Buying NBCUniversal, Michael's new
company is going to have an opportunity to look at things from all over the world. But I think our number one focus
and just want to make sure you hear it is the kind of results that we've posted in the first quarter here. Staying focused,
not taking our eye off the ball, looking at how to accelerate this great X1 experience for customers, improving customer
service every quarter, which we did in the last quarter, but we know we can continue. We'll have a lot of news and talk
about that at the cable convention, and continuing to onboard the great products that we've got in the company and get
them to more consumers. So a good quarter, and thank you to the team for making it happen. Jason?
