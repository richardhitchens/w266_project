Nicholas K. Akins
Thanks, Bette Jo. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining AEP's second quarter 2015 earnings call. AEP
once again had a strong quarter performance. At the risk of being redundant, there are several reasons for this positive
performance: the strength of geographic and state jurisdictional diversity; the passion and culture of AEP employees to
continue our journey of efficiency gains through Lean optimization activities; positive regulatory outcomes through our
focus on operating company performance; continued expansion of our transmission business, increases in all three
customer segments, Residential, Commercial and Industrial; and continued positive performance by the unregulated
business despite lower than forecasted power prices.
These result continue to illustrate the disciplined execution of our business segments to produce consistent earnings
performance for our shareholders. That's what's expected from the next premium regulated utility, our tag line at last
year's EEI Financial Conference. Second quarter GAAP and operating earnings came in at $0.88 per share compared
with second quarter 2014 GAAP and operating earnings of $0.80 per share. So for year-to-date with the positive
performance of the first quarter as well, AEP's earnings stands at GAAP $2.16 per share and operating earnings at
$2.15 per share.
As you already know, two days ago the board of AEP authorized dividends to be paid to shareholders of $0.53 per
share, making this the 421st consecutive quarter of dividends being paid in the history of AEP. It was Plato who said
there is no harm in repeating a good thing. So in light of that, as we did last year, we are raising our guidance for 2015
from $3.40 to $3.60 per share to $3.50 to $3.65 per share and increasing our capital spend in transmission another $200
million from $4.4 billion to $4.6 billion. We are also reaffirming our 4% to 6% earnings per share growth rate based
upon our original guidance.
2015 is stacking up, so far, to be another great year for AEP, but we still have a half year to go. So we aren't popping
the champagne corks or anything like that, but we are leaving the second quarter with a smile of quiet confidence as we
enter the second half of 2015. As we have maintained for the last two years, 2016 is a significantly challenged year
because of Ohio issues of deregulation and capacity auctions, but we have, and continue to, chip away at the deficit
because of actions taken to continue our expected earnings growth profile.
So let me address a few areas before Brian takes over with the details. While customer load remains somewhat tenuous
if you're looking quarter-to-quarter, during the second quarter all three customer classes, Residential, Industrial and
Commercial, increased, particularly Commercial load. Continued Industrial growth is interesting, given it is primarily
driven by the oil and gas sector. We usually hear of new rig counts decreasing, but that doesn't necessarily translate to
the load decreases, however. We continue to see production and load increasing in the Shale regions, primarily due to
continued optimization of the oil and gas fields, including the additions of compressor load. While overall load
increases have been slightly less than forecast, the mix between customer classes continues to impact financial
outcomes. We will continue to watch the load sectors closely as we gauge the robustness of any potential overall
economic recovery.
We continue to be pleased with the progress of our continuous improvement in culture-related initiatives through Lean
and our Power Up and Lead programs that enable a culture and an expectation of continuous efficiency improvements
with decisions made at teams at all levels through the organization. Regarding Lean activities, we are now complete
with 15 plants with one remaining and have extended into areas, such as Cook Nuclear Plant and centralized repair
shops as well. We have completed 20 of 31 distribution districts with 10 remaining for this year and one that will
extend into first quarter of 2016. Three of five transmission areas across AEP have completed Lean reviews with the
remaining anticipated to complete by the end of the year. Additionally, Lean activities are in progress in other areas,
such as IT, supply chain, inventory management, fleet operations, customer and distribution services and others. This
activity has and will continue to be a very important part in engaging our employees to achieve not only our 2016
objectives, but also to redesign our business processes and supporting culture for the future.
Starting with the rate case activities, we have completed cases at APCo in West Virginia and in Kentucky. We also
initiated rate case at PSO in Oklahoma. The West Virginia rate case outcome met our expectations of improved

revenues to support the quality of service to our customers and improvement in the return expectations with
investments made at APCo. The order authorized an increase in rates with an ROE of 9.75% with additional revenues
for vegetation management, conformation of the base rate transfer of the Mitchell Plant, resolution of the consolidated
tax issue, among other areas that really set a positive tone for the future.
Regarding Kentucky, the rate case outcome there, again, was constructive for future investments. The $45 million rate
increase authorized included a 10.25% ROE for several riders regarding certain Mitchell and Big Sandy activities, and
included incremental vegetation management. Also, importantly, it allowed the recovery of NERC CIP compliance
costs signaling the recognition by the commission of the importance of these types of expenditures. It also settled the
issues related to the fuel cost recovery case that was before the court. With these two cases completed, along with the
formal base rate adjustments at I&M and SWEPCO, we have now secured the forecasted rate changes for 2015.
Additionally, we followed a base rate case at PSO to recover generation environmental-related cost and as well as other
cost adjustments with the requested 10.5% ROE. Rates in that case are intended to be effective in first quarter of 2016,
so, overall, a great story regarding regulatory performance.
As you all know by now, FERC had approved the capacity performance model that PJM had proposed and last night
threw a wrench in the plans for at least the supplemental auction being held next week. But regardless, the upcoming
base residual auction will ultimately help define the forward view of generation value. The supplemental auction
remains important for our risk adjusted 2016 performance. We will be participating in all of these auctions, of course
not saying how, but we are hopeful to see improvement in valuations of our generation.
These auctions will affect the financial outlook for unregulated generation, in particular baseload generation, and would
begin to answer some of our 2016 risk adjusted assumptions. More clarity on the subject will be provided when we
give 2016 guidance at the EEI Financial Conference. The forward view of generation will also be an important data
point as it relates to our valuation process of the unregulated generation. The process continues with these instructive
and perhaps substantial data points that we have been discussing with our board for a couple of years now. Chuck
Zebula and his team have done an outstanding job compartmentalizing the risk of this business and are positioning the
business in a positive way regardless of the outcome.
PJM and FERC have done their jobs in at least making some progress in allowing for a potential path for improved
generation value. The only hold out is the Public Utility Commission of Ohio on the PPA question. We would not have
presented the PPA option to the Commission if we did not think it was important. It is important for Ohio and its
energy policy, Ohio jobs, taxes, economic development, and, in fact, the future of the generation business in Ohio.
Governor Kasich once gave me some advice: don't get so buried in the financial expectations of the company that you
lose sight of doing the right thing. If we take a look back at AEP's proud history of owning and operating generation in
Ohio, we have always supported the economic engine for growth, whether it be the assets themselves, the ancillary
assets, such as transmission, that supported economic development, or the development of domestic Ohio fuel to
support the generation.
So what's happened in the last few years in Ohio? Well, for AEP, over a half a billion dollars of write-offs, the
incremental loss in capacity revenue of approximately $200 million each and every year in the last three years, and a
state that is left short of generation capacity to serve Ohio customers; not a good story for generation investment in this
state. Because we serve 11 state jurisdictions of almost all regulated jurisdictions as well as significant transmission
across the country, we have managed the loss of Ohio revenue pretty well. That's the value of diversity, but this is
really about the customers in the State of Ohio. It's about volatility of electric pricing, particularly in extreme heat or
extreme cold, that impacts all customers' pocket books and it's about Ohio's energy and financial future by developing
its own resources, such as natural gas, and maintaining existing resources. Continual delays are not the answer. It is
time for the PECO to do the right thing.
Moving on to another subject, we continue to participate in the EPA dialogue regarding the Clean Power Plan. We have
talked at length in previous earnings calls about the challenges the proposed rule produces for the state, utilities and
other stakeholders, so I won't cover that ground, again. I will say that I believe through conversations at the White
House and the EPA that there is an understanding of the major issues involved, namely the aggressive front-end 2020

emission targets and timeline and the reliability implications. What they ultimately do about it in the final rule, we don't
know. We will continue to work with our states to understand the final rule implications and engage in the succeeding
the liberations to achieve an ultimate result that is reasonable and rational in its impact on customers' costs and
reliability of supply while maintaining to achieve environmental progress.
So let's turn to the next page, the famous equalizer graph. There's a couple of stark things in the equalizer graph that I'll
get into here, but, from an Ohio power situation, the ROE for AEP Ohio decreased this quarter primarily due to lower
earnings driven by increased PJM and property tax cost and lower margins due to seasonal rate adjustments; however,
we do expect the AEP Ohio subsidiary will finish the year in line with the 12% ROE forecasted.
For APCo, you just heard about the rate case in West Virginia, the outcome there. So rates were implemented in June
of 2015, so we expect to see higher ROEs for APCo for the balance of the year; and that will continue to improve.
The primary drivers – and Kentucky is one of those areas, 0.6% doesn't look too good, but the primary drivers for the
decrease in ROE were the $36 million regulatory provision that was recorded for the fuel cost recovery disallowance
related to Mitchell plus an additional $7 million that was recorded in 2015. Also, off-system sales have been off
slightly in Kentucky as well, but we expect the ROE will grow to approximately 5% by the end of 2015 and should be
in the 9% to 10% range by the end of 2016. So we should see measurable progress here in the next year and a half.
I&M continues to do well. It's on track to grow earnings and achieve its authorized ROE range. They're in the middle of
several capital investment programs, particularly in generation with Rockport SCR, solar installation, nuclear life cycle
management and, as well, transmission projects. So we continue to see that one improve.
PSO did improve modestly as a result of, I guess, higher retail margins primarily on increased rider revenues and lower
O&M expenses. A base rate rate case I mentioned earlier had been filed July 1, 2015, so we expect continued recovery
there as well.
In SWEPCO, the transmission cost recovery in Texas and a formula base rate true-up in Louisiana as well as a true-up
and increase in wholesale customer rates were the primary drivers for SWEPCO's ROE improvement during the second
quarter. However, the ROE continues to be under pressure because of the Arkansas portion of Turk and we continue to
analyze our alternatives and timing associated with addressing the 88 megawatts of Turk that's still outstanding.
AEP Texas, we expect the ROE there to continue to decline somewhat through 2015 as distribution has raised their
CapEx and the need to infuse equity to replace tax obligations due to related deferred taxes from the securitization. The
AEP Transmission Holdco is doing well as Holdco returned 11.9%. It's still in line with its authorized return, so it
continues to do well. So from the equalizer standpoint the numbers are reasonable. The overall has come up. It will
continue to come up, and Kentucky, which is the one that's showing extremely low, will make rapid progress. So we're
in good shape there.
The transformation of our industry is occurring and AEP will continue to position itself to succeed. If I could borrow
from Jim Collins, the famous business author of Good to Great, Great by Choice and other books, what our investors
have witnessed over each quarter over the last four years has been the beginning of AEP's version of the 20 Mile
March. With dogged determination, disciplined execution and AEP's ingenuity, we will be successful as the next
premium regulated utility.
Brian, I'll turn it over to you.

Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin on slide five with a review of the major drivers affecting the
earnings comparison for the quarter. This year's second quarter operating earnings were $0.88 per share, or $429
million, compared to $0.80 per share, or $390 million, last year. This solid performance for the company was driven by
our regulated businesses where we are investing for our customers, executing on our regulatory plans and spending
O&M wisely. With that overview, let's review the major earning drivers by segment.

Earnings per share for the Vertically Integrated Utilities segment were $0.43, up $0.12 from last year. Key drivers in
the quarterly comparison include rate changes, which added $0.11 per share and are related to the recovery of
incremental investment to serve our customers. This improvement includes the effect of annual true-ups related to
FERC formula rate customers. Warmer temperatures in 2015 and higher normalized margins each added $0.01 per
share to the quarter versus last year. The growth in normalized sales was primarily driven by improvements in the
commercial class. I will talk more about load and the economy in a few minutes.
The Vertically Integrated segment also benefited from lower O&M expense, adding $0.02 per share for the quarter.
Partially offsetting these favorable items is a $0.03 per share decline in off-system sales margin, which was driven by
much lower power prices this year.
The Transmission & Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.16 per share for the quarter, down $0.02 from last year.
The $0.02 per share decline in normalized margin is due in part to the elimination of seasonal rates in Ohio beginning
in 2015. This will reverse over the balance of the year. This segment was also adversely affected by a $0.01 per share
from higher O&M expense primarily due to higher transmission costs in Ohio. These two unfavorable items were
partially mitigated by earnings on incremental investment in distribution facilities to benefit customers in Ohio.
The Transmission Holdco segment continues to grow, contributing $0.13 per share for the quarter, an increase of $0.03
per share over last year. Year-over-year, the Transco's net plant grew by approximately $1.2 billion, an increase of
57%.
The Generation & Marketing segment produced earnings of $0.16 per share, off $0.04 from the second quarter of last
year. As expected, we are beginning to see the adverse effect of lower Ohio capacity revenue. You will remember our
2015 forecast included a capacity revenue decline of $0.35 for the year beginning in June. Despite this decline, the
segment benefited from favorable hedging activity which helped offset the impact of weaker market prices.
AEP River Operations declined $0.01 per share quarter-over-quarter, reflecting a decline in barge revenue due to high
water conditions in May and June. Corporate & Other earnings were unchanged from last year's results.
On slide 6, we have a view of year-to-date operating earnings compared to last year. Operating earnings for the period
stand at $2.15 per share, or $1.1 billion, compared to last year's $1.95 per share, or $950 million. Similar to the
quarterly comparison, growth from our regulated businesses is driving results with the competitive businesses
performing close to last year. Weather had no impact on the year-to-date comparison.
Earnings per share for the Vertically Integrated Utilities segment were $1.03 per share this year, up $0.15 from last
year. The major drivers for this segment include the favorable effects of rate changes for $0.15 and the effect of the
Virginia rate legislation adding $0.03 per share. The remaining drivers were discussed at length during our first quarter
call. As a reminder, these include lower normalized margins primarily due to lower residential sales in the East, the
effect of lower power prices this year on both our off-system sales margin net of sharing and PJM expenses, and lower
O&M this year primarily driven by a decline in employee-related expenses.
The Transmission & Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.36 per share for the first six months, down $0.02 from
2014, consistent with the second quarter. We are on track to achieve this segment's earnings target for the year.
The Transmission Holdco segment earnings through the first half of the year are at $0.21 per share, up $0.06 from the
same period in 2014. Similar to the quarter, increased investment is driving the year-to-date result.
The Generation & Marketing segment matched last year's results through the first half of the year. As I mentioned, we
are seeing the adverse effect of lower capacity revenue, but our trading and retail activities have offset this impact. And
finally, AEP River Operations remains favorable for the first six months driven by lower costs in the first quarter.
In summary, when you look at our performance for the first half of 2015, you see our regulated utilities executing on
their investment and rate recovery plans while demonstrating cost discipline with day-to-day operations. Our
competitive businesses, despite being challenged by the decline in capacity revenue, have produced earnings at last
year's level as the commercial and retail teams continue to take advantage of the available opportunities. This
combination has allowed us to exceed last year results by $0.20 per share. Strong results from the first half of the year

and a stable outlook for the balance of the year serve as the basis for raising the operating earnings guidance range to
$3.50 per share to $3.65 per share.
Now, let's take a look at slide seven to review the normalized load performance for the quarter. Starting in the lower
right corner, weather normalized load grew by 0.9% compared to last year with growth spread across all our major
retail classes. This brings our year-to-date normalized growth to within 0.3% of last year's results through the second
quarter. In the upper left quadrant, residential sales are up 0.3% compared to the second quarter of 2014. The growth in
residential sales is largely coming from customer growth, which is also up 0.3%. Most of the customer growth is
happening in our Western territory, especially Texas, where residential counts are up 1.2% versus last year.
Year-to-date residential sales are down 2.2% versus last year. This is mostly a result of the weak normalized growth
reported in the first quarter. Remember that last year's first quarter normalized load was unusually impacted by the
polar vortices.
Looking to the upper right corner of the slide, commercial sales were up 1.9% for the quarter. Here we saw growth in
commercial sales at every operating company, except for Kentucky Power. Once again, the strongest growth in the
commercial sales is happening in the West where we also saw the strongest growth in non-farm employment.
Finally, in the lower left quadrant, industrial sales growth moderated again from the previous two quarters, but still
grew by 0.6% compared to last year. We continue to see robust industrial sales growth from customers in oil and gas
related sectors despite the recent decline in oil prices.
Outside of the oil and gas sectors, our industrial sales were down 3.2% compared to last year as many of our export
manufacturing customers are starting to feel the impact of the strong dollar and weaker global demand.
With that, let's review the most recent economic data for AEP's service territory on slide 8. Starting with GDP, you can
see that the estimated 1.7% growth for AEP's service area is about 0.5% less than the estimated growth for the U.S.
This is not surprising given the impact of falling oil prices, especially in our Western footprint.
As you know, AEP's service territory covers five of the seven major shale areas that the EIA has noted are responsible
for 95% of domestic oil production and all of natural gas production growth since 2011. While the entire nation
benefits from lower fuel prices, the regional economies supporting these shale plays experienced the direct impact of
the lost oil and gas jobs in those areas. In fact, this quarter marks the first time in over four years where AEP's Western
GDP growth fell below that of the East.
In the bottom left quadrant, you can see that the job market within AEP's service area continues to improve in step with
U.S. employment recovery. Here, job growth within AEP's Western territory exceeds the Eastern service area. The
sectors showing the strongest job growth for the quarter include construction, leisure and hospitality, and education and
health services. We should point out that the sector which saw the biggest decline this quarter is the natural resources
and mining sector, which is not surprising giving the decline in oil prices and active rig counts.
Now, let's turn to slide nine to update you on the domestic shale gas activity happening within AEP's footprint. We
continue to see significant industrial load increases in the parts of our service area located in and around major shale
formations as illustrated in the upper left chart. It is remarkable that we saw 10% growth in electricity sales to oil and
gas related sectors despite oil prices that are down 45% from last year, rig counts being down nearly 60% and 8,000
fewer oil and gas workers than we had at the end of 2014.
In the upper right chart, oil and gas loads spread across all major shale plays within AEP's service territory with the
strongest growth located around the Woodford, Eagle Ford, and Marcellus shales. If we dissect the oil and gas growth
into its components, that is upstream, midstream, and downstream activity as shown in the bottom left chart, you see
that the strongest growth is coming from the midstream pipeline transportation sector, which grew by over 34% in the
second quarter. This is mostly due to the expanding infrastructure being built in West Virginia, Ohio and Texas to
support the Marcellus, Utica and Texas shales.
In our upstream sector, oil and gas extraction, volumes are up nearly 6% while the downstream petroleum and coal
product sector grew by just under 2% this quarter. I should point out that we expect a number of new oil and gas related

expansions to come on-line over the next 18 months.
In contrast to the growth in our oil and gas sectors, I'd like to focus your attention to the red bars on the upper left chart.
This shows the trend in our industrial sales excluding the oil and gas related sectors. You can see that the rest of our
manufacturing sales are not growing as they were last year at this point, down 3.2% in the second quarter. In fact,
through June, six of our top 10 industrial sectors are down from last year's results. The only sectors showing growth are
the three oil and gas related sectors along with transportation equipment manufacturing, which benefits from low oil
prices.
The stronger dollar and weak global economy have developed into headwinds for many of our export manufacturing
customers. For example, sales through chemical manufacturers were down almost 9% this quarter while primary metals
volumes were down 10%. This is something we'll continue to monitor closely as we work through the balance of the
year.
On a lighter note, let's turn to slide 10 and review the company's capitalization and liquidity. Our debt to total capital is
very healthy at 54.3%. Our credit metrics, FFO interest coverage and FFO to debt, are solidly in the BBB and Baa1
range at 5.6 times and 21.5%, respectively.
Our qualified pension funding has improved and is now fully funded at 101%. This improvement was driven by a
reduction in liability from increased interest rates which more than offset a small decline in pension assets. The
company also made a $92.5 million contribution to pension assets in June as planned, which is equal to the company's
estimated annual service cost. Since our OPEB funding stands at 122%, no funding will be needed in 2015.
Finally, our liquidity stands at $3.2 billion and is supported by our two revolving credit facilities that extend into the
summers of 2017 and 2018.
At this point, I would like to point out some of the opportunities our treasury group has taken advantage of during the
quarter. First, at Appalachian Power Company they redeemed a high coupon issuance and refinanced at a much lower
market rate. Secondly, the treasury team extended to April of 2017 the $500 million AEP Generation Resources term
loan with a flexible lower cost facility. And finally, the team partnered with local banks in the Indiana and Michigan
service area to grow that company's local bank facility to $200 million with an expiration in May of 2018.
The company has worked very hard over the last several years to strengthen its balance sheet. As you just heard, our
treasury group is active in the debt markets and working with our banking partners to secure low cost capital to put to
work for our customers. This, when combined with our strong operating results, give us the confidence to increase our
capital spend by $200 million this year.
Let's see if we can wrap this up on slide 11. Clearly, the first half of 2015 is off to a strong start for our customers,
shareholders and employees. Conditions have been favorable and our operating commercial and corporate groups have
made the most of the opportunities available to them. Based on our strong results to-date and our outlook for the
balance of the year, we are comfortable raising our operating earnings guidance range to between $3.50 per share and
$3.65 per share. Based on our operating cash flows, our strong balance sheet and our continued access to low cost debt
capital, we are confident in increasing our capital investment this year by $200 million. This incremental spend will be
in our transmission businesses, both at the Transmission Holdco and at our utility operating companies.
And finally, we are reaffirming our 4% to 6% growth range. We have some challenges related to Ohio deregulation and
an unsettled economy, but we are managing our way through with disciplined O&M spending, the continuous
improvement initiatives that Nick mentioned and increased investment in our regulated businesses.
With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions.

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Daniel Eggers with Credit Suisse.
Please go ahead.
<Q - Daniel L. Eggers>: Hey. Good morning, guys.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Good morning, Dan.
<Q - Daniel L. Eggers>: Hey, Nick, I know you can't control the governmental regulators, but certainly delays in Ohio
and the FERC snafu last night to kind of push that timeline to clarity on the generation business, but can you walk
through how you and the board are approaching a decision on monetization and then what data points you guys think
you need to see before you get comfortable formalizing that decision?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah, Dan. Well, clearly we were looking at the capacity auctions to look at the long-term
value of that generation. The supplemental auctions are, by and large, some of the risk-adjusted items and filler-in for
2016 and 2017 during those years, but in particular 2016. If those supplemental auctions continue to occur certainly
before – in the September-October timeframe, even then we'll have a good handle on what 2016 looks like. But the
base residual auction is clearly the important win in terms of long-term valuation of generation and we continue to
expect those valuations to improve.
So our board has been along with us all along the way; matter fact, we just had a board meeting with them this week
and went over the issues involved, and the primary issue was the upcoming auctions that would be a large part of
presenting to us our options relative to the strategic valuation of generation. So that's the key component.
Now as far as the PPA is concerned, that's going to continue on; but it's really hard to tell when the PECO is going to
focus on that. And I would say that we continue to push for the PPA, obviously, but the main determinant right now
with the board is that capacity auction. So once we get that, we'll have a major data point for the board and we can
continue our process of that strategic evaluation.
<Q - Daniel L. Eggers>: Got it. And I guess just on guidance – and I know we're just going into the summer, but if
you look at generation now above your full year guidance and transmission at a run rate that's equal to your full year
guidance, what are some of the things we're seeing that's hampering the second half results to stay within even this
elevated band given how far ahead you are in some of these segments?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah, I think you have O&M spend. Obviously, there's timing issues with O&M. And as far
as the remaining, we have – there could storm related activities, many things that we sort of hedge on. I know that
sounds – makes us sound like sandbaggers to a certain point, but it's not that. It's really we're trying to risk-adjust some
of these issues that can occur. Brian, you got something else?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Yeah. Dan, another big driver is the PJM, the capacity revenue decline. It's $0.35 and almost
all of that is in the back half of the year; $0.05 of that was in second quarter, but the remaining $0.30 is back half of the
year.
<Q - Daniel L. Eggers>: I guess, maybe probing it the other way, how much O&M do you think you can
incrementally pull forward from 2016 into 2015 just to give you a little more breathing room for next year, given some
of the other kind of built-in challenges there already?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: We've pulled some already that's incremental beyond what we did last year. It's around $14
million. It's getting harder and harder to do that. Obviously, you can pull some in, but you can't pull everything in. So
I'm seeing that as more limited right now.
<Q - Daniel L. Eggers>: Got it. Okay, thank you guys.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Okay.

Thank you. Now, we'll go to the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Good Morning, Stephen.
<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: Good morning. I wanted to touch on transmission. You're making great progress in
terms of incremental spend and I just wondered if there were further opportunities that you saw. If you could just
maybe give us a little more color on the outlook there to create additional opportunities, what sort of – what are the
drivers here as we should think about your ability to grow transmission even further?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: There is lot of color here. We have a lot of incremental spending that we can do in
transmission. And right now, I mean, transmission – you think about it. We have over 2,000 projects going on right
now – and those are small projects, larger projects, and all that kind of thing, but it shows the bandwidth of what
transmission is doing. And we look at the investment profile for transmission, particularly for AEP. It continues to be –
it's just a huge footprint that we are able to invest in from a Transco perspective and from an individual operating
company perspective. And we mentioned this last time, I mean, just the rehabilitation of the existing grid, we're
challenged to keep up with that, let alone put in additional enhancements. And we really want to do that because it
improves the quality of service, ultimately, to our customers. And so, we have a lot of runway left relative to
transmission; no question about it.
<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: That's helpful. And switching back to Clean Power Plan, after we see the final rule from
EPA, could you just talk about sort of the process overall. I know you have a bunch of states, a bunch of things to think
through, but how should we think about how you might respond over time in terms of what that will mean for your
overall spending plan, how the grid will look, make the power plant, et cetera? Can you just talk a little bit at a high
level as to how we should see that unfold for you?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Sure, Stephen. Obviously, it depends upon what that final rule looks like. If you look at the
categories – I mean, if you're having to adjust natural gas dispatch versus coal dispatch, for example, that's one thing.
That ultimately impacts the fuel cost to customers as a result, when you do that kind of switching. But in terms of
infrastructure, we made the point – our initial approach to this is going to be: we get the final rule, and if the EPA is
fully aware of the issues involved from a reliability standpoint, but also from a implementation standpoint, and if they
wind up being respectful to the states, of the resource process that they go through, and allow time for that to occur, and
targets are more rational instead of – 11 states have over 75% of their requirement in 2020 and in several – many states
there's over 50% of their requirement in 2020.
That has to change. It's too early and it's too aggressive in emission reduction targets. So if they come off of that and
have a rational plan to allow technology to continue to improve, and we can actually wind up at a better place at the end
of the day in 2030, that'd be a good outcome. And in that case, we could be able to work with the states because they
obviously care about what we think in terms of reliability standpoint and the infrastructure to be put in place and how
quickly we can do it and that kind of thing.
But it is the state's plans and the states have to have time to review those plans, and then we start taking actions based
upon where our individual states want us to go. So it really – in my mind, it depends upon, certainly, the President,
because the President is driving the bus on this thing. And the EPA, obviously, is looking at all the issues involved.
And if there's moderation associated with the targeted implementation and being respectful of the state processes that
need to occur and the infrastructure, the timing of infrastructure, and having reliability provisions that make sense, then
we can get about the process of investing.
From an AEP perspective, we're in the middle of a transformation, anyway. The industry is in the middle of a
transformation. We've already reduced our carbon emissions by 15% since 2005. So – and that process is continuing
with the advent of natural gas, shale gas activity, the advent of renewables. We're putting in solar. We're doing wind
farms, but energy efficiency and battery technologies are coming into play as well. So there's real opportunities for us
to invest in the right things for the future and actually balance out our energy portfolio, which is a good thing for this
company and the country, as a matter of fact.

<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: That makes a lot of sense. And assuming that, again, the EPA rule does give you a
realistic path, as you pointed out, instead of a path that's really – you surely couldn't achieve, if it is realistic, should we
be thinking about sort of resource plans that could be filed and overall plans over time that you would submit that
would lay out how you see the best path forward and what that would involve in terms of spend and asset mix?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah, that's right. That's right. We'd be working with the states to file the resource plans,
and then we'd start the actions associated with it. And this is a little different than the Mercury Rule. The Mercury Rule
is point specific, plant specific, so you knew exactly what you need to do. This has got tentacles in many aspects of the
electricity utility business itself and it will take some dialogue – some serious dialogue and contemplation of how to
address these types of issues from a state jurisdictional perspective; and we'll be a part of that process. We will file our
resource plans and we'll go from there, just like we always have.
<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.
<Q - Steven Isaac Fleishman>: Yeah, hi. Good morning. Good morning, Nick. You referred a couple times to the
2016 risk adjusted assumptions. Could you just kind of clarify exactly what you mean by that?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah. When you go into forecasting a year, you're looking at what load's doing; and
obviously load's moving around on us. The customer mix is moving around on us. Capacity auctions were
contemplated, whether PPAs would occur during that period of time, and then, of course, looking at any transmission
investment and those kinds of things that we need to evaluate. Those are important pieces, but I think probably – and
the only thing we can do is sort of come up with a plan and a budget that risk-adjusts many of these items; and some of
them are externally driven, significant external driven, like the capacity auctions and the PPA approach in Ohio.
So, as we go forward in the year, we obviously like to get more information that we can really make a quality forecast
of what 2016 looks like. I think we made a lot of progress because we know what we've done relative to the continuous
improvement enhancements that have occurred, that have crescendoed over time, and we expect that to inure to our
benefit during 2016. But these external items are more difficult to tell, and really what happened last night is just
another indication of how things can get adjusted at the last minute. So it's difficult to tell, but I think in the next two
months to three months we're going to probably see a lot of clarity.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: And even with all those factors that Nick mentioned, Steve, we are still, as we look at 2016,
inside the operating earnings guidance range that we'd given for that previously of $3.45 to $3.85 a share.
<Q - Steven Isaac Fleishman>: Okay, and is this – part of this kind of trying to judge how much you need to manage
cost and move stuff around depending on how these play out? Is that also kind of what you're referring to?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, we've been moving costs from 2016 into 2015 and 2014, and now
we're reaching sort of the point of conclusion where we understand those cost components going into the year. It really
is about load forecast and, certainly, these external issues that we're dealing with, but those will play themselves out
here in the next couple of months.
<Q - Steven Isaac Fleishman>: Okay. And then, just – maybe this is a bit of a commentary and a question, but just – I
know you continue to focus very much on the auction outcomes and, to maybe a lesser extent, PPAs in Ohio for the
decision on generation, but there are like a lot of other things that affect the value of the portfolio: commodity prices,
stock market, financing conditions, all those kind of things.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Right.
<Q - Steven Isaac Fleishman>: So I just – how much do you just need – how are you weighing kind of answers to that
– some of these questions versus just there can be periods of time where it's just hard to get transactions done?

<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah. So, obviously, the interest rate environment we continue to deal with, and certainly
what Janet Yellen is trying to do with interest rates in the future might have an impact. But as far as the sector itself and
our performance within that sector, we feel very good about the path that we're taking; and that is to take risk out of our
business and to make sure that we are able to invest in those things that provide quality returns to our shareholders.
And, I mean, that's what we control. And we have to be very disciplined at it and there may be external things that
occur around the world or nationally that could impact it, but typically, though – even if you look at commodity prices,
I think where we're at right now is, like I said earlier, somewhat of a tenuous economy because we see residential,
commercial, industrial moving back and forth all during the year and it's like you're in a waiting stage.
Now, who knows what's going to happen here, but you could have an energy economy take off or you can have an
energy economy that stagnates but that's based on public policy, whether we do exporting, whether we do other things
that would have an impact on the commodities themselves. And I think it's important for us to be knowledgeable about
those kinds of issues so that we can manage our business around no regrets investment that are meaningful to our
shareholders that provide consistent returns. And that's what we're doing.
<Q - Steven Isaac Fleishman>: Great. Last question, just the page with the credit metrics, particularly the FFO to debt
or the EBITDA metrics, clearly shows you're way stronger than your targets. Can you maybe give some thought on
kind of what's the ultimate goal? I'm assuming your goal is not to stay dramatically above the targets?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: It's to be within those targets, Steve, and part of that rationale is why we increased the CapEx
for the balance of the year. And, of course, we'll be looking at what we expect those metrics to be in 2016 and adjusting
our CapEx forecast, accordingly.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: A lot of this is about making sure that the business is on firm and sound financial footing so
that we can make continual judgments about where we put our capital. And we have this huge hedge out there, called
Transmission, that we are able to essentially do acquisitions all the time and it's a good place to be. But at the same
time, we improve our currency value; we improve our position from a risk tolerance perspective. And it is an
opportunity for us to reposition this company for the future. And we just retired 5,500 megawatts of coal-fired
generation. So you're starting to see a rebalancing of the portfolio to address what customers truly want in terms of
resources. We believe a balanced set of resources is important, including coal, but we've got to get through the process
of ensuring that we're advancing from the other technologies and addressing customers' concerns relative to the quality
of service; and that's what we're doing.
<Q - Steven Isaac Fleishman>: Great, that makes sense. Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. We'll now go to the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Good Morning. How are you?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Just fine.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Can you – the $200 million of incremental transmission capital, how is that going to be divided
between Holdco and the other utilities?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: About $80 million of that is going to go to the Transco and the remainder is going to go to
the Integrated Utility operating companies.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Thanks. Can you just give a little more flavor as to what went better than planned to allow you
to raise guidance at this point in the year?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Yeah, I think we covered that during the meat of the call, to a large degree. Rate increases
and weather were stronger than what we had forecasted. The regulated businesses are doing very well and the

competitive businesses are doing about as well as last year. Cash flow is ahead of expectations. And you put all those
things together and that gives us the confidence to raise the operating earnings guidance and raise the CapEx that we
talked about.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: And the continuous improvement activities that are starting to culminate across the board.
So it's cost control. It's certainly – the underlying fundamentals of the business are very positive and it gives us the
confidence to raise the earnings [ph] fees (50:10).
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator
Next we'll go to the line of Gregg Orrill with Barclays.
<Q - Gregg Gillander Orrill>: Yeah, thank you. Can you talk about the scale of the open position at AEP Generation
Resources as you look out over the next few years, or how to think about that as a sensitivity?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Yeah. So, Gregg, they're trying to stay in a hedged position of about 60% to 70%, and I think
they've done that to pretty good effect, really, since early last year when the business started. And that allows them to
do a couple of things. It allows them to hedge in what some of the earnings are going to be at prices that they find
attractive, and they do that through both retail, the wholesale auctions that they have to serve SSO load, and their
normal trading activity. But then it also leaves them with an open position to take advantage of what could be higher
prices like they had during the polar vortices of last year. We were able to take advantage of that and to cover things
like unit outages or price – or load spikes or price spikes that can happen in the short-term period. So they don't want to
be sold out, fully committed. They want to have a significant portion hedged and a portion to cover some unexpected
short-term opportunities.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Chuck and his team continually evaluate that, but the 60% to 70% has been pretty much a
target for – well, actually for a very long time now. And, it's for that reason – I mean, we're just sort of risk averse from
that standpoint, because that business is really focused on making sure that it continues to be an airtight business that
has – like I said earlier, he's done a great job of compartmentalizing the risk and that's a part of that ability for them to
do that.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: The assets that Chuck has in that business are great assets and the risk management they have
applied to that business has been phenomenal through some really pretty volatile circumstances over the last year and
half. So we're really proud of the way they're managing that business and they've done it to very, very good effect
financially.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Really, when we look at it, it's not internally what the issues are, because we can control
what happens relative to how our generation operates from an operational excellence perspective and how we manage
risk within that envelope. The real issue is what happens outside, with the regulatory commissions, FERC, Ohio and
elsewhere. But, certainly, yesterday was another indication. I mean, the market is moving toward a certain set of
conditions for the auction and it gets changed at the eleventh hour. And that's a concern, because you never know what
the rules of the game are and they can change at the last minute or change afterwards; and that's troubling. So I think
consistency – we have consistency internally; it's consistently externally that we need.
<Q - Gregg Gillander Orrill>: So is it presumptuous to say that you're bullish about power prices?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: I wouldn't say that's presumptuous. I mean, I really believe we've taken a substantial amount
of capacity that's been retired and we believe that capacity process will improve.

And we'll now go to the line of [ph] Paul Fuhrman with Nexus (55:01). Your line is open.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Good morning, [ph] Paul (55:05).
<Q>: Good morning. I guess I just wanted to sort of follow up on the PECO decision yesterday to give further
consideration at some point in the future of your re-hearing request in the OVEC proceeding?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Yeah, it just looks like it's some continued delay, really. We don't seem to be getting answers,
schedules or the things that we need to be able to get the answers that we're looking for. And they seem to be punting
some of these decisions farther out into the future and, as Nick said, we need some clarity and we don't seem to be
getting it.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: I don't know how far you can delay these things. I mean, it's an issue where there needs to
be an answer and I'm just concerned that we're either waiting till after the capacity auctions or whatever. But Ohio
needs to be concerned about – and just yesterday was another indication of, if you're going to depend upon – from the
federal side to address the market issues, that changes will occur that you may not anticipate. And I think, from a
generation perspective, we've got to make sure that Ohio continues to develop and, certainly with the natural gas out
there, that nothing is going to happen until there is some resolution. So you're sort of in a hold pattern. We're not going
to make any investments in central station generation in Ohio, and I haven't seen many others step up to the plate. I
know there is maybe one or two units that are being built out there, but keep in mind you've retired thousands and
thousands of megawatts and you're short in Ohio. And so, the delays need to come to an end.

<Q - Brian J. Chin>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Brian, how are you?
<Q - Brian J. Chin>: Good. Just a brief one on your earlier balance sheet comments. Clearly, the metrics are looking a
little better. Debt to cap numbers have started to turn around; even the pension funding numbers look really solid.
Given all of that, does it make sense on the margin to reconsider capital deployment towards maybe looking at the
dividend policy as opposed to purely looking at transmission CapEx; any sort of like marginal changes there to think
about?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: The real question is: what happens to the dividend? Is that...
<Q - Brian J. Chin>: Okay. In so many words, yes.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah. So usually we review the dividend policy in the October timeframe, and our board
certainly will be considering the dividend policy. And we still maintain our 60% to 70% range that we stated earlier,
and that dividends will be commensurate with what the earnings profile looks like. So we stand by that. There's no
reasons to see it will change, but obviously we look at the baseline of the business and what the forward long-term view
of it looks like; and the board will reevaluate, and do that in the October timeframe.
<Q - Brian J. Chin>: Great, thanks a lot. The rest of my questions were asked and answered.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Okay, thanks.
Operator
Thank you. We'll go to the line of Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies.
<Q - Anthony C. Crowdell>: Hey, good morning. I guess this is a real softball question, but do you think Governor
Kasich's entry into the race slows decisions down in Ohio? It looks like we've really being punting. I don't know what
the end game is or where they're looking to punt to, but do you think this slows things down or speeds things up or has
no impact?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: My bet would be no impact, because Governor Kasich obviously has confidence in the
Commission and certainly Andre Porter, as Chairman, has taken over there and my belief is that he is going to leave it
to the Commission to decide what this Ohio policy looks like. So I don't see his running for office of the President to
slow things down. But I guess the real question is will the PECO actually speed up? And that's something that they
need to address.
<Q - Anthony C. Crowdell>: Do you think they're waiting for like – Brian had used a football metaphor: they keep
punting. I mean, are they punting to a certain calendar date or a certain time, whether its PJM is all resolved or
something? Is that their target, or it's not really sure?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah, only they can answer that, and I think to have – it's one thing to have one delay, but to
have delays of several cases occurring, that's really not a good message. And to set energy policy in this state, you've
got to have the courage to step up and make decisions.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Anthony, we'd love to see them score a touchdown or a field goal rather than punt again.
<Q - Anthony C. Crowdell>: So would I. Thank you.

<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Good morning, Ali.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Good morning. Nick, I just wanted to make sure I heard your original commentary correctly with
regards to your thinking on the generation business. So this, as you say, with Ohio PPA decision have been punted,
most likely now we are looking at that maybe in 2016. But if I am hearing you right, should we still expect your final
decision on the merchant business this year – in the remaining months of this year, or is that also going to be dependent
on when this PPA rider stuff now comes out?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: You know, I think, certainly, the capacity performance and the base residual auctions are a
significant piece of that discussion. We're going to have to see – I mean, we're going to have to see what the lay of land
is, you know, after that's concluded to, obviously, visit with our board and determine what the next steps are, but, you
know, that doesn't stop us from pushing ahead with the PPA proposals regardless of the outcome; but certainly I think
Ohio can send a great message by approving those PPAs, but it remains to be seen whether we are going to actually
wait, because this can't go on, you know, for a long time.
We're after certainty for our investors, and from a shareholder perspective we can't have this overhang because it really
not only confuses us on how to invest in the unregulated generation or lack of investment, but it also – it's so
convoluted that it's difficult to understand exactly what it is you have in terms of valuation of that generation. And so,
you know, the steps being taken, particularly with the Clean Power Plan and other things that are occurring, I think
those units are going to survive the Clean Power Plan because they're absolutely needed. They're great units and they're
two-thirds coal, one-third gas, and a lot of fuel switching occurs between coal and gas. So they're valuable units, but
they just need to be reflected that way. And I just think it's something we've got to get a handle on.
Now, as far as timing is concerned, we want to make that decision because – as quickly as we possibly can. But we
have to do what's right for the shareholders, and we have to do an analysis based upon what we can determine the best
we can what the value of that generation on a forward basis is going to be. And so, if you get a great capacity
performance number, then that may diminish the need for a PPA. But I still think a PPA is needed because it's an
important part of the hedging for customers in Ohio and it's an important part of that generation being maintained in
Ohio with the jobs, taxes and everything else I talked about.
So we're not going to – we have not and will not give up on the PPA approach with the Commission. They need to
answer that question. It'd be great if they answered it relatively quickly so we could get on with the business at hand,
but you know, certainly, the – those two items are still outstanding and we're hopeful that at least one of them will get
resolved here very quickly so that we can start filling in the blanks.
<Q - Ali Agha>: And from a logistics point of view, Nick, there would be no constraint for you to exit the merchant
business while this PPA rider application was still outstanding?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: We don't believe there is a constraint, because the real value of the PPA is, again, to
maintain that generation in Ohio and make sure that economically they're still there, and – regardless of the outcome of
the disposition of that business.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Got it. And last question, is it fair to assume that – and, you know, previously you had looked at sale
and spin-off as two trajectories. Is sale now looking like a more likely outcome than spin-off? Is that fair to say?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: We don't know that, yet. I mean, we've obviously got to look at things like the tax efficiency
and other parameters before you can really make a decision on sale versus spin or, for that matter, keep. But, certainly,
sale and spin, which you mentioned, those are areas where we just have to look at the economics, and it depends on
what, you know – I mean, you've got to be offered a sale price that overcomes the tax efficiency of a spin, and there's
other things involved with it from a business perspective as well. So, I would say both are still part of the decision
process.
<Q - Ali Agha>: That's true. Thank you.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah.

Thank you. We'll go to the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Hi, can you hear me?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah, Julien. How are you doing?
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Hey, not too bad, thanks. Good morning. A quick question, if you will. I wanted to get
some clarity here around transmission spending. PJM's been evaluating a reduction in their load forecast, but from what
I understand you all are investing below the RTEP level as in its basic transmission investments at a lower kV. How do
you think about the impact of potential reduction in the PJM load forecast relative to your investment plans near term
and long-term, especially in the context of having more proceeds from any prospective sale of the River Ops or Genco,
et cetera?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: I don't know if anybody knows what the load forecast is at this point, and certainly don't
know the level of investment needed from a transmission perspective because we are in the process of redefining this
electric grid. And we have retirements that have occurred. A lot of the transmission has been built because of the
retirements, but also there continues to be optimization across the grid as a result. And there will be more optimization
after the Clean Power Plan gets resolved. But the changes occurring within PJM now are more about generation and,
certainly, reliability and less so about load. And so, I would – actually, I wouldn't put much context in terms of a
forward-looking transmission plan. And we've seen over and over how transmission plans change with varying degrees
and sometimes we get irritated by that because we plan transmission and – like path, and things happen. So, it's – but if
you look at the underlying fundamentals of transmission, the grid's changing dramatically. The flows on the grid are
going to change dramatically. So when you look at the bulk power transmission system, you can be bullish about that.
And then, the underlying, which you mentioned, the lower kV levels, the sub transmission and those levels, there is a
massive amount of rehab work and follow up work to the bulk power transmission that needs to be done. So – and we
happen to have the largest transmission system in the country, so that bodes well for the investment potential for AEP.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Perhaps just to clarify, if you will, in the increase in transmission spend of late and
just thinking about the sensitivity if there were to be a shift in the RTEP, it seems that you guys have historically had
some element of comfort around your projections given that they don't primarily seem to flow out of the RTEP process.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: That's right.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: If you could elaborate on that a little bit, just getting some sense of how hedged are
you, presumably, to changes either way in the RTEP?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah, we have a bunch of big buckets and a lot of those big buckets are not RTO dependent.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Our transmission spend and forecast is not dependent on an RTEP load forecast.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: That's what I wanted to hear. All right, thank you.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: And I'd – yeah. I wouldn't put a lot of stock in an RTEP load forecast anyway, so...

<Q - Paul Patterson>: Just a quick couple ones. First of all, with the transition auctions have you guys heard from
PJM or do you guys have any idea when the new schedule might be or when we might get more information on that?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah, we'll know soon. I think, certainly, PJM will have to speak about the ins and outs of
that, but we suspect – I mean, it will be maybe a month – three weeks or a month delay, something like that, because
it's not – I don't think it's a substantial thing. They still have to observe the same performance criteria when they bid in,
so I think it shouldn't be a large delay.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Do you think it might be before the BRA?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: I don't know about that.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah. I mean, they're going to have to answer that, obviously, but I don't think we're talking
about moving into fourth quarter or anything.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Let's hope not.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Yeah, famous last words. Anyway, going on, just another quick one for you. In terms of the
potential asset sale or spin, would you guys be open to the idea of accepting another entity's currency, like a stock deal?
I mean, I would assume you guys would prefer cash if you were to sell the Genco, but would you guys be open to the
idea of maybe taking the equity of a whatever, one of the players out there that's been acquiring these things?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Paul, as this point as we're evaluating this, I think everything would be on the table. We
wouldn't say no to that if we felt that was the highest value for our shareholders.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah, I think we haven't closed off on any of these parameters that we keep talking about
because, frankly, we don't have the full answers yet, right? So...
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Right, I got you; makes sense. And then, just on the delays that have been happening in Ohio,
et cetera, do you sense any change in tone or issues that have come up that – you know, just any flavor as to sort of the
environment there with respect to this, or is it sort of kind of regulatory – sort of just the regular regulatory stuff that
happens in a lot of sort of major proceedings that are not exactly run of the mill?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah. I mean, obviously the PECO will have to speak for itself on that issue, but it is – I
mean, it is a major issue. You can't get around that. So I'm sure, you know, there is a lot of deliberations occurring over
in their camp and, you know, it's just part of the regulatory process. But many times I think it's important for policy
makers to understand the business disruptions that occur relative to either waiting for decisions or not making
decisions, let alone the wrong decisions, but we really do need some consistency and delivering on the orders and the
rulings on a timely basis. I think it's particularly important to the industry and particularly important to the electric
utilities in Ohio.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay, but there – but you haven't noticed any significant shift, I guess, or any change in what's
going on there other than the sort of normal back and forth and what have you, or have you?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: I don't think there's been a significant shift or anything. I think there's a lot of dialogue
going on. I know we had dialogue going on these issues in the Ohio Business Roundtable and the Columbus
Partnership and, of course, at the Commission as well. And it is an important issue, but I haven't sensed a change. I
think it's just a very deliberative approach.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay, great; really appreciate it.

Thank you. The final question, then, will come from the line of Raymond Leung with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Raymond Leung>: Hey, Nick and Brian, thanks for everything today. I think we touched a lot on PJM and PPA,
so – but maybe if I could switch over to transmission back again, can you talk about what you guys are thinking, any
update on potential alternative structures? I know last time you talked about the REIT structure doesn't make sense for
you guys. Any updated thought process on that?
And then a second non-related question, can you talk a little bit about what you're – I know demand looked pretty good
on a normalized basis. Any additional more insight maybe, you know, with respect to usage patterns, what you guys are
seeing there, what sort of – aside from just the general economy improving that it is driving the growth or demand
improvement there?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah, I'll just let Brian cover the economy piece of it, but as far as transmission is
concerned we haven't changed our approach to the transmission business. We're still heavily investing in it and we still
want to make sure that we continue to do it in a positive way from a state perspective. So we haven't changed our
approach from that perspective. Brian?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Yeah, I think the other thing...
<Q - Raymond Leung>: There is no consideration of REIT structure? Sorry.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Not at this point.
<Q - Raymond Leung>: Okay.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: So I think on the customer usage side a large part of what's driving residential, in particular,
is customer accounts. We're seeing average customer usage hanging in there. We're not seeing it decrease to the degree
some others are, but its customer accounts that are really driving that. Yeah, I've been in this job for five and half years,
maybe a little bit more, and I've been talking about 5.3 million customers that whole time. I'm finally thrilled to be able
to say that with rounding its 5.4 million customers. So customer accounts, particularly in the West, helping us out and
it's largely driven by – I guess you asked not to talk about macro factors, but a lot of its shale gas and where the
economies are doing well we're seeing increased usage. In places like Kentucky Power that's being particularly hard hit
by mining shutdowns and the like we're seeing customer counts decrease and usage go down. So it's a – it really does,
unfortunately, follow the macroeconomic factors that we're seeing, and we're blessed to have the shale gas plays in our
service areas and that's really driven a lot of the load increases that we've seen.
<Q - Raymond Leung>: Great, thank you.
<A - Bette Jo Rozsa>: Thanks.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Thanks, Ray.
<A - Bette Jo Rozsa>: Okay.
