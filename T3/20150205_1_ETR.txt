Thank you, Paula, and good morning, everyone. Last year, we told you that Entergy was in a unique position and that's
still true today. We said we had a significant opportunity to invest in and modernize our fleet, strengthen reliability and
meet evolving regulatory expectations and requirements. We said by making these investments, we can both grow our
rate base and keep customer rates low. A strategy supported in part by the industrial renaissance here in the Gulf South.
We said we would manage risk and preserve optionality at Entergy Wholesale Commodities by improving fleet
operations and pursuing stability. We said we'd manage commodity risk and leverage in the inherent volatility of power
prices to our benefit and that of our owners. I'm pleased to say we did all of these things in 2014.
At the Utility, we announced the proposed purchase of the Union Power Station, which would serve four of our
operating companies. In Louisiana, Ninemile 6 came online months early and about $70 million under budget. We
resolved two important rate cases in Mississippi and Texas. And in Arkansas, while we are not where we need to be,
we were granted limited relief in our request for a rate case rehearing.
We completed our first full year of operation in MISO, and it's becoming clear that our projections that customers
would realize savings were correct, validating our regulators' decisions to approve that move. Although the numbers
are still estimates, it now appears that customers across the Utility will, in fact, realize more MISO driven savings than
we had originally expected. We did all this while keeping our rates low, about 20% below the national average across
all of our customer classes.
For the year, we beat our original 1.9% retail sales growth projections by 0.4% coming in at 2.3%. Industrial sales led
the way with 5% growth, beating our estimates of 2.8% by wide margin.
At EWC, we improved operations at our plants, which, even during the coldest days of the polar vortex, we're able to
provide customer with safe, reliable power. And we made significant investments at our FitzPatrick plant to strengthen
reliability even further. At Indian Point, we received an important favorable ruling on CZMA from a New York State
appellate court, and we continue to engage New York State agencies when appropriate and possible.
And particularly, in the first quarter, during periods of market volatility, our risk management and hedging activities
delivered substantial value for our owners. EWC's strong first quarter coupled with that of the Utility resulted in
operational EPS growth of nearly 9% for the year, well above the original guidance we provided in the fall of 2013.
All of these things led to Entergy capturing a top-quartile position on total shareholder return in 2014. We believe this
performance illustrates our commitment to what has been our mission for some time; creating sustainable value for our
owners, customers, employees and the communities that we serve.
As we look to 2015 and beyond, we can say with confidence that the fundamentals driving our business are intact. Of
course, we know that our company faces some challenges in the coming year, and these challenges, including the drop
in power prices, underlay our announcement this morning on 2015 guidance. But Entergy remains on track to deliver
on its objectives. Our strategy remains sound, and we will continue to see us execute on it this year and in the years to
come.
Let me start our discussion about the Utility by saying we continue to believe that, today, Entergy has some of the best
growth fundamentals in the business. We continue to see a need to make productive investments to meet increasing
reliability requirements and to modernize our fleet. We enjoy, and are working hard to strengthen recovery mechanisms
that give us the financial flexibility to make these investments. Again, we expect to do so, while maintaining our rate
advantage both through actions we've taken and despite the drop in oil prices through the continued expansion of our
industrial customer base. 2014 provided ample evidence to support this point of view.
Start with productive investments and the recent actions we've taken. On December 9, we signed an agreement to
acquire Union Power Station near El Dorado, Arkansas. While the agreement is subject to regulatory approval from
three of our operating companies, buying this natural gas fired nearly 2,000 megawatt facility helps us modernize our
fleet and positions our operating companies to meet growing demand including from industrial customers. In Arkansas
and Louisiana, similar to prior acquisitions, these filings also include proposals for timely rate [ph] treatment (06:15).
In Texas, we filed for a CCN Certificate of Convenience and Necessity and plan to file a rate case in the second quarter

to incorporate the Union plant in rates upon closing.
In Louisiana, for the first time in nearly 30 years, the Utility added a self-build power plant to its fleet. We're happy to
say that Ninemile 6 in Westwego began commercial operations in the MISO market on December 24. This plant
provides value to our customers and to our community and is already fully reflected in rates.
In addition, in early June, we announced plans for a major transmission build in Southwest Louisiana. The Lake
Charles Transmission Project with investment of an estimated $187 million will be one of the largest transmission
projects in Entergy history. Again, our aim here is to strengthen reliability and support economic development that is
already occurring in one of the fastest growing regions in the country.
I'll move now to the regulatory arena, where we also made significant progress. In Mississippi, we received more
clarity in early December when the MPSC approved the rate modernization plan, which includes, as you know, a
10.07% benchmark ROE, as well as provisions to strengthen our financial position for making investments.
Importantly, and also in Mississippi, we began implementing the state's first ever Utility-owned solar project, which
will include the installation of three 500-kilowatt ground-mounted solar arrays, not a huge project, but it's an important
way to gauge the viability of solar energy in the state and for us, it's also a good example of how Entergy and our
commissioners have worked together to find common ground.
In Texas, we were the first Utility in the state to take advantage of a Distribution Cost Recovery Rider. We also had
two transmission lines' CCN approved and we filed another for a total investment of approximately $166 million.
In Arkansas, the APSC recently ruled to allow us to recover via retail rates, FERC ordered system agreement payments.
100% of the $71 million requested last June was approved in the PCA Rider. And just last week, we notified the
Arkansas Commission that we will be filing a rate case in the next two months to three months. We believe this rate
case will have a positive outcome and give us financial flexibility to invest in and strengthen our Arkansas portfolio,
which, in turn, should go a long way in helping to drive economic growth and job creation. As you've heard me say
before, constructive engagement with our regulators in Arkansas has been a top priority for us. We think we have an
opportunity to strengthen our efforts in this regard and now it's up to us to do just that.
In New Orleans, the ENOI and the City Council's advisors reached an agreement in principle. This agreement would
allow securitization of the amount necessary to establish $75 million store reserve. It would also allow recovery of
nearly $32 million in capital costs associated with Hurricane Isaac restoration. Funds from this securitization are
expected in May of 2015 and will give Entergy New Orleans the financial resources to restore services if and when
another storm hits.
In Louisiana, the LPSC approved an accelerated gas pipe replacement program to among other things replace about 100
miles of pipe over the next 10 years. The commission also approved a Rider for recovery of approximately $65 million
in investment over 10 years. Rider Recovery will be adjusted quarterly to reflect actual investment occurred for the
prior quarter.
Finally, as I said earlier, we expect to see the industrial renaissance continue. Overall, we see retail sales growth
estimates at 3.25% to 3.75% through 2017. Drew will be giving you more detail about this in a minute.
Entergy Wholesale Commodities also had a strong year capped by a quarter with some important positives. The plants
operated well and we made progress on the license renewal of Indian Point. As most of you know, a New York State
appellate court ruled that Indian Point is grandfathered under the New York Coastal Zone Management program as
such exempt from CZMA review. If permission to appeal is denied or the ruling upheld, a new CZMA determination
would not be required for license renewal.
We also negotiated a standstill agreement with the New York State Department of State, which provides parties a
period of about six months to discuss our recent withdrawal of the CZMA application. While we remain confident in
our legal position to withdraw this application, the agreement is notable because it is evidence of the progress we've
made in engaging in constructive discussions with New York State Agencies. As we have consistently said, Entergy
remains open to discussing a potential settlement that is fair and considers the interest of all parties.

We continue to work through the license renewal process for Indian Point, a plant that supplies on average 25% of the
power for New York City and the Westchester County area. And one that the New York ISO acknowledges is an
essential part of his state's generation portfolio. We also continue to believe Indian Point will operate well into the next
decade.
Another item of note in the fourth quarter was Vermont Yankee, which came offline safely and as planned on
December 29. Remarkably, it did so following its fourth breaker-to-breaker run.
During what was often a difficult time, through hard work and dedication, our VY employees delivered an
extraordinary year. At Entergy, we often say that we're lucky to work with the best in the business. And there can be no
better evidence of this than our people at Vermont Yankee. And for that, they have our sincere thanks.
The VY closure also highlighted market design flaws. While we can't say these flaws were the sole cause of the
closure, it nonetheless brings into stark relief the unintended consequences that unviable market design can have.
Fortunately, we are seeing some progress on [ph] fixes to (12:30) capacity markets, and, certainly, the infrastructure
constraints in the Northeast are attracting more attention.
If this attention translates to sound policies that address these issues, we think that would be good for everyone. One
thing you'll be hearing about this year is energy price formation. Basically, today some ISO market rules and
algorithms in effect suppress prices by not allowing the full cost of the marginal unit to set the clearing price.
In the long run, this will lead to unwarranted plant retirements, resulting in higher cost and more volatility in price and,
ultimately, degradation to reliability. And that won't be good for anyone.
I'll enter EWC discussion with a note on our hedging strategy, which has proven so successful in the past. While we
strive to hedge with asymmetric upsides, to take advantage of our bullish point of view and market volatility, our
hedging portfolio as reflected in our quarterly price sensitivity charts does carry some downside price risk.
Moving forward, we will continue to position our portfolio to capture market upside while maintaining downside risk
protection, always considering product availability, hedging cost and market liquidity. Overall, we think EWC has one
of the best merchant portfolios in the country. Not only are our plants safe and well run, operating at high capacity
factors with few unplanned outages but as we saw last year, all of them play a critical role in their respective regions.
We also believe the EWC fleet is well positioned for growth in part because we see improving fundamentals over time,
including power prices and a constructive outcome on Indian Point. And we intend to continue to strengthen these
fundamentals through our own actions, including disciplined hedging and risk management, as well as diligently
managing the processes for the continued safe operation of our facility.
So, again, Entergy had a strong year. But as proud as we are of that success, it's in the rearview mirror. We are now
focused on the road ahead in achieving our 2015 goals. First and foremost, excellence in safety and operations. We're
pleased that River Bend received its first ever rating of excellence compared to peers, joining both Indian Point and
Waterford 3 in that category. This is an accomplishment that reflects our employees' years of hard work and
commitment. We need to make sure that this level of excellence is maintained and expanded.
At the Utility, we expect to deliver on our significant investment in construction opportunity, even as we work to find
new ways to benefit current and potential customers. I'll note that this includes deployment of renewable energy. In
2015, we'll be taking additional steps to assess its potential cost and performance at several of our operating companies.
And in order to meet evolving customer needs and expectations, we will also look for opportunities to incorporate new
idea and technology.
Working to ensure that we are able to earn our full allowed ROEs in the coming years and across the Utility also
continues to be a priority. Another objective is to receive approval from the Louisiana Public Service Commission to
combine Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana into a single Utility. This move will make it easier for us
to make needed investments in the state's power infrastructure and via expanded rate options, sustain and propel the
state's industrial renaissance.

At EWC, we will continue to focus on positioning the portfolio to unleash its full value and this certainly includes
advancing license renewal efforts at Indian Point. We will continue to advocate for sensible policy frameworks that
recognize the value of our merchant fleet, from environmental to reliability, which we believe will benefit not only our
company, but also the customers and communities we serve.
And finally, all of these actions will support job creation and economic growth in every state, region and community
where we do business. This includes substantial support for schools and universities as well as workforce training
programs, so opportunity is shared with as many people as possible. This is a priority for us. You'll be hearing more
about progress against each of these objectives in the months to come.
Let me conclude with a couple of important points. Today, as you heard me say Entergy has an opportunity to position
our service territory for the future. This means modern, more efficient plants, infrastructure even more reliable than it is
today and the incorporation of new and emerging technologies. For us, this opportunity translates to investment,
particularly, over the next three years to five years. To reiterate, and as we saw in 2014, we have a compelling capital
plan, a regulatory environment that by and large allows us the financial flexibility to deploy it and sales growth that
supports both by keeping rates low.
And in the end, this business is a long-term play. So, short-term, and even mid-term volatility is a fact of life. As we
look to 2015 and beyond, this should not distract us from this company's strong fundamentals, sound strategy and
unique opportunity.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Drew.
Andrew S. Marsh
Thank you, Leo, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will review the financial results for the quarter as well as
highlights from the full year. In addition, I'll discuss the 2015 operational earnings guidance, which we initiated today
and review our 2017 financial outlook.
Starting with slide two, our fourth quarter results for the current year and prior years are shown on as-reported and
operational basis. Note that operational results exclude special items from the decision to close Vermont Yankee, HCM
implementation, and the transmission spin-merge effort terminated in 2013. Operational earnings per share were $0.75
in the fourth quarter of 2014, lower than the dollar per share earned in 2013.
Results by line of business are summarized on slide three. Starting with Utility, operational EPS was $0.61 per share in
the current period compared to $0.86 in the prior period. The Utility continued to realize volume improvement, at 2.4%
weather-adjusted retail sales growth. Excluding the effects of weather, higher volume contributed about $0.03 per share
to the quarter's net revenue increase. Industrial customer class had the strongest gains at 6.7%. About a third of the
industrial growth came from the large chemical segment, which increased 11% quarter-over-quarter, mostly due to the
expansion of the chlor-alkali, of a chlor-alkali customer. We also had solid growth of 4.3% from our petroleum refining
customers, while sales to small industrial customers increased 3.3% as regional producers continue to benefit from a
stronger national economy.
Higher price contributed approximately $0.14 per share, a portion of which was offset by other line items. Despite the
net revenue growth, Utility results declined due largely with three drivers. First, non-fuel O&M was higher as benefits
from our cost management efforts were offset by higher nuclear spending to improve operations, timing of fossil
spending and other increases, such as MISO administrative fees, which were offset elsewhere in the income statement.
Next, we recorded a $0.06 per share write-off because of regulatory uncertainty associated with the resolution of the
Waterford 3 steam generator replacement prudence review. Finally, the Utility's effective income tax rate was higher
due to benefits recorded in 2013.
Moving on to EWC, operational earnings per share of $0.39 were lower than the $0.48 earned the year ago. The low
EBITDA, two key drivers were higher effective income tax rate and lower realized earnings on decommissioning

trusts. EWC EBITDA for the quarter summarized on slide four was $183 million, a $50 million increase from the
fourth quarter of 2013. Increased net revenue was the main driver due primarily to the effects of mark-to-market
activity.
Similar to 2013, we had sales that did not qualify for hedge accounting. Unlike 2013, market price moved down after
those sales were executed and resulted in a positive mark-to-market gain in the fourth quarter of 2014. The net revenue
increase was partially offset by the gain on the sale of District Energy business in the fourth quarter of 2013. Briefly
moving to operating cash flow shown on slide five, OCF was around $1 billion in the current quarter, about the same as
2013.
Now, I'll review the full year results starting on slide six. On an operational basis, 2014 earnings per share end of the
year $5.83, up from $5.36 in 2013 and above our original guidance midpoint of $5, the largest driver for the year with
top-line growth at EWC and the Utility. EWC earnings is benefited from improved operating performance, as well as
our hedging strategy, which, as Leo noted, provide upside opportunity in a higher price environment while balancing
operational credit risks. Utility net revenue reflected rate actions in sales growth, including the effects of weather. The
overall company net revenue growth was partially offset by several items, including a higher effective income tax rate,
Utility write-offs, and the 2013 gain on the District Energy sale.
On slide seven and staying with the full year view, EWC's operational adjusted EBITDA increased almost $400 million
year-over-year, due mainly to the higher net revenue discussed earlier. Our full year operating cash flow performance is
summarized on slide eight. OCF was about $3.9 billion in 2014, up $700 million from the prior period. The primary
full year drivers are higher net revenue and receipt of proceeds to reimburse the Louisiana operating companies for
Hurricane Isaac cost.
I'll now turn the forward-looking information. Slide nine summarizes our 2015 operational earnings guidance, which
we are initiating today with a midpoint of $5.50 and a range of plus or minus $0.40. Our guidance range reflects two
key updates since we talked to you at EEI about our expectations for 2015. First of all, we're now using forward price
curves as of December 31, which are lower than the September 30 forward available at EEI. Since EEI, our revenue
estimates for EWC's nuclear fleet have come down approximately $0.65 per share, including $0.13 for mark-to-market
activity.
Secondly, we have continued to evaluate our income tax positions and our midpoint now reflects an effective tax rate of
approximately 23%. This change is driven by additional anticipated benefits of the Utility compared to expectations
last fall. The precise timing of these benefits is uncertain, but our best estimate right now is that these will be more back
end loaded in the year. Other less significant updates largely offset.
Now, I'll cover few highlights of each of the business segments. Starting with the Utility, the guidance midpoint is
$5.70 per share. Net revenue continues to be an important driver and sales growth accounts for approximately half of
the $0.55 net revenue increase. Our guidance midpoint reflects 2.7% weather-adjusted retail sales growth in 2015,
including 4.4% growth for the industrial class. A portion of the growth percentage change is due to 2014 industrial
sales that were higher than we expected, as well as continued refinement of our 2015 estimates driven in part by timing
adjustments, meaning some customers with delays and some with slower ramp ups.
We also updated some customer-specific forecast for recent utilization trends. In addition, the net revenue increase
reflects expected rate changes. But as we noted last quarter, we don't see regulatory price changes having a material
year-over-year bottom line impact. Below net revenue, Utility O&M will increase because pension expense is now
estimated to be higher than we anticipated at EEI, due primarily to a lower discount rate of 4.27%. The pension
expense changed since EEI increased Utility O&M by approximately $0.06 per share. For taxes, the Utility midpoint
reflects an approximate 23% effective income tax rate in 2015.
Now, let's turn to EWC. EWC's 2015 operational earnings guidance midpoint is $0.70 per share. We've isolated the
year-over-year earnings contribution of Vermont Yankee and is now expected to decline approximately $0.20 per
share.

This is different than our expectation to the EEI of about $0.40 per share, due to lower fourth quarter prices in 2014 and
more earnings on the decommissioning trust as we rebalanced a more conservative stands during the first phase of
decommissioning.
Another driver in EWC's 2015 guidance is higher non-fuel O&M, including higher pension and OPEB expenses as well
as a maintenance outage at RISEC, our CCGT and Rhode Island.
A 2017 outlook is summarized on slide 10. Utility outlook for operational earnings of $1.05 billion to $1.1 billion
remains on track. The foundation for the Utility's growth outlook is at capital investment plan, which is largely
unchanged than EEI.
The next important assumption for the Utility is sales growth, which we anticipate will continue to be robust for 2017.
Our current estimate for the full year compound annual growth rate off a 2013 base year is around a low end of the
range provided at EEI.
Now that 2014 results are in the books, we are updating that disclosure to 3.25% to 3.75%, three-year compound
annual growth rate through 2017 off the 2014 base year and reflecting continued refinement of our expectations.
For EWC, we have an EBITDA outlook of $650 million to $700 million in 2017. As you know, market prices are
volatile and based on December 31 prices, we would not be in that range. However, based on our point of view, we
continue to believe that we can meet our EWC EBITDA expectations for 2017, although we are at the lower end of
those expectations today. Our 2017 outlook for Parent & Other is unchanged as well.
Slide 11 provides a view of the contribution to Utility growth by key industries expanding in our service territory. Over
the last several months, we've seen steep declines in oil prices and many of you have asked us about the potential
impact to our sales growth outlook. There will be some effects on our state economy, particularly on Louisiana and
Texas businesses that support the oil and gas services industry. However, the outlook to our core growth large
industrials remains robust. Key growth segments in the chemical sectors are largely unaffected by oil price decline such
as ammonia, chlor-alkali and industrial gases. Primary metals and wood products are also largely unaffected. These
industries rely on low energy costs and a growing economy to be successful.
Other second order impacts could begin to impinge on petrochemicals, but we have only seen a couple of minor delays
to-date and our customers remain committed to completing the multi-year projects they have started. We have seen
some pullback in specific sectors like gas to liquid facilities, which compete directly with crude based on production oil
pricing. While we would note that oil to gas spreads remain robust, prices are at lower levels with increased volatility,
which has caused some of our customers' investment decisions to be delayed. Still, these customers are not key to our
growth expectation through 2017. In fact, through 2017, the vast majority of our anticipated new or expanding large
industrial customers have passed their final investment decisions or they are under-construction.
As Leo said, 2014 was a good year, but it's now in the past and we still have a lot head of us. We understand that a lot
has changed in the last few months and we know that a lot can happen between now and 2017.
However, based on what we know today, we believe that the Utility's long-term growth proposition is intact and
achievable. We will execute the capital plan and upgrade our infrastructure to better serve our existing as well as our
new customers. At EWC, we will manage around the volatility that's inherent in that business and we work toward
additional clarity on Indian Point, which will give a strategic flexibility and we will continue to focus on safety and
operational excellence throughout the company. We know we have new challenges and we are excited about meeting
them.
And now, the Entergy team is available for questions.

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Michael Weinstein of UBS. You may begin.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Hi, good morning. It's Julien here.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning, Julien.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Good morning, Julien.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: So, I wanted to just dig into the guidance a little bit further here. Can you expand, and
I know you alluded to it already, but what exactly is driving the tax changes? Can you elaborate here a little bit and
what you think about a normalized tax rate would be in subsequent years or just kind of in a generic year?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Julien, this is Drew. That's a good question. If you look back over the last five years, we
have had an operational effective tax rate in the range of what we're talking about. I think corporate wise, it's been
about 26% and at the Utility, it's been about 23%. So, what we're talking about is not unusual in that regard and as we
look forward, this year, when we usually talk about these things, we talk about a portfolio of opportunities and it's still
certainly no different now. We have a portfolio of opportunities that we're looking at in 2015 and by laying it all out
this year upfront, we're trying to give you a better view of what we expect this year. Beyond 2015, certainly, our
expectations continue to be that we will look for opportunities because that is one of the largest items of our income
statement, but just to make sure that we are all clear about what the underlying business expectations are, we haven't –
we put statutory tax rates in for 2016 and our 2017 outlook that we rolled forward today.
So, as far as 2015 goes, like I said, it is a portfolio of opportunities. We have a number of cases that are rolling forward
with various tax authorities and it's based on what our expectations are today. Certainly nothing is guaranteed in that
because there are ongoing discussions, but that's the best estimate that we have today. It could be higher or lower than
that by the end of the year.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: And just relative to the initial guidance, you kind of laid out there, at the time of EEI,
what exactly changed if you could elaborate briefly?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: So, I think it just has to do with some of our expectations about what's going to transpire,
particularly, towards the end of the year. And our desire to make sure that our investors were fully informed about what
the possibilities could be rather than get surprised. Even if it's an upside at the end of the year, we certainly didn't want
to land that in your lap as a surprise.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Great. Excellent. And then just coming back to the other side of the house here on the
EWC front, what are you thinking about sort of or what gives you confidence rather in still having kind of a long-term
bullish perspective; obviously, you have a view on 2017? What are you seeing out there? Is it capacity? Is it energy? I
mean could you elaborate a little bit?
<A - William M. Mohl>: Sure, Julien, this is Bill. A couple things from – in the long run as we look at gas supply,
obviously, we're seeing a huge cutback in drilling, so we think that eventually that will have an impact, a bullish impact
on natural gas prices. As it relates to heat rates, we think that those are also undervalued in the market as you think
about the number of shutdowns, either economic shutdowns or shutdowns due to environmental reasons, we remain
bullish on heat rates. And we are seeing some positive changes in the capacity markets such as what was evidenced
recently this week up in New England.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: All right. Great. Well, thank you, guys.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Thank you.

<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning, Dan.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Good morning.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Hey, if I just kind of look at what you guys did in 2014 and you look at 2015 at the Utility level,
right, and if we back out the beneficial tax rate, 2014 being pretty close to statutory, 2015 being much lower. It looks
like your earnings are a lot closer to flat year-on-year – I know there's always going to be moving parts, but how should
we think about earned ROEs this year for 2015 and then 2016, 2017, how you get to your earned ROEs if that tax rate
does normalize?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: I'll take a first crack at this and then Theo can jump in. So – and I'll let Theo talk about
ROEs. I'll talk about the big drivers for the earnings blocks as – particularly as we move forward. So, I think you're
right in terms of 2014 to 2015, we are not seeing substantial growth because we don't have a lot of rate actions, but as
you look forward certainly this year, we have some significant investment opportunities. We're talking about like
Union Power and those kinds of things that we expect to come on at the end of the year as well as rate opportunities
within Arkansas and Texas. And those are going to be the main drivers that are going to push us forward to sort of the
2016-2017 timeframe. And I'll let Theo talk about the ROEs in particular.
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: Hi, Dan, this is Theo. I mean I think when you look at 2015 ROE, I think you see an
ROE that it's slightly below 10%, not much different from 2014. I think as you've somewhat illuminated on. But I think
as you go forward through 2016 and you look at the things Drew just mentioned earlier, sales growth, the fact that the
Union purchase goes into – plan it into rates in – anticipate it goes in rates in 2016.
And also, you see some changes relative to some of our O&M levels pension cost. I want to mention you'll see those
ROEs start to move as we have said many times that EEI and other venues in the 10% to 11% range in 2016.
As you look at the various operating companies, we see ourselves making constructive progress at Arkansas as it
relates to moving towards the allowed ROE as a result of 2015 plant rate case and other actions in Arkansas. The
growth that we see in Louisiana, we'll move our Louisiana utilities. I think when you look at it on a combined basis,
you will see that company at within its earnings band range based on its 1995 allowed ROE.
And I think as you look to Mississippi, New Orleans, we see those companies also earning at their allowed ROEs when
we get into the 2016 timeframe. Texas gets closer, we'd see growth in Texas as well and also we would, because of the
Union acquisition, we'll have a rate case in Texas to move forward with that and so, we'll see some – likely see some
rate change in Texas as well. So, all of that, as you look across the jurisdictions, we moved closer, but those that aren't
at that point today, they move closer to or get to their allowed ROE and, overall, as we've said over the past few months
and now you see Utility business that's in a 10% to 11% ROE range.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: So, I guess, thank you for that Theo. But, if you think about kind of next year and beyond
effectively the $0.95 of tax that you presumably could go away next year, you're thinking that the Texas case, the
Arkansas case and putting Union in a rate base should more than compensate for that headwind. Is that the way if
you're going to simply balance things out?
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: Yeah. I think you see the right actions and, again, as well as I think we'll see some O&M
impacts as well as we go into 2016.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Okay. And I guess one dumb question. If the discount rate stays at the same level, was is it
ended of last year? What happens to pension expense beyond 2015? As you say, catch up year or would it stay at these
levels, so that would be flat year-over-year comp?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: No – that's an excellent question. No, it would actually; it would go up. So, we build our
forecasts with a interest rate increases as the market tells us in mind, and mark-to-market, if you will, it's not exactly
like a mark-to-market, but it's similar. And so, we're anticipating interest rate rises, which should mean lower pension
liabilities, which will mean lower pension expense. And so, right now, we are anticipating in 2017, a 5% discount rate
on a pension liability and as I mentioned that's 4.27% is where we ended the year. So that would be somewhere in the

neighborhood of about $0.20 of earnings, $0.20 to $0.25 of earnings per share impact if we were sort of flat to where
we are today versus our expectations for 2017.

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. You may begin.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Good morning.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning, Paul.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Just on the 2015 guidance, you guys mentioned that there's an increase in depreciation and
decommissioning for 2015 and you talked about, I just wonder if you could just review that a little bit in terms of
what's driving the increase in depreciation expense and decommissioning at the wholesale business at the non-regulate
business?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Okay. This is Drew. So, I mean I think it's due to just normal activities. The depreciation is
the higher – is the capital investment that we've made at EWC in 2014. And then the decommissioning expense is, as
we get closer to the end of these lives, particularly, as you shorten up your expectations that decommissioning expense
is going to rise naturally as you go out that direction. So, I think it's just the normal expectations based on capital
investment and shortening life of the assets.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: So the capital investment that you're making, the actual plant value of the nuclear plants is
increasing as the lifespan of the plant is decreasing, is that correct?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Certainly, from a GAAP accounting perspective that you're seeing, largely, you're growing
the asset base still right now and it is as you are getting to a shorter life expectancy, you're having that greater
depreciation, yes.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: And we should expect that to continue going forward?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Yes. Yeah. I mean, well, like you said, last year, I think or maybe just two years ago, we did
a depreciation study to try and balance it out a little bit. So, it's less dramatic than it would have been before. But...
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Right.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: ...certainly, you will see some of that still going forward, yes.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question is from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley. You may begin.
<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: Good morning.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning, Stephen.
<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: I wanted to discuss a hedging strategy from here. And just given the environment that
we're in and your point of view, would you want to be a bit more cautious in terms of hedging in the expectation of
improving heat rates et cetera or how do you think about sort of your hedge philosophy at this point?

<A - William M. Mohl>: Stephen, this is Bill. Well, absolutely we think about that. So, given the point of view that we
just discussed earlier, as we look into the outer years, we want to be very careful about the products that we use. So,
that we – not necessarily really interested in a lot of fixed price products at this point in time.
So, we look to move more towards structured products that have that asymmetric upside. Obviously, that depends on a
lot of things, counter parties, cost of the products, et cetera. But we are carefully looking at that strategy as we speak,
specifically, as it relates to 2016 and 2017.
<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: Okay. And just shifting to Indian Point, specifically, there is a recent, I guess, a state
ruling regarding just the hearing process around potential summer shutdowns for tax efficient Hudson River. Could you
give us a sense of just procedurally that the process, through which that hearing will take place, just so we can try to
focus on next steps and understand that process?
<A - William M. Mohl>: Sure. That ruling just did come out this week. So, kind of from a high level perspective by
February 20. Riverkeeper and the staff needs to make some recommendations, as it relates to, specifically, what it
thinks. It would like to recommend in terms of the outages that will go through the normal discovery process, probably
more or less throughout the summer. And then, in the fall, we will actually have a hearing on the issues of outages, and
then hope to get some initial replied briefs by the end of the year.
<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: Okay. And then, in terms of after the reply briefs, what would the step after that?
<A - William M. Mohl>: Well, depending on what happens there then you would work through an appeal process, et
cetera. To kind of sum it up, Stephen, I mean we think this process probably goes on for several years before you get
any final determination.
<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: Oh I see. So, there could be a decision late in the year or early next year, but then there
will be – there could be various appeals after that.
<A - William M. Mohl>: That's correct.
<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: Okay. Thanks very much.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Thank you, Stephen.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank. You may begin.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Good morning guys.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning Jonathan.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: One quick question on: when you gave the sensitivity on interest rates, and the
discount rate just now on the pension, so I think it was $0.20 impact on 2017 if the discount rates increase did not
materialize, is that a holistic estimate including, your exposure to short-term debt or is that just the pension?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: That was just the pension and I was trying to do math on the fly. I tried to widen my range
out a little bit. But I think $0.08 is our rule of thumb on 25 basis points. So $0.20 to $0.25 is probably a better estimate
for that, but, yes, it doesn't include the interest rate offset.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Okay. And the second point was, I was just curious on your – you have the slides with
the 2017 point of view, but you also have the 2018, 2019 disclosures in Table seven of the release. Can you share with
us what capacity price was embedded in that for the option that just happened? Yeah, you did...
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: You're talking about for ISO New England?

<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Yeah, I am guessing it wasn't updated overnight, but it might have been your point of
view that was in there?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: I think it is in our point of view. So, you know that the option results for both Pilgrim and
RISEC came back for the SEMA zone at about 1108 KW for that option.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Right. Is that what was in your Table here?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: I think it's fairly close to what we had. I mean I think we had talked about that. We anticipated
it would be [ph] net coned (46:35).

<A - Leo P. Denault>: Thank you, Jonathan.

Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. You may begin.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Hey, guys, can you talk to us a little about your plans in Arkansas. You've hinted at times
about trying to seek legislative relief. Just trying to think about the timing of trying to do that and what type of relief or
what type of mechanism should like to seek versus the timing and process for a potential full blown rate case there?
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: Yeah, Mike. Well, this is Theo. I mean I guess I'll start with, we believe in Arkansas.
We're starting from a common goal, common goal with those that are in state, we believe with commissioners as well
as state local officials, which is really about attracting jobs, supporting economic development, growth and regional
prosperity in the state.
When you think about legislative actions that we've talked about, and we said this before. The legislature is currently in
session now in Arkansas. And any legislative actions would clearly go through the legislative processes within the
current session. In terms of the different, what may be a part of that, I think as we said before, we would be looking at
mechanisms that would align Arkansas with some mechanisms we see in other jurisdictions across our service area.
Things like, for instance, FRP, FRPs, maybe similar to what we saw in Mississippi that has various forward-looking
elements that recently came out of the Mississippi case. And also, I think one thing we would look to try and address in
Arkansas is really given the commission some criteria, other than kind of a simple DCF method to determine ROE. I
mean really this is really about giving the commissioners some, I think, more tools in a toolbox, sort of really giving
them various options they can look at, again, in a different way at Arkansas that would help achieve the common goal
that I talked about earlier. So, with the legislative session going on from a timing perspective, I would expect that we'd
follow some legislation around us and around these various components in the next few weeks in Arkansas.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it. So, we should probably think that any rate filings wouldn't happen until after the
legislative session closes. So, kind of thinking about a mid-year case that implies a mid-year 2016 revenue change?
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: Well, I think if you look – I mean, honestly, Leo mentioned in his opening comments
that we did provide notice that we would a file case in Arkansas, I believe in 60 days to 90 days. So – and we did that at
the end of January. If you count from that point in time, you're sometime in March-April timeframe in terms of filing a
case. And given the statutory timelines in Arkansas that would probably put you with, if I'm doing my math correctly in
my head, a rate effective timeline somewhere at the beginning potentially of 2016.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it. Okay. Thank you. Much appreciated.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Great. Thanks, Michael.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Charles Fishman of Morningstar. You may begin.
<Q - Charles J. Fishman>: Thank you. Leo, you made comments concerning the way the board would look at the
dividend in 2016 at EEI. If I take slide 10 on your 2017 outlook, the way I understood those comments at EEI, I should
look at the Utility, net income, your outlook, less Parent & Other. And it appears to me you're probably, by 2017,
you're getting close to the payout range you want to be in. Is that a fair assessment that the board and the way the board
would look at it?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Yeah. When we – I think even when we were talking back at EEI, the view is that we'll start to
have the conversation with the board when we start to look at 2016 and 2017's results. If you look – and you're exactly
right. What we're talking about this the payout ratio around Utility combined with Parent & Other, as the dividend
paying entity that we would be looking to, excluding EWC, of course, given the volatility associated with that kind of
business. But, as we start to look at what 2016 and 2017 hold and what those combined earnings will be, we think that
that's when the conversation begins with the board.
As we've mentioned that a lot factors will go into that in addition to just what those earnings levels are. So, for
example, the investment profile, what's going to happen in terms of our investments in the Utility in 2016 and 2017 and
if it makes sense to reinvest versus the dividend or raise the dividend because we have the growth path there. So, you're
right about the metrics and like I said the timing would show up right around the – as we look at the 2016 and 2017
earnings profile.
<Q - Charles J. Fishman>: Okay. Thanks for the additional color. That's it.

Thank you. Our last question is from Andy Levi of Avon Capital. You may begin.
<Q - Andrew Levi>: Hi. Good morning, guys.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning, Andy.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Good morning.
<Q - Andrew Levi>: Hey, just a few questions, I'll keep it at to two, two and a half. Just back on the taxes, I guess, the
concern I have that it is about $0.90 of earnings power. So, if you kind of back that out, 2015 actually looks kind of
weak. And so, I'm just kind of want to understand your thinking on that and why that is the case because if you kind of
just put a Utility multiple on it, it's quite a bit of value, $10, $15 of value in the stock. And then I have a follow-up.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Okay, Andy. This is Drew. And I think the way we're thinking about it is 2015 is sort of a
foundation year for the growth opportunity that we have over the next couple years. And as we look at it, I mean we're
really focused on making sure that we put the building blocks in place for making that 2017 aspiration. Taxes are a big
piece of what we do every day and we manage them as well as we can, like every other line item on the income
statement. And like I said earlier, it's not out of line with where we have been in terms an effective tax rate over the last
five years. So, we think this is part of our normal operating procedure and this year, it's – there's a couple of lumpy
items in there that are helping us get there. But this is part of our expectation and what we expect to do every day when
we come to work.
<Q - Andrew Levi>: No, I understand that, but again, I'm not going to debate it with you, but if you go back to your
Regulation G disclosures, your statutory tax rate's 36%. So, I'm just trying to look at the true earnings power longer
term of the company. The follow-up I have, this is on Pilgrim, I guess, since the big snowstorm the plant's been out. If
you can kind of give us an update there and if I'm not mistaken, you were supposed to have an outage in 2015 on
Pilgrim. And so, whether this unforced outage will help on the scheduled outage that you had, or is this just an
unfortunate outage event in the spring, you'll go into your regular outage and also the cost of having the plant down
during this time of year?

<Q - William M. Mohl>: Yeah, Andy, this is Bill. So, to answer the question regarding Pilgrim, the plant shutdown
due to Storm Juno shutdown orderly, safely, without incident on the 27th. We did lose offsite power to the facility.
However, all safety systems and backup power systems worked as planned. So, we've been working through that.
Dealing with a number of issues, we expect that plant to start up in the near-term in the next couple of days and be back
to full load probably sometime this weekend. As it relates to the planned outage, we do have a refueling outage that's
scheduled in the spring that remains unchanged. So, we still need to refuel the facility and perform normal maintenance
on that facility as we originally planned. So, nothing really changes there.
<Q - Andrew Levi>: And then I have one really very quick question. On just EWC, I didn't see any CapEx numbers
for 2015. Is that something that you guys disclose or you don't give?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: No. It should be in there, Andy. It's on Table – it's in Appendix B.
<Q - Andrew Levi>: Okay and how much is that for 2015?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: $425 million.
<Q - Andrew Levi>: $425 million, okay, and so, your operating cash flow at EWC is how much?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: I don't think we've disclosed that specifically.
<Q - Andrew Levi>: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.
