Gregory J. Hayes
Okay. Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. So 2016, a solid year for UTC; we delivered on the
commitments that we set back in December of 2015 and today we reported adjusted EPS of $6.61, just $0.01 above the

high end of the outlook range that we provided. I think importantly, sales $57.2 billion and organic growth of 2% and
free cash flow to net income was 93% even with the continued investments in the aerospace ramp. Both of these of
course were within our expectations with the range for the year and of course we continued to be disciplined with our
capital deployment in 2016. We returned $4.3 billion to shareowners in the form of share repurchases and dividends on
top of the $10 billion from 2015.
Looking forward to 2017 we remain confident in our full-year targets; adjusted EPS again in the $6.30 to $6.60 range
and sales of $57.5 billion to $59 billion. Again, with organic growth projected to be somewhere between 2% and 4%;
of course, that's on top of the 2% organic growth we reported in 2016.
During 2016, we saw a number of significant accomplishments across all the business units. Both Pratt & Whitney and
the Aerospace Systems business had impressive years in area of innovation and they achieved some noteworthy
program milestones. We feel good about the GTF accomplishments. That engine is now in service powering 46
A320neo and CSeries aircraft with more than 82,000 revenue hours.
We're also addressing some durability issues on the GTF. We have some fixes identified and, of course, we're
supporting our customers in the field. With that, though, we remain very excited about the value proposition of the
engine since we're meeting or exceeding both the fuel and noise and the emission targets right out of the gate.
Pratt was also awarded the engine contract last year for the B-21 Raider. With that win, Pratt has added another
program to the already impressive military portfolio including the Joint Strike Fighter and the refueling tanker. Pratt's
military business is truly set up for a very bright future.
Aerospace Systems last year we supported 15 critical program milestones including first flights, entry into service, and
aircraft certification across a multitude of commercial, military, and business jet platforms.
At Otis, 2016 marked a year of market segment gains for new equipment orders globally and, most impressively, in
China. These gains were driven by higher engineering development investments that was up almost 30% in the year. It
was also helped by better market segmentation and improved sales coverage. But we're not just investing in new
products, we're also investing in service transformation including new IT platforms and digital tools for our 31,000
service technicians, all of these to increase our productivity and improve the customer experience.
As you know, driving costs out of the business is part of our DNA. As an example, CCS expanded their margins by
another 60 basis points in 2016 and over the last four years, since 2012, Climate Controls & Security has achieved 400
basis points of margin expansion all while continuing to increase R&D and spending. The investments, of course, drive
new product introduction and, last year, CCS introduced over 100 new products into the market.
Aerospace Systems, another great story; last year, they had about $300 million of adverse impact from declines in the
high margin legacy products and they were able to offset almost of that through product cost reductions, lower A&D,
and lower SG&A. Really solid performance by Mr. Gitlin and team.
So, I'm pleased with the progress being made at each of the businesses and despite the continued macro uncertainties,
we're confident in UTC's 2017 outlook. Our continued focus on the key priorities around innovation, execution, cost
reduction, and disciplined capital allocation were a major factor in achieving 2016 results and they will continue to help
us meet our 2020 goals of delivering on long-term sustainable growth at UTC.
With that, let me hand it over to Akhil and Carroll to take you guys through the results. Akhil?
Akhil Johri
Thanks, Greg. So let's talk a little about Q4. We reported good performance, in line with expectations and what we had
said in December. Adjusted EPS of $1.56 was up 2% year-over-year. On a GAAP basis, the earnings were $1.26, so
that had $0.30 of restructuring and other significant items, about $90 million from restructuring.

We talked about some pension liability reduction initiatives that we had taken in October – that we announced in
October. That came with a onetime noncash charge of $423 million, or about $0.32. And we also redeemed some high
coupon debt, about $2.25 billion of that in November and that gave rise to $164 million, or $0.13, charge also in the
quarter. Partially offsetting that, on the positive side, we had additional tax settlements with the U.S. IRS and that gave
us a benefit collectively between that and some French tax law changes of about $0.23 below the line, that also we have
pulled out of our adjusted EPS.
Overall cash flow came in strong, 116% for fourth quarter, 93% of net income for the full year, slightly above
expectations, so pleased with that performance. If you look at the organic growth on slide 3, no major changes in the
trends that we were seeing throughout the year, just some minor puts and takes here. Americas for the commercial
businesses had continued with a strong growth, Otis particularly, up 4% in the quarter year-over-year. That was on top
of 10% growth that they had in Q4 of 2015 over 2014. So, again, strong performance. CCS was up 2%, largely on both
residential and commercial HVAC, showing decent growth.
Within EMEA, actually, the change, the data decline that you see on the page is entirely a function of Middle East.
Middle East sales saw the pressure from the – all the reduction that we've seen in prior quarters and were actually down
35% year-over-year for commercial HVAC and nearly 40% down year-over-year for the Otis new equipment business.
Excluding that, Europe was actually up low single-digits for Otis, largely on the strength of new equipment business,
and CCS was down low single-digits. Asia was flat, continued pressure from Otis China new equipment, which was
down low double digit, 12%; and CCS and Otis were both up in rest of Asia nicely.
Now aerospace, the quarter is not really meaningful because you'll recall, we had some volatility last year between
third and fourth quarter as a result of the new logistics center that we had launched last year in Q3. So, what is more
meaningful, certainly from my perspective, is looking at the second half in totality. And if you do that, we were up 4%
to 5% for UTAS and Pratt combined in the second half, which is more in line with what we expect in 2017 and going
forward to our 2020 target, so in line with that. So, the fourth quarter number is not that meaningful there.
The interesting thing and encouraging thing, frankly, for me was the orders. We saw pockets of improvement in some
of our commercial businesses. Firstly, for the first time this year on a quarterly basis, CCS equipment orders were up.
They were up 2%. In fact, if you include services, they were up 6% year-over-year. So, an encouraging sign as we go
into next year.
Otis China new equipment orders were also flat on a dollar basis. Now, we all know one quarter doesn't make a trend,
but this is still encouraging. And as I said in December, obviously Q1 2017, we will see probably the lowest organic
growth at CCS in terms of their full-year outlook. We also expect EPS for first quarter to be in the range of $1.35 to
$1.40, largely driven by two facts. I think if you look at our bridge for the full year that we shared with you in
December, we expect $0.32 of good news from share buybacks or low share count.
First quarter will have a smaller portion of that, so it's only $0.04 to $0.05 good news in the first quarter. Secondly, for
the commercial businesses, both Otis and CCS, we expect to see better year-over-year profit performance in the second
half than in the first half. And so, that's impacting the first quarter to some extent. But overall, pretty good start.
And with that, let me hand it over to Carroll to walk through the BU details. Carroll?
Carroll Lane
Okay. Thanks, Akhil. I'm on slide 4 and I'll be speaking to the segments in constant currency as we usually do. And as
a reminder, there's an appendix on slide 14 with additional segment data you can use as a reference.
So, Otis; in the quarter, sales were flat to the prior year at constant currency, while profit was down 4%. Foreign
exchange translation was a 1 point headwind to sales and earnings. Profit in the quarter benefited from higher service
volume, productivity, and mark-to-market FX tailwind. These benefits were more than offset by continued pricing
pressure in China and EMEA, as well as additional E&D investments.

New equipment sales were down 2%, driven by low double-digit decline in China and close to a 40% decline in the
Middle East. Offsetting these headwinds, we continued to see strong growth in North America, with new equipment
sales up 13% as well as solid growth in Europe. Europe was up 7%. Otis service sales were up 3%, with continued
growth in modernization and repair. Maintenance sales were up slightly.
New equipment orders were up 3% in the quarter. We saw mid-teen growth in EMEA and low double-digit growth in
Asia, excluding China. This was partially offset by North America, down about 20% off tough compares. You'll recall
last year, North America orders were up over 50% in the fourth quarter.
New equipment orders in China were flat on a dollar basis but up 5% in units, and that's despite a market estimated to
be down mid-single digit. For the full year, operating profit was down about 6% at constant currency on 1% higher
organic sales. Organic sales excluding China were up 4%. FX translation for the year had a 2-point unfavorable impact
on both sales and profit.
Turning to slide 5, Climate, Controls & Security sales were up 5% at constant currency in the quarter. That was all due
to acquisitions. Profits were up 5% driven by acquisitions and lower cost partially offset by around $15 million of
impact from the devaluation of the Egyptian pound. FX translation was a 2-point headwind to sales and earnings.
Organic sales at CCS were flat this quarter with strength in North America residential HVAC offset by declines in
global fire and security and Middle East commercial HVAC.
Transport refrigeration was down 1% with container down slightly, and that was a sequential improvement after being
down almost 30% through the third quarter. Commercial refrigeration was up 9%. Total equipment orders at CCS were
up 2% for the quarter and up for the first time this year, as Akhil noted. Strong growth in commercial refrigeration, up
nearly 20%, combined with high single-digit growth in fire and security products more than offset continued pressure
in North America truck trailer.
Global commercial HVAC equipment orders declined 5% and that was primarily driven by the Middle East, which was
down over 50%. For the full year, CCS grew operating profits by $130 million at actual FX with organic sales down
1%. FX translation for the year had an unfavorable 1 point impact to sales and profit. Operating profit growth was
driven by continued productivity, restructuring gains, and tailwind from commodities.
Okay. Shifting to Aerospace on slide 6; Pratt & Whitney sales were flat organically in the quarter. The military
business saw low single-digit growth driven by OEM, development programs and aftermarket. We also saw growth in
commercial OEM driven by favorable mix and development revenues. For the year, we delivered a total of 138 GTF
engines and now support 13 operators and service. In the quarter, we delivered 62 GTF engines, supporting customer
requirements, and that was the highest output for a quarter-to-date on the GTF for Pratt.
Commercial aftermarket was down 6% in the quarter. In the large engine business, the transactional aftermarket was up
3% and up off tough prior-year compares. However, this strength was more than offset by unfavorable long-term
contract adjustments for fleet management programs. Pratt Canada aftermarket saw growth in the quarter, up 6%. Pratt
operating profit was down $80 million driven by the unfavorable contract adjustments in the commercial aftermarket,
additional ramp-related costs, an unfavorable mix in military engines, and that did include the absence of F-117.
This was partially offset by tailwind from pension, FX, and lower negative engine margin. For the full year, organic
sales were up 6% and operating profit was down $162 million. Higher negative engine margin, E&D, and ramp-related
investments were partially offset by drop-through from the double-digit sales growth in the commercial aftermarket as
well as tailwind from pension and FX.
Turning to slide 7, Aerospace Systems operating profit was up 4% in the quarter on flat organic sales. Commercial
OEM sales were down 1%. Continued growth on next-generation platforms was more than offset by a decline in legacy
volumes. Commercial aftermarket was up 3% with 4% growth in parts and repair combined and a slight decline in
provisioning. As we've seen throughout the year, military sales declined in the quarter, down 4%, and that included the
continued headwind from the completion of the C-5 nacelle retrofit program that wrapped up earlier in the year.

Operating profit growth was driven by drop-through on higher commercial aftermarket sales, continued cost reduction,
and pension tailwind, partially offset by unfavorable commercial OEM mix and lower military volumes. In line with
expectations, full year operating profit was essentially flat on 2% organic growth. Strong performance in cost reduction
offset new program mix and military volume headwinds.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Greg.
Gregory J. Hayes
Okay. Thanks, Carroll. So, overall 2016, no drama, at the end of the day. A lot of challenges throughout the year, but
good execution by the entire team, and as a result, we're able to meet all the commitments that we laid out for the year.
So that's 2016. Let's focus now on 2017 for just a second. A lot of challenges ahead of us. I think all of us recognize,
we've got a new administration in Washington, which has an agenda to be friendly to business, and I think we're
anxious to see how all of that will that play out.
Certainly, tax reform is the biggest single item that we're focused on this year. On top of that, however, there's always
the issue of FX. You'll recall, we've pegged the euro to €1.05 to the dollar. We're a little bit better than that today, I
think it's at €1.07, but FX remains a watch item for the year, especially with the impacts of tax reform potentially
impacting the exchange rates. We're also course closely watching the economic environments in both China and
Europe, our second and third largest markets. Also, of course, what happens with Brexit and also the elections in
France and Germany will create some uncertainty as we move through the year.
Despite all of this, though, I'm very confident. We have a portfolio of industry-leading businesses. We've got global
footprint. We've got global scale. We've got strong balance sheet, as well as an experienced management team. All of
those things give me high confidence in our ability to deliver on the guidance that we weighed out a month ago. We, of
course, remain committed to the key priorities: we're going to continue to innovate for growth, we're increasing R&D
investments at both Otis and CCS, and we're going to continue to drive cost out through restructuring and product cost
reduction.
We'll also remain disciplined in our capital allocation. You recall last year we had a placeholder of $1 billion to $2
billion for M&A. We ended up only doing about $700 million. But again, trying to be disciplined with your money.
This year, we've got a placeholder of $3.5 billion for share buyback and $1 billion to $2 billion for M&A again. High
confidence that we'll continue to buy back stock as we continue to see intrinsic value of UTC significantly in excess of
the current share price. In total, we remain on track to return $22 billion to shareowners from 2015 to 2017.
The entire organization is focused on execution and meeting these commitments. These include commitments to both
our customers, our shareowners, and our employees. We've never been better positioned for growth. We've got strong
backlog and these great forward global franchises that all provide recurring revenues and resilient business models.
UTC is uniquely positioned to deliver shareholder value well into the future.
So with that, let me stop and open it up for questions. Brian?

<Q - Samuel J. Pearlstein>: Can you talk a little bit more about the Pratt & Whitney aftermarket? You mentioned a
long-term contract impact. I'm trying to – is that a one – I guess, can you size it? Is it one time? Is it something that's
ongoing? And is there any way to read into that, how you were able to get price in terms of the fourth quarter? Because
that's usually when we would see the pull forward in terms of that's probably more the parts side.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, Sam, I think you're exactly right. The contract adjustments we typically see these on a
quarterly basis at Pratt. We go through all of our – I think we got some 80 long-term contracts out there with the
airlines and we look at each one of these every quarter. Because of some issues that we've seen in the V2500, we went
back and we had these negative adjustments on some long-term contracts specifically related to the V program. Again,
I would say it's not a one off, it's just something we look at every quarter. You'll recall we get good news some
quarters, we get bad news some quarters.
This year I think net probably $200 million of bad news on these contract adjustments. But I wouldn't read anything
into it. The good news, of course, is we're selling more spare parts. And you saw that, I think, spare parts were up 3%
or so in the fourth quarter and that was off of a really difficult compare from 2015 where I think we were up about
19%. So, I wouldn't read anything into it. I think it's just a kind of a one-off thing at Pratt. Clearly, something we had
anticipated as we started looking at this. And it's the reason Pratt's kind of at the low end of the guidance range for the
year.
<A - Akhil Johri>: Keep in mind, Sam, that for the full year, Pratt commercial aftermarket was 10% up, which is
exactly what I think we had said sometime middle of the year. So, we've seen some good strength on the transactional
side, as Greg said. Some of it was driven by some of these issues that you've seen, unfortunately, the reverse side of
that shows up in our FMP contracts. And so the – net-net, it's still a pretty, good solid story.
<Q - Samuel J. Pearlstein>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays. Please proceed.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Good morning, gentlemen.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Carter.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Greg, I wanted to ask about the GTF and just what you guys have been seeing in terms of
in-service reliability. Clearly, you've been swapping out some engines. There have been some to come off wing. I just
wondered if you could speak to how that's trending and what you guys are seeing in terms of deliveries of spare
engines, and how that's trended versus your original expectations, and just sort of what the implications for how that
engine is performing given it's got such a high level of FMPs?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah. That's a good question. As we look – as we exited the year, we saw really two issues
around the durability, I would say, of the engine. We've got 82,000 hours now in service on the engine and we're
starting to see some issues out there, but it's really related to two specific things. One, we've been talking about since
probably the middle of last year which is the combustor liner, it's not having – in some harsh environments like India,
we're not getting the life out of that combustor liner that we had expected. So, there's a redesign that's being
implemented. We'll get those out there in service later this year.
Second issue is oil seal or carbon seal where we've seen again some premature failures on that. We're working with
supplier on that to correct that. We've got a fix in place that should be delivered by about May, I think, of this year. So,
these are annoying things for the airlines, obviously caused them some disruption. We've got a lot of spares out there to
try and keep the fleet running and, in fact, we've been doing a pretty good job of supporting them. It is still a pain for
the airlines.

So, a little bit of noise in the system, but I would characterize it as typical of a new program introduction. And we
exited the year on a good trajectory for production. I think we built 62 engines in the fourth quarter. This year, we're
going to build 350 to 400. A chunk of those, over 50 of those engines, will be spares to give – to support the fleet going
out there to make sure when we do have these issues that the customers are not impacted too much. So, yeah, just
normal growing pains of any new engine, but I would nothing that's causing us to lose a lot of sleep.
<A - Akhil Johri>: Yeah. And, Carter, just to put in perspective, you know this industry better than I do, but certainly
to put in perspective, historically, when you introduce engines in addition to some teething pains we also struggle with
fuel-burn and some of the other commitments. And the good news is that this time at least those key performance
characteristics are being met right out of the box and that's unusual. So, that makes us feel good. The gear architecture
is holding up very well, and so the fundamentals of the engine are still very sound and it delivers the fuel performance.
So, some teething issues will get through, this is always part of what happens and the good news is we are catching
these early and we'll fix these as soon as we can.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: And to Akhil's point, too, Carter, I would just say the gear system has performed flawlessly,
and this oil seal issue that we talked about has nothing to do with the gear system. So, meeting fuel burn, we're doing
everything, there's been no order cancellations, it really just normal new product introduction issues that everybody
goes through.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: And just as a clarification on that topic, do you build in cushion into the long-term service
agreement to account for this sort of stuff?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, absolutely. When you take a look at all these contracts, you build in a warranty
cushion, if you will, in terms of what you're going to have to give away for the first couple of years. So, we don't see
any big drama on the long-term FMPs as a result of this. Again, we've got fixes identified, we'll get them in the fleet
this year. These contracts last or run over 10-plus years, so they're still flying the hours which is the good news.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Great. Thanks for the color.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Thanks, Carter.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question will come from the line from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please proceed.
<Q - Lucy Guo>: This is Lucy on for Cai. So, can you talk about the moving parts of the Trump administration
policies in terms of any tax cuts or the border adjustments and whatever manufacturing implications may be?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Sure, Lucy. Well, first of all, we've obviously been following the Trump administration
closely in terms of what you're talking about on tax reform. And it looks like we're going to be following the Chairman
Brady blueprint out of ways and means which would lower the top rate to somewhere around 20%, eliminate the
deductibility of interest but also provide for immediate expensing of capital. Also provide for a territorial system which
is really good news for us because, as you know, we've got about $6 billion in cash sitting overseas that we can bring
back to the U.S. very cost effectively.
So, we look at this as a huge opportunity to again drive growth in the business, and growth here in the U.S. by being
able to bring the cash back. There is still some question mark round border adjustability. We are a net exporter, so if
that were to remain in place, probably a positive for us. But again, there's a lot of moving pieces in tax reform and we
will be actively involved in the debate. Again, the good news is, is if it does happen this year, it's going to be net
positive for the U.S. economy.
<Q - Lucy Guo>: Great. And can you just say, is it a net positive or favorable, or not?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Well, it – I'd like to say it's going to be a net positive, but as you know, Lucy, the devil is
always in the detail around taxes. Our effective tax rate is about 28%. If they drop the rate to 20% or even 15%,

obviously that would be helpful. Lose the deductibility on interest, which we've got about $1 billion of interest expense
a year, so that would hurt. Again, it'll all be what happens in the transition rules, too, and how do you transition into
lower rate, how do you transition into border adjustability. But net-net I think it's positive. Even if our effective tax rate
doesn't drop all the way down to 20%, just having access to our foreign cash through a territorial system is a very, very
positive net for the U.S. economy.

Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Please proceed.
<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: Thank you very much. Greg, you've talked a lot about innovation and focus on new
products. R&D is up a little bit in 2016. Where are your initiatives for 2017, and what will we see the spending on other
than obviously improving GTF?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah. So, if you think about it, last year we spent about $2.3 billion. We saw probably the
biggest increase percentage-wise at Otis, and that I think is just some deferred maintenance where we hadn't been
spending enough on new product introductions. So, you'll see Otis E&D go up a little bit again this year as we look
both to introduce some new products as well as to help on the service side on some of the service tools.
As far as the aerospace businesses go, Pratt ought to start coming down the E&D curve here relatively soon. I think
we've got one more big first – well, we've got the MRJ certification. I think that happens in the first quarter. We got
Embraer out there. I think once those get behind us, we should start to see E&D tail off. Trying to deal with these
reliability problems has caused a little bit of additional E&D, but that's not really significant. And the same at
Aerospace Systems, I think we ought to see that number start to tail off as you get some of these new program
introductions behind us.
<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: And then just as a follow-up, on Otis, you very much called out the change in trajectory
with orders, and it sounds like there's a lot of organizational items that went into this. Could you elaborate a little bit on,
is it customer touch or what is it in the organization that made for this change?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: So, a couple of things I would say, Howard. One thing is, when Philippe was put in
management team, we still have the typical Otis structure, which is really based on branch offices and regions. But we
now have a president of the service business. We also have a president globally of the new equipment business. And
the idea here is to drive commonality and to drive best practices across all of the Otis organization.
And sometimes, as you know, in a decentralized organization like Otis, things might not always be as easy to change as
you would like. And so, I think Philippe with this new organization is really encouraging the collaboration and trying,
again, push best practices throughout the entire organization. For instance, when we look at our business in Japan,
we've got a cancellation rate of less than 2%; globally, it's north of 5%. So, I think there are things we can learn in
Japan. Similarly, what we're doing with new products coming out of France and coming out of Spain, I think we can do
some things and use some of that knowledge to help us in our businesses here in North America and in South America.
So, a lot of things to do from the organizational standpoint, but the key is focus. The new equipment market, again,
very competitive; it's about driving cost. On the service side, it's about improving the customer experience. We talk
about these 31,000 service mechanics at Otis. Those are the touch points for our customers. Those are the people that
represent Otis to the customer, and giving those folks the right tools is imperative. We started rolling out some of these
digital tools in Hong Kong here in the fourth quarter. We'll roll out digital tools to about half of the service technicians
this year. That'll cover about 75% of our total service sales.
So, a lot of things to do, a lot of best practices, and it starts at the top with having a great organization. But I think
Philippe and team are on track.

<A - Akhil Johri>: Yeah, on the new equipment side, Howard, I think some of the more encouraging things I've seen
is really thorough segmentation of the market. Looking specifically targeted sales force additions. So, seeing markets
where maybe it's a Tier 3 city in China or Bangalore in India where we are underrepresented vis-à-vis some of the other
sales people from other companies and adding selectively sales force in those markets to provide better coverage. So,
it's really a very deep down analysis with targeted investments beyond just the new product stuff and other things that
Greg talked about. So, really happy with the progress we've seen on the new equipment side there.
<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: Thank you.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Thanks, Howard.

Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
<Q - Julian Mitchell>: Thank you. Hi. My question was on Otis. Yeah. You talked back in December about maybe a
slightly narrowing or at least leveling out of the price/mix headwind in 2017 for Otis. I just wondered, in China, it does
look as if the price and mix declines are kind of narrowing in your order book at least. Maybe just give some color
around that.
<A - Akhil Johri>: Julian, I would say it differently because it did narrow. If you think about it, our sales were up in
units – our orders were up in units, 5%; in dollars, we're flat, right? So the gap was only 5 points this time compared to
a larger gap that we've seen in the earlier quarters. On the pricing side, we did see pricing pressure go down to 6% to
7% range from the 9% range that we had seen before. And if you recall from our December conversation, that is what
our plan is for next year.
Now, obviously, one quarter does not make a trend, and the local team would still say it's very competitive out there in
China; a lot depends on what happens with the policies on the real estate side and the housing markets in China. But
certainly, Q4 was a little more encouraging than what we have seen for the first three quarters.
<Q - Julian Mitchell>: Thanks. And just a quick follow-up. Did you see the same in Europe? How's the pricing in the
EMEA, particularly aftermarket business right now?
<A - Akhil Johri>: Unfortunately, not much of a change there. So, Europe service business has seen similar level of
pricing pressure that we have seen historically. The real thing there that'll change that as you know is two things. One is
inflation because most of our contracts have built-in price increases related to customer, price inflations, et cetera. And
we have seen virtually no sign of that, so that starts to change, that'll automatically ease some of the pricing pressure.
The second thing that'll probably change that dynamic will be greater strength in the new equipment business because
that will drive better conversion and it'll also drive a little easing of the competitive pressure on some of the people. So
there, at least we saw some signs. The new equipment orders in Europe, excluding Middle East, were up 13% for the
year, right? That's a pretty strong sign of new equipment progress. The modernization side is also up strongly. The
backlog for modernization in Europe was up over 30%. So, when you look at those data points, it's encouraging but
really not much change in the service pressure yet. It is a long-term story. It'll probably take another year or two before
we'll see that.
<Q - Julian Mitchell>: Understood. Thanks.

<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hi, David.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Greg, F-35, obviously, the new administration has taken a lot of interest in that, pushing on
the cost side. Given you're the engine provider, can you talk about how you might be participating in that as well?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: So, just to be clear, David, we negotiate separately from Lockheed on the engine. We
negotiate directly with the Joint Program Office, the JPO. As we have said for a number of years, we remain committed
to a cost curve that we established back in 2010 which is essentially an 88% learning curve, meaning that every time
we double production, we'll take the price or the cost down by about 12%. And we remain on that 88% learning curve.
I think we're just on LRIP 11 negotiations right now, and [indiscernible] (37:00) JPO on cost as we continue to meet
the commitments we have there.
Obviously, Lockheed's got some work to do, but I think even – as Mrs. Hewson said yesterday, they're coming down
the cost curve nicely as well. They'll have a JSF out there next, a lot less than $90 million from over $100 million
today. So, there is cost reduction coming. Volumes are picking up, and it's a great aircraft. I think if you ask the
Marines, they like the aircraft in service. And certainly, the Israelis and some of the other foreign buyers are very happy
with the aircraft. So, there's always going to be pressure on price for what is the biggest DOD procurement program in
history, but I think Lockheed is committed to continue the cost reduction as is Pratt & Whitney.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Okay. Thanks. And as a quick follow-up, on the outlook call, Greg, I think you talked about
the idea that we could see share repurchase come down significantly in 2018 relative to 2017, more of a focus on M&A
and dividend. Could you just expand a little bit on that and your thinking there? Thanks.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, so if you think about it, we'll do about $3.5 billion of additional share buyback this
year, which is a little bit above the historical norm. So, remember, back in late 2015, we committed to this $22 billion
of capital – redeploying our capital returning to shareowners. We're on track to do that. As I think about when we get to
2018, 2019, we'll probably go back towards that $2 billion a year, $1 billion to $2 billion a year of share buyback. We
need to do a little less than $1 billion a year just to offset dilution, so that's I would say the minimum number out there.
But we'll continue to just be judicious in terms of where we spend the capital.
I'm not looking to do big M&A, but again if you get cost – or if you get tax reform this year, you could actually see a
little bit different capital allocation because maybe you can take the dividend up if you know you can get access to your
foreign cash. Right now, as you know, about half of our cash is generated overseas, and most of the cash that's going
out is for U.S. purposes like the dividend, like debt repayments, et cetera. So, having access to that foreign cash in your
tax returns I think would be very beneficial to us and allow us to really re-look at this whole capital allocation strategy
that we have.

Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Hi. Good morning. Thanks, guys.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hi, Nigel.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: So, Greg, just turning back to the V marks that you took on the long-term contracts, I'm sorry if
maybe you provided more color, I was going back and forth on another call. But can you maybe just provide a bit more
color on what drove those adjustments? And given that you review these contracts periodically, to what extent do you
think there could be further contract adjustments over the next 12 months?
<A - Akhil Johri>: Nigel, as you know, the way the process works is we've got about 80 contracts that Greg
mentioned earlier, and we look at them on a quarterly basis. And as we have more data on cost performance or the
product performance, that factors into re-estimating the overall cost. It's also a function of what time period the contract
is in. If it's 8 years out of 10 already done, there may be a cum catch-up for – which has an impact – a larger impact
than normal. And I think some of what you saw in this quarter was a function of that.

Again, no surprises here. We kind of knew, as we saw the transactional spares come in stronger as a result of a couple
of these technical issues we had talked about, the impact on the FMPs was going to be adverse and that's what we had
factored in to our guidance and was affected in our Q4 as well as in Q3. So, I think periodically as we do these things,
we catch up, but I think it's behind us. I don't expect that...
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, look, I think the issue that's caused the re-estimation bad news is a specific durability
issue that we saw on V related to a part that's supplied from one of our partners. And we're in the process of
campaigning the fleet. Because we've had to campaign the fleet, it's been a little bit more expensive when we do the
overhauls at the shops. But to Akhil's point, that means we're also selling a lot more spare parts to those non-FMP
customers.
This is not a flight safety issue, this is just kind of a one of those things that you encounter with an engine that's been
out there for a while, but again, not a big surprise. We knew this was coming. But there shouldn't be, to Akhil's point,
more bad news related to this issue. We think we've gone through all the contracts and done all the catch-up that we
need to do.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Great. Thanks. That's great color. And then just switching back to Otis pricing, obviously good news
directionally on that. Do you think that the pricing umbrella in China, again, do you think that's reflective of just the
broad pricing in China or do you think this is Otis-specific? And any color on market share trends would be helpful too.
<A - Akhil Johri>: Clearly on the market share, that's an easy question to answer right now because we've seen 4% to
5% growth in our unit orders, and we know that the market has declined by about 5%. So, I think that's a clear
demonstration of a share gain, and this is just China I'm talking about. I think if you do a similar analysis in most parts
of the world, you will see that the Otis new equipment business in orders has done really well and gained share
probably on a global basis this year. That's really encouraging.
On the pricing side, Nigel, I think while pricing pressure has always been in China, it used to be in the 3% to 5% range,
it escalated a little bit to the 8%, 9% type of level early in 2016 and that was partly a function of the fact that the market
declined in unit terms for the first time in many years and, therefore, people were responding to it through price
reductions. I think that is not something that can sustain forever, so we're seeing a little reduction in that. But on the
other hand, you also see commodity prices going up. So, I think that may have some impact on pricing as well. We'll
see how it all plays out but, as you know, our guidance is for a 5% to 6% decline in pricing next year for Otis new
equipment business and similarly on the CCS business we expect a slight decline in pricing there, low single digit,
which are both better than what we've experienced in 2016.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: That's great color. Thanks, guys.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Thanks, Nigel.

Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Please proceed.
<Q - Jason Gursky>: Hey. Good morning, guys. Sorry, if this has already been covered. I actually have been having to
bob between a couple of different calls. But on the Geared Turbofan, Akhil, I think you said 64 units delivered in the
quarter? Can you confirm that? And then just talk about the ramp as we move into 2017 and 2018, some updated
thoughts on that.
<A - Akhil Johri>: Sure. 62, Jason, to just correct that data point. It's 62 units in fourth quarter. And the good news is
that the run rate in December was exactly in line with what we need in the first quarter. And January so far has been
trending okay as well and this is largely on the fan blade side, which is what we have talked about a lot. The key data
point that we track that Greg looks at almost on a weekly basis is the yield and the throughput from the fan blade
facility. And that's trended up, so we are at about 80% yield on the fan blade facility and a throughput down to 45 days.
Both those are significant improvements from where we were in June of last year. So, feel a lot better about our plans

there.
As you know, IHI, our partner, had certified their facility in fourth quarter and now are going to start producing parts,
fan blades, in first quarter this year. Plus, we are making excellent progress on the second facility in Michigan, which
will add capacity in the second quarter of this year. So, given all those actions, we feel a lot better about the fan blade
situation and overall industrial plan for Pratt GTF production capabilities and feel very good about being able to deliver
the 350 to 400 that is our goal for this year.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah. Just to add some color there, Jason, we reviewed this in detail yesterday with the Pratt
team. There's about 1,200 engineered components on a GTF and Pratt has engineering responsibility for 1,000 of those.
Of that 1,000 that Pratt has responsibility for, there is literally six parts where we have some concern about availability
to MRP. And there's a plan for each one of those parts as well as the other 1,000 parts that are out there.
So, there will always be a challenge as you're ramping up new engine. There's always learning that you're going to see
out there, but I feel very good about what the Pratt team has put in place in terms of leadership and in terms of the
analytics around understanding what's going on in the supply chain and understanding where the shortages might be
and working aggressively to address those things.
<Q - Jason Gursky>: Okay. Great. Thank you. One last clarification question here. You suggested second half profit
in commercial business and I couldn't hear whether you said CCS or in Otis.
<A - Akhil Johri>: Yeah.
<Q - Jason Gursky>: Second half profitability is better than the first half. Can you confirm which business it was and
then what are the major drivers of that ramp, and kind of what are the risks there?
<A - Akhil Johri>: Sure. In the case of CCS, Jason, it's just a function of the organic growth because, as you saw, the
order rate in Q4 came up but we still expect the trend will be relatively low organic growth in first quarter for CCS and
then that order rate will continue to drive better organic growth in the second half. So, it's more a function of superior
organic growth later in the year driving better profitability at CCS.
In the case of Otis, as you know, we are still in the process of making strategic investments that Greg described a little
bit about so there will be more cost upfront before we start to see the returns on that. The second point is pricing
pressure in China is more intense in the first half because of what we saw in the order book in the third and second
quarter this year, which gets translated into sales in the first half. So, I think Otis similarly will see better profit in the
second half on a year-over-year basis than in the first half.
<Q - Jason Gursky>: That's great. Thanks, guys.

Thank you. Our next question will come from Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
<Q - Ronald Jay Epstein>: Hey. Good morning, guys.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hey, Ron.
<Q - Ronald Jay Epstein>: Maybe a little more detailed question on the GTF. Just kind of surveying around some of
the folks looking at it closer, it seems like you guys are on the fifth generation of combustor for the engine. Does that
fall in the realm of normal for a new engine, five combustors? Seems like a lot to me. I don't know. Any thoughts?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: So, I think your math's a little off. So, the first 17 engines went out with what we would say
was the first combustor. We knew that, that had to be upgraded, and in fact the B combustor is the current configuration
that's out there on the fleet field. As I talked about some of the durability issues that we're having, the combustor, the B
version of the combustor is not having the life that we would hope it to have in these very harsh environments, like
India. So we've actually got one more combustor redesign on the way. We'll have that in place later this year.

So I'm not sure where you got five, but we're clearly working on the third version which we think will give us the
expected life that we had committed to the airlines. And again, it's one of those things where you just don't know until
you get out there in service. And not all operators are having issues with the combustor, but the ones that are, it's
certainly a pain for them pain, so we're working aggressively with spares to make sure that they've got the right level of
spares out there to be able to deal with this lower-than-expected life on the engine.
<Q - Ronald Jay Epstein>: Okay. Cool. And then maybe one more follow-on kind of along the same lines. One
management team ago, the goal was set forth that maybe one day you guys would be able to sell engines at breakeven
OE, and given that the GTF compared to its closest competitor has, what, 30% fewer parts, right, so there's less in it. Is
that still a goal, that one day you could sell these things at breakeven as opposed to losing money every time you ship
one?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: I had a dream just like Akhil had a dream that one day we would be able to sell these at
breakeven, but the fact of the matter is just with the market dynamics out there in a very competitive marketplace,
pricing just does not allow us – or the market doesn't allow us to sell these new engines at anything other than a loss.
The good news is, I think longer term, the value is still there. The IRR on the GTF program is still well north of our
cost of capital, and we continue to see opportunities to improve that. So, this is again not for the faint of heart, Ron.
You know that. These are long term programs. Returns come in the later years.
The good news is most of the investment is behind us. We're going to continue to invest in negative engine margin for
the foreseeable future, but three or four years from now we start seeing the first overhauls on these engines. It's going to
be very profitable with Pratt & Whitney. So again, we all dreamed about breaking even and getting real value upfront,
but unfortunately, the market did not allow us to do that.
<A - Akhil Johri>: The other thing, Ron, I think is we are being very disciplined and selective with regard to the
campaigns as well. I think if you look at – and some of that shows up in our market share. We're not chasing market
share here, but we are chasing more profitable part of the engine portfolio and trying to make sure that we remain
disciplined and at least tilted that windmill a little bit. So, that's part of what we need to do.
<Q - Ronald Jay Epstein>: Got you. Got you. And then maybe one last one. A while back, there was some talk about
maybe doing a big sister to the GTF, right, a higher thrust engine. If an aircraft OE were to do a middle of the market
airplane, and there are some speculation that one based in Seattle may, would you guys want to do an engine for that? I
mean, what's your thought on doing a wide-body version of a GTF?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Would we want to do an engine? Of course, we'd want to do an engine, Ron. I think the
question always goes back to business case, and you'd have to make sure that the economics work for a single point
aircraft. And that goes to how big is the market, that goes to what pricing looks like, that goes to as well whether or not
there's going to be one or two engines offered on the aircraft. So, all of those things will go into our decision.
We're obviously working with that company in Seattle on trade studies on the engine, but just like they're not
committing to it, I say we're not going to commit to it and we'll see what happens with the economics. As you know, in
the airline business it's all about cost, cost, and cost, and we're trying to make sure that whatever product that we have
out there can meet the very stringent guidelines around cost while also delivering on the fuel burn and other key
parameters for this new engine. So, we'll see.

<Q - Douglas Stuart Harned>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hi, Doug.
<Q - Douglas Stuart Harned>: On Otis in China, if I go back a while ago, you used to talk about margins, OE
margins in China is running kind of at the same level as Otis overall. Back in those days, it was kind of a 20% type
level. But recently, since we've seen these price declines, and they may be slowing some but if we're down 6% now, we
were down 9% before. When you think about Otis margins in China, where are they headed now for OE? I mean, are
we looking at something that has a lot more pressure on it than we had seen in the past, or have you been able to get
costs down in a commensurate way?
<A - Akhil Johri>: Yeah. So I think the answer is yes and yes. The team in China has been very good at getting cost
out of the supply base. That's step number one. And then they've also been consolidating the operations within China to
make sure that we have a common supply chain. We have a common management team managing the supply chain;
factories have been shut down and consolidated. So, I think the team is very active at ensuring that we can offset and,
thus far, they have been successful although you're right that there is increasing pressure; pricing pressure is greater,
commodity prices are starting to become more of a problem now. But we still remain committed to trying to keep the
margins at a pretty good level on the OE side in China.
<Q - Douglas Stuart Harned>: And then on the service side, I mean, a big part of this is trying to get the attachment
rates up and you saw the regulatory reform. It's been about two years now in terms of needing service contracts for
elevators that have been installed. What does the attachment rate look like now, and how are you seeing the trends both
in your service volume as well as service margins?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: So, if you look at the attachment rates, they're still around 35%-ish.
<A - Akhil Johri>: Improved slightly.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, which improved slightly over the last couple of years. The problem in China on
service from a profitability standpoint is still lack of density in many of the roots. It's fine in the Tier 1 cities but we're
still struggling on the profitability side. So, service margins are pretty close to what you see on the new equipment side.
You don't see the big differentiation there. That should change over time. But part of this too is regulation in China
which requires two service mechanics when you visit an elevator as opposed to one, so that's driving cost up. We
expect, I think, service this year will probably grow another 10% in China, feel very comfortable with that.
The key for us, though, is actually getting the service technicians. We had to hire over 1,000 people again this coming
year to meet the demand for these higher levels of service. So, again, it's a very long-term gain for service in China.
Service didn't start – the market is still new, relatively speaking. So, we'll get there eventually but it's going to take a lot
of hard work and more investment, I would say, on the Otis side. But that is the ultimate prize is the service portfolio,
over 2.5 million elevators in service in China today. There's a lot of opportunity there.
<A - Akhil Johri>: And the conversion rates, Doug, within the Otis business in China, as you know, we talked about
this before, the higher-end the conversion rates are even closer to the Western markets which you would expect
because there the people – the customers are more reliant on and they're more careful about making sure they have the
right people doing the maintenance work. But on the lower end, it is significant and the regulation hasn't quite kicked in
yet.
<Q - Douglas Stuart Harned>: Is there a point where we should expect this to really take off? In other words, do you
have goals for volume, market share, those sorts of things that would give you the kind of density you want at a certain
point in time? I'm trying to understand when we can see this as an important contributor, if it is 10 years away or if it is
3 years away.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: It's probably five years away, Doug. Think about it, we've got about 165,000 under current
maintenance contracts, maybe 175,000 through December. We've got another probably 50,000 out there under current
– like, one-year service warranty that we give. So, I think, once you get north of 250,000 to 300,000 elevators – again,
it's a big country, you need density, but once you get to that level, we should start to see profitability increase. Again,

it's still a new business and there's still a lot of work to do to get the workforce trained and to get the efficiency of the
service technicians up to the efficiency levels that we see in the rest of the world.
<Q - Douglas Stuart Harned>: Okay. Great. Thank you.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Thanks, Doug.

Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Hey, guys. Good morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hey, Steve.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: On the GTF, just to make sure that we're kind of reading the comments right, I mean,
you're still saying that the 2018 kind of peak loss is intact and there's not risk that there is extra cost on top of that, just
to make that clear, right?
<A - Akhil Johri>: Yes. No change to the outlook of $1 billion of negative engine margin in 2018.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Right. Okay. And then on CCS for the year I think it's kind of like a mid-single digit
type of increase in profit. You said it's going to start a little slow. Will it still grow here in kind of both quarters here in
the first half? Just trying to judge the magnitude of the ramp expected in the second half of the year.
<A - Akhil Johri>: I would say this, I think the CCS team would be very disappointed if they don't grow. They're so
used to delivering profit growth every quarter that they would be disappointed if they don't grow. Now the magnitude
of that can be questioned and that's what I was referring to more than the ability to grow earnings. They're a very
determined team and they know that shareholder value gets created by growing earnings.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Okay. And that's for the first half, right? Growing profits?
<A - Akhil Johri>: Yeah, but at a very low rate probably compared to the second half.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Okay. Any – last one, any change on the price-cost dynamics there given a bit of a
move up in kind of a bit of a backup recently in commodities?
<A - Akhil Johri>: Certainly, CCS does not see the kind of commodity tailwind they saw in 2016 and that pressure has
been there a little bit. The pricing side still has to play out. As you know, the biggest pricing plays out in the residential
market and for that the list prices are up. I think all competitors have done that. We'll have to just see how it all plays
out as the market goes into the cooling season.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.
<A - Akhil Johri>: Thank you, Steve.

Okay. Thanks, Brian. Thank you all for listening in. I would just remind everybody, 2017 has a lot of challenges out
there but we remain highly confident in the guidance that we've got. I mean, again, for us, it's about execution this year,
execution, execution, and we're confident we've got the right team to do that. So, Carroll and his team will be around
for the rest of the day and tomorrow to answer any questions you guys might have. Thank you, guys, all for listening
and have a great day. Take care.
