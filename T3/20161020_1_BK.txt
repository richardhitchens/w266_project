Now, I would like to turn the call over to Gerald Hassell. Gerald?
Gerald L. Hassell
Thanks, Valerie, and thank you for joining us this morning.
As you may have seen from our release, we delivered strong results for the quarter. On adjusted basis, we are $0.90 per
share, up 22% year over year. Total revenues grew 4% while total noninterest expenses were down 1%. We generated
more than 500 basis points of positive operating leverage resulting in an adjusted pre-tax operating margin of 35%.
Now, since we shared our three-year strategic plan with you in October of 2014, we have delivered seven straight
quarters of solid performance against these goals, despite the relative lack of industry and market catalysts, building a
strong track record of success, managing what we can control through all environments. Our assets under custody and
administration increased to $30.5 trillion and our assets under management increased to $1.7 trillion.
Our success reflects our relentless focus on creating new solutions for our clients, reducing costs and improving our
clients' experience. It also reflects the progress we are making in our cultural, structural and operational transformation.
All of this has created a more collaborative and solutions-driven approach working with our clients.
Now, central to our growth strategy is an investing in future revenue-generating initiatives that leverage our expertise
and scale. And so we seek to strike the right balance to deliver both near-term and long-term shareholder value.
NEXEN, our digital ecosystem, is one of the most transformational of our investment. NEXEN is digitizing our
company and in the process, enhancing our clients' experience and creating efficiencies for us. Clients are just
beginning to experience the ease with which they can connect with us at their desktops or on their mobile devices.
While it's early days, we are confident in our future as we continue to invest, innovate and transform into a digital,
data-driven, global financial services powerhouse.
So let me update you on the progress against our strategic priorities. Our top priority is enhancing the client experience
and driving profitable revenue growth. These goals are interconnected; one enhances the other. Some examples in
investment services include building best in class technology and operations to deliver middle office outsourcing
solutions efficiently and profitably. Our timing to expand this business could not be better. We have a solid pipeline
reflecting the secular trend of asset managers seeking lower cost solutions.
We continue to focus on growing our collateral management capability. With global regulatory reform reshaping and
redefining the way market participant host initial and variation margin, we worked with the industry to implement new
initial margin requirements that were effective on September 1 of this year. We enhanced our capabilities, met a market
need, and it is already positively contributing to earnings.
Our margin segregation platform supports the new requirement with a high degree of automation and transparency and
represents a growing new revenue stream for us. The alternative administration business, we've had some good recent
wins including significant deals across three major alternative manager segments; real estate, private equity and
single-manager hedge funds. We are also executing on a comprehensive technology platform transformation program
that will consolidate all alternative servicing onto a global platform that will leverage NEXEN. This will increase our
scale, deliver seamless global capabilities and improve the overall client experience. Our pipeline in alternative
servicing remains strong. We expect to see continued success.
BNY Mellon treasury services has just been named among the top five of all global cash managers in Euromoney's
2016 Cash Management Survey based on a survey of treasury professionals. In the payment space, we have been
innovating and driving industry change. In the U.S., we're working with our clients to provide early access to the
clearinghouses' real-time payments network which will also be accessed through NEXEN. In investment management,
we had a strong quarter with fees up 4% year over year and pre-tax income excluding intangibles, up 7%. Inflows into
alternatives and LDI continued their growth trend as we progress with our approach of providing the strategies most

in-demand by our clients to meet their investment goals.
Under Mitchell Harris' leadership, we've been laser focused on enhancing our core functions, improving the investment
performance in key strategies and strengthening our distribution capability. We are centralizing business functions and
further leveraging the resources of BNY Mellon. And we have curtailed initiatives that aren't core to our strategic
priorities so we can better direct our resource. So for example, this quarter we closed our reverse mortgage business.
Our disciplined execution against these areas of focus is helping drive near-term performance, positioning us to attract
new asset flows and drive improved margins.
In terms of our investment performance, over the last 12 months and at a time when few active managers are
outperforming their benchmark, our top revenue-generating investment strategies have performed well.
Our second priority is executing on our business improvement process, which is benefiting us and our clients. The
savings we generate are enabling us to fund regulatory change, invest in strategic revenue growth initiatives and reward
shareholders more consistently. We are meeting or exceeding both our cost-saving goals and operating margin targets
that we laid out on Investor Day. And we are far from being done. In this quarter alone, we further optimized our real
estate portfolio. We shed 9% of rentable square footage occupied year over year. At the end of September, we closed
on the sale of 525 William Penn Place, which eliminate 25% over 600,000 rentable square footage of our downtown
Pittsburgh campus.
Our procurement and technology teams have continued to renegotiate key IT vendor contracts to reduce pricing and
eliminate unnecessary spend.
We continue to manage our balance sheet and align the drivers of cost with client pricing. For example, we imposed
new pricing that incented clients to reduce average daily overdraft balances. Now this month, we opened our seventh
Global Innovation Center, this one in Central New York. This one will focus on harnessing robotics and machine
learning to reduce our costs and free our staff to focus on higher-value activity.
We continue to add bots to support processes in the areas of client onboarding, global institutional accounting, and
corporate trust. Now there's a good-sized pipeline of other projects under review, and we expect more robotics
automation to be deployed in the near future.
Now also during the third quarter, we held a sell-side tour of our Innovation Center in Pittsburgh. It was an opportunity
to showcase our NEXEN ecosystem and the applications available today and what is in the pipeline to deliver to clients
in the future. NEXEN provides a single gateway to deliver all of BNY Mellon's solutions as well as best-in-class
third-party applications. So let me give you a couple of examples of our current capabilities.
In terms of blockchain, we're using distributed ledger technology for system resiliency in our new broker-dealer
services system, which is up and running today. We created a tool called BDS 360, using a distributed ledger to
reconcile transactions between clearance and repo platforms. Our asset servicing businesses use our Digital Pulse big
data analytics platform for real-time tracking of NAV production activities against client completion deadline. It's also
used for predictive analytics to project completion times against historic trends. So there are many exciting
developments that are going on in our technology area.
Our third priority centers on being a strong, safe, trusted counterparty. On September 30, we submitted our resolution
plan to the regulators, outlining our strategy to further enhance the resolvability of our company, including measures to
ensure the recapitalization and liquidity support of our material entities.
We strengthened our capital ratios during the quarter. Our supplementary leverage ratio on a fully phased-in basis was
up 70 basis points to 5.7%, and our common equity Tier 1 ratio was up 30 basis points. We also issued $1 billion of
preferred stock at one of the lowest rates ever, indicating the market's confidence in our financial strength.
Our fourth priority involves generating excess capital and deploying it effectively. During the third quarter, we
repurchased $464 million in common shares and we distributed $205 million in dividends. As a reminder, our board
approved the repurchase of up to $2.7 billion of common stock over a four-quarter period, which includes the
repurchase of approximately $560 million contingent upon the successful issuance of the preferred, which obviously

we've already done. And we began our buyback program during the third quarter, and it will continue through the
second quarter of 2017.
Our fifth priority is attracting, developing, and retaining top talent. We continue to prioritize bringing great talent into
our company while further developing and promoting the talent we have. We welcomed our newest independent board
member, Elizabeth Robinson, a former Goldman Sachs partner and Global Treasurer. Liz will be a great asset to BNY
Mellon as we continue to execute on our strategic and regulatory initiatives.
Hanneke Smits joined us in August as the CEO-designate of Newton. She has long been recognized as a rising star in
the investment world. Her proven expertise in growing a global firm across developed and emerging markets equip her
well to lead Newton's next phase of growth.
Niamh De Niese joined us to head up our EMEA Innovation Center. She has held a number of senior technology and
innovation leadership positions in the financial services and consulting industry, most recently heading Visa's European
Innovation Labs. Alex Batlin, respected cryptocurrency expert, will be joining de Niese in her EMEA Innovation
Center to bolster our efforts around blockchain. Dana Codispoti will join us next month from Morgan Stanley as Chief
Operating Officer of our HR area and Global Head of HR Solutions. Dana will help drive our efforts to reengineer our
HR operating model to provide an even greater strategic value and impact to the organization.
And we're already realizing on some of the benefits of our talent-related efforts. We were ranked fourth in Glassdoor's
50 Best Places to Interview in 2016 survey, which suggests we're getting the candidate experience right. The Anita
Borg Institute has named BNY Mellon to the 2016 Top Companies for Women Technology Leadership Index,
reflecting our success in recruiting, retaining, and advancing more women in technology roles.
And very importantly, we also make it a priority to develop and provide more growth opportunities for our talent within
the company. And the diverse global teams we've built are making a real difference for our clients and our
shareholders.
Now I'd also like to take the opportunity to publicly thank Karen Peetz, who is retiring at the end of this year, for her
leadership, partnership, and contribution to our firm over the last 19 years. We will miss her wise counsel and wish her
and her family well as she moves to the next chapter of her life.
So in summary, a strong quarter in terms of our financial performance, our strategy is benefiting our clients and our
shareholders through all market environments. We are executing on our key priorities, and we are confident in our
future.
With that, let me turn it over to Todd.
Thomas P. Gibbons
Thanks, Gerald, and good morning, everyone. My commentary will follow our financial highlights document starting
with slide four, which details our non-GAAP or operating results for the quarter.
Our third quarter adjusted EPS was $0.90. That's 22% higher than the year-ago quarter. On a year-over-year basis, third
quarter revenue was up 4%, expenses were down 1%, and we generated 511 basis points of positive operating leverage.
As we've noted in prior quarters, the strength of the dollar continues to impact results negatively for revenues and it's
positive for the expense categories. However, the net impact from currency translation is minimal to our consolidated
pre-tax income.
Income before taxes was up 15% year over year on an adjusted basis and it was up 12% sequentially. On a
year-over-year basis, our adjusted pre-tax margin was up four percentage points to 35%. Now while this reflects in part
the progress we continue to make, it's not a watermark we would expect to match in coming quarters, as we benefited
this quarter from seasonally higher DR fees. And return on tangible common equity on an adjusted basis was nearly
24% for the quarter, that's up three percentage points.

Moving ahead to slide eight, I'll discuss our consolidated fee and other revenue. Asset servicing fees were up 1% year
over year and flat sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher money market fees and securities
lending revenue and that was partially offset by the impact of a stronger dollar and the downsizing of our UK transfer
agency business. Clearing services fees were up 1% year over year and they were down slightly sequentially. The
year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher money market fees partially offset by the impact of the
previously disclosed lost business, largely driven by industry consolidation.
Issuer service fees were up 8% year over year and 44% sequentially. The year-over-year increase reflects higher fees
from corporate actions and depositary receipts and higher money market fees in corporate trust. The sequential increase
primarily reflects seasonally higher fees in depositary receipts. Treasury service fees were unchanged year over year
and 1% lower sequentially.
Third quarter investment management and performance fees were up 4% year over year and sequentially. The
year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher market values and money market fees, offset by the unfavorable
impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, principally driven by the weaker pound and net outflows of assets under management
in prior periods. The sequential increase primarily reflects higher market values.
FX and other trading revenue on a consolidated basis was up 2% year over year and 1% sequentially. FX revenue of
$175 million was down 3% year over year and up 5% sequentially. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects
lower volumes and volatility, and that was partially offset by the positive net impact of foreign currency hedging
activity. The year-over-year decrease also reflects the continued trend of clients migrating to lower-margin products.
The sequential increase primarily reflects higher depository receipt-related FX activity, partially offset by a little lower
volatility.
Financing-related fees declined 18% versus the year-ago quarter to $58 million and they were up 2% sequentially. The
year-over-year decrease primarily reflects lower underwriting fees and lower fees related to secured intraday credit that
we provided to dealers in connection with their third-party repo activity. As we noted, following the implementation of
these facilities in the second quarter of 2015, we expected market participants to moderate their usage and rely less on
our credit facilities in the following quarters, and that has played out pretty much as expected.
Distribution and servicing fees were $43 million, 5% higher year over year and flat sequentially. The year-over-year
increase primarily reflects higher money market fees, partially offset by fees paid to introducing brokers. Investment
and other income of $92 million compared with $59 million in the year-ago quarter and $74 million in the second
quarter. Both increases primarily reflect higher asset-related and seed capital gains.
Moving to slide nine, which shows the drivers of our investment management business, and I think that will help
explain our underlying performance. Assets under management of $1.72 trillion was up 6% year over year. That's
reflecting higher market values, offsets by the unfavorable impact of a stronger dollar. Sequentially assets under
management were up 3%. Long-term flows of $1 billion included inflows of $3 billion into our actively managed
strategies. We had $2 billion of outflows from index strategies. Additionally, we had $1 billion of short-term cash
outflows.
Wealth management continued its multi-year pre-tax earnings growth trend year over year as we focused on
high-growth U.S. markets. Our successful program to extend banking solutions to wealth clients through Pershing
continued to drive strong loan growth. Investment management loans were up 20% and deposits were up 2% year over
year.
Now, turning to our investment services metrics on slide 10, you can see that assets under custody and administration at
year-end were a record $30.5 trillion, up 7% or $2 trillion year over year, reflecting higher market values offset by the
unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. Linked quarter, AUCA was up 3% or $1 trillion. We estimated new assets
under custody and/or administration business wins were $150 billion in the third quarter. Now, we've heard questions
around this metric and want to remind you that we only include wins in this metric if they will add to the total AUCA.
For example, if a client who already has custody assets with us chooses to use us for fund accounting for those assets,
we would not include that in this metrics since the custody business already captured the AUCA.

Looking at the other key investment services metrics, you will see the impact of us proactively managing the balance
sheet and certain client relationships, with a focus on optimizing capital, liquidity and profitability, as well as the
impact of lost business in clearing.
Turning to net interest revenue on slide 11, you'll see that on a fully taxable equivalent basis, NIR was up 2% versus
the year-ago quarter and 1% sequentially. Both increases primarily reflect the actions we have taken to reduce the
levels of our lower-yielding, interest-earning assets and higher-yielding, interest-bearing deposits, as well as the impact
of higher market interest rates. The sequential increase also reflects higher average loans. The actions we took and the
higher market rates drove our net interest margin for the quarter to 106 basis points, 8 basis points higher than both the
year-ago and prior quarter.
As we previously indicated, we have been evaluating the impact of a resolution planning strategy on net interest
revenue. We currently believe that it requires us to issue approximately $2 billion to $4 billion of incremental,
unsecured long-term debt above what would be our typical funding requirements by July of 2017. And that is to satisfy
the resource needs and time of – at a time of distress. This estimate is subject to change, of course, as we further refine
our strategy and related assumptions. This is currently expected to have only a modest negative impact to net interest
revenue.
Turning to slide 12, you'll see that noninterest expense on an adjusted basis declined 1% year over year and increased
slightly sequentially. The year-over-year decrease reflects lower expenses in almost all categories, primarily driven by
the favorable impact of a stronger dollar, lower other, software and equipment, legal, net occupancy and business
development expenses. And that was partially offset by higher staff and distribution and servicing expenses. The
increase in staff expense was primarily due to higher incentive and severance expenses and the annual employee merit
increase. And that was partially offset by lower temporary services expense.
We continue to benefit from the savings generated by the business improvement process, including the continued
impact from vendor renegotiations and the execution of additional real estate actions that allow us to optimize our
physical footprint and improve how our employees work. We are running the cost to generate these savings through our
operating earnings each quarter because this is a continuous process; it's not a one-time project.
The sequential increase primarily reflects higher staff expense and M&I, litigation and restructuring charges, partially
offset by lower expenses in nearly all other expense categories, including business development, sub-custody, net
occupancy and other and software and equipment expenses.
Now, turning to capital on slide 13, our fully phased-in advanced approach common equity Tier 1 ratio – and this is
computed on a non-GAAP basis, increased 30 basis points to 9.8%, as we generated $286 million of capital after
dividends and buybacks. Our supplemental leverage ratio on a fully phased-in basis was 5.7%. That's up 70 basis
points, reflecting lower deposit and balance sheet levels and the benefit of the $1 billion preferred stock issued in the
quarter.
Two other notes about the quarter. The effective tax rate was 24.6%. And on page 11 of the release, we show some
investment and securities portfolio highlights. At quarter-end, our net unrealized pre-tax gain in the portfolio was $1.4
billion. That compares to $1.6 billion at the end of the second quarter, with the decrease primarily driven by a slight
increase in market rates.
Now, let me share a few thoughts to factor into your thinking about the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter earnings are
typically impacted by a seasonal decline in depositary receipts, total revenue with a limited offset in expenses. We
currently estimate the decline in the fourth quarter from the third quarter to be approximately $130 million. We expect
performance fees in our investment management business in the fourth quarter to be flat to slightly down versus the
fourth quarter of last year. NIR for the fourth quarter is expected to be flat to up slightly. SLR may decline slightly as
we increase buybacks following the preferred issuance. We expect total expenses for the full year now to be down 1%
to 2%. And lastly, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 25% to 26%.
With that, let me hand it back to Gerald.

Gerald L. Hassell
Thank you, Todd, and we can open it up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question from the line of Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Ashley Neil Serrao>: Good morning.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Good morning, Ashley.
<Q - Ashley Neil Serrao>: Good morning. So you've got some great margin improvement, but it feels like investment
management isn't where you want it to be yet. So I was curious if you could provide us an update on how you're
thinking about the margin potential for this segment. At this point, is margin expansion more dependent on your
various revenue growth initiatives or is there more work to do on the expense side of the story too?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: So why don't I take the beginning of that and then ask Mitchell to comment. We do think
there is additional margin improvement within investment management. I would note, that we are running through the
existing expense base, that the cost associated with severance have shut down of certain businesses. So that's in the
existing expense space. I also will say that we're very pleased to see some positive flows into our active management
areas, which has some good fees associated with them. So the expenses are a bit high at the moment, as we have
cleaned up a variety of activities. And we do think the revenues are starting to come on, due to strong investment
performance. So Mitchell, why don't you add some additional color?
<A - Mitchell Evan Harris>: I think that on the expense side, we have taken some actions, there are some severance
charges and one-offs in there as we've shut down a number of initiatives that you'll see really flow through into 2017,
so it's the noise of the expense of reducing the run rate costs that you're seeing this year, you won't see next year,
number one. Number two, the industry has had a lot of challenges on the asset flow side. But in saying that, we're well
diversified, people worry active versus passive. We have 18% of our assets in passive, so we are nicely diversified on
that front. Performance is looking very strong with respect to – our equity performance has been good and flows have
been slowing down – negative outflows have been slowing down.
You do see, we've been building more alternative strategies. Our alternative inflows have been increasing modestly
over the last few quarters and have been positive for at least five or six quarters, those have high margins. The asset
mix meaning that the equity outflows have slowed, you have some outflows in indexing or passive, those are much
lower margins. So the way the flow situation is looking, I think it'll start to benefit us going forward and I think we're
nicely positioned given the regulatory environment with the DOL to win some business next year. We had some
idiosyncratic issues with sovereign wealth funds in the Middle East that we've been concentrated. And I think those
have abated as well. So I guess the long and short is, I see opportunities on the revenue side. And I think we've been
quite aggressive on the expense side. But you'll see more flow through in the beginning of next year.
<Q - Ashley Neil Serrao>: Thanks for all the color there. And I guess other question was I was curious what the client
reception has been to some of the balance sheet actions taken this quarter on the deposit side, and if you feel you can do
more here?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Sure. This is Todd, Ashley. I'll take that. As we indicated in the second quarter, there were
two things we were going to do. One is, we were going to downsize the activity that was not client related that was
taking place in treasury. So we did have some deposit taking and some reverse repo and repot activity in treasury that
expanded the balance sheet by about $20 billion or so. That we took down in the quarter. Those were relatively
high-yielding funding sources and the margins on that was relatively low. And that's why you saw the NIM improve.
That had very limited impact or a zero impact on the clients. There are some adjustments to clients, but again, it's a

handful of clients and we're providing them alternatives to our balance sheet. So we don't think it's going to have a
meaningful impact to the client relationships.
We have actually seen a little bit of a spike in the fourth quarter, in our deposit base, primarily related to one-time
events, very large escrowed balances around some corporate trust activity, so we have then since seen that decline but it
while impact slightly the average deposit, just for the quarter but not for the long run. So we think we can continue to
bring down the balance sheet a little bit. We don't have to bring it down a whole lot more. We do need to bring it down
a little bit because you can see the progress that we made in the quarter was a little ahead of what we had anticipated in
the 570 basis point SLR. So I think we're in pretty good shape without going a lot more or impacting our NIR to meet
our capital targets.

Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. First question, I just wanted to ask about the servicing business.
You mentioned you had good wins again. AUC was up and AUC/AUA was really nicely. But it was down a couple
million even ex-sec lending or just down slightly. I'm just wondering, could you talk through? Is there seasonality in
asset servicing on the collateral business? Is there a fee capture challenge? Or did some of the business just not convert
yet? Can you just walk us through your expectations for asset servicing and just the trajectory there? Thanks.
<A - Brian Thomas Shea>: This is Brian Shea, happy to do that. I guess the asset servicing business, the revenue with
fee revenue was flat year over year and sequentially, driven by a little bit of improved fee waivers and improved net
new business, offset by the unfavorable impact of currency and a little bit lighter activity volume in this quarter.
So I think the other thing that's affecting the asset servicing business is that we're really focused on profitable growth
over pure revenue and market share. We've been going through a portfolio review of product services and solutions and
reducing things that are not really profitable or don't drive adequate return. The best example of that, which actually is
putting downward fee revenue pressure on us but improving our profitability, is the repositioning of our UK TA
business. And we are committed to the global institutional TA business and growing that, but the UK local retail
business we have been exiting, and so we're actually pushing out revenue and clients to other providers. And what's
happening is it's reducing our fee revenue but our operating margins and our fee-to-expense ratio and our profitability
is improving. So that's really the focus of the asset servicing business.
We think longer term there's a secular trend where asset managers are under fee pressure, particularly active asset
managers. And so we think there is a longer-term trend that's in our favor around middle-office outsourcing, extending
our technology solutions, the need for growth for collateral services and derivatives margin requirements and all the
other things that we think will drive longer-term growth in the asset servicing business.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Great. Thanks, Brian. So second question just on the expense side. Todd, you mentioned that the
year over year is still being helped a little bit by FX translation, but down 1% to 2% is still a great result regardless.
Can you help us understand? Just of the full-year benefits, how much of that is FX translation? And then as you look
out, depending on that first part, do you think you can replicate the type of stable if not declining growth as you look
into 2017 and beyond, given that you still seem to have a lot of this stuff still on the come?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Sure, so a couple of questions there, Ken. The first one as to the impact, it's probably
about 100 basis points. And if you look at our operating leverage, it's probably reflecting about 100 basis points in our
operating leverage. So we are getting a tailwind to the expense base from the strength of the dollar, and specifically
with the move in sterling because we do have a fairly large expense base in sterling. Of course, that's offsetting us, and
offsetting our revenue lines. And the one that Brian just walked you through, asset servicing, is one of the ones that has

a significant component of non-dollar-related revenues that's being impacted.
That being said, the underlying trends, we did make investments in this quarter to continue to manage down our cost
across a number of different line items. And I think we made some good progress that Gerald pointed out on the
occupancy front as we exited another building in Pittsburgh. And we got the benefit of our programs in New York
kicking in on a year-over-year basis as well as what we've done in Philadelphia and Boston. So there's a little more
room in occupancy. And we also continue to make investments in automation, and I think there is more to come there.
And also we did take some severance, which that gives us the opportunity to get our staff in the right locations as well.
So I think we're continuing to make good progress. I think Brian and I and Mitchell lead a team that identify
opportunities and continue to add to the list. And like we say, it's not a program, it's a process, and we're not complete
yet. I did give guidance for the full year in my opening remarks that we now anticipate expenses to be down 1% to 2%.
Frankly, that did get the benefit of the stronger dollar, but it's also reflecting that we've been able to do some of those
things at a little lower cost than we had anticipated.
Our compliance and regulatory costs continue to go up, and so we were running – right now we absorbed at a pretty hot
rate the cost associated with submitting our October 1 resolution submission. And we are continuing to work hard to
July of next year. Those costs will be relatively high, but we're absorbing it into the run rate from the other things that
we've been doing. And there's also a virtuous cycle that we get as we've invested in the actions to reduce our costs
across the board, and they're throwing off benefit that's giving us the opportunity to invest in additional actions. So if
we're saving 2% or 3% in expenses, we're putting 1% or 2% back into future benefits. So I guess the only guidance I
would give right now is that we do expect to be down for the full year in the 1% to 2% range, and there's more to come.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Thanks, Todd. Great color.

Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Hi, thanks very much, one quick follow-up on that whole balance sheet remixing and NIM
dynamics. You gave us a lot of detail on the deposit front. Was that the bulk of the eight basis points? Or is there – can
you tell us what you're doing on the asset side also in terms of – there was some commentary in the release on moving
towards higher yielding assets. Just curious for some color.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Glenn, the driver of our balance sheet is the right-hand side. So the actions in borrowing
through repo and reducing deposits, mostly out of our treasury department, is what brought the balance sheet down.
And what we did on the left-hand side was just reduce the lower-yielding assets. We are seeing some – we did see over
the course of the quarter some growth in our loan book, which is one of the highest yielding portfolios. So the
combination of those two things both increased NIR while bringing the balance sheet down. But there's no real remix,
if you will, outside of the actions I just described.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Cool, I appreciate that, and then one other follow-up on the asset management conversation. So I
guess I'm curious. You had mentioned some fee pressure for the industry. You also mentioned that you have some good
performance. But as you've been trying to build out the retail distribution side, we have the fee pressures you
mentioned, but also distributors are now looking for more compensation in a post-DOL world. Can you talk about some
of those pressures and how it impacts you guys specifically?
<A - Mitchell Evan Harris>: Yes, sure, a couple things. More than fee pressure, it's flow pressure. It's the amount of
outflows in the industry if you think about what's happened, though, obviously it does impact fees as well. And
particularly on the DOL side. I think there is a couple things on our retail basis. We're doing several things. First off
with the DOL, the focus is really on the home office now, not on the field. So we don't need as much field coverage as
we've had in the past, as the home office will be to a research-based model making decisions with respect to what goes
on their platform. I forget the exact amount, but if you look, I think it's at Merrill, they had about 4,000 products on
their platform and they're looking to go to 1,000.

So what happens is you have to have either highly active products or good priced passive products, with scale, with
performance and the right pricing in order to be on that platform. So we need to be in the position to be on that platform
by making sure the pricing is right and that we've got the right performing products for them. And as a result of that,
you will get a lot more scale because with a reduction of that many products, the assets will be much more concentrated
into fewer products. And we think we can position ourselves nicely to end up remaining on those platforms and
achieving the scale that will offset some of the price pressures, quite frankly.
<A - Brian Thomas Shea>: Glenn, just as a reminder, about 80% of our assets under management are institutional.
And so you're not feeling the same fee pressure there as opposed to being performance-driven. Second thing, from an
enterprise perspective, we have a very large distribution platform called Pershing. And so what may be a negative
effect on one side of the house, there is a positive effect on the other.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: I definitely appreciate that. Thanks.

Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Alexander Blostein>: Hey, guys. Good morning.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Good morning.
<Q - Alexander Blostein>: Hey, Todd, just a quick, I guess, another follow-up around the balance sheet and then NIR
discussion. If you look by bucket, it looked like security yield has dropped pretty meaningfully sequentially, and maybe
some of that at just a lower-rate back drop in Europe, but curious if you guys can give us a little more color, kind of
what's going on there. I don't know if there is any premium amortization that was hurting that this quarter that might or
may or may not reverse.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: There was a little premium amortization, there wasn't a significant drop there. In fact,
sequentially the securities yields were flat, Alex, they're down from a year-ago about 4 basis points. And we actually
think that we'll see that turn around a little bit. The recent movement in the yield curve is a net positive and some of
these securities are repricing at LIBOR and they're getting the benefit of higher LIBOR so we actually could expect
securities – the yield on securities to go up.
<Q - Alexander Blostein>: Got you. And then your comment around flat to slightly up in IR next quarter, does that
assume a December hike? And, I guess, if not, given the balance sheet moved around a little bit, all else equal, how I
guess should we be thinking about the NIM impact from 25-basis-point hike in December?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, well, 27 basis points won't – our 25 basis points in December won't do much for us
because it's such a short period, it could only be a couple of weeks in the entire quarter. So it wouldn't hurt, but it
wouldn't drive the needle a whole lot. We are getting some benefit from the LIBOR resets, so the LIBOR spreads are
up. They continue to be up and on average in the quarter. So we're starting to see some of that benefit now. And that's
primarily the – and that's probably the number one driver of why we will think that it's going to be up in the quarter.
Kind of two good things that happened this quarter or that's happening right now is number one, we're seeing the higher
short-term LIBOR rates and the yield curve has deepened a little bit, as we have some reinvestments to do in this
quarter. We're picking up a little benefit from that yield curve. And that's why we felt comfortable saying that flat to up
despite the smaller balance sheet that we're targeting for the quarter.
<Q - Alexander Blostein>: Right. Sorry. I should have said just kind of in a run rate steady-state benefit. So I get the
fourth quarter, not a ton of benefit, but I'm just saying like from a run rate perspective, what kind of sensitivity to the
NIM should we think about from a 25-basis-point hike.

<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Well, we've given you some color, if you look at the Qs and the sensitivity to a 100 basis
point, the rate move is typically in the vicinity of about $100 million to $150 million of benefit to net interest income.
And that includes – so the NIM is probably a little more positive because that includes some runoff and the size of the
balance sheet, yes, it's still positive to net interest income.

Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Good morning, Betsy.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: A couple of questions. One, Gerald, you mentioned in your prepared remarks about
the new growing revenue streams that you've got in some of your new businesses, I think specifically around investor
services, maybe you could speak to that a little bit and size it for us?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yes. What I was referring to is a couple, generally collateral management and the initial
margining that we put into place for the large broker dealers as they had to comply with a requirement as of September
1. We worked with all the market participants, got the documentation in place, the business is up and running. And
we're already seeing positive revenue flows as a result of that. Collateral management, broadly across the world,
continues to grow nicely. And Brian mentioned the mid-office outsourcing is a real opportunity. Now, we've got a lot
of people lined up and we want to make sure those dialogues are in such a way that they're willing to do more
standardized approach to mid-office servicing, so it's good for them and profitable for us. I'd say those are the key areas
that we see opportunities, Betsy.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: And the collateral management side is coming through the fee line or is it also partly
coming through the NII line?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: It's mostly fees.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Yeah, okay. And then the other question, Todd, for you is on the real estate activities
that you're doing and the shrinkage in real estate. You highlighted, what was it, 600,000 square feet coming off of your
books. Could you just give us a sense as to the size of that and how much it impacts your expense line? And then in
looking forward, how much of the real estate that you have today do you think that you could shed over the next year or
so?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Sure. So occupancy historically has been running, it was over $600 million. We brought it
– the run rate for the full year to under $600 million and we've actually brought down. We look at the – we call it
vacancy, but we look at the space per employ and we brought that number down dramatically as we have a lot of
vacant space throughout the company. So we're managing that far more aggressively. I wouldn't get fixated too much
on that line because that's $600 million of expense on an over $10 billion baseline. But it does improve where we were,
the efficiency of how we work and making sure that we're getting in the locations that are most efficient for our staff.
So little more on that line that we think we can do, and it's certainly nice to see it going down while revenues are
actually going up.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Okay. But your run rate this quarter suggests that there should be more downward
pressure there into next year as well, right?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: And it also, Betsy, we're running any actions that we're taking to reduce further cost
through that line. So from time to time, you may see us take some action if we shut something down, if we terminate a

lease early, something like that where you might see a little bit of a bump up in that. And we're just eating through that
line. So I can't really say that from quarter-to-quarter it's going to just flatten out. You might see it every now and then
that we've done something to improve the future quarters.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Okay. And then just trajectory on the overall efficiency ratio. I know you spoke
earlier to the asset management side of the business but maybe you could speak to the overall expense ratio of investor
services in the company generally. How much more legs do you think it has over the next cycle here?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Why don't I start on that one and then I'll hand it over to Brian? So if you look at the ratio
that we show you expenses or fees relative to expenses, and we've moved that. There is some seasonality to it but if you
adjust on a year-over-year basis, we've moved that meaningfully another 300 basis points this year versus – and a 300
basis points last year. So this particular quarter, we're now at 103%, which is the best that we've printed. So I think it's
reflecting the strategies that we've got. I mean one of the things that Brian pointed out, we're exiting some businesses
that were not profitable at high cost. So we've given up a little revenue but it's really benefited us in the profitability and
it's also benefiting us in this particular metric. In terms of where were more actions, more where you think we can go,
Brian?
<A - Brian Thomas Shea>: Yeah, no, I think that 103% is a record for us. And even adjusted for the seasonality and
depository receipts, it's still up significantly year over year so the core is improving. I'd echo your comments, Todd and
Gerald's comments, right? This business improvement process is really part of our cultural change and we're gaining
momentum. And we still have a pipeline of initiatives including people think of business portfolio reviews. We've done
some of that. But we're looking more now deeply at product services and solution portfolio revenues and again, making
sure that we're getting adequate return on the investments and adequate client adoption value from the investments we
are making.
So I think you'll see continued tweaking of the product service and solution portfolio review, continued progress on
every element of business improvement process. The alignment of the drivers of our cost and our client pricing. Gerald
mentioned the overdraft thing but we have a pipeline of other initiatives there. And we're driving more value from
enterprise team work which there is many examples of that.
But one is the NEXEN platform is going to be able to deliver the whole company in a way that enables us to drive cost
in the solutions more and more. And I guess the poster child for this working really well is the partnership between
Pershing and the private bank, where we now have well over $3 billion in credit facilities established from our private
bank to our independent broker dealer and RIA clients at Pershing. And that's a significant revenue driver for the
wealth management business and a great example of the leverage we can create sort of connecting the solutions across
the investment process. So all of those things are captured and tracked in the business improvement process and I think
we have more to do.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: The averages on the structural cost side, we're still finishing up converting a number of
operating platforms, where I think we're still in the early innings of further automation through artificial intelligence,
machine learning and robotics. I think we've got more work to do and more opportunity on chopping away at those core
structural costs. So we're actually fairly optimistic that we can keep on this space.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Okay. The pace that you've had over the last year, fairly optimistic you can keep that
going over the near-term.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: We can't get to infinite operating leverage or margins at 100%, we have to keep reinvesting
in the businesses, but we feel good that we can keep chopping away at the core structural cost of the company.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Thank you.

<Q - Mike Mayo>: Hi, Gerald, I just want to know the punch line from what you just said. You can keep chopping
away, and we've heard a lot of positive initiatives with the business improvement process from real estate, the cultural
change, digitization, and NEXEN, and you're optimistic that it can stay in place, on the other hand, the guidance that
you gave at the top of the call implies the profit margin, which was 35% in the third quarter, would decline in the fourth
quarter. So where do you think the profit margin should be over time and where do you think it will be?
And I guess I have some follow-ups to that, sub-point to the question, where will the pre-tax margin be. The investment
management slide, slide 19, that hasn't shown the good year-over-year improvement. You have middle-market
outsourcing, which in the past has caused some upfront costs. And I guess your money market fee waivers are mostly
recaptured?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Mike, this is Todd. I'll take the beginning of that and then just turn over the higher level to
Gerald. In terms of – just want to remind you, that the third quarter is a seasonally positive quarter to us because of our
DR business and we indicated in my remarks that we would expect that revenues associated with that business to
decline by $130 million in the fourth quarter and there are no real costs. That's basically a fixed cost business, so there
is no cost that come out as a result of that. And I also pointed out that the operating margin, it's a high watermark for
us, but not one that we would expect to see in more normal quarters, we expect to see it from the third quarter of next
year.
So what we have done is, if you seasonally adjust it, we are grinding the operating margins, I think we're seeing
positive leverage on a year-over-year basis, which I think is the way you have to look at it because we didn't have some
seasonality in our numbers. I don't know, Gerald, if you wanted to comment.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: On the investment management side, I think we said in the opening commentary and
Mitchell alluded to it, we are running through the expense base, severance costs, restructuring costs, shutting down a
business cost and the margin did in fact improve. We said publicly, and Mitchell and I are both committed to it, that we
can improve those margins further. It does require a certain level of revenue mix, but we're not going to depend on that.
And so we think there are further opportunities to improve the core functions and leverage the scale and breadth of the
rest of the firm as well as making sure that they continue to have the investment process totally under the control of the
investment management unit. So we think there are better ways to leverage the company, improve the margins in that
business as well.
And as I said to Betsy's question, everything within operations and technology investments we're making are paying
off. We're seeing it in the positive operating leverage. I'm not going to change guidance from Investor Day. Mike. I
know you keep asking me to do it each quarter, but I think we're fulfilling those goals. And we're going to talk to you at
this time next year about future goals for another three years.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Mike, I think you also had a question in there around fee waivers. And our view of fee
waivers right now is what we had indicated before the Fed move, => is that we thought a 50 basis point move would
result in about a 70% reduction in our fee waivers. Our fee waivers what we had indicated were running at about $0.06
to $0.08 a quarter. With the first 25 basis point move, it looked like we got about 50% of that. So that is in our run rate.
In the asset management business, the business has gotten a bit competitive, so it's eating in slightly to those numbers.
We would expect an additional 25 basis points or so to fulfill that 70% target that we had – or estimate that we had
previously given.
So if it's $0.07 a quarter if we get another 25 basis point move, we could say there's probably about another 20% of that
in there, so about $0.01 a quarter if we were to see another 25 basis point move. And that's probably maybe a little bit
more if we go beyond that, but not a whole lot more.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: And then I think I snuck in a question about middle-market outsourcing. In the past, that would
cause some upfront fees and you get the benefit down the road. Is that still the case?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Generally, that's the case, but as Brian and I both have said, we really want to make sure we
have the right kind of client with the right kind of mindset in terms of trying to do more standardized work versus
customized work. We do not want to take on business that will be long term a drag on our firm. And so we go through

a very, very robust analysis, and we've had experience from these different mid-office outsourcing arrangements. So
we're doing it in a very disciplined fashion, Mike.

Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Brian Bedell>: Great, thanks very much. Maybe just tag along on that question and tie it into the longer-term
trend post-DOL, on the mid-office, the standardized versus the customized, obviously the T. Rowe deal and large deals
like that tend to be more customized. Are you willing to look at taking on those big deals, or really going back to that,
that's more standardized strategy? And then do you think asset managers will essentially adopt that standardized
strategy? And then also on the clearing side, I think, Brian, you mentioned some benefits longer term from your
business on DOL and clearing, if you can elaborate on that a little more.
<A - Brian Thomas Shea>: So it's Brian. I'll start with the middle-office solution. So as Gerald mentioned, we really
are taking a business disciplined approach to this. And we're really making sure we're aligned with the asset manager
client on what they're trying to accomplish. And what they're really trying to accomplish is lower variable costs, lower
capital investment in technology, and creating shared economy to scale. So the best way to do that is to drive a more
common operating model and platform that more than one client can leverage because that's where the benefit comes
for us and for all the clients. And so we are only getting into these arrangements when we have the mindset of the
partner, as Gerald indicated, that enables us to create those shared economies of scale.
But we're also driving a technology platform strategy that's going to enable us to onboard these clients faster and make
it easier for them to get the customized information and data they want. So we've talked a lot about NEXEN and we
showcased it in August to a number of analysts, including many on this call. And basically, NEXEN is an API-driven
system, and it enables the asset managers to get the data they want on demand the way they need it. And so it's a much
more effective way of helping clients get the customized information they want without creating customized
development. And so that's going to be one of the ways we're able to not only meet asset manager needs effectively
without creating extra costs, we're also going to be able to speed the onboarding of these clients in the future.
<Q - Brian Bedell>: And then on the Pershing side?
<A - Brian Thomas Shea>: On the clearing side, look, each vector of the Department of Labor fiduciary standard to
drive more RIA activity, people are going to shift from commission-based traditional brokerage business to RIA. That's
been a cyclical trend for a long time. We expect it to accelerate. And so we expect real growth in our RIA custody
business, and we're helping our broker-dealer clients who want to take advantage of the best interest contract
component of the Department of Labor ruling. Pershing is developing the capabilities to help the clients comply, which
we think will help – which will help them.
But we're also providing all of the RIA custody and managed accounts tools and capabilities they need to shift their
business much more toward an advisory model. And our RIA custody business is growing at double-digits in terms of
revenue and in terms of AUC. So we're pretty well positioned to take advantage of the shift that's going to happen in
the RIA and in the RIA market.
<Q - Brian Bedell>: Do you think that could be fairly immediate, like next year?
<A - Brian Thomas Shea>: It's happening already. It's been happening but it's accelerating. Yes, and the DOL rule is
effective next year. So I think you're going to see real shifts in broker-dealer business models as a result.
<Q - Brian Bedell>: Great, and then just a longer-term question for both Gerald and Mitchell. As we think about the
active and passive trends, if they continue, how does that make you feel about consolidation or appetite for

acquisitions? I guess the question is, do you think there will be more consolidation in the asset management industry?
And do you think you can be a participant in that on the buy side?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: I do think there will be further consolidation. You just saw an announcement fairly recently
because it's going to become a scale business like our servicing businesses. We continue to look at our boutiques and
whether they have sufficient scale and capabilities. Virtually all of them do, and they're very strong in terms of their
investment performance in the size and scale of what they can offer the marketplace. So I do think it's going to be a
scale business. We're always mindful of looking at our portfolio the right way from a business and a shareholder
perspective, so we'll see.
<Q - Brian Bedell>: Okay, great. Thank you. Yes, please.
<A - Mitchell Evan Harris>: Just a little more color perhaps is that one thing I would just remind everyone is that on
the passive side, let me just mention that it's about revenues. And people talk about the assets on the passive side. They
don't make a lot of money in the margins on that. You're making one or two basis points and your operational risks are
enormous. So that clearly is a scale business that have a handful of players consolidating into. On the equity side, what
you saw with Janus and Henderson, if you don't have good performance you're not going to survive. So you're going to
see a lot of second, third, fourth quartile equity performers having to merge or get out of the market, that it's not
sustainable.
But in saying that active is going to continue to survive and thrive. We're largely in that space that we do have, as I
said, 18% exposure to the passive side. And there is some cyclicality to it. We've been in a seven-year or eight-year
bull market that favors indexing that. When those markets start to blip, and they will, active equity management, active
management is going to do well again. So it's a mixed story is what I'm saying and I think we're nicely positioned for it.
And we'll see what opportunities come up that make sense given where we're going with it all.
<Q - Brian Bedell>: Great. Thanks for that color.
<A - Mitchell Evan Harris>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Yeah, hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I actually want to
follow up on that RIA discussion briefly. We've seen increasing M&A and consolidation in the RIA channel. And so
when you think about going forward, one of the potential outcomes from DOL may be being a shift and a need for
scale, a greater need for scale certainly among the RIAs. Are you, or do you think or are you already seeing some of
that consolidation leading to more negotiating power for some of your counter-parties in that business? And then
maybe either current or the potential for some pressure on those revenue yields and margins?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: I think there will be consolidation in the retail advice business, so one, broker-dealers need
to shift toward an advisory model pretty rapidly. We're providing them with tools to do that successfully and I think
many of them will really make that pivot and succeed and they're deeply already on that trail. Some will struggle and I
think there'll be more consolidation in the broker-dealer market as a result. And to your point there may also be
consolidation in the advisory market.
Our model in the RIA market is more focused on larger registered investment advisory businesses so they're not
individual practitioners. We serve registered investment advisory companies and they tend to have groups of advisors
and they tend to be larger advisors. So to the extent that there is consolidation in that space, we think we'll be a
beneficiary of it, because we tend to [ph] serve (01:06:55) our average advisor is bigger and more likely to be an
acquirer than not. Although we're not immune from the market forces that are out there.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Great. Thanks for that.

<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: On the margin side I think they should be pretty steady. I don't think we're going to have
fee compression in terms of competitive pressure. I think overall, there's a broader-based sort of change underway in
advisor fees generally driven by a variety of factors including DOL, including the rise of digital advice and things like
that which could put some downward pressure. But if you look at the growth of assets and the growth of the wealth
market overall, I think that fundamental growth should offset some of the pressure on margins.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Okay. Great. Thanks for that. And then for my second question, spread
improvement in sec lending – apologies if you hit this before, but I don't remember hearing it. Could you maybe break
down how much of that was rate versus hard to borrow?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, I think we benefit in the securities lending and the agencies book on both of those
accounts. I don't have an exact split between the two, but we did benefit from the higher prior LIBOR rates and some of
the resets that come along with that. And there were quite a few specials in the quarter where we did benefit on as well.
So I'd say it was a combination of the two, specials probably being the greatest.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Okay. Thanks for the color.
<A - Valerie C. Haertel>: I think we have time for one more question.

Our final question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.
<Q - Brian Kleinhanzl>: Great. Thanks. Just one question on the asset management and the flows into LDI business.
They were a little bit lower than what they have been in recent quarters. But could you also remind us, how do those
flows react when rates rise? I mean, would that put less pressure on clients to use the LDI strategy?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: A couple things. First off, let me just touch on the flows. The average flows per quarter
last year were about $11 billion. This year, I'm sorry, that's this year. They're actually averaging $11 billion, even
though they were only $4 billion in the third quarter. They averaged $9 billion last year per quarter. So from an average
perspective, we're still seeing strong flows into LDI, and the pipeline is showing quite consistently. We see a pretty
strong and consistent pipeline for LDI business, number one. Number two, what you saw in the third quarter a little bit
is the impact because so much of it is related to sterling. The 15% drop in sterling has had an FX impact on what you're
seeing from the flows.
With respect to the interest rate rise and its impact, from a U.K. perspective, we don't foresee any interest rate rises.
And since the core of the business is there, we really don't see a significant impact there. The amount of business we
have or we'll start to have in the U.S. is fairly nascent. So we don't believe it will have a material impact on us as we
start to enter new markets and grow, quite frankly, where there hasn't been a lot of growth in the past. So we see it as
still a significant opportunity for us, irrespective of what happens to the interest rates.
In respect to interest rates, we don't see them moving that much.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yeah, interest rates are a long, long way away from where they are on a normalized basis
and in pension funds all around the planet. Can't get the returns they're looking for to satisfy liabilities. So I think this
business still has a legs to it.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah.
<Q - Brian Kleinhanzl>: Great.

Well, with that, I want to before closing the call, first of all, thank you all for dialing in and your interest in us. And, of
course, you can ask some follow-up questions with Valerie Haertel. But I also want to encourage you to watch the
premier of the documentary Hamilton's America, which is this Friday night on Thomas Broadcasting Systems, Great
Performance Series. It's a biography of our founder, Alexander Hamilton as seen through the lens of Lin-Manuel
Miranda. And he obviously created the hit show Hamilton over a six-year period of time.
I saw it the other night; it's fascinating. It's part of American history. I think you'll be enthralled with it, particularly if
you're a history buff and interested in how the financial markets started and evolved. So it's a great documentary, and I
encourage you to watch it. And, of course, we help sponsor it. And we also believe that Alexander Hamilton's
inventiveness and vision is still part of the DNA of our company, and we're going to continue that legacy forward.
So again, thank you for dialing in today, and we look forward to catching up with you soon. Thanks, everybody.
