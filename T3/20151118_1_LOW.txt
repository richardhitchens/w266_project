Good morning, and thanks for your interest in Lowe's. I'm pleased that we delivered another solid quarter with
comparable sales growth of 4.6% or 9.7% on a two-year basis. Our comp growth was balanced with a 2.5% increase in
comp transactions and a 2% increase in average ticket.
Our U.S. home improvement business achieved 5% comps for the quarter with all 14 regions generating positive
comps. While our businesses in Canada and Mexico delivered high-single-digit comps in local currency, our
consolidated comp was negatively impacted by foreign currency translation.
We generated positive comps in 12 of 13 product categories with outdoor power equipment delivering flat comps on
top of double-digit comps last year. We had strength in seasonal living, as customers took the opportunity to extend the
outdoor season driven by warmer and drier weather early in the quarter. Tools and hardware also performed well as
both Pro and DIY customers responded to the improvements we continue to make in our assortment, further enhanced
by exciting home center exclusives. And our strong brand and service advantages in appliances continue to drive
double-digit comps in the category for the fourth quarter in a row. Lastly, our Pro business also performed well as we
continue to build deeper relationships with the Pro by enhancing our product and service offering to meet their unique
needs.
For the quarter, gross margin expanded 26 basis points and we effectively controlled expenses, delivering 130 basis
points of operating margin expansion and earnings per share of $0.80, a 36% increase over last year's third quarter.
Delivering on our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, in the quarter we repurchased $750 million of
stock under our share repurchase program and paid $260 million in dividends.
We've been working to improve our product and service offering for the Pro customer and differentiating ourselves
through better customer experiences that make us the project authority. And we continue to enhance our omni-channel
capabilities, transforming our brand from a multichannel offering, in-store, digital, in-home, and by phone, to an
omni-channel experience where all of our channels work in concert with one another. To clarify, this transformation is
about much more than growing our e-commerce business. Our efforts are centered around supporting customers at
every step of the home improvement journey, and building greater affinity for the Lowe's brand.
I'm particularly encouraged by the momentum we're gaining through increased engagement with our in-home selling
efforts. During the third quarter, we expanded our Project Specialist Interiors program to an additional 475 stores and
now offer the program in 1,365 stores across the country. Coupled with our Project Specialist Exteriors program, which
is available in all U.S. home improvement stores and our highly motivated team of Account Executive ProServices who
continue to strengthen relationships with regional Pro customers, we have a strong outside selling force of more than
3,000 people who are able to meet customers on their terms either in their home or at their place of business.
The execution of our strategic priorities alongside a favorable macroeconomic backdrop make this an exciting time for
Lowe's. In fact, the forecast for key drivers of the home improvement industry remain conducive for growth at least
through 2017. Steady job and income gains, coupled with persistent home price appreciation and strengthening home
buying, should keep home improvement growth buoyant.
We continue to be pleased with the results of our quarterly Consumer Sentiment Surveys. Most encouraging, this
quarter is that the desire to invest in the home continues to grow as survey respondents are indicating that growth in
their home improvement spending is outpacing increases in their overall spending. In fact, the number of homeowners
indicating that their home improvement spending increased has almost doubled since 2012, boosted by the persisting
recovery in home prices. This trend underscores the opportunity we have to address the needs of 75 million
homeowners across the country who are increasingly willing to engage in home improvement projects, in addition to
the 5 million who relocate or move into a new home each year.
Before I close, I'd like to express my appreciation for our employees' purposeful commitment to serving customers. In
particular, I'd like to thank those Lowe's team members who worked diligently to assist our neighbors that were
impacted by the historic flooding in South Carolina. In addition to working around the clock to ensure our stores in the
affected communities were able to provide products needed for storm recovery efforts, many of our employees also
pledged their time to help individuals in need.

Thanks again for your interest, and with that, let me turn the call over to Rick.
Ricky D. Damron
Thanks, Robert, and good morning. As Robert shared with you, we delivered another solid quarter. The team executed
well, driving traffic to our stores, growing both transactions and average ticket for the quarter.
Our appliance category experienced the strongest growth in the quarter, producing double-digit comps. In addition to
our leading brands and service advantages in this category, our investments in customer experience are also having an
impact both in-store and online. We have further enhanced our appliance offering with the introduction of 17 appliance
suites, showcasing coordinated appliances, allowing customers to visualize how their appliance purchase will fit into
their space, not just as a single replacement purchase, but as a full set of new appliances. And because we understand
that more than 80% of customers begin their appliance purchase by researching and shopping online, we have enhanced
our customer experience and presentation on Lowes.com, including improved product search, enhanced videos,
upgraded presentation like 360-degree views and simplified product groupings.
In fact, J.D. Power and Associates ranked Lowes.com the number one appliance retailer website for 2015. Our
continued focus on improving the omni-channel customer experience together with leading brands, breadth of
assortment, competitive pricing, knowledgeable sales specialists, as well as delivery and haul away, combined to drive
our share gains in appliances.
Seasonal living also outperformed as we effectively anticipated customer needs and capitalized on favorable weather
conditions. Warmer weather in the north and west in the first half of the quarter drove strong demand for air
conditioners, and we were able to meet that demand thanks to the flexibility and capabilities of our distribution teams
as they worked efficiently to move product.
Further, our customer experience design capabilities continued to pay dividends. These capabilities were first
introduced with the Outdoor Living Experience, showcasing patio and outdoor fashion, which recorded strong comps
again this quarter. Along with the strong sales of patio furniture, we continued to see an increase in attachment of
related products such as cushions and other outdoor accessories. Our customer experience design capabilities take
advantage of our larger store format to produce a show room feel and create a more shoppable environment, which
drives higher customer engagement and stronger attachment rates.
The layout and adjacencies also make it easier for store associates to offer a more coordinated project solution to meet
customer needs. As we transitioned to fall, we leveraged this capability to create a seasonal stage to anticipate customer
needs for the season like planting, leaf removal and exterior maintenance. And as winter arrives, we will continue to
leverage this capability and seasonal stage to help customers refresh their homes for holiday guests, decorate, then
organize their home after the holidays.
This quarter, we also saw above average comps in tools and hardware driven by strong demand as well as our expanded
offering including continued innovation from brands such as Stanley Black & Decker, Hitachi, Bosch, DEWALT,
LENOX and IRWIN and improved brand relevance in critical categories like pneumatics, with our expanded line of
Hitachi pneumatic nailers and fasteners, a home channel exclusive to Lowe's. We recently completed the reset of our
pneumatics destination, featuring the three strongest brands in the category: Hitachi, Bostitch and Paslode. Our
pneumatic brand partnerships make us a clear destination for Pros and create opportunities to be more relevant to their
business.
Our paint performance was in line with the industry with a low single digit comp. With our launch of HGTV HOME by
Sherwin-Williams at the beginning of the second quarter, we are now providing our customers with top brands they
trust for their next paint project. Olympic provides quality at a lower price and easy application. Valspar specializes in
color authority with their Love Your Color Guarantee and HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams provides a strong brand
recognition, designer coordinated colors and quality customers trust. Paint employees are now able to meet the needs of
both DIY and Pro customers who have been shopping us for paint sundries and requesting Sherwin-Williams.

We also continue to see strength in our portfolio of Pro-focus brands. In addition to the brands we rolled out in the first
half of the year, including Goldblatt masonry tools, GAF roofing, Owens Corning insulation and Lennox HVAC, we
are proud to introduce Masonite Entry and Interior doors offering a key brand that Pros know and trust. These new
brands continue to build on momentum with the Pro customer and also represent the powerful partnership between our
ProServices and merchandising teams as we work together to incorporate Pro feedback into a better offering and
experience. This commitment is also evident in the assignment of field-based merchandising managers who are
working closely with the Pro customer to identify local market opportunities and introduce products optimized to local
norms to be more relevant with the Pro.
Along with strengthening our brand portfolio, we relaunched LowesForPros.com at the beginning of the second
quarter, making it easy for Pros to manage multiple properties and purchase items like appliances for their locations
nationwide. This full omni-channel experience allows Pros to easily order online and choose their preferred fulfillment
option of parcel, store pickup or store delivery, saving them time and money.
We are also reconnecting with Pros who have not recently purchased from Lowe's to show them what's changed in our
stores and online. We're using targeted marketing as well as Pro-focused events to drive awareness and generate new
business. For example, September was Pro Appreciation month. During the event, we offered vendor demonstrations,
special values on core Pro products throughout the store and drove awareness of the support we provide like job site
delivery and credit offers. Our focus on strengthening our portfolio of brands, and serving Pro customers through our
Account Executive ProServices team as well as the recent relaunch of LowesForPros.com, are part of a broader
commitment to build on our strong foundation with the Pro.
In addition to our efforts to drive topline growth, we continue to focus on driving productivity and profitability. During
the third quarter, our store teams once again effectively managed payroll increasing sales power in line with comps. We
continue to leverage our prior investments, optimizing store labor to meet customer demand, and continuing to focus on
shifting more hours to customer-facing roles. Most importantly, we have achieved this greater payroll efficiency, while
improving customer satisfaction scores.
We also drove productivity in marketing by using a robust set of analytic tools to optimize our media allocation,
leading to a reduction in print advertising and an increase in digital advertising and an expansion of social media,
increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of our media power and improving our advertising spend, all while
maintaining our customer reach and improving exposure. While we've already seen positive results from this work,
media optimization is a multi-year effort and opportunity.
We also continued to identify and implement additional expense efficiencies by consolidating the procurement of
similar types of goods and services across our corporate and store functions. For example, this year we have worked
cross-functionally to streamline the procurement process for supplies used across our stores, distribution centers and
our corporate office. Early results are favorable, with savings across multiple lines.
We have also worked to increase profitability for the services we offer without impacting the customer experience. For
example, as part of our appliance offering, we provide service advantages such as free delivery and haul away. This
year, as part of our appliance recycling program, we worked directly with [ph] end (15:55) recyclers to increase the
recycling income despite a decline in the metals commodity market. As you can see, we are pleased with the third
quarter results and the continued progress of our initiatives to drive top-line growth, productivity and profitability. We
look forward to sharing further progress with you over the coming quarters.
Thank you for your interest in Lowe's, and I will now turn the call over to Bob.

Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the third quarter were $14.4 billion, an increase of 5% driven
primarily by comp sales. Total customer transactions increased 2.8% and total average ticket decreased 2.1% to $67.34.
For the quarter, comp sales grew 4.6% and comp transactions grew 2.5% and comp average ticket increased 2%. The

monthly comps were 5.1% in August, 4.8% in September and 3.7% in October, while the monthly two-year stack
accelerated through the quarter. Year-to-date sales of $45.8 billion were up 4.9% versus the first three quarters of 2014,
driven by a 4.6% increase in comp sales and new stores.
Gross margin for the third quarter was 34.75% of sales, which increased 26 basis points over Q3 last year. The increase
was driven primarily by better sell-through of seasonal products and product cost inflation. Year-to-date gross margin
was 34.87% of sales, an increase of five basis points over last year.
SG&A for Q3 was 22.89% of sales, which leveraged 91 basis points driven primarily by four items. Advertising
expense leveraged 17 basis points as we transitioned to a more efficient and effective media mix. The proprietary credit
program leveraged 16 basis points due to continued growth in the program and lower operating costs. Cost associated
with building, maintenance and repairs leveraged 15 basis points largely due to the timing of projects as more of them
occurred in the first half of the year versus last year. Store payroll leveraged 13 basis points as we continue to optimize
hours against customer traffic. Numerous other expense lines also leveraged as a result of sales growth. Year-to-date
SG&A was 22.55% of sales, which leveraged 60 basis points versus last year.
Depreciation for the quarter was $375 million, which was 2.61% of sales and leveraged 13 basis points compared to
last year's third quarter as a result of sales growth. In Q3, earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, margin increased
130 basis points, 9.25% of sales. For the first three quarters of 2015, EBIT margin was 9.89% of sales which was 79
basis points higher than the same period last year.
For the quarter, interest expense was $141 million, which was flat to last year as a percentage of sales. Effective tax
rate for the quarter was 38%. Net earnings were $736 million for the quarter, an increase of 25.8% over Q3 2014.
Earnings per share of $0.80 for the third quarter were up 35.6% to last year. For the first nine months of 2015 earnings
per share of $2.70 was in line with our expectations, and represented a 20.5% increase over the same period last year.
Now to a few items on the balance sheet starting with assets. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter was
just over $1.2 billion. Our inventory balance of $10.4 billion increased $672 million or 6.9% versus Q3 last year. The
increase was driven by timing associated with seasonal builds. Inventory turnover was 3.85 times, up 12 basis points
over last year. Asset turnover increased 10 basis points to 1.75 times.
Moving on to liabilities, accounts payable of $7.3 billion represented a 13.6% increase over Q3 last year caused by the
timing of purchases year over year. In the third quarter we issued $1.75 billion of unsecured bonds.
The bonds consisted of three, 10- and 30-year issuances with a weighted average interest rate of 3.45%. A portion of
the proceeds was used to repay a $500 million obligation in October. At the end of the third quarter, lease adjusted debt
to EBITDAR was 2.17 times. Return on invested capital increased 276 basis points for the quarter to 15.78%.
Now looking at the statement of cash flows, operating cash flow was $4.5 billion, capital expenditures was $844
million, resulting in year-to-date free cash flow of $3.7 billion. In September we entered into a $500 million accelerated
share repurchase agreement. We expect to receive approximately 7.3 million shares but the ultimate number of shares
will be determined upon completion of the program in the fourth quarter. We also repurchased approximately 3.5
million shares for $250 million through the open market. In total we repurchased $750 million in the quarter. We have
approximately $4.1 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization.
Looking ahead, I'd like to address several of the items detailed in Lowe's business outlook. As Robert noted, the
forecast for key drivers of home improvement industry remain conducive for growth, and as our year-to-date
performance is in line with our expectations, we are maintaining our outlook for the year. We expect a total sales
increase of approximately 4.5% to 5% driven by comp sales increase of 4% to 4.5% and the addition of 15 to 20 stores,
which includes five Orchard and two city center locations.
We're anticipating an EBIT increase of 80 basis points to 100 basis points and are targeting 25 basis points to 30 basis
points of EBIT expansion per point of comp above 1%. While this is our expectation for the year, as we've seen, there
will be some choppiness quarter to quarter. For the year, we expect that most of the EBIT improvement will come from
SG&A. Expense leverage will come from store payroll, marketing and leveraging our scale to achieve cost savings on

indirect spend. In addition, we expect fixed cost leverage associated with sales growth.
The effective tax rate is expected to be 38.1%. The higher rate relative to 2014 is a result of settlement of prior year tax
matters recognized in Q1 2014. The higher rate negatively impacts earnings growth by roughly $0.06 per share. For the
year we expect earnings per share of approximately $3.29, which represents an increase of 21.4% over 2014.
We're forecasting cash flows from operations to be approximately $5 billion. Our capital forecast is approximately $1.3
billion, which results in estimated free cash flow of $3.7 billion. We will continue to manage to the 2.25 times lease
adjusted debt to EBITDAR target. Our guidance assumes approximately $3.8 billion of share repurchases for 2015.
Regina, we're now ready for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Thanks. Good morning. So first question, I think it could be a key question of the quarter
is the flow-through, which was a welcome improvement. My question 's on the sustainability of it. You've been
discussing it especially in the back half some indirect expenses coming out of the business and I think Q4 also screens
pretty well forward. So as we head into Q4 and to next year, any reason why we shouldn't see this type of incremental
margins continue?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: So, Simeon, no. As we think about Q4, the drivers that came to fruition in Q3 should remain for
Q4. Obviously our outlook is 25 to 30 basis points of EBIT expansion per point of comp above 1%. Q4 we do have
tougher comparisons going up against a 7.3% comp for Q4 last year. So the [ph] ultimate (25:25) EBIT expansion will
be largely determined based on the comp growth in the quarter. But the factors that drove the 130 basis points in Q3
should remain going forward.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Simeon, this is Robert. Just as we indicated throughout the year, this year as we've had our
quarterly earnings releases, we give guidance for the year with the flow-through, but there can always be choppiness
quarter to quarters, like you've seen this year. But on an annual basis it's basically what Bob has told you from a
guidance standpoint.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Okay. And then second, the follow-up, you mentioned the consumer sentiment survey
that the growth in home improvement is outpacing spending. Do you have additional context on that? Is the rate of
what they're going to spend in home improvement, how is that changing?
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Simeon, as we survey our customers and what they tell us for their intentions with respect to
spending and we look at – overall their level of spending is not increasing, but the amount that they are allocating to
home improvement, they're indicating that they're spending more in home improvement. Then obviously how much of
that winds up in our channels, which you have to look at. But it was a significant increase over what we had seen last
year in the third quarter.
And as you know, sentiment doesn't always turn into action. So it's a leading indicator. We think that when you look at
what's happening in the overall macro environment, when you look at what's happening with home prices, it once again
speaks to the fact that consumers are re-engaging in discretionary spending around the home. And so when we see them
leaning that way, it gives us confidence and all the numbers that are built into our outlook for the remainder of this year
and also as we lean into 2016, but we did see a nice pickup in what their intentions were.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Right. And then the survey, does this push into your 2017 outlook? Or is there other
factors that are more of a macro look?

<A - Robert F. Hull>: Those are same factors that we used to provide the 2017 outlook at the analyst conference last
year. Obviously the drivers of our business, income and housing, right, so as we think about more people working and
starting to see some wage appreciation, those are positive factors and then on the housing front, housing turnover
continues to pick up and we see ongoing home price appreciation. So all the macro factors that drive our industry
continue to line up for sustained growth through 2017.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Matthew Jeremy Fassler>: Thanks a lot, and good morning. Congratulations on the quarter. My first question
relates to inventory. If you could just give us a little more clarity about the increase, which was a bit of a departure for
you, and also how we should think about the relationship between that inventory number and your gross margin
increase, if any?
<A - Ricky D. Damron>: Matt, I'll start. This is Rick. The 6.9% increase in inventory reflects our preparation for our
Q4 advance coming up as well as being in stock on some critical items our customers deem to be most relevant. So the
increase is really driven by timing associated with getting inventory in for our advance for Q4. Looking forward as we
look into year-end inventory in Q4, we expect our inventory levels to be marginally higher, but this is being primarily
driven by the timing of Chinese New Year, which is roughly 11 days earlier this year than last, which pushes some
order purchases earlier in the cycle for the seasonal build for 2016. But when you look at the number in totality, it's
really driven by our preparation for Q4.
<A - Robert F. Hull>: Matt, the second part of your question related to gross margin. We don't see any gross margin
pressure. As Rick said, this is inventory purchase for anticipated sales in the quarter. It's non-perishable product and the
other item I would add is really no working capital impact as we've seen a corresponding increase in accounts payable.
<Q - Matthew Jeremy Fassler>: Got it. And just a quick follow up, you did everything you said you would do on the
margin and expense front in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, you sort of indicated to do it again. Now I know that
the drivers of expense leverage were pretty diverse. It came from a bunch of different places. As we think about the
fourth quarter drivers, anything you would point to in particular?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: No, Matt, really the same drivers. So we should see some, again, modest gross margin
expansion. We ought to see leverage in credit, in bonus, in advertising, in store payroll, so all the factors that drove Q3
should again drive operating margin expansion in Q4.
<Q - Matthew Jeremy Fassler>: Thanks so much, guys.
<A - Robert F. Hull>: You bet.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Robert Baird. Please go ahead.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Yes. Hey, guys. I was wondering, can you talk a little bit about the Pro marketing efforts in
the second half? I know you mentioned September being the Pro Appreciation month. You've done a lot of work to get
the foundation in place to serve the Pro better. Can you talk about or give us a sense of how you're going to be speaking
to the Pro more aggressively over the next several quarters?

<A - Ricky D. Damron>: Yes, Peter, this is Rick. As we think about the Pro, we continue to leverage our Account
Executive ProServices teams to meet with Pros on their job sites to really understand what their needs are and where
they're moving. We're continuing to leverage our in-store teams in our account management processes to make sure
that we're communicating effectively around the relevant products for the particular times of the year and the particular
jobs they're working on.
And then from a mix perspective, most of our Pro marketing is really targeted messaging from a direct communication
standpoint, targeted messaging through email or radio. So we'll continue to build upon what we've done over the last
several quarters, leveraging both our field teams as well as our marketing programs to communicate effectively with
the Pro.
<A>: And just to build on that, you'll see us leverage some of our digital assets as well. So we talked quite extensively
about LowesForPros.com gives us a ability to reach the Pros. You'll see us use some of our more creative online
techniques to get the right promotion in front of the Pro at the right time. You'll see us, as we continue to migrate more
towards digital away from print, with Pros you'll see us take a slightly different balance where we use some print to talk
to them as well.
I think the key is that what we've done is we've made a concerted effort to make sure we have the right brands that Pros
need, and now we're starting to reach out to those Pros much more efficiently and effectively so we can get the right
promotion along with those brands in front of the Pros.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Thanks for that, guys. And then just maybe a follow-up for Bob. The 2.25 times leverage
target, I know you've been operating below that to a degree. It sounds like your view on the macro continues to kind of
get better. What conditions do you think need to be in place for you to kind of get to that 2.25 times level, if you can
share that? Thank you.
<A - Robert F. Hull>: Sure. So it's a couple things, Pete. So it's a matter of forecasting. Number one, we were at 2.17
times end of Q3, so not too far off. As we think about the fourth quarter, we've got perspective on sales and
profitability, perspective on working capital. It's just a matter of how close do we want to balance the borrowing at
year-end relative to our expectations. So I would expect us to be somewhere in the 2.15 times to 2.25 times range at
year-end.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Okay. Perfect. Thanks so much, guys.

Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan.
<Q - Christopher Michael Horvers>: Thanks. Good morning. So store payroll leverage showed some very nice
improvement from 2Q. Can you talk about what's driving that overall? Is there something more systematic going
around labor management systems, is it process improvement, is it focus? Any detail there would be great.
<A - Ricky D. Damron>: Yes, Chris, this is Rick. As we continue to look at store labor, we've talked about the tools
that we've deployed to help our store teams and our field teams to manage our labor more to customer traffic. So we're
continuing to see those tools pay dividends for us as we continue to match our hours more to traffic. We continually
focus on making sure that we're doing everything possible to increase our customer-facing roles. Most of that is
through process improvement as well as the utilization of technology within the stores, making it simpler for our
employees to engage with the customer, and improving our processes that make it easier for them to interact both with
the customer as well as through the tasking process that we have within our stores.
Chris, one of the things, to give you an example of something that seems simple that can have a significant impact, is
we're now leveraging a lot of the tools that were used in our stores which is the way finding app on our digital
platforms, and now we incorporate that information on every product label for every item shipped from our distribution
centers. So when that package arrives, it will tell the employee the exact aisle and bay location that product is stocked.

So as you can imagine, tremendous efficiency for newer employees in trying to manage and navigate our stores makes
the whole process much more effective, much more efficient.
We transferred several of our processes that were manual, paper-driven processes to more technology-driven,
leveraging the iPhones and the iPads that we've deployed into our stores to make them more efficient. So what you're
seeing is an accumulation of better tools to drive better payroll efficiency, the continued focus on making sure that
we're leveraging customer, employee hours to customer traffic and then the continued work to drive better productivity
through the tools that we provide our employees.
<Q - Christopher Michael Horvers>: And so, do you think – because it was a lot better in 3Q versus 2Q, do you think
this is the inflection that's really gelled around the payroll management process as you look forward?
<A - Ricky D. Damron>: Yes. As we continue to look forward, I think we'll continue to see solid payroll efficiency.
<Q - Christopher Michael Horvers>: Okay. And one of the questions that we're getting is the performance in October
and how to interpret the deceleration? Two-year stack did accelerate and they didn't look very strong. But if we held
stacks in the 4Q would suggest comps decelerated about 200 basis points. So anything to point out there around
October and your thoughts about the current quarter. Thanks.
<A - Robert F. Hull>: So, Chris, in the quarter, weather had no net impact to the three-month period. We did have
favorable weather in the first part of the quarter, a little tougher weather toward the end of the quarter. Second, and as
you suggest, we did see two-year stack acceleration throughout the quarter, so we feel really good about our ability to
deliver comp-on-comp. As we look to 4Q, we would expect further acceleration on a two-year basis into Q4. As it
relates to November to-date, we're in line with our expectations and are really excited about Q4.
<Q - Christopher Michael Horvers>: Thanks very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Laura Champine with Cantor Fitzgerald.
<Q - Laura Champine>: Good morning. You did a good job of expanding gross margin despite such strength in
appliances, which is typically a lower margin category. What is your expectation in Q4 for mix's impact on your gross
margins?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: So mix should have a negligible impact. As Rick noted, we're now in four straight quarters of
double-digit appliance comps. We cycle some tougher compares although appliances continue to perform well. So mix
should be a little bit less pressured in Q4 and going forward, for that matter.

<Q - David Schick>: Hi. Good morning. Rick, a question for you or maybe Rick and Mike. You're talking about
sitting down with the Pro and the merchandising changes and all of that. Where do you think the balance of the
opportunity is in the Pro? Is it pros you already have spending more? Or is it pros you're not reaching? And if so, where
are they coming from?

<A - Michael A. Jones>: This is Mike Jones. I'll start. We think the answer is yes. We think it's the pros that we
already have spending more. And we know that there are pros today that have – that drive past us to go someplace else.
And we know we can do a better job at bringing them into our stores. And so we started by ensuring that we have the
right inventory depth, the right brands, the right local market assortment. And as that was corrected, we feel real
comfortable about where we are. From there, we started to turn on our marketing so that we can start to invite those
pros back in. So we're excited about both the pros we have, it's still a big part of our business, and we're excited about
the pros that historically have purchased someplace else and now come in and trying the experience at Lowe's.
<A - Ricky D. Damron>: David, this is Rick. I'll just add, when we look at the Pro in general, we're very excited about
what we're seeing from both a transaction point of view and a comp across all ticket ranges. So when you look at
comps by ticket size and the way we evaluate those, we're seeing positive growth across all tickets, which is telling us
that we're getting some new accounts in, but we're also selling our existing accounts more.
The other thing through our Pro appreciation events and what we're doing to really target pros to the new brands, the
increased inventory depth and our five ways to save value propositions we're doing, we saw a strong double-digit
growth in new accounts during Q3 as well. So I think that also goes to support the fact that we're becoming more
relevant, that the brands that we're introducing have an increased awareness with the Pro and then the aspects of
services that we're providing is beginning to resonate as well.
<Q - David Schick>: Great. As a follow-up, Bob, you mentioned more efficient and effective media mix. Understand,
I think, the efficient side. Could you give numbers on effective in terms of how many you're reaching or some way for
us to think about that?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: So, I'll start and let Mike jump in. So, Dave, we're doing some media mix modeling, so we're
trying to understand the impact of different mediums on different markets and we're adjusting accordingly. So
ultimately, we're taking a look at the most effective yields which is the sales dollar yielded for a dollar of marketing
spent. We have shifted some – as Rick mentioned in his prepared comments -- we've shifted some dollars away from
print towards more digital assets. We're able to reach more folks in a very cost-effective way, which gets into the
effectiveness of – and efficiency of marketing.
<A - Michael A. Jones>: And just to build on it, if you look at the way we've remixed our advertising and marketing
spend, we're moving more towards digital, more toward social media and less out of the more traditional way,
advertising vehicles. I'll give you some numbers, a way to think about this. Just looking at social media, Lowe's
followers on Facebook are over 3 million; Pinterest, just about 3.5 million followers; Lowe's video views, well over 70
million. So we see – one easy way for us to track is just to watch our activity in social media. Our digital footprint is
very, very large and we continue to increase it, so we're quite proud of the work that's happened there.
<Q - David Schick>: Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Budd Bugatch with Raymond James.
<Q - David Joseph Vargas>: Good morning. This is David Vargas on for Budd. Thank you for taking my question.
On the Pro business, can you tell me what the Pro penetration was this year versus last year and also what categories
within Pro saw the strongest comp sales growth?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: So, David, the Pro is an inexact science. We have some direct measurements of them. Relative
to managed accounts and credit vehicles, there's some imprecise measures. Currently the Pro mix is about 30%. In the
past three quarters, it's grown in line with the [ph] company (42:27) average. The fourth quarter last year was a little bit
faster, so that would suggest it's migrated from a little bit higher, in that 30% range.
<Q - David Joseph Vargas>: Okay. And then what categories did you see the strongest growth in year-over-year?

<A - Ricky D. Damron>: A couple actually. I'll pick on a tools where we've really worked diligently to get the right
brands. So we've added brands like IRWIN, LENOX, we've added Hitachi, we've added Goldblatt, as an example. You
couple that with the brands like DEWALT, Kobalt, Porter-Cable, Bosch, we saw double-digit growth in pneumatics,
we saw very strong growth in cordless power tools, accessories and rotary tools. And we watch tools in particular
because it's a good indicator of how well we're engaging the Pros.
And this isn't just adding brands by happenstance. If you look at the way we've added brands around pneumatics, we've
added Hitachi to complement our offering in Bostitch and Paslode. So we have the three best brands in pneumatics. If
you want to buy pneumatics as a pro, we feel that Lowe's is certainly the best place to come. So we look at each
category. We strategically decide how to best serve the Pros. We build brands that complement one another, and from
there, we increase our relevant engagement with the Pro. We certainly saw it in tools, we see it across the stores as we
continue to grow our Pro business.
<Q - David Joseph Vargas>: Got it. Thanks. And then finally, one more question on just the consumer in general.
What are you seeing this year versus last year in terms of customer spend on large ticket discretionary, like kitchen
remodel, bathroom remodel? And are they moving towards more of that discretionary spend from, I guess, general
maintenance and repair of large ticket items?
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: I'll start. This is Robert, and then I'll let other guys finish. Certainly when we look at
consumers' discretionary versus non-discretionary spend, we're seeing that when you combine small and large
discretionary spend, what they're telling us that more than 50% of their spend is on a discretionary basis, which is
tripped over from where it would've been prior years, so we're seeing it move above that 50% level.
When you look at – and we talked about appliances being double-digit comps for the quarter, we've talked about some
of the project spending and initiatives that we're putting behind that, whether that's project specialist interiors, which is
major interior remodels or project specialist exteriors, which is the exterior, programs we do, fencing, siding, new
windows, those type of things, both of those programs had double-digit comps in the quarter.
So appliances, PSI, PSE all running double-digit comps in the quarter, so we are seeing that consumer take on that
willingness to spend around the home on discretionary projects driven by, as I've said my comments, some macro
factors as well as continued comfort that comes from home price appreciation that they're seeing.
<A - Robert F. Hull>: The other item I would add, in addition to Robert's comments, is if you take a look at tickets
above $500, comped 7.2%, so we continue to see strong growth in the big-ticket categories.
<Q - David Joseph Vargas>: Got it. Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Mike Baker>: Thanks. I'll finish it up with – or looks like we're getting towards the end -- with one bigger picture
question; this is for Mr. Niblock. You're still a couple of hundred basis points away from your peak operating margin.
But I think as you guys like to say, you have line of sight to it. When you start to get to that double-digit opportunity
margin, how do you think about balancing further margin gains with some top-line initiatives? Ever so subtly, you're
increasing your store count growth in other regions, in other formats, your competitor just made an acquisition. How do
you think maybe some new top-line growth initiatives to balance that margin gain? Thanks.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: It's a great question, Mike. When you think about it from where we peak our operating
margins previously to where we're at today in trying to hone back in on that, we really are a totally different company.
If you think about back in those days, it was single-channel. We were on a rapid expansion of the store footprint. We
think the store is still the nucleus of our relationship with the customer, but the store in and of itself is not enough. You
really have to be there on an omni-channel basis for the customers, so that's why everything we've been investing in for
the past few years is really to be able to deliver that omni-channel offering so that we take those stores, we continue to

build on those and leverage them where you can do the PSI, PSE programs that we just talked about, whether it's the
improvements that we've made on dot-com, whether it's all the improvements that we've made with the Pro customer to
really get us back to the point, where then we can look at other opportunities to try and grow that top line.
So certainly, we expect to continue to have gross margin – operating margin improvement, continue to have nice
flow-throughs and drive comp sales improvement like the guidance that we've given you. But we will continue to look
at how are there other opportunities as the consumer changes, the way the consumer wants to interact with us changes,
what are the other opportunities where we can do things that will continue to allow us to pursue opportunities for
growth, particularly in a recovering market and the affinity that we're seeing from the consumer around investing in the
home. So whether it's stuff like LowesForPros.com that we invested in because we know that that was a key gap that
we had there, whether it's rolling out additional PSI programs like we added this quarter in the store, you'll see us
looking at ways that we can continue to make sure that we're responding to where the customer wants to go. And we'll,
whatever that ends up being, we'll end up evaluating that, but also using the base of stores we have to continue to drive
nice flow-through.
<Q - Mike Baker>: Okay. Thank you. One follow-up is, on the previous question, you had said that now more than
50% of spend as you talk to your customers is discretionary. Can you tell us where that was at a peak probably in 2006
or 2007 and where it troughed out when housing crashed? Thanks.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: I don't have the numbers back before the peak as to the exact numbers as to where it was at,
that would be back in the 2000 and...
<A - Robert F. Hull>: 2009 is when we started the survey.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: 2009 is when we started the survey, Bob is saying, so we don't have the numbers back
before the decline.
<A - Robert F. Hull>: What we are seeing though is a greater proportion of customers telling us they're leaning into
the bigger ticket discretionary from smaller ticket discretionary as you think about greater consumer sentiment,
confidence around their personal job situation and home appreciation, they're starting to think about these bigger ticket
discretionary projects.
<Q - Mike Baker>: Okay. Understood. Thanks a lot, guys.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. So how do we think about the
underperformance or the below-average comp in categories like kitchen, millwork, flooring, in light of your
commentary about the success of the Project Interior Specialist program?
<A - Ricky D. Damron>: Go ahead.
<A - Michael A. Jones>: This is Mike Jones. Look, the categories were below average but driven largely by the
strength in appliances and seasonal living. We had a couple categories like millwork and OPE. They were up against
significant comps well into the double-digit comps last year same time. So I think the Consumer Sentiment Survey is
probably a better indicator. They're looking at the distribution of our above average and below average. I just
encourage you to keep in mind that all of our categories are positive with the exception of OPE, which was about flat.
So again we remain pretty encouraged by what we're seeing both on the big-ticket as well as other transaction side of
our business.

<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: So then if we assume that those two categories added about 100 basis points to your
overall comp, do you think that the market in the areas surrounding your store for categories like kitchen, flooring,
appliance, millwork is growing in the 3% to 4% range?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: I can say that the categories that you asked about did comp in the 3% to 4% range. As Mike
said, they were positive, but they were below the company average based on the strength of the appliance and seasonal
living businesses.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: Okay. Is that the rate of growth you would expect at this point in the cycle for those
categories?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: So the market specific growth is based on the state of the economy and housing in those
markets. So the facets that drive the macro Lowe's business also drive each individual market. Housing and incomes in
those markets, some higher, some lower depending on where they are in the housing cycle.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: Got it. My last question is and I'm sorry to pick on all the other categories, but paint has
been below the company average for five quarters in a row despite the launch of some new products within the
category. Can you talk about the reason for the underperformance, especially because paint is a category that's attached
to a lot of other home improvement products whether it's inside or outside of a house?
<A - Ricky D. Damron>: Sure. I can talk to that. The paint industry in total is below the average, and so our paint
performance is about in line with the industry. I'd say we're not satisfied with that, we want our paint performance to be
above the industry as are most of our other business units. That said we're seeing good momentum with HGTV by
Sherwin-Williams. We got a great relationship with Valspar and with PPG, with the Olympic brands. We've leaned
pretty heavy into some promotions around paint as I'm sure you've seen. Our promotional cadence year-over-year is
about the same, but we did redirect a little more towards paint and we're pretty excited about our paint lineup. But that
said, the industry is below the average and we're running it above average to the industry.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: Thanks so much, and good luck with the holiday.

Your next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: Good morning, guys. I actually have another SG&A follow-up. I mean obviously you guys had
very strong leverage in the quarter. You talked about that continuing going forward. But looking at the data a little bit
differently, you generally been posting SG&A per store growth of about 2% to 3% unless comps were call it sub 1%.
This quarter it was only about 50 basis points on a very strong mid-single digit comp. Can you help us better
understand what changed in the expense growth rate? Is it, you know, you just don't have to spend any more on labor
and you kind of topped out? Is it advertising flattening out that reduced losses on international ops? I guess I just want
to understand kind of what's changed in that run rate and how we should think about that going forward?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: Yes. So we talked about the choppiness quarter-to-quarter in the flow-through that's a variety of
factors, performance relative to plan drives, those accruals year-over-year. The nature of the credit program as we think
about portfolio performance, loan-loss reserves that's driving some expense leverage second half of this year relative to
first half. As I mentioned in my comments regarding building repairs and maintenance, our plan is more front half
loaded, therefore we're getting leverage based on the timing of projects year-over-year. So there's just a variety of
factors that contribute to movement year-over-year. I think that if I had to leave you with a punchline, you heard us talk
about steps we're taking in payroll, in advertising, in indirect spend that are sustainable will drive benefit through 2015
into 2016.
<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: So a run rate, is it something – Bob, is it something between kind of what we saw – in terms of
SG&A actual growth, is it something between what we saw in the first half and third quarter because of kind of the

timing differences? Or when we kind of think about the longer term model, what's the right way to think about it?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: So for 2015, SG&A grows at roughly 46% of the rate of sales growth. I think something close
to that 50% is probably the right way to think about it.
<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: Got you. And then just hopefully a clarification. There was a bunch of questions on Pro sales
and ticket size. When you guys look at your ticket size buckets, the strongest growth continues to be in those higher
ticket transactions over $500. Is it fair to assume that it's primarily driven by Pro customers, or is it kind of more of a
50-50 deal between Pro and DIY because of appliances and other high-ticket items, specifically within that over $500
bucket?
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: So as you think about the mix of our business, it's 70% DIY, 30% Pro. However, the Pro
ticket is larger than the DIY Pro, so the driver of the big-ticket is probably going to be closer to 60/40, DIY to Pro.

Your next question comes from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Hey. Regina, this will be our last question.
<Q - Seth M. Basham>: Well, thanks. I got in under the gun. My question is around close rates. You guys have talked
in the past about how you've done with close rates. Given the fact that you're optimizing labor, any update there on how
close rates and customer satisfaction is proceeding here?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: So Rick talked about customer satisfaction, we continue to see very strong customer sat results
through our Customer Focus Program. And as you think about close rates, we've done a lot of things to address all the
potential factors that might impact close rate both the quality and quantity of labor, the depth of inventory, the local
assorting. Rick mentioned way finding which is the ability to navigate our stores. So a lot of good steps we've taken. As
a result, we're seeing roughly 100 basis point improvement in close rate this year relative to last year.
<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: That's helpful color. As a follow-up, just to tie the knot on the near-term outlook, comp store
sale trends accelerated throughout the third quarter to a 6.6% comp in October, 11% on a two-year stack. How do you
think about the fourth quarter? I mean can you hold that 11% two-year stack rate?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: That's the expectation. So we've seen good sequential progress through the quarters. We saw
sequential progress through the months of Q3. As Robert talked about in his comments, good momentum as it relates to
the consumer and drivers of our industry. And each day, our execution continues to improve. So we feel good about the
ability to drive and achieve or exceed the outlook we put forth for the year.
