Throughout this conference call we'll be making references to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. The
matters we'll be discussing today include forward-looking statements and as such are subject to the risks and
uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on Form
10-K and Form 10-Q and any applicable amendments which identify important risk factors that could cause actual
results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements.
Unauthorized recording of this conference call is not permitted. All comparisons through this call will be on a
year-over-year basis unless stated otherwise. As we have said in the past, we will discuss product results in terms of
revenue and geographic and customer segment results in terms of product orders unless specifically stated otherwise.
I'll now turn it over to John for his commentary on the quarter.
John T. Chambers
Mel, thank you very much.
Our Q2 results reflect continued progress as we transform Cisco to become the number one IT company. In the quarter,
we grew revenue to $11.9 billion, up 7% and grew non-GAAP earnings per share to $0.53, up 13% year-over-year. We
generated $2.9 billion in operating cash flow this quarter and returned $2.2 billion to our shareholders through share
repurchases and dividends. We delivered this strong performance despite a volatile economic environment.
Our strong momentum is the direct result of how well we have managed our company transformation over the last
3-plus years, and our leadership position in the key technology transitions such as cloud, mobility, big data, security,
collaboration and the Internet of Everything.
The four key takeaways I have from this quarter are the following. First, we are executing well and growing at a
healthy pace in a tough environment. Second, we saw very good balanced growth, the best balance in 12 quarters
across the majority of our key geographies, product categories and customer segments.
Third, our financials are very strong and we continue to deliver value for our shareholders with strong earnings, cash
generation and capital return, including another $0.02 dividend increase to $0.21 per quarter. And fourth, every
country, every city, every business, every home and every car is becoming digital. In our view, Cisco is better
positioned than any other company to help our customers reinvent their business and technology strategies as they
become digital organizations.
Today, every company and every industry is a technology digital company, something people would not have said a
year ago. Over the last month I've met individually with over 100 business and government leaders. Without exception,
these leaders recognize the role technology plays in their future, not just how it creates opportunity but also risk.
Customers around the world, both business and governments, are aligning with strategic partners in order to be more
successful in the digital transition. They are increasingly choosing Cisco as their strategic partner and you are seeing
the evidence in our financial performance.
Let's start with a basic question, like why Cisco? With the network at the center, Cisco has the portfolio and the ability
to bring our customer solutions to drive down costs, help secure their businesses and increase the speed and agility so
they can innovate across their own organizations. In our view, our track record of disrupting markets by leveraging the
power of the Internet is unmatched. Our strategy has always been based on understanding the direction of major market
transitions, transforming ourselves to meet the needs of our customers, and demonstrating the courage to disrupt not
just the markets but even ourselves.
The market is moving fast, and change is exponential. We are in the strong position we are today because we made
dramatic moves in how we're innovating, how we're interfacing with our most important customers and how we're
organized to ensure Cisco is leading where the market is going. Most companies resist changing until it's too late and
their market credibility has eroded, the classic innovators' dilemma.

It was our choice to move early and boldly with incredible speed to realign 40% of our employees to priority areas, to
reorganize from product groups and to integrate solution teams, to replace more than 30% of our leaders. We are seeing
the results in our relevancy with our customers and our operational excellence, and that is driving our financial
performance, where, since fiscal year 2011, we have added $4.9 billion in revenue with about $300 million in
incremental non-GAAP OpEx. Said another way, for every dollar of revenue we've added over this transition period,
we've only added about $0.06 of non-GAAP OpEx. I think you'll find this is best in class by a factor of 5- to 10-fold.
In the 1990s, we were the best example of a company capitalizing on the Internet, and that gave us tremendous
credibility with customers and fueled our growth. Today, as every company becomes digital, every CEO knows he or
she needs to evolve the organization to move with speed, agility and efficiency the Internet of Everything will demand
of them. Our strategy is to be the model in how we've reorganized and the customers we're driving as a result, and
we've done the heavy lifting with our peers, and customers are just starting. As a result, I am now spending a
significant amount of time with our customers' executive teams and in their boardrooms discussing how they organize
for digitization, innovation, security and the Internet of Everything.
We could not be better positioned in the market. We've worked very hard to get here, and the opportunity feels very
much like it did in the 1990s when the Internet became mission-critical to our customers. We have said for several
years that we believe the impact of the Internet of Everything would be 5 to 10 times greater than that of the Internet
today. At CES and the World Economic Forum, most every leader we saw agreed. We have been building for this
opportunity. We have the innovation, operational excellence, speed, agility and efficiencies in our business to drive the
greatest possible benefit for our customers, our partners, and our shareholders.
On to guidance. As we've said for the last two quarters, we are pleased that in spite of the headwinds we are growing
well again. We are well positioned for a positive turn in either service provider or emerging markets, but we are not
modeling those turns for several quarters, despite the better results we saw in this last quarter, for reasons you are all
very much aware of. For Q3, we expect to see revenue growth in the range of 3% to 5% and non-GAAP earnings per
share in the range of $0.51 to $0.53.
Let me now provide some additional detail on the business momentum we see in our geographies, customer segments,
products and services business within our portfolio.
In terms of business momentum, as a reminder, the geographies are primarily the way we run our business. For
geographies and customer segments I will speak in terms of product orders year-over-year unless otherwise noted.
We finished the quarter with product orders up 5% and product book-to-bill greater than one. Let's move first to the
Americas. The U.S. continued to accelerate growing 7% compared with Q1 3% growth. Latin America returned to
double digit growth at 12% versus Q1 of 5% and negative growth in fiscal year 2014. Strength in the U.S. public sector
continued growing 17% with U.S. federal growing 23% and U.S. state and local growing 8%.
Moving on to our Europe, Middle East and Africa operations. As we said in last quarter's conference call, we were
more optimistic about Europe than most of our peers and we saw that business play out as we called with growth in the
EMEA of 7% year-over-year. We saw phenomenal execution in the U.K. up 17%, Germany up 12% and something no
one else in the industry is coming even close to, Southern Europe actually grew 20% year-over-year, speaking to the
relevancy that we provide to companies and governments. Over the last six quarters, our growth year-over-year in
EMEA has gone from minus 4% to minus 2% to minus 1% to 2% to 6% in Q1 and now 7% in Q2 and we remain
cautiously optimistic.
In Asia-Pacific, Japan and China. In China in particular, we continue to see challenges that all of you are aware of and
we saw our China business decline by 19%. However, we saw India grow by 11%. The rest of APJC, not including
China, was down 1% this quarter.
And finally emerging markets, emerging markets total grew 1% with emerging markets excluding BRICs plus Mexico
up 8%, a major change from last quarter. We continue to see the BRICs plus Mexico challenged, down 6% in total with
Russia down 15%, Brazil down 8%, China as I said earlier down 19%, we did see growth in Mexico up 21%, India up
11%. While we're pleased with these results, we believe it is still way too early to call a turn in emerging markets and

are modeling for them to be challenging for several more quarters.
Customer segments. Total global commercial grew a healthy 8%. Our success in the U.S. commercial continues to be
very strong, up 12% in Q2. We have built a model based on success in the U.S. commercial and best practices from
around the world and have implemented the model outside the U.S. seeing our orders grow from down 5% in fiscal
year 2014 to up 4% year-to-date.
In total Cisco business terms, that improved performance added a full point to our company's growth rates. Our new
operating remodel in global service provider is also showing similar traction. This quarter, our service provider
business was down 1% after having been down on average 10% or more for the last five quarters.
Like many in the industry, we are modeling total global service provider CapEx down the mid-single digits for calendar
year 2015. We are focused on growing share of wallet. We believe we are very well positioned in terms of our portfolio
and how we have aligned with our service provider customers but we expect the next several quarters to continue to be
challenging and service provider along with emerging markets remain our two challenged areas.
Total global enterprise grew 10% versus 2% in Q1. We did see U.S. enterprise grow a bit slower than expected at 3%
growth due in part to the timing of some very large deals. The enterprise pipeline continues to see rapid growth in very
large multiyear deals, which should benefit Cisco over several years. Our global enterprise U.S. customers which are
the largest 28 enterprise accounts, not included in our regular U.S. enterprise discussion, grew about 30%
year-over-year. Global public sector continued to be solid at 7% growth year-over-year.
I will now move on to discussion of our Products and Services business, which I will discuss in terms of revenue
year-over-year unless otherwise stated.
Starting with switching. We saw very strong switching growth of 11% with strong performance in both the data center
switching and our campus switching business. We were especially pleased with the continued momentum of our Nexus
ACI portfolio including the Nexus 3K and Nexus 9K and the 8-bit controller. As an example, the Nexus 3K plus 9K
grew 350% year-over-year.
We have seen the Nexus 9K and ACI customers grow each quarter from 580 customers two quarters ago to 970
customers last quarter to 1,700 this quarter. APIC customers grew to over 300 and the Nexus 9K passed the 1 million
installed port mark this quarter less than one year after the first shipments. We are pulling away from our competitors
and leading in both the SDN thought leadership and customer implementations. The market has recognized the benefit
of ACI as compared to PowerPoint concepts of aspirational competitors.
ACI and APIC will become the cornerstone of the next generation of networking architectures for many years, much
like the UCS has become in the data center.
I am particularly pleased that we have kept gross margins extremely stable in switching and have actually grown gross
margins in many of our product switching areas which were already very strong in new areas such as the ACI portfolio.
Moving on to data center which grew an impressive 40%, UCS has now reached over $3 billion revenue run rate with
over 41,000 customers. More than 85% of the Fortune 500 have chosen UCS because of the innovative architecture
with particular traction in cloud, big data and enterprise application solutions.
The innovation underlying UCS, the convergence of compute, network and storage is continuing to fuel our growth in
the data center and differentiate Cisco. Now we are converging networking, applications, security, with scale for our
ACI platform. And we are doing it with the speed and a scale that no one else is coming close to.
Next to NGN routing which grew 2% year-over-year in terms of revenue. We saw strong performance in high-end
routing up 5% with continued strong performance in our new product introductions such as the CRS-X and NCS. With
the global macro changes and headwinds like net neutrality, and industry consolidation, we expect this business to be
challenged going forward but we believe we are taking market share and will continue to take market share.

Wireless had another strong quarter, up 18% year-over-year compared with Q1, which was up 11%. We saw strong
growth in our traditional business but in Meraki, cloud networking business continues its stellar growth, up another
100% with an annualized run rate of approximately $400 million.
Security grew 6% with orders growing even faster. We saw very strong adoption of our Cisco ASA with FirePOWER
services, which integrates our Sourcefire software products together. Our acquisition strategy in our security business
has been very successful as we integrate the various elements into our overall security architecture. We fight point
players in some areas but no other vendor can play at the level across the enterprise that our customers need.
In this volatile environment with change happening faster than ever before, the importance of security has never been
more significant. The level of danger has been raised from a firewall breach to the potential for enterprise destruction
and having robust security solutions before, during and after attack is table stakes. In this environment, customers are
migrating to partners they can trust who will lead with innovation and who will be around tomorrow.
This trusted partnership is core to our success and drives everything we do. Cisco is the number one security player in
terms of revenue and we are progressing nicely toward our goal of becoming the number one security company in
terms of mind share which literally we announced a year and a half ago an intention to do so.
Moving on to collaboration. Last quarter we boldly stated our intention is to lead in the next generation of collaboration
and become the number one collaboration player. After a complete portfolio refresh and four quarters of decline, we
made very good progress this quarter with growth of 10%. Kelly, I think it was flat or negative last quarter if I
remember. Within collaboration, the strongest growth came from our Telepresence business, where we saw, on the
back of our new Telepresence portfolio, a 60% growth in units and revenue growth of 35%.
We continue to grow our recurring business in collaboration. Our deferred collaboration revenue was up 26% in the
quarter to $1.1 billion. SP video declined 19%. We've announced key partnership wins to develop the next generation
end-to-end video solutions, from the set-top box to the cloud. Service revenues grew 5%.
We saw our portfolio in cloud, security, consulting and analytics all grow in double digits. This quarter, we launched
Cisco Connected Analytics Strategy to manage the explosive growth of data at the edge of the networks. As the Internet
of Everything evolves, we forecast as much as 50% of the data will be handled and decisions will be made at the edge
of the network. Given Cisco's position in the network, Cisco is the only company positioned to manage and capture the
insight from distributed data. This has the potential to be an important growth area for Cisco, and even more
importantly, to drive the value of the Internet of Everything.
Let me now provide an update on Cisco's momentum in the cloud. Cisco's cloud strategy is pervasive throughout our
portfolio. We continue to lead in the hybrid cloud market and our Intercloud momentum continues. As you look at our
cloud business I would look at the following metrics to track our success. First, Cisco's leadership in cloud
infrastructure was once more reaffirmed with the release of the latest Synergy Group's research report showing we have
retained and strengthened our number one position for sales of hardware and software used to build cloud
infrastructure.
Second, we are growing our cloud services, including Managed Security, Project Squared in collaboration, EnergyWise
and Meraki for Enterprise. Cisco and Telstra are now both in production with OpenStack-based public cloud services.
And third, our Intercloud ecosystem continues to grow and now exceeds over 50 partners, more than 400 data centers
across more than 50 countries. Rob, just a great job by your team and your leadership. Customers are using Intercloud
Fabric and ACI to implement highly secure and on-premise hybrid cloud capabilities across heterogeneous
environments.
To summarize my comments, our customer conversations today are not about standalone products. They are about new
revenue streams, growth and outcomes, about securing and about managing their businesses, about how they have to
reorganize to drive the innovation their survival requires. We are executing across our business because we are bringing
together our product leadership in every category into architectures and solutions that deliver real outcomes.

I will now turn the call over to Kelly for her comments on the quarter and guidance for the next quarter. Kelly,
welcome, and great to have you leading in the conference call.
Kelly A. Kramer
Thanks, John.
Overall, we had a strong quarter and executed well. From a top line perspective, total revenue was $11.9 billion,
growing 7%. We grew profits faster than revenue with non-GAAP net income of $2.7 billion, up 9%, and non-GAAP
EPS of $0.53, up 13%. Our GAAP net income was $2.4 billion, and GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis
were $0.46. Product revenue increased 8%, and Service revenue increased 5% with product book-to-bill greater than 1.
Our non-GAAP operating margin was 28.4%.
In our guidance last quarter, we told you that we expected total non-GAAP gross margins to be in the range of 61% to
62%. For Q2, our total non-GAAP gross margins and non-GAAP product gross margins came in at 61.7% and 60.8%,
respectively, reflecting the mix of our business and especially the strength of UCS.
John T. Chambers
Kelly, I'm just giving you a little bit of help with the microphone. I'm here to help in any way you want.
Kelly A. Kramer
Thanks, John.
Non-GAAP Service gross margin was 64.8%. Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $4.0 billion or 33.3% as a
percentage of revenue compared to 34.1% in Q1 of fiscal year 2015. Non-GAAP operating expenses were down 5%
quarter-over-quarter and up 6% year-over-year, reflecting investments in key growth areas such as security, cloud and
software. Our GAAP net income and GAAP earnings per share for Q2 fiscal year 2015 included a pre-tax gain of $126
million or approximately $0.02 per share related to the reorganization of our investment in VCE. This gain is excluded
from our non-GAAP results.
Now moving on to our non-GAAP tax provision rate which was 22% consistent with our expectations. In connection
with the recently reinstated U.S. federal R&D tax credit, we had a tax benefit of $91 million related to fiscal 2014 that
we excluded from our non-GAAP net income. The extension of the R&D tax credit did not have a material impact on
our non-GAAP tax rate during Q2 and is not expected to have a material impact on our non-GAAP tax rate for the
remainder of fiscal 2015 since the benefit only extended through December 31, 2014.
We ended the quarter with our head count at 70,112, a decrease of 2,135 from Q1. As a reminder, we took restructuring
actions to invest in growth, innovation and talent while managing costs and driving efficiencies.
We announced and completed one acquisition during the quarter, Neohapsis, a provider of network and security
consulting services to enhance our offerings to our customers.
Looking at our geographic segment results in terms of total revenue on a year-over-year basis, our Americas segment
was up 10%, EMEA was up 7% and APJC was down 3%. Total gross margin for the Americas was 62.0%, EMEA was
61.8% and APJC was 60.3%.
From a balance sheet and cash flow perspective, total cash, cash equivalents and investments were $53.0 billion
including a $3.2 billion available in the U.S. at the end of the quarter. We generated operating cash flow of $2.9 billion
during the quarter. Deferred revenue was $14 billion, up 6% year-over-year. Product deferred revenue grew 14%
largely driven by subscription-based offerings while services deferred revenue grew 2%. We continue to build a greater
mix of recurring revenue as reflected in our deferred revenue balance. Our DSO was strong at 35 days as compared to

36 days in Q2 fiscal year 2014.
In Q2 we returned $2.2 billion to shareholders that included $1.2 billion through share repurchases and $974 million
through our quarterly dividend. In the first half of fiscal year 2015 we have returned approximately $4.2 billion or 86%
of our free cash flow to our shareholders comprised of $2.2 billion of share repurchases and nearly $2 billion of
dividends. In addition, today our board approved an increase of $0.02 to the quarterly dividend to $0.21 per share, an
approximate 11% increase representing a yield of approximately 3.1%. We remain firmly committed to our capital
allocation strategy.
Let me now provide a few comments on our guidance for the third quarter. Let me remind you again that our comments
include forward-looking statements. You should review our recent SEC filings that identify important risk factors and
understand that actual results could materially differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements, and actual
results could be above or below guidance. The guidance we are providing is on a non-GAAP basis with a reconciliation
to GAAP.
As John mentioned, we expect total revenue to be in the range of 3% to 5% on a year-over-year basis. For the third
quarter we anticipate non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 61% to 62%, and as we have said in the past,
forecasting non-GAAP gross margin has always been challenging due to various factors such as volume, product mix,
cost savings and pricing. As a reminder, non-GAAP gross margin may vary quarter-to-quarter by a point in either
direction from our guidance range.
Our non-GAAP operating margin in Q3 is expected to be in the range of 27.5% to 28.5%. Our non-GAAP tax
provision rate is expected to be approximately 22% in the third quarter. Our Q3 2015 non-GAAP earnings per share is
expected to range from $0.51 to $0.53. We anticipate our GAAP earnings to be lower than our non-GAAP EPS by
$0.09 to $0.12 per share in Q3 2015. The range includes a pre-tax charge of up to $100 million in Q3 2015 as a result
of the restructuring actions that we announced in the first quarter. During Q2 we recognized a pre-tax charge in our
GAAP financial statements of $69 million related to that announcement, and we expect total charges not to exceed
$600 million during fiscal year 2015.
Please see the slides that accompany this webcast for more detail. Other than those quantified items noted previously,
there are no other significant differences between GAAP and our non-GAAP guidance. This guidance assumes no
additional acquisitions, asset impairments, restructurings and tax or other events which may or may not be significant.
Our guidance does not assume a significant improvement in the emerging markets or the service provider segment in
the near future. Although we believe we are executing well in a rapidly transforming market, with these types of
uncertainties in mind, we will continue to provide our guidance with all the appropriate caveats one quarter at a time.
We encourage our shareholders to have similar considerations. As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial
guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure.
I'll now hand it back to John for his summary comments.
John T. Chambers
Thank you, Kelly.
Our results this quarter, which were the best results in three years in terms of balanced growth across all of our
geographies, products and segments, reflects the increased relevancy of Cisco around the world. The Cisco brand is the
strongest it's ever been. Our vision has always been to change the way that people work, live, play and learn and you've
heard us say this for nearly 20 years. Digitization is the next and perhaps the most significant evolution of our vision.
At CES 15 years ago, we showed a network car, Wi-Fi enabled and connected to a coffee shop so you could order your
own drinks and make changes to that.
Fast-forward to several years ago, we introduce the market to the Internet of Everything. While the concepts were
thought leadership for many years, this year companies and countries are seeing the Internet of Everything as a

business imperative and top priority. To take advantage of the Internet of Everything, every country, company, city,
home and car has to be digital. The single most important investments are at the center of their digital business and
technology strategy for our customers. And at the center of that will be the intelligent network. From the data center to
the edge through the cloud, all brought together with an end-to-end security and Cisco has never ever been better
positioned.
In the 1990s when companies needed to get online on the Internet, Cisco was the thought leader, the company with the
product leadership and the best example of a company capitalizing on all of the transitions. Our customers wanted our
help and to follow our example. Fast-forward to today, the next generation of the internet, the Internet of Everything,
should generate at least 5 to 10 times the value of the first generation of the internet to date. Again, no one is better
positioned than Cisco in terms of strategy, market position, product leadership, architectures and organization structure.
I am not sure those outside Cisco appreciate the magnitude of the changes we have implemented over the last year
largely because of our ability to continue to deliver to long-term value to customers and to our shareholders despite the
challenges in the market. Most companies wait to change until they have to, when it's obvious and it's often game over
and those companies get left behind. In the last year, we were willing to disrupt our leadership position, for example, in
switching and routing by introducing entirely new platforms. We knew we'd see a short-term impact but told the market
how we would grow. Once again, we did what we said we would do.
This is just one of many examples and these are exactly the hard decisions our customers, employees, partners and
shareholders have trusted us to make so we can lead in these market transitions.
I want to congratulate and thank the Cisco team for believing in the vision and executing one of the most successful
company transformations the industry has witnessed. Very few companies could do what we have done with the speed
and the results we have driven. And the opportunity we've created for ourselves is truly exciting and in many ways just
getting started.
Our transformational work will continue as we help our customers digitize everything, secure everything and organize
their companies, their governments, their businesses for the Internet of Everything. Because of the agility we built into
our organization and our ability to align directly with our customers' goals, we are helping our customers with their
business outcomes. And let me be very direct here, we are winning very large service provider, enterprise and public
sector deals that we would not have won just as recently as one year ago.
We do see our competitors struggling and know we are not immune from economic or other challenges in the market.
While we believe we have positioned the company better than any of our peers, we do still see the same challenges we
have discussed in the past few quarters, specifically emerging markets and service providers, as continuing to provide a
negative drag for the next few quarters. What I believe the market now understands is that Cisco is managing
effectively through a challenging macro leading through transitions, disrupting markets, increasing our relevancy with
our customers and delivering value to our shareholders.
Looking forward, we've laid an incredibly exciting foundation for future growth, innovation and leadership, reinventing
the network with application-centric infrastructure, a platform at the very early stages of its future potential. Our
leadership in security, the most important topic in IT today, in many ways, our emerging role in data and analytics at
the edge and how we will bring all of this together to enable the Internet of Everything.
We have our stakes in the ground to capture tremendous opportunities in front of us and are well on our way to
becoming the number one IT company. The momentum in the business feels extremely good and we are excited about
the opportunities ahead.
We will now move, Mel, to what I enjoy the most, which is the Q&A section, and it's over to you, Mel. And I'll try to
keep my answers tight and I'll do better this time.

All right. Operator, can we please open for questions?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. And our first question comes from Amitabh Passi with UBS.
<Q - Amitabh Passi>: Hi, guys. I had maybe sort of two half-questions. John, I guess the first one for you. Services
gross margin probably came in at the lowest level that we've seen in a few quarters. I was hoping you could maybe
elaborate on what's happening there.
And then just secondarily on your security business, I know you sounded very bullish in Security and the momentum.
6% seemed a little disappointing. We'd love to get some clarity there.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Gotcha. So, Amitabh, I like the way that you went. We probably had eight or nine areas
that were very close to the highest growth rate we've had in two years and you're focusing me on the two challenges,
more than fair.
So let's go to the issue of Services gross margins. If you watch, we start with the big picture: our revenue growth areas,
what is our gross margins, our OpEx. Kelly and I have a lot of levers we can pull within that. Within the gross margins
we have never been more comfortable, and actually I said this only three or four quarters ago, Mel. I've never been
more comfortable with any aspect of our business than our ability to maintain gross margins. It's a mix issue as you go
through it.
So the Services question, we've had great Services gross margins unequaled in the industry. Gary, our Technical
Services, what you and Joe Pinto have done is amazing there. Our Advanced Services is an area that we're moving very
aggressively in and that's where you see a little bit of the pull down on the Services model. And as you become
outcome-based, as you re-focus on these new growth areas, being able to literally digitize a country, digitize a city,
digitize a manufacturing company, a healthcare company, et cetera, you saw us invest an awful lot in vertical
consultancy. You saw us invest in security in a big way with major expectations in terms of expertise centers, et cetera,
and in cloud. So we're going to continue to make investments in these areas and I'm very comfortable with our gross
margin portfolio. I actually think our gross margins has been the most predictable part of our total business, although
we have a lot of various variables in that.
On Security, Security will occasionally be bumpy. We reorganized our organization and realigned Security across the
whole globe with a separate sales force. As you make those changes, you occasionally lose a little bit of momentum
before you pick it up. The order growth was actually at 9% for Security. I expect Security to grow very healthfully as
we move forward, and you'll continue to see us make a number of both resource investments in areas like services,
sales investments to really lead in depth and consultancy in a way that really brings this picture to light. But I think
you're going to see growth out of our Security business. I think we're positioned extremely well and I kind of, in a fun
way, challenge you.
When an enterprise customer has 45 to 60 security players in their environment, how many do they really have? And
you look at a CEO in the eye and they go, I get it John. We've got to consolidate this and the network's where it's going
to get consolidated, so very comfortable in terms of our security growth over time. Do not see any issues in terms of
strategy, vision, or margins here.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: Great. Thanks, Amitabh. Operator, next question.

<Q - Brian Modoff>: Hi, John. I'd like to talk about Meraki. You had obviously good numbers, $400 million annual
run rate. At Cisco Live you announced that you were expanding it out to a broader range of customers. Can you talk a
little bit about that and what that might do to the growth there and how this might affect your overall margin mix as you
continue to say you're comfortable with where that's headed?
<A - John T. Chambers>: Sure. So Meraki overall, Kelly, keep me honest here, very good margins. We're very
comfortable with that. When you begin to look at a company that is now at $400 million run rate and grow it at 100%,
that's hotter than almost any startups in the industry with great gross margins. And what Rob is doing in leadership on
cloud and what Nick is doing with our service providers and what we're seeing is a continued leverage of the Meraki
type of vision for how we grow our resources and how we grow our relevance to our customers.
Rob, would you like add something to that?
<A - Robert W. Lloyd>: I would just add that we are expanding globally, with recent additions of Meraki presence in
EMEA as well as building out in Europe. They are not – there's no margin impact. It's a very profitable business model
and we did expand and announced the expansion of the Meraki portfolio at Cisco Live in Milan in January. What you'll
see, an expansion of the enterprise offer including a really neat mobile device manager. So profitable platform, John,
growing very, very quickly at 100% and geographic expansion as part of that model.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Got it. It's a nice way of saying this is really hot. It's going to, Kelly, be one of our better
acquisitions, but then you turn to Sourcefire which was the other big one we did in the last year and a half. It's literally
on fire too, a little bit of humor. I'm getting better, do you think, Mel? Yeah. She's not so sure. Thanks, Brian.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: Thanks, Brian. Operator, next question.
Operator
Thank you. Next question comes from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Simona K. Jankowski>: Hi. Thanks very much. So you had obviously a good quarter and good guidance but,
John, your tone seems even more bullish than kind of the numbers would suggest. I mean I couldn't count how many
times you said that you've never been better positioned and I just wanted to see if you can just provide another layer of
detail behind that to just let us understand better what's behind that tone. I think you kind of referenced some large
deals in the U.S. with enterprises, service providers, public sector and I noticed your deferred was up 6%, the long-term
deferred even though short-term was flat. So are there large multiyear deals in there that are giving you that kind of a
bullish outlook?
<A - John T. Chambers>: Simona, it literally is across the board and we see this in every country, every segment of
our business, even those that are challenged like emerging markets and service provider, we made huge inroads
because of the momentum we gained. Mel told me not to be too enthusiastic on the call. I went out and ran four miles
this morning. I had my best time in the last year, lifted weights, et cetera, and I'm sorry, Mel. I'm just full of energy.
It's exciting what's in front of us and when you sit across from a customer, if you could've been WEF [World Economic
Forum] and I could take this to our shareholders, anybody who walked out of WEF, 21 of the sessions were about
Cisco-related areas from what you're going to do with infrastructure to digitizing countries to cities to how you bring
this to bear to how does it affect the environment. We were right in the middle and in so many different ways we are
not just in thought leadership. No one can compete. Individual pinpoint products are getting killed in this marketplace
and the different competitive models that you see evolving or different models we saw coming for four to five years.
So yes, I feel really good and the only area that I would be critical of because we've got to do better in service provider
video and when you have a portfolio like we have and customer segments and products, it feels good. But to your point,
our relevance in major government bids and major enterprise bids, we are winning bids that we would not have come
close to in a year ago and it isn't just we're winning from the beginning. We've got an ability to adjust in engineering
and sales and services to meet their needs at a speed we were not and candidly we're taking it to competitors. It really

feels good and it's really fun.
See you tomorrow by the way, Simona. Looking forward to being on stage with you. Go easy on your questions
tomorrow on me.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: All right. Thanks, Simona. Operator, next question.
Operator
Thank you, our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - James E. Faucette>: Thanks very much. Hey. Good afternoon. Just a quick question. You said that you're
expecting a turn in service provider and emerging markets not for at least several more quarters. Others have indicated
that they felt we could see a rebound in service provider spending maybe in the next couple of quarters. Just wondering
what's making you a bit more cautious than that? And I guess trying to gauge your level of confidence that you can
really see your service provider and emerging market businesses rebound, I guess, exiting this year and going into
2016? Thanks.
<A - John T. Chambers>: So let's start with the overall premise. My premise on service providers is you're going to
see negative growth in terms of CapEx for this year with a lot of the experts saying it's actually going to be uglier in the
next six months than it will in the back half of the year. So our assumption is any gain in service providers will be share
of wallet gain and market share gains.
What makes me very, very bullish on this is on the things we can control. If you watch what Nick Adamo, who heads
up sales; Kelly Ahuja, [indiscernible] (42:44) services, Kelly's engineering, we are now winning big service provider
deals that we would not even have been in the game in a year or two ago.
And our ability to do this in at a different margin level, our agility on this, and we're taking it to our competitors and
you're seeing this across the board. I would've vastly preferred and you can never do it exactly how you want but
having had five quarters of 10% or more negative service provider growth, I would rather have gone from negative 10
to negative 5 or 6 to negative 1 then positive and up from there. We got a couple deals right at the end of this quarter,
which caused us to go from minus 10 to minus 1. That's more than I think anybody else anticipated in the marketplace
especially when you have areas like SP video which drag you down by two or three points off of that.
I just didn't want the market getting ahead of us. My comfort level with seeing growth this year by the end of the year
and probably before that is extremely good in this market, but I'm modeling all wallet-share gains and market share
gains. I do not think Service Provider CapEx will be up this year. I hope I'm wrong, in which case we'll get more of our
share there, so I feel very, very good in the positioning.
Was there a second question that I missed there? Okay. Thanks, James.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: Next question.
Operator
Thank you, your next question comes from Rod Hall with JP Morgan.
<Q - Rod B. Hall>: Yeah, hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Sure, Rod.
<Q - Rod B. Hall>: I guess the first one I wanted to start with was switching the quarter-on-quarter.
<A - John T. Chambers>: [indiscernible] (44:11) Go ahead.
<Q - Rod B. Hall>: Sorry. Can you guys hear me now?

<A - John T. Chambers>: Yes.
<Q - Rod B. Hall>: Yeah, so the quarter-on-quarter trajectory of switching seasonality a little bit more than normal,
about down 6% quarter-on-quarter if our math is right, and the average a little bit below three over the last five years,
so I know that last year there was some Osborne Effect ahead of the 9K. Just wondering if you guys could comment on
color there. I mean what might've driven that seasonality? Did we see some FX impact, just normal seasonality from
your point of view, et cetera.
And then also, John, I know you're lifting weights and running, doing all this stuff. Could you just give us an update on
your tenure at Cisco? It doesn't sound like you're in the mood to retire, but could you just give us some kind of update
on what your plan there is? Thanks.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Sure. The next time you hear, Rod, about any talk about the change will be when we
announce it, and that hasn't changed overall. We've got an amazing team with several of the players around this table
being examples of it, and we'll make this a non-issue as we make the transition.
So the first part of the question, no, I disagree with your basic premise. We don't give booking by category, by
seasonality. But if you watch our normal booking trends and if you watch where we've gone – and let's use total
bookings as an example – from Q1 to Q2 it was up at the very high end of our seasonality booking sequentially and the
year-over-year numbers. So either way you want to measure it, we're in good shape on that.
I do agree with several of your premises in terms of the 9K growth. It feels very, very good. Rod, you got to know, I
completely disagree dramatically with your comment about our switching products commoditizing. They're going the
opposite way. This is one that I think you're going to see us get our competitors very aggressively, and even in
merchant silicon, like the Nexus 3000, we're doing extremely well in terms of growth in gross margins.
It's an architectural play now. We saw this coming four and a half years ago. With switching, you've got to have
security, you've got to have collaboration. It's got to integrate to processor capability, it's got to tie the Internet of
Everything. There has to be an architecture that brings this together, business results, and I think our relevance and our
value to the customers are going the exact opposite way. We have shown remarkable consistency in switching gross
margins, and I feel very, very good about our future on that one, Rod.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: Thanks, Rod. Operator, next question.
Operator
Thank you, your next question comes from Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Hey, Mark.
<Q - Mark Sue>: How are you? The gross margin improvements and the cash returns was a major driver in your
stock's outperformance last year, so I'm trying to understand the opportunities ahead on top of the ongoing
improvements you've made to date, for example. I know that it's a multi-year progress, but the progress in terms of
becoming a software company, maybe you could give us an update there in your go-to-market.
And as it relates to your financials, maybe thoughts on future cash flow returns to investors, considering free cash flow
is now on parity with net income.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Got you. So I'm going to have Kelly take the other part on thoughts about cash and where
we're going, Kelly, and our overall, and I don't mind if you even comment a little bit about the programs we have on
gross margins through that. And on the first part, giving out that question, the first question missed from Mark was...
<A - Melissa Selcher>: Just – with the strength in gross margins last year [indiscernible] (47:24).

<A - John T. Chambers>: Okay. So we have leverage in every single category. If you watch what we're doing,
whether it's operating expenses, whether it's the gross margins by products, products and switching, funding areas that
don't have as good a gross margin picture to gain momentum, et cetera, and there's leverage literally everywhere.
While we're seeing no unusual competition in the market, no unusual competition from white label or white box – nor
will we in the future – we saw that coming, as I said, a long time ago, wins on architecture and this whole call literally
is about that. So I feel very good about our total gross margin mix.
We will absolutely be aggressive when we want to move consulting, as an example, to play a much larger role in
business outcomes. But our ability to have multiple leverage that we can touch on, I think, feels very, very good. We
are going to invest in some of the areas and we're going to do a large part of it by literally what we said earlier, moving
40% of our resources around in a year is almost unheard of. And then literally, unfortunately, taking down 6000 people
and back up 6000 people with the different skill sets speaks to the agility we have in the market. Kelly, your thoughts?
<A - Kelly A. Kramer>: Yeah, to answer your question, Mark, on our cash, as you can tell our commitment to the
capital allocation hasn't changed, as evidenced by giving back 86% of our free cash flow back as a dividend and a
buyback and as well as increasing our dividend going forward. So that's not changing. We are extremely focused on
increasing our cash flow and, to John's point, focused on driving that through improvements in our margin, both on
gross margin and operating margin. So that focus will continue, and we still have lots of flexibility with our balance
sheet to continue the balance of giving back to our shareholders as well as having that flexibility strategically for M&A
and other investments.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Gary, you and Kelly are working jointly on gross margins. Any additional thoughts?
<A - Gary B. Moore>: Yes. Mark, I think we've demonstrated our ability to manage the gross margins and pull the
levers and the different things that we have. Those haven't gone away. The investments we're making in value design,
value engineering is a gift that keeps on giving, and we have doubled down our efforts there, so we'll keep going. We're
going through functional transformation. John pointed out that $0.06 for every $1 of revenue over the last three and a
half or four years, and I think we can continue to do that. So it's about freeing up those assets to reinvest in the growth
areas for the future, and we are doing that spot on, and we're looking at this for the long term.
<A - John T. Chambers>: And Mark – and Mel's probably going to send me out to run laps around here before I
answer the next question, but if you watch what changes, architectures save our customers huge amount of operating
expense. It allows them to get to business outcomes much quicker, and when you combine an architecture like Data
Center with an architecture like Intercloud, with an architecture like Collaboration, with an architecture like Security,
with architectures about big data at the edge of the network with mobility, we can do that in a way that no one else can
to get business outcomes. Customers will pay probably 3% to 5% – three to five times more for a business outcome
than they will for a standalone switch or a standalone router.
So as we make that transition, this is where you really see our relevance change. And this is why when you talk about
digitizing countries or digitizing cities, we're all by ourselves in our ability to do it. It's about how we bring all those
together in the Internet of Everything and that has great gross margins. And that's where I think the market – we need to
do a better job, Mel, of explaining to the market why our gross margins and why we're so optimistic about our future
here if we do it right.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: Great. Thanks, Mark. Operator, next question.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer.
<Q - Ittai Kidron>: Thanks, and congrats, guys, on great execution on the quarter. Following up on this last point of
gross margin, John, looking at the regional gross margin it seemed like Europe was certainly a standout as we haven't
seen a gross margin that poor since – I had to go all the way back to 2011. Was that just a function of FX, meaning was

the move in that since you're pricing in dollars you had to do a little bit more active discounting in order to get the
volumes that you need? How do we think about that?
<A - John T. Chambers>: Yes. A fair question. I think Europe's a great example. First of all, Europe was 7% growth,
which I don't think anybody else is getting. You take Russia out and it would have been 9% growth. But you did see
remarkable growth across many of the countries where they're really being impacted by foreign exchange, et cetera.
The way we look at foreign exchange, we do business in dollars, as most of you know on that, so we perhaps can't draw
the correlation as quickly as others. But it does mean the deal size may not be as large, or it does mean that there might
be pressure on discounts to provide a total solution and when you see us grow at 20% across Southern Europe – I'm not
aware of anybody else that is growing in Southern Europe, period, much less at those type of numbers. It speaks to our
strategy working. Foreign exchange does have some impact on it, and Kelly maybe if you'd like to add something in
addition to that?
<A - Kelly A. Kramer>: Just to add to that, Ittai, from a pricing perspective actually our pricing is in line, our normal
quarter-on-quarter pricing as well as year-over-year, if I look over the last six quarters. So we haven't really seen that
increase on discounting. What we did see driving the margins in Europe is definitely the mix of our strength and our
UCS is a big, big driver of it.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: Great. Thanks, Ittai. Operator, next question.
Operator
Thank you, our next question comes from Tal Liani with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Hi, Tal.
<Q - Tal Liani>: Hi, guys. I have a question on switching, great growth. The question is, can you distinguish between
plain vanilla upgrades just because you have new platforms and between really changes to the architecture of data
centers? One has a short cycle, one has a longer cycle, longer impact on the company. Is there any way we can look at
it? Think about our side. Is there any way we can have evidence that the cycle is longer rather than shorter when it
comes to switching? Thanks.
<A - John T. Chambers>: I think the data center switching cycle is a very, very long one that I think we'd all agree
with in scale, and even though we'll face new competitors, white label et cetera, in this market, we saw that, as I said,
coming a long time ago. And this is where it isn't about switching in the data center, it's about convergence, about
switching with storage, with servers, with security even within the data center and then the ability with
application-centric infrastructure to run that in a data center, in cloud, in WAN all the way to the edge, and that's about
applications, again, with the network, with security, with scale.
You combine those two and we are almost unbeatable in the approach. You do have a natural update cycle with new
products coming in and there was probably a little bit of a stall when we stalled ourselves a year ago, deliberately, and
we knew what we were doing. But we needed to transition to the new high-end switching and needed to signal people
where we're going.
There are additional drivers. We're starting to win network refresh and some competitors refresh, purely because of
security. In this environment, they aren't going to take risks on it. This is where we're just going to, I can't say crush –
yeah, I can versus white label. This is where we're going to really crush the white label people. It's got to be a
security/architecture type of approach. If you just say, I'm going to get merchant silicon and throw software on top of it
and run data centers, run WANs and everything, all it takes is one breach and you've done more damage to your brand
as a company or as a government than you could in 100 years of saving on a little bit of switching difference, and that's
before you get to the outcomes in terms of the direction.
Now is switching going to grow double digits? Of course not. But I think more down in the mid-single digits and it will
go up and down depending on the quarter and there'll be a different mix in the data center versus campus.

<A - Melissa Selcher>: Great. Thanks, Tal. Operator, next question.
Operator
Thank you, your next question comes from Benjamin Reitzes with Barclays Capital.
<Q - Benjamin A. Reitzes>: Hey. Thanks a lot, guys. Can you talk about the new relationship you have with VCE?
The data center numbers were very good, but I was wondering if there was any impact on switching in the quarter. And
do you see yourself partnering, partner-strategy changing and getting more robust, perhaps with some other partners
with what's going on with that, that could be material to revenue going forward? Thanks a lot.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Yeah, Ben, let me answer your direct question and the second one that you didn't ask me,
which I know is on people's minds, as well. In terms of VCE, we have a very good relationship with EMC. I look for
that to be continued very strong. Gary, you're our key interface there, you and Howard and Joe and I all the time go
back and forth. VMware is a competitor. We view them as a competitor. We're going to beat them as a competitor and
we will beat them and have fun doing it. I wish I was a better person, but I'm not, and we are going to take it to a bunch
of our competitors and I think you'll like the progress that you're going to continue to see there.
We are, however, going to continue to partner with NetApp, which is a great relationship – almost no competitive
overlap – and we announced what we're doing with IBM. And I think to the second part of your question, when we talk
about pace of change it means that your strategic partnerships – and the Wall Street Journal had an article I think before
December that talked about the role of strategic partnerships would dramatically change, and this will be customer
partnerships as well – will be dramatically different looking out over the next several years and determine a company's
success or not in ways they haven't in the past. And part of that pace of change is you're going to have at times even
very good customers or very good partners go into our area. We're at the center of every transition, so anytime anybody
makes a networking announcement, they're going to say either this has been Cisco or doesn't. And you're going to see
our evolution of our partners grow in that.
Having said that, you'll see us do more strategic partnering, much deeper, with many, many partners such as players
like Rockwell, that you might not have thought of before, or GE, or players that we are literally getting closer to in
terms of the direction here. Relationship with EMC is very, very good. We like them, they like us, and we do a lot of
business together. I think, Gary, the run rate was 50% year-over-year growth together plus some?
<A - Gary B. Moore>: Plus some. And it's a strong relationship and the partnership has all the elements it does before
we just restructured it.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Okay. Thank you, Ben.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: Thanks, Ben. Operator, next question.
Operator
Thank you. Your next question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Hey, Simon.
<Q - Simon M. Leopold>: Hey, John. Thank you for all the detail as usual. I wanted to follow up on the VCE
relationship in terms of how it affects your business from a modeling perspective. As I understand it, you do sell a
significant amount of UCS products, maybe some switching products through that channel, if you could help us put that
into perspective as to how significant that is as a source of revenue for the UCS.
And then in terms of below the sales levels, I understand that you have some benefit exiting the VCE, that you're not
incurring the expenses you had been in the partnership. Can you help us understand the implications of this from a both

revenue as well as operating expense perspective?
<A - John T. Chambers>: Yeah, if I were to summarize the revenue perspective, it's a very good one for us, just like
NetApp is. The growth rates are unbelievable. Our field sales teams, the EMC sales team and the Cisco sales team, you
often can't tell the difference between them out in the field in terms of how they come together. It's very, very good for
us and we feel very good growth from that relationship, and by the way, the same is true with the other partners we've
alluded to in terms of the direction. So I think what you're seeing is just an evolution of a partnership model and some
competition versus VMware, which is, I think, the world we live in today. Next question please?
Operator
Thank you, our next question comes from Paul Silverstein with Cowen & Company.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Hey, Paul.
<Q - Paul J. Silverstein>: Hi, John. Good evening. One clarification. I think it's obvious from your previous
comments, but I just want to make sure I understood. The traditional breakout you give us between pricing and
productivity improvement, volume, et cetera, it appears – and again, I just want to confirm – that the rate of price
erosion did not change from the trend we've seen recently and the same thing with the rate of productivity
improvement. Can you give us the numbers if you have them?
<A - John T. Chambers>: Kelly?
<A - Kelly A. Kramer>: Yes. Hey, Paul. So you'll see that in our Q filing, but I can tell you the ranges that we
typically see on a quarter-on-quarter basis have been in the range over the last six quarters from half a percentage point
impact on gross margin up to over a point and a half, and we are well in the – we're basically in the middle of that
range. And the year-over-years are in the middle of the range as well when I look over six quarters. So you'll that when
we have our 10-Q filing.
John T. Chambers
If I look – and Mel's giving me that I'm out of time, so I wish we could do a couple more questions. I want to just
summarize with I've never felt better about our business and our future. We are, as many of you have already said,
we're back, and this movie I have seen before. I wish I could just bottle WEF and I wish I could bottle the
conversations that we're in with government leaders and business leaders and how different than before, it's just not one
product area. It's how we can bring architectures together with services in a different sales motion.
We had the courage to disrupt ourselves starting three years ago, and we did a huge amount of organizational evolution
over the last year that allowed us to do fast innovation and agility and speed with which others cannot meet. There is no
surprises to us in the market and I mean none at the present time. It's playing out very much like we expected. It's a
world that pace of change will go exponentially, but as you walk away, just kind of think about it.
Executing extremely well and healthy growth, digitization will be 10 times, I think – we'll say 5 to 10 to keep me solid
– the impact as the Internet of Everything really affects every country, every citizen in the world and every company.
Our product portfolio across the board, you saw all but one area increase, and it's nice when I get beat up on just 6%
growth. That is a pleasant position to be in, Kelly, probably one we won't always experience as nicely as that.
The balance geographically and even our headwind areas, while we've signaled there'll be a couple more quarters to
work through, showed a lot of progress that means we are positioned as they eventually turn in emerging markets,
which they will, and there will always be challenges in a group like China and Russia and Brazil. But the rest of them
feel headed in the right direction pretty well, and if you watch where we're doing in terms of our product leadership in
each category and then integrating them together with architecture, it feels good.

So I get pumped up. It hasn't changed and I hope that came across. The pace of change and the new competitors and
new challenges is something that will not change, it will go up exponentially. I believe we're going to become the
number one IT company, and our goal is to show you that and get the reward our shareholders, our customers and
employees deserve. Mel, back to you.
