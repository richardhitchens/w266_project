Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Ellen. Hello, everyone.
I want to say at the outset that this quarter Google turned in a strong performance, and this despite substantial currency
headwinds. As we've all seen, the U.S. dollar has continued to strengthen, which resulted in a gross negative currency
impact on our revenues of $1.1 billion for the quarter. Even after the significant benefits of our hedging program, the
net impact to our gross revenue was still $795 million. If these currency trends persist, FX headwinds would obviously
continue to impact our results in 2015.
So for our results now, our gross total consolidated revenue was $17.3 billion, growing 12% year over year and
declining 5% quarter over quarter. Without currency fluctuations, our gross total consolidated revenue growth is in fact
a healthy 17% year over year. Despite significant FX pressure, Google site revenue was up a healthy 14% year over
year to $11.9 billion, and was down 4% quarter over quarter. Once again, strength in mobile search was the key driver
of growth here.
Network revenue was up 1% year over year at $3.6 billion and down 8% quarter over quarter. As I mentioned last
quarter, our network business includes two businesses with different growth profiles, our legacy AdSense business and
our newer display and programmatic business, where the latter continues to perform quite well.
This quarter, we reclassified some revenues, primarily related to DoubleClick ad serving software, from the other
revenue to network revenue line. This reclassification increased network revenue by approximately $130 million in Q1
and decreased other revenue by about the same amount, or the same amount. The display and programmatic business,
as I mentioned earlier, continued as always to be reflected in the network line. To see the impact of this reclass on
historical periods, please see the earnings slides on our IR website.
Finally, Google's other revenue grew 23% year over year to $1.8 billion and was down 2% quarter over quarter. This
was driven really by year-over-year growth from the Play Store, offset by a decline in Nexus, and what I've mentioned,
the FX impact.
Our global aggregate paid clicks were up 13% year over year, down 1% quarter over quarter. Our aggregate CPCs were
down 7% year over year and down 5% quarter over quarter. And on our monetization by property, Google Sites paid
clicks were up 25% year over year and down 3% quarter over quarter. Google Sites CPCs were down 13% year over
year and down 3% quarter over quarter. Network paid clicks were down 12% year over year and up 4% quarter over
quarter, and network CPCs were up 2% year over year and down 11% quarter over quarter.
As you know, we don't usually break down the impact of the individual factors on the quarterly changes in our clicks
and CPCs. But this quarter, I want to provide more color on what's happening within our Sites clicks and CPC metrics,
so that you can better understand the dynamics of the underlying businesses that drive them.
So many commentators are incorrectly assuming that the growth trends in our Sites clicks and CPCs are primarily due
to difficulties monetizing search on mobile, but that's in fact not the case. Remember that Sites metrics include clicks
and revenues related to ads served on Google's owned and operated properties, most notably obviously Google.com,
but as well as YouTube engagement ads like TrueView, where a user's choice not to skip an ad is counted as a click.

Over the past year, we've seen YouTube viewership climb dramatically both in established markets but also due to
rapid expansion in emerging markets. And quality improvements in the TrueView ads mean that more users are in fact
choosing not to skip them, increasing the overall ad view. So this means that there is much higher volume of TrueView
ads being seen, which has been a significant driver of year-over-year growth in numbers that you've seen in Sites
clicks.
TrueView ads currently monetize at lower rates than ad clicks on Google.com. But as you know, video ads generally
reach people earlier in the purchase funnel. And so across the industry, they tend to have a very different pricing profile
than they would have on a typical performance search ad. Excluding the impact of YouTube TrueView ads, growth in
site clicks would be lower but still positive, and our CPCs would be healthy and growing year over year.
So really we have two positive stories to tell here today. First, as I mentioned earlier, we're experiencing real strength in
mobile search, and the CPCs in our core Search business is continuing to grow year over year, so it's doing very well.
Second, viewership in YouTube videos and TrueView ads are growing significantly, and YouTube's contribution to our
advertising revenue continues to grow at a strong rate year over year. And we're really pleased with how the YouTube
business is progressing. So that's the story.
Turning to geographic performance, you'll see in our earnings slides, which you can find on our Investor Relations
website, you'll see that we have broken down our revenue by U.S., UK, and the rest of world, and show the impact of
FX and the benefits from our hedging programs. So please refer to those slides for the exact calculations.
So despite large currency headwinds I mentioned, we saw solid performance for our core advertising business all
around the world. The U.S. was up 11% year over year to $7.4 billion. The UK was up 6% year over year to $1.7
billion. And in fixed FX terms, the UK actually grew 12% year over year. Our non-U.S. revenue, which excluding the
UK, was up 14% year over year to $8.2 billion, accounting for 47% of our total revenue. And in fixed FX terms, the
rest of the world grew a solid 24% year over year.
Now let me turn to expenses. Traffic acquisition costs were $3.3 billion for the quarter or 22% of total advertising
revenue. Our non-GAAP other cost of revenue was $2.9 billion in Q1, which excludes SBC. Our non-GAAP operating
expenses totaled $5.4 billion, again excluding stock-based compensation. As a result, our non-GAAP operating profit
was a healthy $5.7 billion, and non-GAAP operating margin 33% in Q1.
Headcount was up just over 1,800 people in Q1. In total, we ended the quarter with approximately 55,400 full-time
employees at Google.
Our effective tax rate was 22% for Q1.
Let me now turn to cash management. Other income and expenses was $157 million. Interest income and realized gains
on investments offset the continued impact of expenses from our FX hedging programs. For more details on OI&E,
please do refer to the slides that accompany this call on the IR website.
We're pleased with our strong operating cash flow at $6.6 billion. CapEx for the quarter was $2.9 billion. This quarter,
most CapEx spend was related to, first, product, production equipment, data center construction, and facilities, in that
order. Clearly, our computing capacity is a strategic asset for us, and that's why we're investing in it. But we innovate
there just like we do everywhere else. To give you an example, compared to five years ago, we can now deliver more
than three times as much compute power for the same amount of power or money.
Our free cash flow for the quarter was $3.7 billion; so once again, strong results in the core business, as evidenced by
our 17% fixed FX revenue growth this quarter and solid margin.
Now I'd like to turn it to Omid to provide you more specifics on our successful performance of our core and new
businesses, and then we'll turn it over to questions. Omid?

Thank you, Patrick.
Our teams turned in a great performance across our business this quarter. I thought I would switch up our typical
format a bit this time around. So I'll quickly share some highlights, and then I want to talk more about growth areas that
we are really focused on, mobile and branding.
Let's start with the rise of programmatic ad buying. It's an extraordinary change for the ads industry, and I want to point
out that our investments in the DoubleClick platform continue to be a big positive for us. We recently made TrueView,
our skippable ad format on YouTube, available through our DoubleClick suite, and we brought Internet-delivered TV
content to our Ad Exchange through mDialog, a company we acquired last year.
Google Play is also growing fast, connecting developers and content providers with more than 1 billion people on
Android devices around the world. Developers are building thriving businesses on our platform. And in February, we
announced that over the past 12 months, we've paid more than $7 billion to developers. We're honored to be partnering
with them.
Our partner hardware ecosystem is also doing great. LG Watch Urbane and Huawei Watch recently announced new
Android wear devices, and Pioneer launched in-dash car units compatible with Android Auto. Also, 10 top computer
OEMs are now making more than 35 Chrome devices, available in 38 countries, so it's great momentum for us.
Google for Work continues to grow at an impressive pace, thanks to the addition of customers like G4S, one of the
world's largest private-sector employers, who moved 70,000 of their employees to Drive for Work.
Working with our partners, we also recently launched Android for Work to accelerate the adoption of Android devices
in the workplace. Business is going great in these areas, and we continue to invest to capture the potential we see for
growth.
Now I want to talk more about the two areas where I see a lot of opportunity for us, first, the shift to mobile, and then
the trend of TV budgets shifting to digital. Mobile devices are driving a huge shift in the way people consume media.
You have heard about the trends many times. Here is our point of view.
As we all know, consumers reach for their phones a lot, and some of these moments matter more than others, like when
people are looking for answers or making a decision about what to buy or do. For example, more than eight in 10
smartphone users use their phone to research a product decision they're about to make in store. These moments include
small things like looking for a movie review and really big decisions like researching a new home purchase or figuring
out what car you want to buy next. So people expect to get exactly what they want, when they want it.
As a company built on intent and immediacy, that's good news for Google. Our job has always been to connect people
with what they are looking for in the exact moment they are looking. Our ad products are a critical way we deliver the
right answers in the right moment, and it's something we do really well. It's often more valuable to know someone is
shopping for a new SUV than it is to know basic demographic information about them. We have great opportunities in
mobile with some of the most popular mobile apps, including the Google app, YouTube, Gmail, and Maps, and our
great Android platform.
Search is also important to the mobile experience. We have retooled our search engine for mobile, providing direct
answers and enabling voice queries. It's really a delightful experience. Try opening the Google app and asking what's
the plot of the Godfather movie or flip a coin. You'll be pleasantly surprised.
Chrome for Mobile is also a popular app with more than 400 million users. And of course, a large number of people use
it as a primary way to search the web. We continue to invest in improving the mobile web for both users and
developers. In our recent Chrome release, we made it easier for users to add their favorite sites to their phones' home
screens and get helpful opt-in notifications from sites they visit often.
We've also been working to index apps just as effectively as we index web content. We now have 30 billion links
within apps indexed. And if you're looking for information that lives within an app that you don't have, we'll now begin
showing links to install the app right under the search results page.

The Google app on Android can also keep you up to date by surfacing information from more than 40 different apps
when it's relevant, like Pandora music recommendations on your commute or a car to request a lift when you arrive at
the airport.
We're also working very hard to make our products more accessible to the next 1 billion people who are coming online.
The first computing experience for these users won't be on a desktop machine or a laptop. They will be on a mobile
phone from day one. In fact, many of them will use a mobile device as their only computer. We launched Android One,
a new family of high-quality, low-cost smartphones in Indonesia and the Philippines this quarter, making it available in
a total of six emerging markets.
We're also working to eliminate the barriers to access from connectivity issues. For instance, in countries like India,
where a user might have a slow wireless connection, we can deliver a fast-loading light version of Search so they can
get their answers quickly and pay less for data. And with the Chrome app for Android and iOS, our data compression
features help reduce data usage by up to 50% while browsing the web. There's tremendous upside to these efforts, and
we're in a great position.
I'm also very excited about how we're helping marketers succeed in this mobile world. As I noted earlier, we're
connecting brands with the right people at the precise moment when it actually matters because of our strong intent
signals. Mobile also enables us to help drive the 90% of commerce that still takes place offline, which is a massive
opportunity that our partners are really excited about.
People are searching on Google for things like near me, closest, and nearby twice as much as they did last year. Our
local inventory ads are a great way for businesses to drive purchases in stores right when people are looking for local
options. We also help advertisers better measure the store visits that their digital ads drive, and we recently expanded
the capabilities to advertisers in new countries.
Our ads are also driving people to download apps precisely when they're looking for them. Our AdMob mobile ad
network offers great targeting and reach and is the foundation of our app install offerings. Last month we also
introduced ad promotion video ads and extended app install ads to our mobile Google display network, which increased
install volumes for early testers by an average of 28% without impacting cost per install. We also recently began testing
sponsored search results in Google Play with a small set of users and developers, helping app developers reach valuable
users directly within the store.
So I'm very excited about the mobile future, and marketers are too. Our pivot to mobile has great momentum and is
delivering strong benefits to users and advertisers.
I also feel very excited about the trend of video content and TV budgets shifting to digital. YouTube is the world's most
popular video service on all screens, with hundreds of millions of hours watched on YouTube every day. The place
where 1 billion people come to watch video is a natural home for video advertising budgets. When people come to
YouTube, they come with the intent of watching video, so it's the perfect time to reach them with a video ad, not when
they're distracted by something else. More and more brands are seeing the value of reaching audiences on YouTube
too, with the number of TrueView advertisers growing by 45% in 2014.
YouTube drives great results, and we can measure the impact. We have run over 6,000 brand lift studies to date across
some of those largest brand advertisers. And in studies we have run for Google Preferred campaigns, we found that
94% of the campaigns we studied drove a significant lift, an average of 80% in ad recall. That's why we're bringing it
back this year and expanding it to more than 10 new markets.
Google Preferred is also attracting some of the biggest TV advertisers to YouTube. More than 30 major brands that
have never advertised on YouTube before signed on with Google Preferred and saw such great results that they have
continued to advertise with YouTube afterwards. YouTube is home to great content and engaged audiences, and we're
seeing the natural shift of TV budgets.
So those are some of my observations on the trends affecting our business, what I'm hearing from partners, and why I'm
upbeat on the opportunities ahead. You will see a lot more at our Brandcast Upfront event in New York next week, at

Before I go, I want to thank all the Googlers worldwide for a great quarter, and I want to say a special thank you to
Patrick, who has been our fearless CFO for almost seven years and who wrote one of the most heartfelt and awesome
retirement notes I've ever seen. If you have read it, you'll know that he was inspired to move on after climbing Mount
Kilimanjaro. I've since then traveled to Kilimanjaro for all Googlers recommending local hills near their homes.
Patrick, you will be dearly missed, and we wish you and your wife all the best on your next venture. Thank you. And,
Ruth, if you're out there listening, we can't wait to begin working with you soon. Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Omid, and absolutely true for Ruth as well. Candace, why don't you give us the instructions to turn on the
Q&A?
Q&A
Operator
Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from line of Carlos Kirjner of Bernstein. Your line is
now open.
<Q - Carlos Kirjner-Neto>: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I have two questions. First, our research has
suggested that many or maybe most mobile websites and mobile apps are still in pretty bad shape when it comes to user
experience and conversion. I think one can expect this to improve over time. The question is, is an improvement in
conversion rate and experiences within mobile apps where users transact good or bad for Google? One could argue that
people are going to spend more time in apps, transacting apps and not search. How should we think about that?
Secondly, it's been more than two years since when we've seen capital intensity very high. It continues to be quite high
with $2.9 billion of CapEx. Is this the new normal? Is that what should we expect going forward? Thank you.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Omid, do you want to take the first one and I'll take the second one?
<A - Omid Kordestani>: Sure. Thank you, Carlos, for the question. We are actually very excited about improvements
of these mobile websites. And we really are happy to see where we can deliver the best answers to our users, whether
be it through an app or whether we find it on the web. We're working with developers, webmasters, publishers to help
them really surface their content to users in the format they feel best. And we also recently introduced this install app,
[ph] Install Carousel (21:33), which is evidence of that effort. So it's really about delivering the right results for the
users. And the less friction you have there and the more targeted you are, we'll see the benefits in monetization.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: On our side, Carlos, on the CapEx side, we are far from surprised from these numbers
internally. Part of our plan, we are shifting. As you know, we've been building a lot of data centers over the last 18
months. And so that is actually giving us the opportunity to put new equipment in. And we are jumping on the
opportunity, thinking through the total cost of ownership of these things and the much more higher efficiency of these
new machines. Having said that, I won't comment about the future. But I just want to reemphasize that we're not
surprised by these numbers. To us actually, they make sense given our strategy, and they really fuel all the innovation
that we have going for us. So it's an important part of our strategy. It's a strategic asset.
<Q - Carlos Kirjner-Neto>: Thank you.

Thank you. And our next question comes from line of Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
<Q - Mark S. Mahaney>: Thanks, Patrick. Thanks for all the additional color on the paid clicks and the CPCs, just so
we step back a little bit because there were many of us who thought it really was driven mostly by mobile. Is your
point, is your assertion that these real major shifts that we've seen over the last two or three years in CPC pressure has
really largely been driven by YouTube TrueView and the adoption of that? Is that the point you're making?
And if you would, in the past you always listed the factors that would cause the shifts in paid clicks and CPCs. Could
you just check off what the other items are and put them in order of priority? What's moving those two needles? Thank
you.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Mark, thank you for your question. In fact, that's why I made the comments I made today. I'm
just talking about the situation as we have it now. I'm not looking back to the prior years, I'm just saying what we have
seen in this quarter and the last quarter, we've just seen a real acceleration at YouTube, and that's why we thought it
was important because we saw this change from the fundamental strong performance of YouTube, both in terms of its
coverage, in terms of the performance. Even the TrueView ads, we tuned these ads to make sure that people want to
watch them so that they are very effective. And when they do, then people watch a lot more of them. And so over the
last quarter, over the last couple quarters, we've seen a real takeoff, and then the geographic expansion is giving us a lot
more coverage.
So it's a real positive story for YouTube because we see it now. We're reporting it now, so it's not a view back to the
last five years at all. I just wanted to clarify that. So thank you for your question.
<Q - Mark S. Mahaney>: Okay, thanks.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Candace, let's go to our next question.
Operator
And our next question comes from line of Douglas Anmuth of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
<Q - Douglas T. Anmuth>: Thanks for taking the question. Omid, I was hoping you could drill down a little bit more
on the mobile search changes that are taking place. Talk a little bit more about what you think the key factors are here
and the key differences, [ph] and how that'll impact both the natural results experience (24:48), and then also
monetization.
And then, Patrick, just on the margins and costs in the quarter, non-GAAP operating margins basically flat from a year
ago. I'm just trying to understand how much you think that was a factor of one-time items a year ago, or a change at all
in terms of your view on cost discipline within the business. Thanks.
<A - Omid Kordestani>: Thanks, Douglas. So with mobile phones really becoming such a primary way people search
the net, our goal is really to help people search, find the content that's not just relevant and timely but also really easy to
read and interact with on these smaller devices and smaller screens.
It's important to note that this is just one of over 200 signals we use to evaluate the best results. Non-mobile friendly
sites won't disappear from the mobile searches. They'll still rank high if they still hold great content that the user wants.
But a lack of mobile friendliness is a problem for web publishers. Visitors abandon the websites, and that's a real issue.
So it's really early to speculate exactly how the monetization impact of these organic algorithm changes will be. But we
always start with the user to deliver the right answer or the best answer, be it on the mobile web or the app, and that we
think that ultimately that's good for publishers, advertisers, and our users, and the monetization success will follow.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Great. And so, Douglas, on my side, if you look at it, we're really pleased with Q1, if you look
at the operating profit of the company. Despite Q4 to Q1 revenue trends that are always seasonal, we delivered

quarter. This was just a pretty clean quarter. We were pretty happy with it.
<Q - Douglas T. Anmuth>: Thank you.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thank you, Douglas, for your question. Candace, let's go to our next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
<Q - Brian Nowak>: Great, thanks for taking my questions. Just to go back to your comments on splitting YouTube
out from the CPCs and paid clicks, you mentioned paid click growth would be lower excluding YouTube. Would you
be willing to just help us understand that growth rate, what it looks like now and what it looked like a year ago? And on
the CPCs, you mentioned search CPCs continue to grow. Is that true even including the migration to emerging markets
where CPCs are lower and even the shift toward mobile?
<A - Patrick Pichette>: So we don't – look, what I wanted to do today is clarify the issue between YouTube and our
dot-com properties rather than to go into all the details. You've seen in my notes, in my comments that the impact of
TrueView ads and site CPCs, site CPCs would be growing if you take out the TrueView ad impact. And I've also noted
that mobile search is continuing on a path of strength. So from that perspective, what I wanted to make sure is that you
get the color that if you just exclude the great growth of YouTube, but it has very different fundamental dynamics; that
the core of what is typically search performance both on mobile and desktop, the combined is doing really good, and
the CPCs would be growing if you take the other effect out. So that's really what I want to make sure of, so that people
don't continue to hound on this issue of it's all about mobile that has terrible monetization. In fact, it's a good story
there, too.
<Q - Brian Nowak>: Okay.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thank you for your question.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ben Schachter of Macquarie. Your line is now open.
<Q - Benjamin Schachter>: First, Patrick, congratulations on a great run at Google and enjoy the future bike rides.
Couple of questions. Can you talk about how you think Google Wallet needs to evolve to better compete with Apple
Pay and others? Are we going to see acquisitions in that space, or will it be more organic?
And then, Patrick, any updated thoughts on how Google is viewing its cash balances? Are you going to return some of
that cash before you leave? Thanks.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: The easy answer is really for Omid, so I'll let him take that one, and then I'll talk about the
cash issues.
<A - Omid Kordestani>: Sure. On Apple Pay, again, I think it's just great; it's really wonderful to see that the industry
is really opening up here and that the merchants, the banks, consumers, are all starting to experience this. And our focus
is really to bring this set of new APIs for payments and called Android Pay, and that our goal has always been to
remove much of the friction that our users encounter today on everyday shopping experiences. And so we're excited
about what the industry is doing here and what the user adoption is going to be, and we're working with all the partners
to just put all the pieces together and finally create the momentum that we're all looking forward to benefit from.

<A - Patrick Pichette>: And on my side, Ben, I have no news on the cash issue. I'll just reiterate what I've said many
times because I think not only is it true, but it's important; that we do bring this issue to the attention of the Audit
Committee, the board. There are regular debates about this issue, and it's a balance between cash being a strategic asset.
And then the question that we ask ourselves also in our conversations and deliberations is do we have a pipeline of
opportunities that would make us believe that we would actually wisely invest this money. And in that sense, it's very
clear that we're having the debates and we continue, but we have no further updates for you on that issue.
<Q - Benjamin Schachter>: Good luck in the future.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thank you, Ben. We'll go to our next question, Candace.

And our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
<Q - Heather Anne Bellini>: Great, thank you for the question and congratulations, Patrick. I just wanted to follow up
on your YouTube comments earlier. You talked about the growth you've been seeing in particular over the last couple
quarters. I'm just wondering. When you are talking to advertisers, what's changed over the last year or so that you really
think has caused this acceleration in click volume that you are seeing? And how do you think about that gap and the
potential for that gap to close over time with what you see in just traditional site CPCs, if you will? Thank you.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: So I'll take the technical side of it, and then I'll let Omid give you a bit more on the color of
what's exciting at YouTube. Related to the question, in the answer I gave you, the comments I gave you today, it's
really about, if you think about it, about coverage rather than the new product because we've done a lot of geographic
expansion of YouTube, and that in itself gives you a lot more volume out there in terms of eyeballs.
And then in addition to that, we've through the great work of the team and the AdWords team and the YouTube team,
the monetization team, making sure that TrueView is a more efficient product where people, basically they actually do
watch the entire ad, and so they don't skip the four to five seconds. And all you need is, given the scale of YouTube
today, all you need is to have a product that people want more, and it actually delivers a lot more value, so in terms of
advertising total revenue. The fact that it's at the top of the funnel clearly has very different dynamics than when you
have a very specific performance-based ad that is tied to a very specific high-margin query. But that doesn't mean that
it's not incredibly useful for advertisers because that's where they start is at the top of the funnel. So these are all the
pieces of the puzzle that we have going for us. And for what's really exciting about YouTube, I'll let Omid give you
more color comment on this.
<A - Omid Kordestani>: Hi, Heather. So first of all, I invite you to come to Brandcast next week. I'll be there in New
York, and you'll get a sense of the momentum in YouTube. But really the way we look at it is as usual; first look at the
users. One-third of all people on the Internet are everyday watching hundreds of millions of hours on YouTube, and
this is generating billions of views. And then when we look at our advertisers, they want to be there. So we're seeing a
strong growth in TrueView with new advertisers. The number grew 45% in 2014. And all of the top 100 global brands
have run TrueView ads over the past year.
And as they are experiencing success, for example, with Google Preferred, I think I shared this stat earlier, but 95% of
the Preferred campaigns that we studied drove a significant lift, an average of 80%. And then more than 30 brands that
were new to advertising on YouTube used Google Preferred and then came back and continued to advertise with us
afterwards. So we're just having great success.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: So, Heather, it's a good story all around. We're pretty pleased by it, obviously. Thank you for
your question. Candace, we'll go to our next question, please.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your line is now open.
<Q - Eric J. Sheridan>: Thanks for taking the questions, and I'll echo the sentiment. Congrats, Patrick on the decision
and best of luck going forward. My question is more around mobile. I appreciate all the color around the clicks and the
CPC. Omid, maybe you could talk a little bit either qualitatively or quantitatively about the way in which mobile
advertising, especially search, is evolving over time and whether some of the gaps that we used to talk about one or two
years ago are starting to close in terms of monetization, whether it be dictated by screen sizes or people getting more
comfortable, or maybe some of the changes you'll be making around mobile search with some of the ranking that we've
seen that have gone into effect this week. I would love to get some color about how you've seen mobile evolve and how
you see it evolving going forward. Thanks.
<A - Omid Kordestani>: Sure. Let me just give you some thoughts, and again, thank you for this. We are very excited
about this pivot to mobile, and it's really obviously a shift that started gradually, and it's been very dramatic for us. So if
you talk to every product manager at Google and leader at Google, they have it at the forefront of their thoughts on how
to delight the users, how to improve the experience, same thing on our advertising front. I think so one is obviously the
efforts we're doing for the discovery, the search for information, be it in the apps or be it on mobile web.
The other aspect of this that is really going to help us obviously with the monetization front, is the improvements in
measurements, measuring across devices, measuring in-store sales. And as you know, the shopping experience
becomes more powerful because users can find this information. They can find it with local products. It doesn't become
just about driving leads to online retailers. It's about driving traffic to offline stores via mobile. And we're seeing great
adoption from retailers, from Macy's, REI, Sears. So what should really – the way we're going to talk about this and
you're going to hear us talk more about this is this intent and immediacy that we're so good at given our heritage in
search. And we're just applying all of that knowledge and all of the experience we have in ads and search to improving
these mobile experiences and how we monetize. Thank you.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thanks, Eric. Candace, our next question, please?
Operator
Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Anthony [indiscernible] (36:40) [DiClemente]. Your line is
now open.
<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Yes, can you hear me?
<A - Patrick Pichette>: We can. How are you, Anthony?
<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Okay, how are you, Patrick? Congratulations and best wishes on your next endeavors, a
couple questions. First, I want to ask about Maps and Waze. It seems to me like those are very strategic assets and
businesses where Google has a competitive advantage. So can you just talk about the progress and user experiences
with Maps and the opportunity going forward for the contribution to the business from those platforms?
And then secondly, Patrick, given your telecom background, can you just please describe for us the strategy around
Project Fi that was announced this week? How does that connect back to the other Google access initiatives like
Google Fiber? And maybe just talk about the longer-term vision there. Thanks.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Great. Do you want to jump in first?
<A - Omid Kordestani>: Yes, sure. This is Omid. Thank you, Anthony, for the question. On Maps, we absolutely
agree with you, very strategic, very popular, and that there are more than 1 billion active users of the Google Maps
services. We have mapped the world, as you know, 200 countries and territories, including North Korea. A billion
times the app has been downloaded on Android, and lots and lots of stats I can go through. I think one of the things
we're doing is not only to improve that experience and integrate it as much as it makes sense throughout the services
and whenever users can take advantage of those signals and the proper response from Google.

But the other side of this is also partnering. One of the things we're really actively doing is partnering, getting our Maps
service in native formats with as many partners out there that can take advantage of it. So it's an area we're really
investing in. we're very excited about it, it's having great traction, and we're also happy to offer it to our partners. And
you'll see us both in terms of Maps and Waze, you will see it getting integrated in other popular web services out there.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Great. On my side, look, there's quite a different rationale if you think of Fi versus access,
which is really asset-based. As a reminder to some of our – you may have not heard. We just announced Fi yesterday,
so it's still very early days. It's focused on innovating in conductivity and communications but in close partnership with
carriers in the U.S., hardware makers. And we're trying to see again from a user perspective and from a service
perspective, with or without assets, what should look like the next wave of innovation.
So we've always – we're always looking to make the web faster, cheaper, more available, and we wanted to try this new
vision, this new idea of fast and easy wireless service, and then work with the ecosystem of our carriers. So that's why
we have T-Mobile and Sprint as launch carriers and manufacturers and developers to develop this new product, new
and innovative service. So different in the sense that, Anthony, in the case of Fiber or in the case of Loon, it's really
asset-based. This one is really about services and how can we use today's platforms to actually just drive for more
innovation.
So that's really the difference, but we're pretty excited. It will be interesting to see the take rate, and it will be
interesting to see how the market responds to it. But again, very much as usual, focused on innovation, focused on
pushing the envelope. Thanks for your question.
<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Cool, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
<Q - Stephen Ju>: Patrick, bon voyage and best of luck with everything. So I'm trying to get some sense of the
direction of costs involved in running YouTube. Granted, there's the revenue share component with the content owners,
but then there are the everyday operating costs involved in just running the business like engineers, bandwidth, et
cetera. So I'm wondering at this point what part of YouTube's cost base is variable and what part is fixed because it
seems like your revenue is now large enough to cover the cost to serve your users and the cost in the aggregate is
probably not growing as rapidly as revenue.
And additionally, even as we adjust for the reclassification, I guess, of DoubleClick to network, the L&O line
decelerated a bit more than we thought. So I'm just wondering if this just due to Play indexing higher against those
countries that have the highest amount of FX headwinds, or did you have some hardware shortage issues this quarter
also? Thanks.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Okay, so let's start with the last one first, and then I'll come back to YouTube. Look, n other
revenues, what you have in there is, yes, you're right that we have the reclass. And then on the two other factors, clearly
Play is going really well, but it's also hit by quite strong headwinds. So we're very pleased with the performance of
Play, but given that it has quite a large international skew, it also gets hit by headwinds of FX as well.
And then on the hardware side, no shortage this quarter, so no shortage issues versus Nexus 4 to Nexus 6, so that's been
performing quite well. But again, when you look at year-over-year comparisons for hardware, then last year we had the
new Nexus 7 tablet that was very popular. So then you have a bit of noise on the comparisons year over year. And that's
really, so you have the combination of these three things that are flowing through the line. So that's why you end up
with that kind of performance. But what's most important is FX adjusted, we continue to be very, very pleased with the
Play growth.
On YouTube, interestingly, obviously we don't divulge any of the details of what's fixed and what's variable, and any of
this. What I can tell you is we actually monitor the performance of YouTube for its profitability to make sure that it

continues to grow profitably, and we basically manage with Susan [Wojcicki] to reinvest at the right pace, if you wish,
so fueling the growth where it is showing up and keeping tight in areas where we need more efficiencies.
So that's how we managed – again, I've said this in the past, I'll say it again. If you just want to make YouTube
profitable tomorrow morning, it's very easy. You put on the brakes on growth, and then it just turns into a profitable
business. We continue to work with that tension where Susan has the carrot of, hey, as much profitability I can generate
I can reinvest at a certain pace, so it creates a great incentive for this growth and disciplined behavior that we have
there. So we're pretty pleased by it. Thank you so much for your question, Stephen. Candace?
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
<Q - Ross Sandler>: Great. I just had two quick follow-ups from the last question, and then one for Nikesh. So,
Patrick, on the operating margin question, so given the increased discipline you talked about last call, do you think this
flat margin is sustainable in 2015? And if not, what would cause it to drop back down year on year?
And then from the prior question, so this new other revenue line was up 23% in the quarter. I think it was like 19% or
20% last quarter, so surprising that the acceleration's in there given the FX trends. Can you just talk about, is that
Google Play or is that hardware between those two?
And then, Nikesh, there's been some talk of Google introducing custom audience products for AdWords. Is that
something you're willing to talk about? And how big of a targeting feature like could that be in terms of improving
ROIs and increasing spend in search?
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Okay. So, Ross, on my side, two points. One is on the issue of margin, you know we don't
give guidance, so I can't pronounce myself for the rest of 2015. But I think that in Q1, you see a good example of what
we talked about when we had the comments in Q4, which is we drive for that right balance; that right balance of you
want to fuel as much as possible responsibly the growth that we have in the areas where we want to invest. And in other
areas, we may decide to actually really torque for efficiencies all the time, and you see that in our Q1 results.
In fact, I didn't mention it, but just a note on the head count. The vast majority of head count for Q1 is in fact engineers
and product managers. It's not G&A. It's not sales. It's really focused on engineering because that's where we wanted to
put the emphasis. So I'm using this as an example of even though the numbers are large in a number of areas, there is
actually a lot of science applied to every one of these numbers to make sure that we continue to drive for high
efficiencies as much as we can.
You may have heard that in Q1, we've canceled another program that we had, which was Helpouts. So this program did
not prove the promises that we had for it, and so we actually repurposed the team and shut down the entire initiative. So
again, I'm just giving you the signal that this is a disciplined organization that looks at the facts, that actually when it's
not working, people can sense it, and then we have a good conversation about it. And then on the other side, when we
see something really going well, we want to make sure that we push hard for it.
In the case of the second piece that you've asked, which was the growth in other revenue, I think Play is doing very
well. We're very happy about that. And yes, we're having good results on the Nexus 6, but year over year, it wasn't as
strong as it would have been given the strength of the Nexus 7 last year, so that's really been the big driver.
And as for Nikesh, Nikesh I heard is on his way to India right now. He was on a plane, but I have Omid here, who
would be delighted to answer your question.
<Q - Ross Sandler>: Sorry about that.
<A - Omid Kordestani>: Hi, Ross. That's all right. No problem.

<A - Omid Kordestani>: People confuse us, and Nikesh is at SoftBank now. So let's see, on these rumors about
custom audiences, we are very much focused on completing the cycle of better targeting and measurement attribution at
all points of the funnel with our different products. We're not announcing any new products at this point, but we have a
great number of targeting options interest/intent location across all the services from performance to brand. And I think
you will see us innovate here and continue to innovate here. So thank you.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thank you, Ross. And I didn't mean to pick on you. We all tripped over Nikesh and Omid all
the time. He's used to it by now.

Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Peter Stabler of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
<Q - Peter C. Stabler>: Good afternoon, thanks for taking the question. Patrick, thanks for all the color around the
click information. It begs another question though. Given the frequency with which a lot of us misinterpret these
numbers and given the growing importance of brand advertising and the accompanying expansion of attribution and
ROI modeling to measure impact beyond simple clicks, I'm wondering if these metrics have outlived their usefulness
and whether you guys are considering a way to help us understand your success behind brand advertising going
forward. Thanks very much.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: I Look, we look at this on a regular basis. We just happened to see on the YouTube side so
much change in the last couple quarters that we thought it was worth mentioning. I think they've served as well. And if
we ever decide to look at different ways to look at the business and want to report it that way, we'll let you know. For
now, we have really no difference and changes in the way that we report it. So that's the short answer, Peter.
<Q - Peter C. Stabler>: Thank you.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: I think we have time for one last question. So why don't we take one last question before we
close to call, Candace?
Operator
Thank you. And our last question come from the line of Mark May of Citi. Your line is now open.
<Q - Mark A. May>: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. There's a view out there that consumer behavior is different
on mobile versus desktop in terms of search and web usage versus apps. I'm just wondering. Are you seeing that from
your users as they shift from desktop to mobile devices? I guess in essence, is the growth in mobile search activity
offsetting the weakness that you may be seeing in desktop search?
And then second question is just on verticals, by-advertiser verticals. We had heard some data points during the quarter
around potentially some weakness in the e-commerce category. I'm just wondering if you could comment a little bit on
maybe some verticals where you saw particular strength and weakness. Thanks.
<A - Omid Kordestani>: Sure, thank you, Mark, for the question. So let me just take the vertical one first in terms of
performance. We definitely saw automotive and travel were stronger verticals this quarter. India was a strong performer
as far as the geo goes for us. And those are really some of the areas that I could highlight.
And I think in terms of this behavioral change, we are really, really focused on studying it every day. The shift is very,
very dramatic and that we're laser-focused on being as good and relevant and fast and monetize well, all the things that
we did on the desktop and continue to do on a desktop to do that on mobile. So I think all I can say on that is that you're

right, behaviors are different. There's this immediacy having this device always with you, using it as your assistant,
using your voice to make commands and getting results, using the Maps being in a moment of purchase decision. And
we are relying on this information source to help you. So all of those things are really, really powerful and we're very
excited about it. It's a journey that we're all on and looking forward to doing a better job and to monetizing well.
Patrick Pichette
So thank you, Mark, for your question. Before I close, allow me just 10 seconds. First, Ruth will join us in about a
month. We're really excited to have her. I will be here to help her in transition, but you'll hear a much better voice in Q2
on the earnings call. So we're really looking forward to having her as part of the team.
It obviously has been a delight to work at Google for the last seven years. I have obviously three thanks, three huge
thanks for that. The first one is to the Google community. As Omid mentioned, all these Googlers are simply
extraordinary individuals and people. These men and women, they just continue to develop the stream of innovation
that is really changing the world and making it a better place. So it's been a real joy to work with every one of them.
My colleagues around this table, the IR team as well as the executive group that I've spent many, many hours over the
years, and they're mostly friends now, so thank you for your friendship and for all of your warmth over the last few
years.
And finally, you, the financial community, our shareholders. You've been supportive, you've been probing, you've had
the insights, you've been really with us for the last seven years through thick and thin as we've seen a lot of stuff come
and go, and really strong supporters for this a bit crazy, unconventional company. So I just need to thank you as well
for all the great times together. With that, yes, I am going to grab my backpack and take off for the world. So you may
see me somewhere in the world, and if you do, just please do stop and say hi. It will be a delight to see you.
So with that, I'll let Candace close the call. Thank you so much, and we'll see you – or Ruth will see you in Q2. Cheers.
