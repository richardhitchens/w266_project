MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, everyone, and welcome to Merck's Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being
recorded.
At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Joseph Romanelli, Vice President-Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Joseph Romanelli
Thank you, Darla, and good morning, everyone. We'd also like to say good afternoon and good evening to everyone
listening outside the United States. Welcome to Merck's Second Quarter 2015 Conference Call.
Before I turn the call over to Ken, I just want to point out a couple of items. First, you'll see that we have items in our
GAAP results such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs and certain other items. You should note that we
have excluded those items from our non-GAAP results. There are reconciliation tables available in our press release so
that you can get a better understanding of their underlying performance. We've also provided tables to help you
understand the sales results in the quarter for the business units as well for the products. This can be found in table
three of our press release and the reconciliation tables I mentioned earlier are in table two of the press release. During
the call, we will be referring to table two for the P&L and table three as it relates to revenue.

Second, I would like to remind you that some of the statements we make during today's call may be considered
forward-looking statements within the Safe Harbor Provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995. Such statements are made based on the current belief of Merck's management and are subject to significant risks
and uncertainties. If our underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ
materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.
Our SEC filings including item 1A in the 2014 10-K identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements that could
cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any of our forward-looking statements
this morning. Merck undertakes no obligation to publically update any forward-looking statements and you can see our
SEC filings, as well as today's earnings release on merck.com.
So with that, this morning, I'm joined by Ken Frazier, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Adam Schechter,
President of Global Human Health; Rob Davis, our Chief Financial Officer; and Dr. Roger Perlmutter, President of
Merck Research Labs.
Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Ken. Ken?
Kenneth C. Frazier
Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining the call today. Before I discuss our quarterly
performance, I want to take a moment to thank Joe Romanelli for faithfully leading our Investor Relations efforts for
the past two years. Joe is moving on from explaining our numbers to a role in which he will be generating revenue as
Managing Director for our business in Taiwan and Hong Kong. We have benefited from Joe's expertise and leadership
and he has done an outstanding job. We wish him and his family all the best as they relocate to Asia. Thank you, Joe.
I'm also pleased that joining the call today is Joe's successor, [ph] Terry Laughlin (02:55). [ph] Terry (02:57) comes to
Merck with a wealth of experience in finance and investor relations, and has worked in the pharmaceutical,
entertainment and investment banking industries. Welcome to Merck, [ph] Terry (03:07). We're pleased to have you on
our team.
This is an exciting time for Merck as we advance our promising pipeline and launch new products in the marketplace.
It is also a propitious time for biomedical research generally, as we are witnessing the introduction of breakthrough
therapies, and in some cases, cures for some of the most difficult-to-treat diseases. Merck's late stage pipeline and
ongoing launches reflect scientific and therapeutic progress that will provide significant value to patients and society.
Over the past few months, I've seen and heard firsthand from stakeholders across the healthcare ecosystem, including
patients, payers and government about the critical impact that our current and future medicines and vaccines can have
on improving the health and productivity of both individuals and populations. These experiences continue to reinforce
my conviction that in the evolving healthcare environment, success will accrue to those who develop products that not
only enable patients to live longer more productive lives, but that also can help reduce overall healthcare expenditures.
By bringing forward these kinds of medical innovations, Merck will create sustainable value for society and
shareholders.
Turning to our second quarter performance, we built on the strong momentum achieved earlier in the year by executing
well on our focused and disciplined strategy. Global Human Health delivered top line growth in our four core areas of
oncology, hospital acute care, diabetes and vaccines. Our Animal Health business also grew 10% due in part to the
strong growth of BRAVECTO.
We are investing resources to grow our strongest brands and to support the most promising assets in our pipeline, while
at the same time lowering our overall cost base and delivering a leveraged P&L. Merck is active in many of the most
promising areas of science and medicine, including oncology, antibiotic resistance, cardiometabolic disease, hepatitis C
and Alzheimer's disease. The progress we continue to make with our pipeline reflects this.

We're advancing both our KEYTRUDA and hep C programs, two of our most important assets. As we move into the
second half of 2015, our organization is preparing for these exciting opportunities.
Last month, the FDA accepted our supplemental BLA for KEYTRUDA in advanced non-small cell lung cancer and
granted KEYTRUDA priority review. And just this past week, the European Commission approved KEYTRUDA for
the treatment of advanced melanoma in adults, both as a first-line therapy and in previously-treated patients.
Earlier today, we announced that the FDA has accepted, under priority review, the new drug application for our doublet
regimen for the treatment of adult patients infected with hepatitis C. Last week, the European Medicines Agency also
accepted our application which they will review on an accelerated basis. Roger will discuss our KEYTRUDA and hep
C programs in greater detail later in the call.
I'm pleased with the progress we've made with our key pipeline assets. I'm also encouraged by our underlying
commercial performance, which Adam will discuss in more detail shortly. We achieved solid growth in both our
Human and Animal Health businesses, and in particular, in our diabetes franchise where we saw 9% growth. We also
continue to make progress with the recent introductions of KEYTRUDA, BELSOMRA, ZERBAXA and GARDASIL
9, each of which provides an important treatment option for unmet medical needs. The growth of an established brand
like JANUVIA and the successful launch of KEYTRUDA in the competitive melanoma field are examples of how we
are bringing greater discipline, focus, and execution across our business and especially in those areas where we have
the greatest opportunities to grow and to lead.
In closing, Merck is positioned to build on the strong momentum we've achieved during the first half of the year. Going
forward, we will focus on the best scientific and medical innovations sourced both internally and externally because we
believe that is the best path to long-term value creation. By capitalizing on the significant and exciting scientific and
clinical opportunities that lie ahead, Merck intends to play a major role in transforming healthcare for the benefit of
patients, payers and shareholders alike.
And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Adam Schechter.
Adam H. Schechter
Thank you, Ken, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll discuss the second quarter results for Global Human
Health and my comments will be on a constant currency basis.
Our performance in the quarter reflects continued efforts to drive growth within our core business, coupled with
increasing contributions from new product launches. Sales increased 3% with growth in all of our core focus areas of
diabetes, hospital acute care, vaccines and oncology. Collectively, these core focus areas grew 9%, excluding the
acquisition of Cubist. I'll start by reviewing the performance of several key products, followed by a brief update by
region and then on several launched products.
Starting with the JANUVIA franchise, we delivered our seventh straight quarter of growth. We have steadily increased
resources for JANUVIA to drive growth, and our results reflect the positive impact of our strategic resource allocation
and the strength of the products. In the second quarter, the JANUVIA franchise sales reached approximately $1.6
billion and grew 9%. In the United States, sales grew 14%. While we continue to drive underlying volume growth of
about 4%, we had some benefits this quarter from adjustments to rebate accruals. In the international markets, sales
grew 4%. Volume growth in Europe was a key contributor to performance. And emerging markets delivered steady
double-digit growth.
Also, we are pleased that the data presented in a TECOS study at the American Diabetes Association meeting last
month confirmed that JANUVIA did not increase the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events or hospitalization for
heart failure. We're now educating customers on these important results.
Sales of ZETIA and VYTORIN declined 8%. In the United States, ZETIA was flat, offset by declines in VYTORIN.
Outside the U.S., sales fell as a result of ZETIA's loss of exclusivity in Canada and prescription initiation restrictions in

France.
Next, in Hospital and Specialty Care, sales of ISENTRESS decreased 10% to approximately $375 million. We are
starting to see the impact of slowing growth of the integrase class and continued competitive dynamics in the U.S. and
Europe. We are also having a difficult year-over-year comparison versus second quarter of 2014 in the emerging
markets due to tenders.
In Immunology, sales of REMICADE and SIMPONI were approximately $625 million, a decline of 1%. Continued
growth in SIMPONI of about 20% was offset by a 7% decline in REMICADE. As expected, we're seeing additional
competition from biosimilars in the first full quarter since loss of exclusivity. We expect declines in REMICADE to
accelerate in the back half of this year as tenders are implemented in core markets.
In Hospital Acute Care, sales grew to approximately $930 million. We drove double-digit growth across our portfolio.
As a leader in hospital acute care, we are enthusiastic about diversity and the breadth of our underlying business and
the promising launch opportunities that we're executing on today and planning for in the future.
Turning to the Vaccine business. Vaccine sales were about $1.2 billion, up 1% versus the prior year. Growth in the
GARDASIL franchise was offset by a decline in sales of RotaTeq due to the timing of public sector purchases in the
United States. Combined sales of GARDASIL and GARDASIL 9 grew 6% to approximately $425 million on
contributions from the United States and emerging markets. We continue to transition customers to GARDASIL 9 and
managed care coverage is now similar to that of GARDASIL.
Sales of ZOSTAVAX were approximately $150 million, a decline of 3%. In the U.S., sales declined 8%. We continue
to work with customers to help them understand the broad managed care coverage and the process for obtaining
reimbursement. Also, we'll be launching a new DTC campaign for ZOSTAVAX in the United States during the start of
flu season. This new campaign will focus on increasing brand awareness and patient activation. Outside of the U.S.,
Canada drove sales growth. We are continuing to launch ZOSTAVAX in more than 25 markets.
Now, I'll provide some geographic commentary for the quarter. In the United States, excluding Cubist, sales increased
5% primarily from growth in the JANUVIA franchise, oncology and hospital acute care. In Europe and Canada, sales
decreased 8%. Growth from the JANUVIA franchise and SIMPONI was offset by ophthalmology product divestitures,
declines in REMICADE and declines in ZETIA and VYTORIN. Japan sales declined 13%, primarily from
ophthalmology product divestitures and declines in older diversified products. PNEUMOVAX grew on the continued
rollout of the national immunization program.
Emerging market sales grew 4%. If you exclude divestitures, sales would have grown 6%. China grew 8% this quarter,
driven by sales increases in hospital acute care.
Now, I'll provide some updates on a few of our key launches and I'll start with BELSOMRA. We are encouraged by
results in early months of the BELSOMRA launch in the United States. Demand for this new medicine is steadily
increasing. From an access perspective, BELSOMRA is now covered by commercial payers, representing over 100
million lives. Next week, we will begin a branded DTC campaign to enhance consumer awareness.
With ZERBAXA, customer feedback in early launch is positive. Over 300 hospitals have placed ZERBAXA on
formulary. Looking ahead, we are intensifying our focus on increasing access, while at the same time driving greater
utilization in hospitals where ZERBAXA is on formulary.
In addition, we saw another strong performance for KEYTRUDA with sales reaching $110 million. In the United
States, we achieved more than 60% patient share in IPI-refractory melanoma, a testament to our team's strong launch
execution. KEYTRUDA is now the number one therapy used to treat melanoma in the U.S.
Importantly, as we speak, we are launching KEYTRUDA the in EU, where the product is approved for use in advanced
first- and second-line melanoma. The deep clinical experience physicians are gaining through KEYTRUDA launch in
melanoma is building a solid foundation, particularly in the community setting for potential launches in lung cancer and
also other cancers. With October 2 PDUFA date, our teams are ready for potential launch in patients with advanced
squamous and non-squamous non-small lung cancer.

Finally, now that our HCV doublet has priority review with the FDA and accelerated assessment in the EU, we are very
much looking forward to launching this important product next year.
In summary, Global Human Health delivered another solid performance in the quarter. We grew through execution in
all of our core focus areas of diabetes, hospital acute care, vaccines and oncology. We are gaining traction with key
launches that will help to drive future growth.
Now, I'll turn the call over to my colleague, Rob Davis.
Robert M. Davis
Thanks, Adam. Good morning, everyone. As Ken and Adam stated, our results this quarter and the first half of the year
show that we're executing the focus strategy we first outlined nearly two years ago. We're driving top line growth in
core therapeutic areas and delivering a leveraged P&L. This morning, I'll provide some additional detail on the quarter
and comment on our outlook for the second half of the year. My remarks will focus on our non-GAAP financials.
Total company revenues were $9.8 billion for the quarter, a decrease of 11% year-over-year while the underlying base
business grew 3%. This excludes a negative 7 percentage point impact from foreign exchange and a net negative 7
percentage point impact from acquisitions, divestitures and the now-ended AstraZeneca JV. I should note that the
impact from foreign exchange includes the benefit of approximately $190 million of revenue from our hedging
program.
Growth, overall, was primarily driven by four core focus areas of diabetes, hospital acute care, oncology and vaccines
in our pharmaceutical business and by the 10% growth in our Animal Health business.
Moving now to expenses, gross margin was 75.4% in the quarter, an increase of 280 basis points year-over-year. Lower
inventory write-offs and foreign exchange provided the primary benefit in the quarter.
Total operating expenses were $463 million lower this quarter, primarily driven by marketing and administrative
expenses, which declined 15% versus prior year due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange, net favorability from
acquisitions and divestitures, and lower direct selling costs. Research and development expenses declined 2%, as
increased spending in the quarter was more than offset by foreign exchange. With our ongoing cost reductions, we are
on track to meet or exceed the $2.5 billion in savings versus 2012 by the end of this year.
Finally, our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%. The 180 basis point increase versus the prior year
primarily reflects a discrete item recorded this quarter related to an adjustment for deferred taxes associated with
restructuring activities.
Overall, we earned $0.86 per share in the second quarter, delivering 1% growth despite meaningful headwinds from
foreign exchange and the net negative impact of acquisitions, divestitures and the now ended AstraZeneca JV. Our
commitment to expense management, coupled with focused investments in key brands, continues to produce results.
Now turning to the outlook for the remainder of 2015. Accounting for our performance in the first half of the year, we
are updating our top line revenue guidance to a range of $38.6 billion to $39.8 billion. While we feel comfortable
moving to a midpoint of $39.2 billion for the full year 2015, we feel the range is appropriate due to the potential impact
of foreign exchange volatility.
Moving to PGM, we expect full year gross margin to be approximately 125 basis points higher versus 2014. We
continue to expect an overall decrease in operating expenses as lower marketing and administrative expenses are
partially offset by a modest increase in research and development expense. Altogether, we anticipate total operating
expenses in the second half of 2015 to be approximately $200 million lower than in the prior year.
Regarding our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we now expect the full year effective tax rate will be between 23% and
24% as we account for the higher rate in the second quarter. Taking these changes into account and given our strong

operational performance in the first half of 2015, we are now increasing our non-GAAP EPS range to $3.45 to $3.55.
We are also updating the range for our GAAP EPS guidance. As we've discussed over the past year, we've been
monitoring the situation in Venezuela. Based on evolving economic conditions and volatility in the country, our
valuations have led us to take a $715 million charge in the second quarter to revalue our net monetary assets in the
country.
While we have taken this action, we will work with the government to continue to get essential medicines into the
country and to ensure continued positive U.S. dollar cash flows from our operations. We now expect GAAP EPS to be
$1.52 to $1.71 for full year 2015, with the charge with Venezuela partially offset by the anticipated gain on the
previously announced sale of CGRP program, which will be accounted for in the third quarter.
Finally, touching briefly on capital allocation, we remain focused on our commitment to returning cash to shareholders
and have, over the last 12 months, returned $11 billion via the dividend and share repurchase. Altogether we're
encouraged by the growth in our business and the leverage we're delivering through our focused strategy. As we move
forward, we remain committed to transforming our operating model, achieving our cost reduction targets and ensuring
we deliver a leveraged P&L.
Now I'll turn the call to Roger.
Roger M. Perlmutter
Thanks, Rob. I'll briefly review some of the accomplishments in research and development during the second quarter.
First, with respect to KEYTRUDA, our PD-1 directed monoclonal antibody designed to promote activation of
pre-existing tumor-directed immune responses, we announced that the European Commission granted marketing
authorization for KEYTRUDA in the first and second line setting for patients with advanced melanoma.
This approval includes data from our KEYNOTE-006 study, which compared KEYTRUDA to ipilimumab in the first
and second line treatment of patients with advanced melanoma. Details of this study, including the favorable outcomes
observed for response rates, progression pre-survival and overall survival, were published in the New England Journal
of Medicine and were also incorporated into regulatory approval of KEYTRUDA in Australia.
We have filed the KEYNOTE-006 data as supplemental BLA with the FDA, and have also filed an sBLA for our
KEYNOTE-002 study, where therapy with KEYTRUDA proved superior to traditional chemotherapy with respect to
both response rates and progression-free survivals.
During the quarter, the FDA granted priority review to our supplemental license application for the use of
KEYTRUDA in patients with advanced treatment refractory non-small cell lung cancer, where EGF receptor or
out-directed therapy is not indicated. Data supporting this application also published in the New England Journal of
Medicine demonstrated that expression of PD-L1, one of two ligands for PD-1, the target of KEYTRUDA, and greater
than 50% of tumor cells was associated with substantially higher response rates than were seen in patients whose
tumors did not express PD-L1.
These responses occurred irrespective of the underlying histologic classification of the presenting non-small cell lung
cancer. These data were included in our recent submission to the FDA, which has an action date of October 2.
We continue to see responses in patients suffering from a broad range of tumor types following treatment with
KEYTRUDA. Registration-enabling studies are already underway in many of these settings. Data on additional
KEYTRUDA responsive tumors were presented at the American society of clinical oncology meetings last month.
Among the most interesting presentations, selected for more than 30 abstracts describing the activity of KEYTRUDA,
was a study from Johns Hopkins University demonstrating that responsiveness to KEYTRUDA in patients suffering
from metastatic colorectal cancer was associated with tumor-specific deficits in DNA repair mechanisms.

These data, which also appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine, provide support for the view that control of
tumor growth following KEYTRUDA administration is in part determined by the frequency of mutations in tumor
DNA that could give rise to novel immune targets in the tumor cells. Studies of this type suggest ways in which the
efficacy of KEYTRUDA might be further enhanced. Additional studies examining the importance of tumor-specific
DNA repair deficits and dictating KEYTRUDA responsiveness in cancer patients will begin in the very near future.
In infectious diseases, the committee on human medicinal products of the EMA recommended approval of ZERBAXA,
our next generation antibiotic targeting-resistant gram-negative bacteria for the treatment of complicated
intra-abdominal or urinary tract infections including pyelonephritis. Once the CHMP decision is ratified by the
European Commission, which could occur by the end of September, ZERBAXA will become available in all member
states of the European Union.
I'm also pleased to report that both the EMA and the FDA have accepted our filing for the use of our
grazoprevir/elbasvir tablet in patients suffering from chronic hepatitis C virus infection. In Europe, our file was granted
accelerated assessment for the treatment of infection with hepatitis C virus genotypes types 1, 3, 4 and 6. The
accelerated assessment was based on the significant unmet medical need that exists in hepatitis C virus-infected
patients with chronic maintenance sufficiency.
The grazoprevir/elbasvir combination was previously granted break through designation by the FDA and we have now
been informed that our file, which supports the use of the combination for hepatitis C genotypes 1, 4 and 6 will receive
priority review with a PDUFA date of January 28, 2016. Site inspections in support of the U.S. filing have already
begun.
During this quarter, we submitted our complete response file for sugammadex, marketed in over 60 countries around
the world as BRIDION for the reversal of neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium or vecuronium, drugs that
are employed during certain surgical procedures. We have been informed that there will be an FDA Advisory
Committee meeting to review the sugammadex filing on November 6, supporting a PDUFA date of December 19.
I should also note that we continue to have good discussions with the PMDA in Japan regarding our filing for
omarigliptin, our once-weekly DPP-4 inhibitor for the control of hyperglycemia in patients with Type-2 diabetes. We
anticipate filing for omarigliptin in the United States before the end of the year.
During our first quarter earnings call, I provided top line information on the TECOS study, which assessed
cardiovascular outcomes in patients receiving JANUVIA for glycemic control as compared to those treated with other
regimens. Details of the study were presented in June at the American Diabetes Association annual meeting and were
published simultaneously in the New England Journal of Medicine.
Beyond TECOS, I will remind you, we are also engaged in a 30,000-patient outcome study called REVEAL, testing
whether anacetrapib, our novel CETP inhibitor, can, when added to standard therapy, reduce the frequency of major
cardiovascular events in patients with significant risk for such events.
As I mentioned in April, the REVEAL Steering Committee continues to evaluate a change in the study protocol to
include Ischemic stroke as a component of the primary composite end point. Their proposal must be fully vetted by
governance committees and regulatory agencies and I expect that they will publish the proposed modifications. The
Steering Committee estimates that the first interim analysis with this new protocol will take place towards the end of
this year. In the meantime, the study is proceeding as planned.
Finally, we have continued to make progress in business development. To cite two recent examples, last week, we
announced an important expansion of our agreement with Ablynx, enabling us to select up to 12 additional programs
involving nanobodies, the products of B lymphocytes in the South American llama.
Nanobodies are small single-chain antibodies that may be concatenated relatively simply using well-described
molecular engineering techniques to produce multivalent therapeutic candidates, including antibodies that block
multiple immune checkpoint targets simultaneously

In a second related example, today, we announced the acquisition of cCAM Biotherapeutics, an Israeli company
pursuing novel immunotherapies for cancer. Included among their drug candidates is CM-24, a humanized, monoclonal
antibody in Phase I trials for the treatment of advanced malignancy. CM-24 is specific for the CEACAM1 cell adhesion
molecule, which, based on preclinical analyses, affects the ability of tumor-specific lymphocytes to control the growth
of malignant cells. Additional details regarding this acquisition can be found in our press release.
In sum, during the second quarter, our teams made meaningful progress in developing key new therapies for the
treatment of malignancy, hepatitis C virus infection and resistant bacterial infections.
I'll now turn the call over to Joe.
Joseph Romanelli
Thanks, Roger. And, Darla, we'll begin the Q&A segment of our call this morning. And for the callers, if you can limit
yourself to one or two questions, that way, we can get to as many people in the queue as possible.
So, Darla, we'll take our first caller, please.

<Q - David R. Risinger>: With respect to my questions, I guess one question on REMICADE biosimilar that I'm not
clear on is, are governments trying to leverage the REMICADE biosimilar and push down pricing of other branded
anti-TNFs? And along those lines, do you expect any implications from the NOR-SWITCH study when that report's
out? So that's my first question. And then I guess my second question is, could you just walk through what we should
focus on in the fall at upcoming cancer conferences on your I-O franchise? Thank you.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Adam?
<A - Adam H. Schechter>: Yeah, good morning, Dave. With regard to biosimilars, right now, we're not seeing a
major impact in products outside of REMICADE. So, for example, if you look at SIMPONI, we continue to see good
growth with SIMPONI and we haven't seen any significant impact to SIMPONI based upon REMICADE being
biosimilar. At this point in time, we're not seeing a major impact from substitution. As you mentioned, there is the
study that's being done in Scandinavia. We'll see the results of that study and, over time, I believe that there will be
additional impact from studies as such, but I think it will take time, Dave.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Great. Roger?
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: Yeah. The question was the fall conferences in the fall. We're going to have a lot of data
at AASLD and I expect we will have the opportunity to present some data with respect to our triplet therapy, which will
be quite interesting going forward. And in immuno-oncology, there are a variety of oncology meetings. I think the
ESMO meetings are probably going to be the most interesting in Europe.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Okay. Thanks, Dave. And, Darla, next caller?

It's from Marc Goodman with UBS.
<Q - Marc Goodman>: Yes. Just to continue on the REMICADE, just curious, help us with how pricing is being with
the biosimilar. And can you talk about China a little bit? Obviously, sales were pretty good there but we're hearing a lot
of slowdown in China. There's a lot of things going on there. Talk about your new product launches relative to what's
happening in China and how we should expect your growth. Can we grow double digits for the next couple of years
there? And then just lastly, on the gross margin, can you just give us the impact that foreign exchange had on the gross
margin? Thanks.
<A - Adam H. Schechter>: So, Marc, this is Adam. Let me start with biosimilars. I'll give you some additional context
then I'll briefly talk about China. If you look at what's occurring in the marketplace, we've definitely seen an increased
impact in our first full quarter since loss of exclusivity in the second wave of the core European markets. We're seeing
mandatory price reductions based upon referenced pricing impacts. And as I reported last quarter, biosimilar discounts
we've seen as high as 45%. However, we still maintain about a 95% market share and we are facing mostly the
reference pricing is the key issue as we speak right now.
Over time, we believe that as more new patients come into the market, we will lose market share because we've been
able to hold on to the vast majority, we've won most tenders for existing patients. So it really is the new patients
coming in that, over time, we'll begin to lose. Taking all that together, we expect the impact from loss of exclusivity on
the REMICADE business for this year will exceed the growth that we're seeing for SIMPONI. But I will mention, as I
said before, we expect SIMPONI will continue to grow despite the utilization of REMICADE biosimilars.
If you look at China, we had 8% growth and we saw growth across our hospital acute care business and diversified
brands. There's no doubt that we are seeing some macro trends of a slowdown, but I still believe there's significant
opportunity there. We have good traction with multiple key products that we have, the products that you would think
of, but we're also pursuing innovation and we're looking forward to having NRDL pricing approval for products like
JANUVIA and ZETIA in the future, which I think can be growth drivers for us in that market. So despite the macro
trends, I do believe over time, that China can remain an important market for us.
<A - Robert M. Davis>: Good morning, Mark. This is Rob. With regards to your question on the impact of foreign
currency and gross margin, it accounted for about half of the increase you saw 2015 second quarter versus second
quarter 2014.

It's from Tim Anderson with Bernstein.
<Q - Timothy M. Anderson>: Thank you. A couple of questions. Obviously one of the important controversies with
investors is how KEYTRUDA's label will read in second line lung. I'm wondering if you can give us your latest
thinking. Will it likely be broad meaning in all-comers or what – will it likely be narrow, meaning in PD-L1 positive
patients? I know in the past, you said you think the label would probably want to reflect the data in both patient
populations, but I don't really know what that means in terms of the indication per se.
And on the same line of questioning, what's the most updated data you have on KEYNOTE-001 in PD-L1 negative
patients in terms of the number of patients you have? I think originally, that data set was around 40 patients. I think at
ASCO I saw that it had grown to about 70 patients that were PD-L1 negative. What's going to be the final number that
FDA has in the KEYTRUDA application?
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: Tim, first of all, with respect to the explicit language of the label, I can't comment on
what FDA ultimately will decide to do. Obviously, the major claims in the study, as I indicated, relate to response rates

in PD-L1 positive patients and that fundamentally is what we'll be focused on, but at the same time, as I've said before,
I don't think that the data that exists in the PD-L1 negative population can be ignored.
The exact number of PD-L1 negative patients in the file, I'd really have to get back to you on that, but you're right, it's
going to be somewhere close to 100 patients. So as I say, it's a considerable number there, and there are meaningful
responses in that patient population which one would guess will be reflected in one way or another.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Great. Thanks, Tim. And Darla, next caller, please.

It's from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you. A couple questions. Ken, first for you, I'm wondering if you guys are giving any
second thoughts to how you might consider unlocking the value of the diversified brands business. I know last year,
there were rumors in the press that you were considering bundling that business and selling it. And I think you decided
not to because of the substantial tax leakage, but as you know, we're seeing companies come up with all sorts of
creative ways to either spin out certain assets, sell assets, et cetera, et cetera. So, I'm just wondering maybe if you or
Rob can comment on what you might be thinking in terms of options for that business because, obviously, it is having a
significant drag on your top line.
And my second question for you, Roger, is on anacetrapib. If you could comment on the drug's long half-life, how
much of a disadvantage do you see this? Obviously I think the Street has basically written your CETP off because of
this issue. If you could put that into context for us, thanks very much.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Ken?
<A - Kenneth C. Frazier>: Okay. Thanks, Jami, for the questions. First of all, as we've said before, we are really
focused on prioritization. And as we look across our entire business, we continue to challenge ourselves to determine
whether specific assets, including diversified brands, would have more value outside of Merck or as part of our
business. You've seen us take action and divest certain assets, I would say ophthalmology, MCC, when we feel that we
can do that in a way that's advantageous to the company long term. So while we are cognizant of the issue that you just
raised relative to the top line growth, we have to look at the difficulty associated with it and what are the vehicles that
we could use to do that.
So I can just summarize it by saying that we will look at these mature assets and we'll focus on the impact that they
have on cash flow as well as the impact they have on growth, and we'll try to make the right decision relative to the
specific opportunities that we have. Thanks.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Thanks, Ken. And, Roger?
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: Yeah, Jamie, with respect to anacetrapib, I think the really important issue is the
benefit/risk ratio. We have a very large, as you know, study, 30,000-patient study, which will go on for quite a long
time. And we're capturing all the adverse experience data within that patient population. The benefit of reducing major
cardiovascular events is significant. It's very meaningful. It can, in fact – it's certainly a morbidity benefit. It could in
fact be a mortality benefit. That has to be, then, juxtaposed with the adverse experience profile.
Because we have so many patients who've been treated for such a long time, I think we'll have a very good sense of
that. And depending upon the magnitude of the benefit that we see, the consequence we believe of LDL cholesterol
lowering, also HDL raising, [indiscernible] (40:26) lowering, all of those things together will have to be juxtaposed
with what the adverse experience profile looks like. Once we have the data, I think we'll have a better sense of that.
<A - Adam H. Schechter>: And Jamie, this is Adam. The only thing I'd add is I'm sure you remember when we
launched the 4S trial, also when we launched the ASCOT trial in the cholesterol area, boy, I would have – I wished we
had an outcomes trial at the time of launch for either ZOCOR or MEVACOR. I think it would have made such a

substantial difference. So I'm very excited about the potential opportunity of launching a product with a 30,000-patient
outcomes trial into an area that we know extraordinarily well, which is the cholesterol-lowering market.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Great. Thank you, Jami. And, Darla, next caller, please.

It's from John Boris from SunTrust.
<Q - John T. Boris>: Thanks for taking the questions and congrats, Joe. First question on the oncology franchise for
Roger and Adam. Can you maybe just articulate, especially in lung, when you think you might have an OS benefit?
And Adam, for you, having or not having that in the label, how does that position you relative to your competition,
most notably Optivo, that has that in the label?
And then second question, it looks as though, Ken, and this is also for Rob, repatriation seems to be a real possibility
this year in order to pay for some highway trust fund funding. You have a significant amount of cash on the balance
sheet; we estimate at the end of 1Q at about close to $29 billion, with 80% to 90% of that offshore. If you do have an
opportunity to potentially repatriate that, how are you thinking about deploying that if you're able to bring it back?
Thanks.
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: So, John, with respect to the 010 study which is the study that will provide a first look at
an overall survival benefit for KEYTRUDA in the non-small cell lung cancer setting, this is a study that compares two
doses of KEYTRUDA, 2 milligrams, 10 milligrams, versus conventional chemotherapy. It's a good-sized study and
there is the opportunity for an interim analysis, which, of course, is event-driven. At the time when sufficient events are
accrued, then the data and monitoring committee will look at that.
In principle, they could see a benefit that would result in a recommendation to modify the study or they could continue
the study which is designed to end sometime around the end of the year. So those are the times when we potentially
would see the overall survival benefit.
<A - Adam H. Schechter>: Yeah, and, John, let me provide some context and then I'll answer your question directly.
First of all, I'm sure you've seen the IMS data and the May IMS data just came out. And KEYTRUDA has more than
80% anti-PD-1 share in all melanoma patients. In addition to that, KEYTRUDA is now the number one treatment in
melanoma at a 35% overall patient share. So hopefully, you've seen that we are able to do well in the marketplace.
With regard to lung, we've built an oncology business unit to maximize KEYTRUDA over the long term. Just as we
were ready to launch melanoma, we will be ready to launch in lung. We are ready for that. We think it's a very
significant opportunity. Of course, we'd prefer to have overall survival data to promote. And as Roger said, those data
are maturing in our broad clinical program.
But we have the capabilities now to be successful, and I think physicians have seen the overall survival data in
melanoma. They begin to assume that you'll have overall survival data once you have the studies underway. So
although we prefer to have it at the time of launch, the good news is that, as Roger said, we have the study to show it
over time.
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: Maybe the only other thing to emphasize is, if you look at the PD-L1 positive
population, so in those individuals with proportion scores above 50%, the response rates are really quite extraordinary.
So in treatment-naive patients, the response rates were 50%. Those are really quite unprecedented response rates in
non-small cell lung cancer. When we'd expect those to translate into survival data, we'll have a chance to see.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Thank you, Adam and Roger. And Robert?
<A - Robert M. Davis>: Yeah, yeah, John, with regard to your question about repatriation, first of all, I would say,
obviously, we are very supportive of comprehensive tax reform and I think, listening to the dialogue as it's evolving in
Wall Street or in Washington, clearly, it's something that I think is a possibility. As we look at it, it's important that it is

comprehensive, that it does look at a territorial system, that it does consider a flat tax and it does look at ways to
advantage companies that develop intellectual property in the United States. So, all of that's being discussed and we're
very supportive of that.
As far as the cash we have offshore and what we would do if we did have a major repatriation, right now, I don't want
to get into specifics about the strategy. I would just go back to say our overall capital allocation philosophy remains the
same. First and foremost, we're going to fund the business and then beyond that, we'll look to deploy capital towards
business development opportunities, primarily focused in areas that help to augment our pipeline. I think you heard
some examples of that even this morning on the call from Roger.
And then clearly, we remain committed to our dividend and we'll consider share repurchase. If you look at what we've
done over the past, we have deployed meaningful capital back to shareholders and all of that would remain the same.
So, as we would see that, all of that will inform any strategy we think of in using the cash.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Great. Thanks, Rob, and thank you, John. Darla, next caller, please?

It's from Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Hey, guys. I really appreciate taking the question. I'll start with Adam, if I may. Maybe
it's early, early days. You don't have a label. Understood. But supposed to ask doctors seeing that you're on the NCCN.
Roughly speaking, how many second-line patients have you guys treated with KEYTRUDA? And do you anticipate
that once fully approved by FDA, that second-line patients that want to elect for KEYTRUDA will need a biopsy prior?
So, in other words, at the time of initiation of second-line therapies, they'll need what presumably will be second
biopsy. That appears not to be the case with nivolumab because, obviously, they did an all-coverage trial. But whether
Merck gets PD-L1 positives and negatives in the label, I'm just curious to know whether or not you think physicians are
going to want to get a biopsy.
And then also, Adam, well, this is more for Ken and Rob, I suppose, but you've obviously – this builds on Jami's
question, you've considered in the past, very thoughtfully, I think, what to do with animal health and you elected to
keep it. And now the PE arbitrage is substantial again, Zoetis at 30 times, Merck at 17 times, which is just a pretty
dramatic opportunity if you were to separate those businesses and liberate value. Does the choice to not do it now that
have to do with that you think the P/E multiple in animal health just aren't sustainable or is there some other reason
why you wouldn't come back to this and study it hard again?
And then finally, for Roger, I just wanted to ask, there's this confusion around this question , sorry, I apologize. I've
asked you this before. But I just want to just get the truth out there. But the CETP main outcome trial that's ongoing, is
that trial powered to hit on the final analysis assuming only an LDL impact on outcomes or does there also need to be
some sort of contribution from the raising of HDL on outcomes under base case assumptions in order for that trial to hit
the endpoint? And then how is enrollment going in the prodromal base trial? We've heard it slowed, just wondering if
that's true. Thank you.
<A>: All right.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: If you don't want to answer all of those questions, you can pick and choose, but I
figured it's Joe's last call, so I can tick him off a little bit.
<A - Adam H. Schechter>: So, Mark, let me give you some context on KEYTRUDA. So if you look at KEYTRUDA,
as you know we only promote the product on label.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Yes.
<A - Adam H. Schechter>: And if you look at the data we have, about 85% of the use we believe is in melanoma. Of
that 85%, we believe about 70% of it is on label which is within the improved indication. So that gives you a sense of

where that is. With regard to the diagnostic testing, diagnostic testing for treatment decisions has really become a
standard and widespread in the treatment of cancer, [indiscernible] (49:02) EGFRs. We believe that physicians will do
that as a standard practice and we expect that we'll have the availability of the test on the day that we launch lung. We
believe it'll be easy for them to do, they typically are doing it already and we'll make sure it's widely available.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Do you think the update is going to require that before getting second-line
KEYTRUDA in lung?
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: I really can't speculate, Mark, on what they'll say.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Okay.
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: I'll look at the totality.
<A - Adam H. Schechter>: Irrespective of what the FDA says, Mark, I think it is going to become standard practice
that the doctors are going to want to know if they're going expressive because it's going to have a very different
discussion with the patient if they know that they are expressive or not. If you can say to a patient, based upon your
expression in the clinical trials you could have a greater than 50% response, that's different than saying you'd have a
10% response rate. So I think physicians are going to want that information and data irrespective of what the FDA has
on the label or not. And I also believe that payers, particularly outside the U.S., are going to be very interested in
having that work done.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: And, Adam, just to be clear, do you believe that physicians will want to have the
second biopsy done at the time of second-line standard of care?
<A - Adam H. Schechter>: I think they'll do it as a first biopsy. I think they're going to just want to know it as part of
standard of care in the beginning as we move forward.
<A>: All right.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Okay. Thanks. And also the animal health PE arbitrage question.
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: Yeah, but I won't answer that one for you, Mark. Just to be clear, you've asked the
question before, but the REVEAL study is powered to see the LDL cholesterol-lowering effect, based on the
nomogram that associates LDL cholesterol lowering with reductions in major cardiovascular events. So, we would see
that, we believe.
With respect to the base studies, prodromal enrollment is always challenging, that is no question. And part of the issue
with respect to prodromal enrollment is that there are a lot of people out there who believe they have cognitive
impairment, are concerned about their mental functioning and when you actually image those people, a small fraction
of them have evidence of plaque and so the screen failure rate is significant. Nevertheless, we're making good progress
in that study.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Joe Romanelli should likely be screened for that trial, just FYI.
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: We're not going to screen you though, Mark.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Thank you. Congrats on a good quarter. Thank you for the nice discussion.
<A - Kenneth C. Frazier>: Mark, this is Ken Frazier. I'm going to try and take a shot at your arbitrage question.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Okay.
<A - Kenneth C. Frazier>: I'm pleased that you characterize it as an arbitrage question. The fact of the matter is, our
animal health business grew very strongly this quarter, it continues to grow well, it continues to have a very good
pipeline. We think about the issue that you put on the table as we think about ways in which we can create value but we
also look at the business from a long-term perspective. And I would say that while we don't take anything off the table,
we always consider changes in the marketplace.

I want to come back to what I always said. We plan to augment our animal health business with additional BD. We
continue to see this business as a key growth driver with healthy margins and a strong market outlook over the long
term. And as for the difference between potential PEs for the animal health business, versus the human health business,
we're continue to focus on running our business. We're going to continue to focus on what's in our control which is
running the business, getting our products approved, augmenting the pipeline, launching these drugs.

It's from Seamus Fernandez from Leerink.
<Q - Seamus C. Fernandez>: Thanks a lot. I assume we're done with Mark's questions and congrats, Joe. Just quickly,
this is more for Roger than anything, just in terms of – it's a follow-up on Tim's questions, prospects for a broad label
versus the filed patient group. Can you just give us a sense of KEYNOTE-010 to the initial filing? And then can you
maybe give us a little bit of color on when you expect the KEYNOTE-010 study to read out? I know the primary
analysis is in the patient group that's over 50% PD-L1 expression, which I think many of us would have thought could
have stopped in an interim, but it would seem that the overall patient group would also be very important to fully
understand. So is that part of the reason why we continue to wait for KEYNOTE-010?
And then lastly on REVEAL with anacetrapib, Roger, can you just update us on when we might expect the paper on
baseline characteristics? I think it would be interesting to know the baseline LDL in REVEAL, particularly in the
context of a similar design to HPS2-THRIVE.
And just additionally on anacetrapib, could you comment on some recent genetic findings correlating the risk of
developing macular degeneration? I'm interested just more if the FDA has requested any substudies evaluating this risk.
Thanks a lot.
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: Okay. A lot of questions, Seamus. First of all, with respect to the KEYNOTE-010 study,
as you've said, I mean there will be the final results which we expect sometime towards the end of the year. But as I
mentioned earlier, we have a – the potential for an interim analysis, which is event-driven. So I can't tell you when that
interim analysis would take place, but that interim analysis could, in principle, result in a recommendation from the
Data Safety Monitoring Board that the study be changed, potentially even stopped I suppose, depending on the strength
of the data.
So it could happen sooner than that. The information from that study could, in principle, then contribute to the initial
finding based on the KEYNOTE-001 [indiscernible] (55:25) in particular cohort, but it depends again on those
analyses.
With respect to REVEAL, the baseline characteristics of patients we have, we will present those baseline
characteristics. I don't have the date exactly of when that would happen. And of course, the study is being run by the
Oxford group, so they're the ones who are making decisions about publication of the REVEAL data. So we can get
back to you on that.
And of course, we are well aware of the potential association between CETP mutations and macular degeneration. One
of the things that we've done is look very carefully in our patient population. Because we're aware of this, we did
additional eye exams in our patient populations. The Data Safety Monitoring Board has been looking at that and thus
far, we're not aware of any adverse effects. Nothing has been called to our attention.
Of course, irrespective of the strength of the genetic association, we have to keep in mind that what we're doing is
interdicting CETP function quite late in life. Individuals who inherit a genetic anomaly, of course, have it from the time
of conception, so that would have a different impact. But thus far, we're not aware of – and we're looking at it closely
and we're not aware of any impact.

<Q - Tony Butler>: Yes. Thanks very much. Adam, I've asked this question of you in the past, but just want to get an
update. As the SG&A year-over-year declines, Rob made some references to that. But yet at least in the EU, you're
launching ZERBAXA and KEYTRUDA in melanoma. And it would strike me that the need for additional capital,
given you're not in oncology in Europe, would require a substantial expense. So I'd love for you to touch on that.
And then, Roger, lastly just some update, if you could, on your compound with Plexxikon and its role with PD-1 and/or
GITR, would appreciate that. And then finally, Joe, all the best on your second tour and welcome back, [ph] Terry
(57:51).
<A - Adam H. Schechter>: Yeah. So, Tony, so we are very much focused on maximizing each and every launch
opportunity that we have. And when you look at the first dollar we spend, it's with the launch opportunities in
JANUVIA, frankly. And what we've been able to do is make sure that when we see growth, we're able to put the money
towards that growth.
So even though you see SG&A declining overall, if you were to look at oncology or JANUVIA, you'd see SG&A
increasing over the past several years. And if you look at oncology, we're already there in Europe with EMEND and we
have a sales force. We've increased that sales force and we're continuing to grow. So, I just wanted to assure you that
any time there's a growth opportunity, we're making sure that we have the right resources to maximize those
opportunities for patients, but also obviously to grow those products.
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: Yeah. And just with respect, Tony, to the combination studies, of course, they have a
very broad set underway. Nothing really to update you on there, except to say that with respect to the GITR studies,
those studies began, it's a GITR agonist, began in June of last year. We have to progress fairly slowly because of the
fact that it is an agonist antibody, and hence, an immune stimulator as opposed to something that relieves inhibition or
is a disinhibitor like KEYTRUDA.
Nevertheless, we have progressed and are moving forward in our Phase I studies and we've just begun combination
studies with our GITR antibody and KEYTRUDA. So that's moving right along.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Great. Thanks.
<Q - Tony Butler>: Thanks very much.

It's from Colin Bristow with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Colin N. Bristow>: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. And Joe, congrats and [ph] Terry (59:38),
looking forward to working with you.
So just as we think about the hep C opportunity, recently one of your peers highlighted that U.S. hep C volumes have
been trending lower than anticipated, and the expectation was approximately 180,000 patients treated per year. Is this in
line with your observations and expectations? And I'm just curious how you see this evolving over time.

And then secondly, on the TECOS trial in JANUVIA trends, just to what extent do you expect TECOS to have a
positive impact on JANUVIA volumes and share? Thanks.
<A - Adam H. Schechter>: Yeah. Hi, Colin. This is Adam. With regard to hepatitis C, I still believe that that
represents a very significant opportunity for Merck, as well as the number of patients that will be treated. You've seen
anywhere from 100,000 to 120,000 patients at maximum treated in the past. Now, you're seeing even 170,000 to
200,000, which is still a significant increase from what was treated in the past even today.
It's not uncommon to see warehousing before a new drug comes to market. You saw that earlier before the Gilead
compound came to market. And obviously, as you have warehousing, you get a big bolus of patients and then it slows
down a little bit over time, but I don't think there's a fundamental issue in the overall hepatitis C market. I still think it
remains a very good attractive market and we are very excited about getting into that marketplace as soon as Roger and
team working with the [ph] right (01:01:09) agencies can get us into the market.
With regard to TECOS, obviously, we're very excited about the result. It's an important area for us, diabetes. We
disproportionately invest in that area. I think that, in general, TECOS validated but physicians already were thinking in
terms of the favorable tolerability profile of JANUVIA.
With that said, in markets around the world, we're able to promote it now. We've begun to promote it. And I think that
it has a very good perception in the marketplace. In other markets like the United States, where we have to wait for it to
be in the label before our representatives can actively promote the product, we're looking forward to getting the data in
our label so we can promote it in the future. But, obviously, the results are helpful.

It's from Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Thanks. A couple quick ones. First, Adam, on diabetes. What would the implications be in your
view, if we saw positive outcomes for Lilly's SGLT2 inhibitor? Secondly, given Merck's history and expertise, are you
interested in the lipid disorder space either from a BD or R&D standpoint?
And lastly, for Ken and Rob, short of an overhaul of the U.S. tax system, which seems unlikely. What is Merck doing
to address the tax line longer term as well as maximize access to your ex-U.S. cash? Obviously, you've returned a lot of
cash to shareholders, but you certainly could do more if you've made certain corporate decisions. Thanks.
<A - Adam H. Schechter>: Yeah. So thanks, Gregg. First, with regard to SGLT2s. In general, if you look at the
utilization of SGLT2s, they're typically after the use of JANUVIA. So typically, it's metformin first, add on JANUVIA,
and then it's after you add on JANUVIA.
So that's the way they're currently being used. I don't see a significant change. Although, obviously, we're not going to
speculate on what the trial results could be for the SGLT2 drugs. So, I still remain optimistic about our diabetes
franchise.
With regard to lipids, I'm very excited about the potential opportunity to launch a CETP inhibitor. Lipids is an area that
Merck has been involved in for many, many years, starting with MEVACOR and ZOCOR. And this is an area we
know very well. We continue to be there for other reasons with cardiovascular medicines, and we'll just see what the
results show from the REVEAL trial.
<A - Robert M. Davis>: And Gregg, with regards to your question about the tax rate, obviously, I don't want to get
into specific strategies but it's safe to say that as we look forward, we will continue to look for planning opportunities to
bring the rate down, and I do believe those opportunities continue to exist. So we are focused on understanding what

Your next question comes from the line of Vamil Divan of Credit Suisse.
<Q - Vamil K. Divan>: Great. Thanks so much for taking the questions. So just one more following up, you talked
about TECOS and the impact on JANUVIA, potentially. Just on IMPROVE-IT with VYTORIN and ZETIA, I
would've thought even though it was not on the label yet that we may have seen some benefit there, but it didn't seem to
have much an impact yet. So I'm just curious how you think about the benefit from IMPROVE-IT maybe for the later
part of this year, and then maybe for next year after presumably you will have the data in the label at some point.
And then second, just separate topic on PNEUMOVAX, if you can just kind of talk about the implications there with
Prevnar having the adult certification, have you seen any impact on PNEUMOVAX from the added competition?
Thank you.
<A - Adam H. Schechter>: Yeah. Sure, Vamil. With regard to IMPROVE-IT, obviously we were very pleased with
the results of IMPROVE-IT trial. As you mentioned, in the United States, we can't promote that trial until we have it at
the label and we're looking forward to having it in a label as soon as possible.
With regard to what's happening in the marketplace, in the U.S., you've actually seen a flattening of ZETIA since the
announcement of IMPROVE-IT because I think a lot of physicians became aware of the trial through The New
England Journal of Medicine and reading about it very quickly. But what you haven't seen is a stem in the decline of
VYTORIN in the United States. Once it's in our label, our representatives will actively be able to promote it.
With that said, as you know in the U.S., the products will be going generic towards the end of next year. I think the
greater impact from IMPROVE-IT is to try to help in the future when you start to think about a CETP inhibitor and the
ability to get more patients to go and lower LDL cholesterol levels.
Outside the U.S., in Europe, we've seen where they're able to promote the product that it does have a positive impact.
But at the same time, we've lost exclusivity of ZETIA in Canada, which has had a significant impact. And we've seen
some changes in France in terms of the ability to have guidelines of when these products are utilized.
Regarding PNEUMOVAX, we have seen increased competition from the ACIP recommendations that now include
Prevnar, and we've seen it in this quarter and we believe we'll see it in this year. However, if you look at the ACIP,
PNEUMOVAX is still recommended as a second dose after Prevnar. So we believe that over time, we'll catch up again
because the patients will get the second dose.
So the question is, how long will this short in term impact occur, and when will patients come back for the second dose.
And our teams have been working on how to find ways to encourage the patients to come back for the second dose.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Great. Thank you, Adam. And Darla, I think we have time for one more call.

Your final question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan.
<Q - Christopher Thomas Schott>: Great. Thanks very much. A few last questions here. A couple quick ones.
Maybe, Roger, can we get your updated view on the role you see for combination therapy as we think about the
first-line non-small cell lung cancer opportunity, particularly just interested in your view of chemo PD-1 combos versus
IO combinations and just maybe just relative to monotherapy as we think about this playing out the next few years?

Second question is on the BACE inhibitor and just updated thoughts on that opportunity in light of the Lilly extension
study and the updated Biogen data we just saw at AAIC. And I'm going to just wrap it up there. Thanks very much.
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: Okay. Chris, first of all, with respect to combination therapy, I believe absolutely that we
will find over time that while KEYTRUDA is foundational for therapy for a wide set of malignant diseases, that there
will be ways to optimize that therapy still further. And I think it will be based on molecular characterization of tumors
because we want to preserve the most favorable benefit/risk profile. And so that's one of the reasons why we have so
many of these combination studies going on and we're exploring the full set of combinations without going into detail
the work which we've done and the work reported by colleagues at Johns Hopkins really points to the importance of
neoantigens in tumor recognition.
So one expects the therapies that increase the representation of mutations within tumor that could be as simple as
radiation therapy, it can be things that are chemotherapeutic agents that damage DNA, it can be ways of immunizing
against tumor antigens. All those things are things that we're pursuing. There are thousands of potential combinations
one could pursue and we're trying to be smart about which ones have the highest likelihood of success.
So, we're also looking at things that affect tumor metabolism. All of those are quite interesting and data from those will
become available in not too long a time. So I'm expecting that we will move to that, but I again point out how
remarkable it is when you look at the response rates to KEYTRUDA monotherapy, particularly in selected patient
populations. They're very impressive.
And second with regard to BACE, the data that have been presented with respect to antibodies directed against Abeta,
that's really quite a different mechanism from BACE inhibition. And I go back to sort of bedrock data. There is very
impressive genetic data that tells us that individuals who have relatively high activity of beta secretase are at higher risk
for developing dementia in their lives and they will develop it earlier, as opposed to those who have lower levels of
beta secretase and that strongly suggests it's the most powerful data that we have. And it strongly suggests if we can
phenocopy that low level of beta secretase activity, we should reduce the risk of dementia. Whether we can do that in
an individual in their seventh decade isn't in fact exactly what we're testing using our BACE inhibitor in both the mild
to moderate and prodromal studies.
I don't think that we can look at the data from an Abeta sequestrant, an antibody directed against Abeta, and really
interpret it in the same way because it's really unclear what those antibodies are doing. We know they cause an
inflammatory response and are associated with an adverse effect exactly what they do in terms of delaying the
progression, if they do that at all, delaying the progression of either plaque or cognitive impairment, I think more time
is needed.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Great. Thank you. Roger. And Ken, do you want to give us some final thoughts?
Kenneth C. Frazier
Again, thanks, Joe, for all you've done.
This has been another solid quarter for us. Our four therapeutic areas with 9% Animal Health with 10% KEYTRUDA
launch is progressing ahead of expectations. But the most important thing is as we move into the future, we're
tremendously excited about the opportunities that we have in hep C, with KEYTRUDA, particularly with non-small
cell lung cancer coming up, and we'll continue to augment our pipeline as you saw this quarter, we did with [ph] BD
deals (01:11:24) like cCAM and Ablynx. The chance to augment our pipeline is there. We are very excited about the
transition to the future that's going on inside Merck. So thank you very much for your continuing interest.
