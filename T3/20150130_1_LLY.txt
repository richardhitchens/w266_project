and those outlined in our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The
information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not
intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.
As usual, I'll begin by highlighting key events that have occurred since last quarter's call. Following FDA approval in
September, we launched Trulicity in the U.S. during the fourth quarter. We also received regulatory approval for
Trulicity in Europe. We're in a process of launching in the UK and Germany and anticipate launches in additional EU
countries over the course of this year and next.
In diabetes, we also resubmitted Humalog U-200 KwikPen in the U.S. and along with Boehringer Ingelheim, we
received approval in Japan for both Jardiance and our insulin glargine product.
In oncology, Cyramza was approved by the European Commission for the treatment of advanced gastric cancer and by
the FDA for two new indications, second line non-small cell lung cancer and advanced gastric cancer in combination
with paclitaxel. Enabled by a fast track designation, we also completed the rolling FDA submission for necitumumab in
first-line squamous non-small cell lung cancer. And we submitted necitumumab to European regulators for the same
indication.
On the clinical front, along with Incyte, we announced that baricitinib met the primary endpoint of improved ACR20
response compared to placebo in the Phase III RA-BEACON study in patients with moderately-to-severely active
rheumatoid arthritis who previously failed one or more TNF inhibitors. The study included a high percentage of
patients who'd also receive prior treatment with one or several non-anti-TNF biologic agents.
Along with AstraZeneca, we announced initiation of the Phase II/III AMARANTH study of AZD3293, an oral BACE
inhibitor being studied for Alzheimer's disease. Earlier this month, we presented Phase III data at ASCO-GI from the
RAISE trial evaluating Cyramza in combination with chemotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. In
this trial, ramucirumab prolonged both progression-free and overall survival. And we began the second Phase III trial
of abemaciclib in breast cancer as well as a Phase III trial in lung cancer.
On the business development front, we announced a pair of immuno-oncology collaborations. One with Bristol-Myers
Squibb to study their PD-1 inhibitor, Opdivo, with galunisertib, our TGF-beta kinase inhibitor, in a Phase I/II study in
patients with glioblastoma, hepatocellular and non-small cell lung cancers.
The other, with Merck, to study their PD-1 inhibitor, Keytruda, in a Phase II study with Alimta in non-squamous
non-small cell lung cancer; and in Phase I/II studies with Cyramza in gastric, bladder and non-small cell lung cancer; as
well as with necitumumab in non-small cell lung cancer.
We also announced a worldwide licensing collaboration with Adocia focused on developing an ultra-rapid insulin,
known as BioChaperone Lispro, for the treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim announced changes to our diabetes collaboration. The companies will continue
co-promotion work in 17 countries, representing over 90% of the collaboration's anticipated market opportunity; while
in the other countries, the companies will exclusively commercialize the molecule they brought to the collaboration.
And finally, on January 1, we completed the acquisition of Novartis Animal Health.
In other news of note, we increased our quarterly dividend by 2% to $0.50 per share and we repurchased $300 million
of stock in the fourth quarter of 2014 under our outstanding $5 billion share repurchase program, leaving $3.7 billion
remaining. I'd also highlight that the total cash distribution to shareholders in 2014 was nearly $3 billion.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Phil for a discussion of our financial performance in the quarter.
Philip Johnson
Thank you, John. And Tom with AT&T, if you could check we should be the only line that is open at this time. We're
getting quite a bit of feedback. If you could make sure the other lines are closed, we'd appreciate it. Thank you.

So first, I'll review our GAAP results, and then I'll discuss a few non-GAAP measures to provide some additional
insights into the underlying trends in our business. Keep in mind that our 2014 non-GAAP measures include the
expense associated with amortization of intangibles. As discussed on our January 7 call, our 2015 guidance, however,
excludes this expense. When we report Q1 2015 actual results in April, we'll provide you with 2014 by quarter restated
for removal of amortization of intangibles and as if we to acquire Novartis Animal Health on January 1, 2014 (sic)
[2015]. As we report our results during 2015, this should provide a meaningful view of the trends in our business.
On slide eight, you can see that revenue in Q4 was $5.1 billion. This represents a decrease of 12% compared to Q4
2013, driven by a reduction of over $500 million in U.S. Cymbalta and of nearly $200 million in U.S. Evista. Recall
that we lost U.S. exclusivity for Cymbalta in December 2013 and for Evista in March 2014. Excluding Cymbalta and
Evista in the U.S., the rest of our worldwide revenue was essentially flat as underlying performance growth was offset
by the stronger U.S. dollar.
Gross margin, as a percent of revenue, decreased 60 basis points driven by the loss of U.S. exclusivity for Cymbalta
and Evista, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold. This quarter,
foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold had a positive impact on our gross margin. However, in Q4 of
2013, there was a negative impact on our gross margin.
Excluding this FX effect, from both 2013 and 2014, gross margin as a percent of revenue declined from 77.0% in Q4
2013 to 73.9% in Q4 of 2014. As in past quarters, we've included a supplementary slide providing our gross margin
percent for the last 10 quarters with and without this FX effect.
Non-GAAP measures are shown on slide nine. Total operating expense, defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A,
declined by 13% or nearly $450 million compared to Q4 of 2013. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses
declined 8% while R&D declined 20%. The reduction in marketing, selling and administrative expenses was due
primarily to reduction in sales and marketing activities for Cymbalta, as well as ongoing cost containment efforts and to
a lesser extent foreign exchange. The reduction in R&D expense was driven by lower late-stage clinical development
costs.
Other income and expense was income of $45 million in Q4 of 2014 compared to income of $9 million in the fourth
quarter of 2013. This increase was due to larger gains on investments. Our tax rate was 14%, a decrease of 6.5
percentage points compared to the same quarter last year. This decrease includes recognition in the fourth quarter of
2014 of the full-year U.S. R&D tax credit. At the bottom line, net income was flat while earnings per share increased
1% reflecting the benefit of share repurchases.
Turning to full-year results shown on slide 10, revenue decreased 15%. Now, to place this in perspective, this equates
to a year-on-year reduction in revenue of $3.5 billion. U.S. Cymbalta and Evista declined by a total of $4.1 billion,
while FX reduced revenue by over $350 million. These reductions were partially offset by performance growth in the
rest of our business of nearly $1 billion or over 5%, driven primarily by insulins, our Animal Health business, Cialis,
Alimta, Forteo, OUS Cymbalta, Trajenta and Cyramza.
Full-year revenue totaled just over $19.6 billion or about $400 million less than the minimum we targeted starting back
in 2009. Gross margin declined nearly 4 percentage points due to loss of U.S. exclusivity for Cymbalta and to a lesser
extent Evista. And through reductions in spend behind Cymbalta and Evista, lower late-stage clinical development
costs and significant ongoing productivity efforts, total operating expenses decreased 11% or over $1.4 billion as R&D
expenses declined nearly $800 million and SG&A expenses declined more than $600 million.
Finally, looking at the bottom line, despite $400 million less top line revenue than we targeted, we nearly met our $3
billion minimum net income goal, posting non-GAAP net income of $2.988 billion and EPS of $2.78. While not shown
here, when we issue our 10-K, you'll see that we also exceeded our goal of $4 billion in operating cash flow.
Our full-year results reflect successful execution of our strategy for managing one of the industry's most challenging
series of patent expirations, driving growth in Japan, emerging markets and Elanco and in brands not losing patent
protection. Replenishing and advancing our pipeline, and reducing our cost structure and increasing productivity across

our business to fund the R&D necessary to fuel our future growth.
Slide 11 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. Additional details about our reported earnings
are available in today's earnings press release.
Let's take a look at the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue. On slide 12, in the yellow box on the middle of the
page, you can see that the total revenue decline of 12% in Q4 2014 was driven by a negative volume impact of 9% and
a negative foreign exchange impact of 4% partially offset by a favorable price impact of 1%. The negative foreign
exchange impact is larger than we've seen in recent years and was driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against
many developed and emerging markets' currencies.
By geography, you'll notice that U.S. revenue decreased 22% driven by volume. This was due to loss of exclusivity for
Cymbalta and Evista. Excluding Cymbalta and Evista, U.S. pharma revenue increased 5%. I would note that this year,
we extended our shipping to wholesalers until December 30, resulting in lower wholesale inventory build this year-end.
In Australia, Canada and Europe or ACE, you'll see a negative 7% rate impact drove the overall 4% decline in revenue.
While on a constant currency or performance basis, ACE revenue increased 3%. In Japan, pharma revenue decreased
10% driven by the weaker yen. On a performance basis, our Japanese pharma revenue increased 2%. Growth, this
quarter, was negatively affected by the timing of Cymbalta shipments to our marketing partner Shionogi, as well as by
volatility we've seen in customer purchases over the course of 2014 due to increases in the consumption tax.
Turning to emerging markets, we saw mid single-digit performance growth driven by volume growth of 7%. As a result
of the significant negative effect of FX, our reported emerging markets revenue declined 3% versus last year. Elanco
Animal Health delivered revenue growth of 9%. Excluding FX, Elanco grew 12%. This performance growth was
driven by OUS food animal products including acquisition of Lohmann as well as OUS companion animal products
and U.S. food animal products. This was partially offset by a continued decline in the U.S. companion animal products
sales principally Comfortis.
Moving to slide 13, you'll see the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on our 2014 results. For the full-year
2014, FX had a modest negative effect at both the top and bottom line. For the quarter, however, we saw a larger effect
and one that differed at the top and bottom lines.
As I mentioned earlier, FX was a top line headwind reducing revenue in U.S. dollars by 4 percentage points. In terms
of cost of goods sold, FX provided a substantial benefit, which led to FX providing a modest tailwind or benefit for
operating income and EPS. Excluding FX, you can see that our non-GAAP EPS in the fourth quarter declined 4%.
While including FX, EPS grew 1%.
Now, let me turn the call over to Derica.
Derica W. Rice
Thanks, Phil. Slide 14 shows our pipeline as of January 23. Changes since our last earnings call are highlighted, with
green arrows showing progression and red arrows showing attrition.
You'll see that necitumumab has moved into the regulatory review column following submissions in the U.S. and
Europe. And as John mentioned, Phase II testing began for AZD3293, the BACE inhibitor for Alzheimer's disease that
we are developing with AstraZeneca. And in Phase I, we initiated human testing of a small molecule BACE inhibitor
for Alzheimer's disease. We also began Phase I testing of two biologics, one for diabetic complications and one for
hypoglycemia and we terminated development of a Phase I biologic for anemia.
Next let me provide a recap of how key events played out in 2014, and remind you of our key events for 2015 and
quickly review our 2015 financial guidance.
Slide 15 is the slide we provided you in January of last year to track our progress against these milestones. As you can
see from the preponderance of green checkmarks, we made significant advances in our pipeline in 2014. These

advances included major progress on eight new molecular entities; approval and launch of three new products,
Cyramza, Jardiance and Trulicity; approval of our insulin glargine product; commission of necitumumab; and positive
Phase III trial read-outs for basal insulin peglispro for diabetes, ixekizumab for psoriasis and baricitinib for rheumatoid
arthritis.
2014 was a very productive year for advancement of our pipeline. And we expect 2015 to provide more of the same.
Now slide 16 lists key events to watch for in 2015, and we'll update this list on each of our quarterly calls to help you
monitor our progress. Since I discussed this list in detail on our January 7 call, I will not go through each item again
today. However, it's clear from this list of key events that 2015 will be another important year for execution of our
innovation-based strategy. And we're excited for what we believe the year may bring. We know it's unreasonable to
expect all of these potential events to be positive. However, we believe it is very possible that a significant majority
will break our way and solidify our near to medium term growth prospects.
Turning to our 2015 guidance, we've updated the guidance we provided on January 7 to reflect current FX rates. That is
the only item prompting these changes. Now before I step through the specific line item changes, I would like to
provide some high-level thoughts on the impact to us both this year and moving forward.
On our call in early January, we provided a full P&L impact of FX to our 2015 results. Now this included a top line
revenue headwind of about 2.5% or $500 million, and a bottom line EPS headwind of about $0.03. At the current FX
rate, the revenue headwind for 2015 would be more like 6% to 7% and the EPS headwind would be about $0.07 per
share, not the $0.03 we shared earlier this month.
Now as we discussed before, the FX effect on international inventories sold that flows through cost of sales provides a
short-term offset to the underlying operational impact of FX. The $0.07 EPS headwind I mentioned is in fact comprised
of an unfavorable operational FX effect of about $0.57 largely offset by favorable FX effect on international inventory
sold of about $0.50. Should FX rate remain stable, this cost of sales benefit would go away as we sell existing
inventory and will likely be nil in 2016.
So we do experience the exact same operational FX effect throughout our P&L as some of the peers and other U.S.
multi-nationals. Different than some however, the FX effect on cost of sales means that the full affect of FX does not
show up immediately in our P&L. We'll see part of it this year and the remainder next year.
Now, turning to the individual line items, you can see on slide 17 that FX has caused us to reduce revenue by $800
million; increase our gross margin percent by 1.5 percentage points; reduce marketing, selling and administrative
expenses by about $200 million; and reduce research and development expenses by $100 million.
As I mentioned earlier, if current FX rate hold for the full-year, EPS would be reduced by about $0.04 per share from
our prior assumptions and we've adjusted our outlook accordingly. However, as our outlook still falls within our
existing GAAP and non-GAAP EPS ranges, these ranges and guidance remain unchanged. Hopefully, this additional
color is helpful as you think about how FX may affect our results.
Also, keep in mind that our 2015 GAAP guidance does not include the $200 million payment that we will make to
Pfizer if the FDA removes tanezumab from partial clinical hold and we move forward with a Phase III development,
and it is based on our current estimate for how we'll account for the Novartis Animal Health acquisition, which could
change based upon revised estimates and final accounting treatment. And as I mentioned earlier, 2015 guidance for
non-GAAP measures excludes amortization of intangibles as well as the other items listed on slide 24.
In summary, we entered 2015 having successfully navigated through the most significant period of patent expiration in
our history. Over the past five years, we delivered on our financial commitment, we advanced our pipeline and we built
what, we believe, is a sustainable R&D engine. Again in 2014, we made excellent progress implementing our
innovation-based strategy. Not only did we advance our pipeline, but we also significantly reduced costs and increased
productivity.
Throughout the balance of this decade, we aim to drive revenue growth and expand margins. Bolstered by the recent
acquisition of Novartis Animal Health, we have a solid base business and we intend to build on that base with a first

wave of new product launches in diabetes, oncology and immunology; followed by second wave of potential launches
in cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease, pain and oncology.
And as John mentioned on our 2015 guidance call, going forward you'll see us sharpen our focus on areas where we're
best positioned to compete and win, and continue to look for ways to increase productivity and do the work of
pharmaceutical R&D better. We enter this post-patent period in a position of strength and we are very optimistic about
the opportunity before us to improve patient's lives and create value for shareholders.
Now this concludes our prepared remarks. Now I'll turn the call over to Phil to moderate the Q&A session.
Philip Johnson
Thanks, Derica. Given the 90 minutes we allot for the overall call and the relatively brief prepared remarks, we do have
quite a bit of time for Q&A, but it would be great and appreciated if you could limit your questions to two or three. If
you have additional ones, feel free to rejoin the queue later.
Tom, if you could provide the instructions for the Q&A session [audio gap] (24:08) caller, please.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Yes. Thanks very much. So I have three questions. First, with respect to the sola extension
study data readout ahead, could you just please characterize that and discuss your level of enthusiasm for that data?
Second, with respect to tanezumab, you're expecting to restart Phase III this year. Should we expect a readout in 2016
or 2017 from that?
And then finally, Derica, it'd be great if you could just explain once again, and I know you have before, but why your
FX tends to lag peers, and just in terms of the accounting whether there's an international cost of goods accounting
difference? That would be helpful and just putting in perspective. Thank you.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Great, Dave. Thank you for the questions. We'll have Dave Ricks, President, Lilly
Biomedicines, handle the first two on sola and tanezumab, and then Derica obviously the FX question. Dave?
<A - David A. Ricks>: Hi, Dave. Thanks for the questions. On the sola open-label extension, just a reminder, we have
a 24-month period where we're measuring patients who all rolled off EXPEDITION 1 and EXPEDITION 2 into drug
treatment at their choice of course. And that data, we do expect to come out in the near future because it's not published
or announced. So I can't really elaborate on what's inside that, but again, we're looking for evidence of a
disease-modifying effect in the patients who were started on sola, coming off placebo don't catch up to those that had
sola all along. And so with that sort of guidance of what we're looking for, we'll wait for the data to be published in the
future.
On tanezumab, we are hoping to have the class and tanezumab removed from clinical trial hold this year and initiate
Phase III studies as Derica mentioned. We have not posted those studies or their design yet, so it'd be premature to
comment on when they'd be completing a readout, but I would guide you to say it's probably beyond 2016, Dave.
<A - Derica W. Rice>: And David, as regards to the FX effect on the international inventories sold, recall that our
inventory turns in Lilly is about 12 months. And so if you think back as we built the inventory during the period where
the dollar was at a weaker level or the euro and the yen was at a higher level, those inventories then went on our
balance sheet as we sell those inventories into the marketplace, those inventories get revalued at current exchange rate.
And that benefit or that differential flows through our P&L at that point in time.

So in the case scenario we look at today where the dollar has been strengthening, it comes through as a benefit. You've
seen in prior periods when the rate was going the other way when foreign currencies were strengthening against the
U.S. dollar, and you were seeing a negative effect or an unfavorable effect flowing through our P&L through cost of
goods sold.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Great. Thanks, Derica. Tom, next caller, please.
Operator
Our next question is from the line of Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Thanks. Good morning. First on Trulicity, you've been very bullish on the opportunity in the
past given the ideal mix of attributes. So I was hoping you could give us some early metrics on launch success beyond
the simple IMS type of data we all see.
And then secondly for John, what are senior management teams and your most important corporate objectives in 2015,
aside from the typical meeting or exceeding the financial metrics you've provided? Thanks.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Thanks, Gregg. Enrique, for the first question please.
<A - Enrique A. Conterno>: Very good. On Trulicity, I think, we have to keep in mind that in mid-November we
launched this product in the U.S. to specialists. The specialists roughly represent about 30% of the market opportunity.
We are in the process of launching, as we speak, in primary care right now. And as I have shared in the past, for us, it is
critical that we basically expand the GLP-1 market. We believe that Trulicity can be an important catalyst for the
overall growth of the GLP-1 class. So we basically have to wait for that.
In terms of metric that we actually look at specific to our near, medium and long-term objectives are looking at the
breadth of prescribing when we look at Trulicity. So we want to make sure that there is a strong breadth of prescribing
in particular, among primary care customers.
<A - John C. Lechleiter>: Gregg, hi. This is John. Thanks for your question. I think I would say three things in terms
of what the senior management team has talked about around the table. Number one is to launch. Well, we launched
three products last year; Cyramza, Jardiance and Trulicity. We have, within a 12-month window, an opportunity to
launch others, potentially our insulin glargine product, necitumumab. We have other filings in the work. So we're
exercising that launch muscle now, and I think that's something we're acutely focused on.
Secondly, to renew our pipeline. We've paid particular attention to putting the company in a position where we do not
have to go through the boom and bust cycle that's characterized the last 10 years. We're very focused on our Phase I
molecule entries on progression from Phase II to Phase III and ensuring that those molecules are high-quality and
substantially de-risked by the time we get to Phase III.
And finally, I would say improving productivity. We work and operate in a very competitive world. We're in growing,
but very competitive classes. And I think learning to operate across our business in ways that respond to the increased
demands of our customers and to competitive pressures is something that's on our desk every day and we're driving
with the new conviction.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Great. Thank you. Tom, next caller, please.

Our next question is from the line of Tim Anderson with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - Timothy Minton Anderson>: Hi. Thank you. A few questions please. You have several drugs for diabetes either
in the pipeline or that have recently been approved. This includes your new GLP-1, your insulin glargine, your naval

basal and empagliflozin and then various iterations of those products. Of the four that I've just listed, which one product
excites you the most in terms of the future commercial potential, let's say, five years out?
And then a second question, I'd love to hear how you think the commercial rollout of your version of insulin glargine
will play out both in Europe and the U.S., ignoring any of the legal challenges that are being mounted against you?
I know you can't really comment on price specifically, but can you confirm that, generally speaking, price is really the
only selling point with a product like this. Therefore, you'll likely price it at whatever it takes to compel payers and
prescribers to get on board.
And then last, third question is just on Alimta, you mentioned price erosion in the U.S. It's not clear to me what the
driver of that erosion would be.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Great. Tim, thank you for the questions. Enrique Conterno President of Lilly Diabetes, will
have you handle the first two on the diabetes pipeline assets and insulin glargine. And either Sue or Ilissa, if you want
to look at the U.S. performance and see what explanation you have for his question on the Alimta U.S. price piece.
Enrique?
<A - Enrique A. Conterno>: Tim, I really believe that I can make a strong case for each one of these products that you
have mentioned. We just discussed Trulicity when Gregg asked the question about – let's look at Jardiance for a
second. We have the EMPA/LINA fixed dose combination coming up. We have a cardiovascular study that we expect
is going to readout in the middle of the year. Those to us are very significant events when we look at that brand.
I'll come in on insulin glargine in just a second. And then of course, we do believe that with our innovative basal
insulin peglispro, we have been able to show reductions in hemoglobin A1c versus the standard of care in basal insulin
therapy, which is something that has never been shown before. So I can make a very good case for each one of these
products. We have to basically launch this product and see how they're accepted by our customers.
When it comes to insulin glargine, I will say that is price the only way to compete? I will say, no. And I won't share
how we intend to compete when it comes to our commercial rollout, but clearly we do have a portfolio of diabetes
solutions. We know that in diabetes, price does play a role. We have delivery devices. And we think that we'll be able
to offer our customers an important alternative when it comes to glargine with our own insulin glargine product.
<A - David A. Ricks>: And then, Tim, on your Alimta U.S. question, we had a very similar, very low single-digit list
price benefit in the quarter like we had in prior quarters. On various quarters, there will be adjustments made for the
accruals, for rebates and discounts. There's this variability and noise in those kinds of adjustments. This particular
quarter those happen to be negative adjustments relative to Q4 of 2013, but there's nothing unusual in the underlying
trends that we're seeing compared to what we've had in past quarters.

Our next question is from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
<Q>: Hey, guys. This is [ph] Salim (34:59) in for Mark. Thanks for all the color. Three questions. One on your CETP.
Can you just tell us exactly how we should expect disclosure this year? And if you could just confirm for us that it's just
a futility analysis, so the trial cannot be stopped for efficacy.
And then just on diabetes, with all the pricing pressure talks, can you remind us of the net price increases you've been
taking maybe for 2014 and recently, and if you think that's sustainable going forward?
And then on your GLP-1 dulaglutide, Novartis obviously made theirs, at least or trying to develop theirs in Phase III for
oral, [indiscernible] (35:42). Is there a reason why you would or should not do the same thing for dulaglutide? Thanks.

<A - Philip Johnson>: [ph] Salim (35:51), thank you for the questions. So we'll Dave Ricks handle the first question
on the CETP inhibitor, and then Enrique has your diabetes question. Dave?
<A - David A. Ricks>: Yeah. Thanks for the question. On evacetrapib, I think we've communicated in the past we do
have an event-driven futility test, which is in the near future, either of being Q1 or early Q2. I want to play down
expectations of any great news coming out of that, because the futility hurdle was pretty low in that test, but we will be
conducting this in a blinded fashion along with a normal periodic safety review. And this is really the last major set of
reviews prior to conclusion of the study we hope in early 2016. So when we have something to say about that, we can
elaborate further.
<A - Derica W. Rice>: Yeah, [ph] Salim (36:38), we have said in the past that's not the kind of analysis, being a
futility analysis that would cause us, if it is not met, in other words the study continues to issue any kind of a press
release. So we provide regular updates for example on next quarter's calls, if it's appropriate on the status of that
particular analysis. Enrique?
<A - Enrique A. Conterno>: Sure. So I assume your questions on list price increases and net prices refers to our
insulin franchise. We have taken list price increases, but we also have increased our rebates that we basically in how we
contract with the payers. As we look at the results for Humalog in the U.S., where we basically saw a minus 2%
comparing Q4 of 2014 versus Q4 of 2013, a couple of things that I would have you keep in mind.
Yes, of course, we did have pressure from managed care contracts. But we had two special events impacting those
results. We had a wholesaler buy-in patterns, nine points, when it comes to Humalog, so 9%. And then adjustments due
to prior periods primarily driven by greater utilization in Medicaid and Medicare, about seven points. So you can think
of those as anomalies for the quarter, but clearly we do see a highly competitive market when it comes to diabetes.
On your question on the GLP-1s and whether we are thinking about oral dulaglutide, I cannot comment on our specific
plans when it comes to oral GLP-1s but what we have expressed is that this is an area of interest to us.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Great. Thanks, Enrique. Tom, next caller, please.

Next question is from the line at Tony Butler with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Charles Anthony Butler>: Good morning. Thank you very much for taking the questions; there are two. First is
on Cyramza, and I'm curious if you might be able to provide some color of what you're hearing back in the field in
gastric cancer.
And second to that question is, have you launched a non-small cell lung given the recent approval, and if you have any
comments back from the field on that launch would be helpful.
And then second, back to solanezumab and EXPEDITION 3, [ph] clinic trials states (39:19) enrollment continues. And
I'm just curious on the rate of enrollment given, I think, the total number is 2,100 or so. So the question is, is that rate
going or occurring in a timely fashion to what you would have expected given that you're looking for individuals who
have positive plaque in the brain? Thanks very much.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Thank you, Tony. So, Sue Mahoney, President of Lilly Oncology, for the first question on
Cyramza and then Dave again on solanezumab.
<A - Susan Mahony>: Yeah. Regarding Cyramza in the U.S., we're hearing actually very good feedback on Cyramza
in gastric cancer. Our Q4 sales of Cyramza was $34 million. That really is on gastric cancer sales. And given that we
only had the combination approval towards the end of the year that really is mainly monotherapy. Since we've launched
the combination study, we're seeing additional use of Cyramza in second-line gastric cancer with paclitaxel.

We have NCCN Category 1 status now both for the monotherapy and for the combination therapy in gastric cancer.
And with regards to the lung indication we had the approval, as you know, at the end of last year. We've literally just
launched that. So it's way too early to give you impact on that, but as I mentioned, we're feeling very good about the
gastric uptake so far.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Great. Dave?
<A - David A. Ricks>: Thanks, Tony. Good to hear your voice. And on sola, we remain very encouraged by the
enrollment in EXPEDITION 3. I really think Lilly has a best in the industry capability on conducting late-phase
Alzheimer's studies. And as you point out, we threw in a significant complexity, which is the requirement to prove
positive amyloid to enter the study in 100% of the patients.
But I'm pleased to say, I think, our last update was we were two-thirds enrolled. We continue to progress to complete
enrollment soon, and I can say we will most likely beat the enrollment window we saw in EXPEDITION 1 and
EXPEDITION 2, which was a similar number of patients. As a reminder, that was 22 months. So we would expect to
complete enrollment soon, and then of course look for a readout in 2016 as we've discussed previously.

Our next question is from the line of John Boris with SunTrust. Please go ahead.
<Q - John T. Boris>: Thanks for taking the questions. First question just has to do with your operating margins.
Obviously exiting the period of YZ, your operating margins are in the high teens. If you look across the businesses
where you're having greatest amount of launches; oncology, diabetes. And you benchmark those businesses against
your industry peers, the operating margins of some of those companies are in the high 30%s. So when you think about
operating margin expansion going forward, can you maybe help us understand or characterize how those businesses are
potentially going to be contributing to that? And any color on the magnitude of expansion would be helpful.
Second question on Alimta, Germany, UK, any update on the patent challenge that's going on there?
And then lastly, just on the BioChaperone insulin lispro, if you can possibly characterize the profile of that product.
What phase of development and when you anticipated it might go into clinical? And how it might contrast with the
insulin oligo that is being worked on by one of your peers? Thanks.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Great. Thank you, John. So we'll go to Derica obviously for your first question on the operating
margins. And then Sue can comment on the European patent litigation. And then, Enrique, if you'll take the first shot at
the BioChaperone Lispro, and Jan feel free to contribute if you'd like as well. Derica?
<A - Derica W. Rice>: Hi, John. Good morning. As you know, we've stated that we expect to get our OpEx as a
combination of SG&A and R&D as a percent of sales back to that 50% of sales or less by 2018 on a full-year basis.
While I'm not in a position here on the call to break out the operating margin by business unit, let me just share with
you some color as to how we see ourselves improving our margins over time, and provide some examples.
So one of the things we've talked about as we're launching in the area of oncology, obviously highly specialized, we
believe we have the commercial footprint in place. So even as Sue is launching new product and new indications, we
believe we can accommodate that within our existing footprint. Likewise, the same is true in diabetes as well, where
while we may be tweaking around the edges, there're not any wholesale changes in our commercial footprint from a
sales force standpoint. Clearly there is the variable marketing spend behind these brands.
And then if you look on the manufacturing side, we see our sales opportunity as we continue to execute and complete
the technical agenda in our insulin business. And from a manufacturing standpoint, which enabled us to be able to
produce the basal insulins that we're launching in the same facilities today where we produce our existing insulins in
terms of Humulin and Humalog. So therefore, we're getting more throughput through the same existing manufacturing

footprint, which should bring down our per unit cost flowing through those facilities.
So these are some examples of how we believe we will be able to get increased leverage out of our existing
infrastructure, which will enable us to grow our OpEx at a slower rate and our cost base than our top line and giving us
that positive leverage to return to the historical levels of profitability.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Great. Sue?
<A - Susan Mahony>: Yeah, sure. I actually don't have any update on the European patent situation. The two cases,
the German and U.S. case, as you know, are both being appealed. The hearing for both of those is set for March. So we
look forward to being able to provide data on that following those hearings.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Yeah. Just to be clear, the German and the UK case, not U.S. case for March.
<A - Susan Mahony>: Oh, sorry. Yeah, thank you.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Enrique?
<A - Enrique A. Conterno>: On the BioChaperone, this product is already in the clinic. We do have some Phase I
data. And the reason we did a partnership is, as we looked at both our internal programs as well as what was out there,
we felt this was the most compelling assets when we looked at the profile. We're looking for something that is faster on
and faster off with a benefit that that could basically bring, including lower rates of hypoglycemia and lower variability
when it comes to the overall blood glucose.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Great. Thank you, Enrique. Tom, we can go to the next caller, please.

Our next question is from the line of Steve Scala with Cowen. Please go ahead.
<Q - Steve M. Scala>: Thank you. I have three questions. First on the evacetrapib interim look. On the Q3 call, I
believe the company said that there are efficacy features to the interim look. Can you give us examples of efficacy
features? Are you just looking at HDL and LDL levels, or are you also looking at trends in efficacy or events?
Secondly, in the PD-1 arena, I'm curious as to why Lilly selected the Bristol PD-1 for one study and the Merck PD-1
for three others. Do you see clinical differences in the PD-1s you seek to accentuate, or was it for financial or
competitive reasons?
And then lastly, a question for Jeff. There are many emerging modalities in animal health. We recently saw approval of
the first monoclonal antibody for cancer. As a leader in Animal Health, what emerging modalities does Lilly Animal
Health find most interesting? Thank you.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Great, Steve. Thank you for the questions. So Dave on evacetrapib again please, and then Sue
for the PD-1 question on the Bristol and Merck collaborations, and then Jeff for the Animal Health question. Dave?
<A - David A. Ricks>: Yeah. Thanks, Steve. Again on evacetrapib, we do expect an event-driven interim look soon.
This is for futility. As I said before, the bar on, from an efficacy perspective is very low, really ruling out absolute
futility and we will look at major cardiovascular events in that look. But as I think we said before, we don't expect a
major press release on both sides of that. Of course if we stop the study for futility, we would announce that.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Great. Sue?
<A - Susan Mahony>: Yes. Steve, with regards to the trials, I wouldn't read anything into the number of trials that
we've got with each company. Basically, the decision was made based on the interest of each company at that point in
time. We could see that we'll continue to have ongoing collaboration in future with other companies. And again, it
would depend on our interest and their interest.

<A - Philip Johnson>: Great. Jeff?
<A - Jeffrey N. Simmons>: Yes. A great question. I think in Elanco we see a few key spaces going forward in the
medium-term and long-term future. I mean, continued animal disease continues to be a problem, both at the respiratory
and enteric levels. So that covers a couple of key classes that we're worried about. So bovine respiratory disease
continues to be a big challenge. So that's one space.
Second is mastitis, continues to be one of the most unmet needs in dairy at this stage, and we're expecting to make a
nice innovation launch in that space in the U.S. this year. And then I think the whole area of immune modulation,
turning the animals' immune system and activating it against the disease versus today when you look at current
medications, antibiotics, et cetera, it's trying to introduce immune modulation. And I think the last one in the pet space
is renal failure. It continue to be a major issue in especially the feline area. So those are some of the big spaces, pain
would be another one as well.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Great. Thanks, Jeff. Tom, next caller, please.

Our next question is from the line of Seamus Fernandez with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.
<Q - Seamus C. Fernandez>: Thanks very much for the questions. So a few here. First off, can you talk a little bit
about the BioChaperone? And really what needs to be proven to advance this program into Phase III?
The second question, can you also update us on what you're seeing globally in the premix market, how market share is
evolving here, and what you see from a demand perspective for a once-daily premix product?
And then lastly, on the CETP inhibitor, have you evaluated the LDL-C reduction using Merck's, or what Merck has
published, which is this beta quantitation method? And if so, what did you see in terms of the LDL reduction
capabilities? And if you haven't done that, could you just give us what your estimate is of LDL reduction on top of
statins with the 130-milligram dose that's used in the Phase III outcome study? Thanks a lot.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Thanks, Seamus. So Enrique, again on BioChaperone as well as the premix question with
regard to what you're seeing for share market as well as demand for once-daily premix outside of the U.S. it sounds
like, and then back to Dave on the CETP inhibitor. Enrique?
<A - Enrique A. Conterno>: Well, I won't be able to, Seamus, unfortunately discuss the program that we have for our
BioChaperone. What you should expect is that we need to make sure that this product is going to be effective in both
type 1 and type 2 diabetes. And we intend to conduct the right clinical studies to ensure that we can have a thoughtful
Phase III commercial decision.
As I mentioned, clearly, we already have multi insulins in the market. So we need to show some benefit when it comes
to differentiation vis-à-vis what's already marketed, but won't be able to comment on that because we believe that's
important competitive information.
On the premix market, clearly the premix market has been, in many areas of the world, declining, with exception of
emerging markets where we see continued growth of this category. When we look at the share performance, Lilly has
done fairly well. So we are gaining share in this market, whether it's in U.S., whether it's Europe, Japan or emerging
markets.
And I'm not sure how to comment on whether a once-daily premix would be a strong benefit. We will have to see what
the clinical data for that is. If I'm speculating about what you're talking about, right, a premix needs to provide at least
non-inferior control to whatever the standard treatment is when it comes to diabetes. And this particular premix that I
think you're talking about, did not meet the primary endpoint when it comes to hemoglobin A1c control vis-à-vis
basal-bolus therapy. So clearly, all is going to depend on the actual clinical data.

<A - Philip Johnson>: Also the CETP question.
<A - David A. Ricks>: Okay. Yeah, sure. Sorry. Sorry the gap there, I thought there was another question between it.
Seamus, thanks for the question on CETP. I think a couple points of clarification. All along, we've been quoting LDL
reduction numbers for our program using these so-called direct measurement methods. I'm not actually familiar with
the statement you made about Merck's method, but we use this direct method, which is the more accurate way and our
numbers have been consistent throughout.
Perhaps with our program the confusion has been, we reformulated as we went to Phase III. We had tested
100-milligram and 500-milligram in Phase II, and the formulation of 130-milligram that you mentioned is more
bio-available than the 130-milligram equivalent in the Phase II study, if that makes sense. So we would expect LDL
reductions between the 100-milligram and the 500-milligram that were previously published, and that puts you
somewhere in the 30%s in terms of percentage reduction using the direct LDL measurement.

Our next question is from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jay Olson>: Hi. It's Jay Olson in for Jami Rubin. Thank you for taking the question. Actually, just a couple
questions on Animal Health. Can you please tell us what Elanco's EBIT margins were in 2014?
And then when the Novartis Animal Health deal was announced, you guided to a dilutive impact on 2015 earnings,
followed by accretion in 2016 with some cost synergies and mid-20% EBIT margins. Can you just update us on
whether all of your targets are still on track?
And then finally, now that the Novartis Animal Health deal is closed, are you comfortable with the signs of Elanco, or
do you anticipate additional business development? And if so, would it be in the companion animal arena or in
livestock? Thank you.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Great, Jay. Thank you for the questions. Those are all for Jeff. Feel free, and then if you want to
comment at all, Derica, on the accretion dilution as well.
<A - Derica W. Rice>: Sure. I'll take the first one. For 2014, it was around 24% was the EBIT margin. And then in
regards to, just to clarify, when we announced the deal, we did say it would be dilutive in 2015. And we said that we
expect by 2017 to return the combined entity to the historical levels of profitability, which was in the mid-20%s in
terms of margins.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Right. Great. Jeff?
<A - Jeffrey N. Simmons>: Yeah. And just to build on that, I think when you look at the Novartis, we feel good. It's
better than expected in a couple areas. Again, we're just a few days in, but close timing was better than expected. And
also the required divestitures really only needing to sell one brand in the U.S. and all the other areas were we're clear
on. So at this stage, though we've got limited detail on moving forward being that we're just a month in, and we'll
definitely get a better view and more clear detail in Q2, Q3.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Great. Thanks, Jeff.
<A - Derica W. Rice>: What about business development?
<A - Philip Johnson>: Oh, the business development priorities.
<A - Jeffrey N. Simmons>: Yeah, we're going to continue from a business development perspective. I mean, we feel
very good about scale and share of voice, being able to [audio gap] (56:53) Lohmann and Novartis, we see as vehicles

already in the early planning of both of these integrations, which are working very well. I think that we're going to look
now very much as we have in the past with other acquisitions is, where the strategic areas of need are. So vaccinations
and that space, emerging markets in companion animals will continue to be target. So we'll probably be more regional
than global in nature.

Our next question is from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Wendy L. Lin>: Thank you. This is actually Wendy Lin on for Chris Schott today. I have two questions on
Alzheimer's. Just on the N3pG plaque-specific antibody, can you talk about the timelines in the next spectrum here?
And then on the BACE inhibitor, can you talk about your study design? How do you see that molecule comparing with
Merck's and when could you move it into Phase III? Thank you.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Great. Thanks for the questions. Jan, if you'd like to lead off with commentary on the N3pG
monoclonal antibody, and then Jan and Dave, if you'd like to provide the thoughts on the base study design? Jan?
<A - Jan M. Lundberg>: Okay. So the N3pG antibody is a plaque-specific antibody, and it's in Phase I studies
although it's actually done in patients with mild cognitive impairment or mild or moderate Alzheimer's. The purpose of
that study is actually to look at safety PK and have some pharmacodynamic marker, so the effects I'm primarily looking
at Amyvid imaging before and after treatment. And the plan completion of the trials are then second half this year.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Great. Thank you. Dave?
<A - David A. Ricks>: Yeah, as it relates to the base program in alliance with AstraZeneca, we've announced to begin
the Phase II/III program. So one feature this is, it say, Phase II program to confirm dose and safety, which will then
convert into a Phase III perhaps toward the end of this year, early next year depending on enrollment. I think the two
key things, we don't have any comparative data with Merck's BACE inhibitor.
The two key things I'd mention in terms of the study itself and then one operationally, we will be positively screening
for amyloid as with the sola EXPEDITION 3 study in this program as well, so that 100% of the patients in the study
have confirmed Alzheimer's and we know that's an issue from other experiences in this field.
And then our study is a mild Alzheimer's disease study, and I believe Merck has a mild moderate plus a prodromal, so
different population mixes. We also have different end points we're looking at. We favor the activity of daily living and
the cognitive – it has cog measurement points and Merck's looking at different points as well. So there are differences.
We'll have to see how it plays out.
I would say operationally, for the previous comment on sola, we feel good about our teams' ability to enroll patients in
these types of studies. And of course, as it rates to get a drug to patients suffering from the illness. So we're very
focused on timelines and feel confident in our ability to execute.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Great. Thanks, Dave. Tom, if we can go to the next caller, please.

[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from the line of Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q>: Good morning. This is [ph] Ari Jaja (1:00:29) in for Vamil Divan. Thanks for taking my questions. I've three
questions here. First on gross margin guidance, can you please clarify to what extent the upward revision is impacted
by inventory step up and amortization, believe that at Novartis Animal Health deal?

Second on pharma net pricing, can you share your thoughts on key headwinds and tailwinds in different regions? It is
interesting that emerging markets is the only part delivering a positive net effect last year.
And then lastly for Enrique, pertaining to the new insulin glargine product, can you talk about Lilly's preparedness
ahead of the EU launch this year? Thank you.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Thanks, [ph] Ari (1:01:05). And was your second question on Animal Health pricing or just
pharma pricing? I'm sorry. Pharma? Okay. So Derica, if you want to comment on the gross margin piece to start with?
<A - Derica W. Rice>: Sure. Sure. In regards to the gross margin change in our guidance, it only relates to FX. So this
is not driven by the step-up in inventory for the Novartis Animal Health acquisition. In fact that was included in our
original guidance that we shared on our January 7 call. So the 78% gross margin projection today is solely due to the
change in outlook in terms of the FX effect on inventories expected to be sold through the period.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Dave, you want to comment on the...
<A - David A. Ricks>: Yeah. Let me maybe just jump in on the – you're commenting on the 2014 effective price rate
volume chart. We show here in the U.S. being down one on the year, perhaps that's a surprise. Remember in Japan,
2014 was the biannual price year. So we expected and planned for a price pressure there, ACE, I think we have
macroeconomic pressure in our business along with the plan for generic event of Cymbalta, which led into this year.
The U.S. is down primarily driven to the AG, authorized generic business transactions we conducted on both Evista
and Cymbalta, which had an effect on our price per unit in a significant way during the year. So, I think that's more or
less a one-time event for the U.S. market.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Great. And [ph] Ari (1:02:41) I apologize, I missed your last question?
<A - Enrique A. Conterno>: Insulin glargine.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Okay, Enrique. Great. Thank you. You got it.
<A - Enrique A. Conterno>: I'm not sure what I can say other than we are ready. Clearly, we expect to launch in
Europe this year post the expiration of the Lantus patent.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Excellent. Thank you, Enrique. Tom, next caller, please.
Operator
And we have a follow-up question from Seamus Fernandez with Leerink Partners.
<Q - Seamus C. Fernandez>: Thanks a lot for the question. So just two things. One, I don't know if I missed the
answer to this question, but pricing on the Animal Health side of the business. What was the driver there? And is that
something that where we could see that kind of pricing power going forward?
And then separately, as you look at the choice to enroll Amyvid-only patients, do you have internal data suggesting that
the Amyvid staining or the Amyvid biomarker positive patient population in the EXPEDITION studies actually did
have a wider magnitude of benefit suggesting that there could be greater power in EXPEDITION 3? Thanks.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Great. Thanks, Seamus. So Jeff, for the Animal Health pricing question and then back to Dave
on solanezumab. Yeah?
<A - Jeffrey N. Simmons>: Yeah. So on pricing in Animal Health, Seamus, a couple comments. First of all, we have a
very market-based pricing especially on the food animal side. So as you've seen economics get better in the meat, milk
business and our return and our value proposition changes. We base a lot of our pricing model off from that. Second is,
we have taken a very global assessment of these markets and the value aspects of this and have taken a global pricing
approach that I think has also benefited.

And then, I think, lastly on pricing, it's linking to our value-based strategy. As you know, we bought an analytics
company and we're offering a broader set of solutions. So those are the key things. I think we've got to continue to look
as you go forward at the cyclical nature, especially the food animal business and the competitive nature of the
companion animal business. So I think the intention is, can you get a 1% to 3% price is a question that's out there in the
industry that still isn't validated yet. But I think those are the factors to watch going forward.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Great. Thanks, Jeff. Dave?
<A - David A. Ricks>: Yeah. As it relates to the amyloid positivity and I should be clear, we test the primary number
of subjects select for a PET scan. Some do receive a CSF as well. But confirming positive amyloid we think is key to
development in Alzheimer's. And we believe that because we do have data in-house that shows that patients who don't
have amyloid do not respond to an anti-amyloid treatment. And we also know from larger scale population studies, they
also don't progress at the same rate. So if they're in the placebo arm, they're going to over perform. So for all these
reasons and just logic, we believe that's a critical element in Alzheimer's drug development.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Great. Thanks, Dave. Tom, next caller, please.
Operator
And we have a follow-up question from the line of Tim Anderson with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - Timothy Minton Anderson>: Thank you. Couple questions. On your novel basal insulin, you continue to talk
bullishly about it. On your early January guidance call, you said this remains a very important product for the company.
And that's just not congruent at all with how consensus use the drug. Consensus is very skeptical recognizing that there
might be some positive efficacy attributes. But there's also some unique and potentially worrisome toxicities like fatty
liver. And in a competitive category like insulin, I think, that unique side effects could basically take down the
commercial prospects for the product. So I'm hoping you can tell us what you think analysts are missing with this
program?
And the second question on kind of a general question on BACE inhibitors, what are the theoretical safety issues to
monitor with these compounds given the magnitude to which the lower Abeta production? It seems like that's
confounded by the fact that nobody really knows what the physiological of Abeta is. So how do you know what to
watch for? And has there been any signals in any human studies that you're aware of or animal studies?
<A - Philip Johnson>: Great. Thanks, Tim. Enrique, if you'll handle the first question on the novel basal insulin
peglispro, and then Jan, if you'd like to handle the base question in terms of safety things we're looking out for what
we've seen so far with molecules in humans. Enrique?
<A - Enrique A. Conterno>: Sure. So on the efficacy side, I think what we basically have is five positive Phase III
trials against Lantus. Now let's keep in mind that we have not disclosed what the level of improvement is, but
statistically significant improvement in hemoglobin A1c in five trials is unprecedented. Hemoglobin A1c reduction has
a tangible benefit when it comes to outcomes, in particular, in terms of the development of micro vascular
complications. So we see these as extremely important. You spoke of some of the signals that we basically saw in our
Phase III programs, at this stage though, I think, we have to wait for us to be able to disclose the data at ADA for you to
be able to see exactly what is the benefit risk profile of this product.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Great. Thanks, Enrique. Jan?
<A - Jan M. Lundberg>: Yeah. If we look at beta secretase or BACE inhibitors, the current BACE inhibitors in the
clinic affects both the BACE1 and the BACE2 enzyme. And clearly for the Alzheimer indication, the thinking is it's the
BACE1 enzyme that is then cleaving the APP precursor. If we look at potential side effects, we experienced and
probably other companies as well, off target effects with some initial BACE inhibitors, which we believe then underlie
some of the liver toxicity, which is not unheard of with small molecules. At the more specific toxicology observations
that we see is actually a depigmentation in some animals. And the potential explanation for that is probably a BACE2

effect. So this is something that also needs to be monitored in the clinic.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Thank you, Jan. Tom, do we have anymore callers in queue?
Operator
And we have a follow-up question from the line of Steve Scala with Cowen. Please go ahead.
<Q - Steve M. Scala>: Thank you. I've two questions. First on your CGRP monoclonal antibody for migraine looks
spectacularly effective, but with significant safety concerns including maybe cardiovascular wound healing, intraocular
pressure, maybe teratogenicity. What are next steps for this compound? And there a number of similar compounds in
development, why is Lilly's best in class?
And then second question on ixekizumab, Lilly has provided solid top line data in psoriasis. I know there are no
head-to-head studies versus Novartis' secukinumab, but based on the full data which you have and we don't, would you
say ixekizumab is comparable to secukinumab? Does it have a chance to be better or is ixekizumab less robust than
secukinumab? Thank you.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Thank you, Steve. Jan, would you like to comment maybe on CGRP please, and then Dave...
<A - Jan M. Lundberg>: Yeah. Well, calcitonin gene-related peptide or CGRP has been around for quite some time
and the mechanism has been studied both with small molecule oral agents as well and as more recently, monoclonal
antibodies. And the studies with oral agents, I think, showed quite positive data in acute migraine treatment relief of
symptoms, but due to probably off target labor talks, these agents could not be used for more chronic treatment.
On the other hand, they were also tested in a variety of patients with other diseases and there were no real other side
effects seen. And this has been confirmed even more with the monoclonal antibodies, which are very specific. And we
have not seen any side effects with these type of agents so far in our studies. And currently, we are then in migraine in
Phase II, preparing for Phase III with a more safety and those ranging studies and we're also studying these agents for
osteoarthritis. But we are very bullish on this mechanism, and realizing it is a competitive area with several other
players but we're doing our utmost to execute the trials in a very rapid fashion.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Great. Thank you, Jan. Dave?
<A - David A. Ricks>: Yeah. As relates to the IL-17s, we're quite excited about this class. We think both psoriasis has
a lot of room for growth and IL-17s present really a compelling difference as a group versus available therapies. I think
that was strongly exhibited in the top line results we put out in September, which demonstrated a very significant effect
size improvement over etanercept in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis with ixekizumab.
We don't have a class comparisons as you mentioned. And Steve, you'll see our data come out pretty soon with a more
full look at what we're looking at, but I'll just say qualitatively, we think we have the potential to have the best drug in
the class because at the maximum doses, we see extraordinary rates of PASI 100 clearance, and I think our numbers are
high. So all the data is not out, we need to see Amgen's full data set, et cetera, but I think we feel good that we could
have the most effective medicine in the class. And as we reported, safety of ixekizumab in the moderate-to-severe
patients with psoriasis was similar to that we saw with etanercept.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Great. Thanks, Dave. Tom, one last poll to see if we have any additional callers.

Okay. Thank you very much. I'll go ahead and turn it over to John then to wrap up the call. John?
John C. Lechleiter
Thank you, Phil. A brief wrap up, here. To all those on the call, we thank you for your continued interest in our
company and for your support. As we emerge from this journey that we've taken through years YZ, I'm extremely
proud that we have executed on the strategy that we laid out for you and delivered on the commitments we shared five
years ago. On January 7, we outlined our objectives for the balance of this decade. We intend to drive year-on-year
revenue growth through the balance of this decade, spurred by new product launches from our pipeline.
Next, we aim to turn that revenue growth into even greater earnings growth by controlling costs and leveraging existing
infrastructure. At the same time, we aim to maintain a sustainable flow of innovative medicines from our pipeline. And
finally, we will deploy capital to create value, which includes returning excess cash to shareholders via both the
dividend and share repurchases.
We remain convinced that our strategy is the right one for Lilly in order to create value for patients, physicians, payers
and our shareholders. And our ability to execute so far gives us increasing confidence in our future prospects. As
always, we'll keep you apprised of our progress. Thank you once again.
