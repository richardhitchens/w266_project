Ursula M. Burns
Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Xerox's third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. At the beginning of the
year, we committed to an ambitious agenda that included delivering on our financial goals for 2015 while creating a
new path forward that will make our businesses more agile, focused, and competitive. I am pleased to report that we are

on track to meet all of these commitments and that we achieved solid financial results this quarter.
Our third quarter EPS was within our guidance range. Cash flow generation was strong, and we realized solid margins
in both segments despite a challenging global market environment. At the same time, our strategic transformation and
separation activities have accelerated significantly. I want to emphasize that these actions are not just about delivering
for the quarter or the year, our strategic transformation program and separation are designed to fundamentally
strengthen our businesses and align them closely with the demands of our clients and opportunities in the market.
We're embedding productivity and cost efficiency into all areas of our business, which will benefit us for years to
come. We're driving operational excellence and innovation to meet our clients' evolving needs. And we're establishing
the new companies with talent, business strategies, and operating models that will enable them to become more
profitable and drive growth over the long-term.
You will hear much more about these initiatives and the strategies, structures and financial plans of the two
post-separation companies at their Investor events in December. But I'm pleased to have the leaders of our new
companies, Jeff Jacobson and Ashok Vemuri, here with me today to answer questions about results in their respective
businesses during the Q&A.
Before we turn to financial results, let me share some highlights of our progress towards the separation. So with two
months to go before we complete the separation, we've passed a number of major milestones in the process. The rating
agencies released updates on Xerox's credit ratings, which will continue to be investment-grade. Conduent Incorporated
is expected to be a high non-investment-grade rated company following the separation. These ratings are line with our
expectations.
Upon completion of the spin, Conduent will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange where Xerox will continue to
trade. Additionally, we were excited to introduce Conduent's new logo and brand identity. Ashok selected Brian Walsh
as the CFO of Conduent. Brian has 20 years of experience in Xerox's finance organization, spanning both operating and
corporate roles, and he is currently the CFO of Xerox Services. He is a great fit for the role. And last week, we
announced seven of the nine directors that will serve on Conduent's board as well as Conduent's named Executive
Officers. With that, the majority of Conduent's leadership team and board of directors is in place. We are in the process
of filling the remaining two board seats, and we'll make those announcements as they become available.
All of this information about Conduent along with updated information on its expected capitalization, pro forma
financials, compensation plans, and governance was included in several amendments to Conduent's Form 10
registration statement.
For Xerox, Jeff is implementing a new, more streamlined operating model and has identified the operation leaders for
the standalone company, building on our strong, well-established infrastructure and executive team. Jeff continues to
focus on filling the remaining executive roles and strengthening the bench, including identifying the right, high-quality
individual for the CFO role. In the interim, Leslie Varon continues to provide strong leadership to our finance
organization and will remain in her current role until we have a new CFO in place.
I should point out that beyond Senior Executive appointments, both Jeff and Ashok have put in place the necessary
leadership teams for the major corporate functions. We are now just days away from what we call our soft separation
phase. This involves separating our corporate functions, business infrastructure, and IT systems into discrete
capabilities for each company. It's a test run at operating independently for the new companies that will help us ensure
a smooth day one launch.
In short, we're moving rapidly toward our separation and remain on schedule to complete it by year-end. The benefits
of our three-year strategic transformation program also continue to ramp across both businesses and can clearly be seen
in our third quarter performance. We remain on track to deliver $700 million in annualized savings from productivity
and cost initiatives this financial year.
With that, I will move to our third quarter results. As I said, this was a good quarter. We delivered adjusted earnings of
$0.27 per share, which was within our guidance range and in line with the same period last year. Total revenue of $4.2

billion, showed a 3% decline year-over-year or 4% on an adjusted constant currency basis, which excludes the 2015
charge related to our Health Enterprise strategy change.
Operating margin was solid at 9.2%. We saw strong year-over-year margin expansion in our Services segment driven
by gains across our BPO businesses, while Document Technology margins remained strong. Cash flow from operations
was $370 million, reflecting a $99 million increase from prior year, and we ended the quarter with a cash balance of
$1.4 billion as a result. Overall, our underlying results demonstrated ongoing progress in our productivity and cost
savings initiatives and our ability to generate strong cash flow.
In addition, we continued to innovate to deepen our client relationships and extend our capabilities. Let me highlight a
few of our achievements during the quarter. Starting with our Services segment, which had a number of business wins
and high-profile recognitions across the portfolio, we were honored to receive Outstanding Corporate Innovator Award
from the Product Development and Management Association for automation, analytics and personalization capabilities.
Another notable recognition was by HfS, which named Xerox Healthcare to its Winner's Circle, the highest ranking in
its report on business services for healthcare payers and providers.
In the public sector, the State of Tennessee selected Xerox to provide EMV-enhanced benefits cards to over 120,000
citizens receiving child support, unemployment compensation, and state pension payments. Our Document Outsourcing
business secured a 10-year contract worth $110 million with the USDA for managed print services. We will be
installing and supporting up to 16,000 Xerox ConnectKey-enabled printers and multi-function devices at more than
3,000 USDA locations around the world.
Document Outsourcing was also recognized for its market-leading offerings by prominent industry analyst groups,
including leadership positions in Quocirca's MPS Market Landscape Report and IDC's MarketScape's Document
Workflow Services Assessment.
Turning to our Document Technology business. In September, we showcased our portfolio of the latest printing
technologies, workflow solutions, and business development resources at Graph Expo 2016. This is North America's
largest graphic arts trade show. We also brought a number of innovative products for small and mid-sized businesses to
market, as we continued to expand our offerings in this space.
At the corporate level, I am proud to share that Xerox released its 2016 Global Citizenship Report, highlighting our
approach to social responsibility. Our citizenship efforts continue to be widely recognized, and, during the quarter, we
were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index, the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for North America, and
Corporate Responsibility Magazine's 100 Best Corporate Citizens.
I'll now turn it over to Leslie, who will provide more detail on our third quarter results and 2016 guidance.
Leslie F. Varon
Thanks, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with the earnings slide and cover the rest of the financials as
well as our guidance before handing it back to Ursula to wrap up.
Our third quarter results reflect operational discipline and good progress in key areas that will set the foundation for the
two companies post-separation. These include: cost and productivity progress from our strategic transformation,
resulting in broad-based margin improvement in BPO and solid margins in Document Technology; overall Services
signings growth, as we renewed 86% in the quarter with high renewal opportunities, reflecting the continued
confidence our customers have in us; strong operating cash generation, reflective of the durability of our annuity-based
business model. So while revenues in both businesses were a bit soft, we delivered overall good results in a somewhat
volatile macro environment.
Total revenue of $4.2 billion was down 3% at actual currency and down 4% on an adjusted constant currency basis,
including one point of negative currency.

I'll be discussing our results on an adjusted basis when making comparisons against the prior year, as the third quarter
2015 included the $389 million pre-tax charge including a revenue reduction of $116 million related to our Health
Enterprise strategy change.
Adjusted gross margin of 31.3% was up 10 basis points year-over-year, driven by improvements in both segments,
partially offset by a greater mix of Services, which structurally has a lower gross margin. There was a modest negative
transaction currency impact in quarter three, reflecting yen's strength against the euro, pound, and U.S. dollar, partially
mitigated by our hedging and currency risk-sharing with Fuji Xerox. At current rate, we are expecting some additional
pressure in quarter four.
Adjusted RD&E was down $10 million year-over-year, and adjusted SAG was down $28 million, driven by
productivity and cost initiatives, which were partially offset by higher expenses related to prior-year compensation and
benefits reduction.
Overall flow-through from our strategic transformation actions resulted in good margins in both segments and a solid
9.2% total company operating margin. Adjusted other, net expense was down $17 million year-over-year, driven by
lower interest expense.
Equity income of $39 million in the quarter was down slightly year-over-year. Our third quarter adjusted tax rate of
25.3% was 1.8 points below last year and just under our guidance range of 26% to 28%, reflecting the geographic mix
of our profit. Bottom line, adjusted earnings of $0.27 was in the middle of our guidance range and flat year-over-year.
Turning to Services, we had another quarter of very good operating profit growth, up $33 million or 17%
year-over-year, as significant margin improvement more than offset modest revenue declines. Services revenue was up
1% at actual currency, down 2% to constant currency and adjusting for the prior-year Health Enterprise charge.
Document Outsourcing grew 1% year-over-year with growth continuing to be driven by Xerox Partner Print Services.
BPO declined 4% on an adjusted basis, reflecting our continued focus on profitability, very modest inorganic
contribution as well as forgone revenue associated with the Health Enterprise strategy change. Within BPO, public
sector revenue grew 3% as our transportation business continues to perform well and is benefiting from ramping new
business, while commercial industries and healthcare declined driven by headwinds as we prioritized profitability, and
therefore have stepped away from some unprofitable contracts.
Total signings in the quarter were up 17% year-over-year and are up 6% for the trailing 12 months. The increase in
quarter three was driven by strong renewal, a reflection of both high renewal opportunity as well as a good renewal rate
of 86%, confirming the value we provide our customers. Over the past year, we have renewed 8 of our 10 top BPO
clients. New business signings have been lower over the past year as we have strengthened our signings criteria, setting
the bar higher on price, margin, and deal terms.
An important measure of our progress this year is Services margin. This has been an area of intense focus, and the team
delivered a quarter three margin of 9.4%, at the high-end of our 8% to 9.5% full-year range. This strong performance
reflects broad contribution across BPO, a result of both our strategic cost transformation initiatives and increased
operating discipline by the team. And as we've said before, Document Outsourcing margin generally is in line with the
Document Technology segment margin.
So key takeaways on Services are consistent with what we said in quarter two. While revenue was a bit soft, Document
Outsourcing remains a good performer, and, in BPO, we're making steady progress, improving profitability. There's
been a near-term trade-off between revenue growth and margin, but overall it has resulted in strong profit growth and
will provide a solid foundation for our businesses as we prepare to separate.
Document Technology delivered strong margins in the face of ongoing revenue pressures within a tough market
environment. Revenue was down 9% at actual currency and 7% at constant currency with equipment down 13% and
annuity down 5%. Annuity was an improvement from quarter two, driven by supplies. Within equipment, trends
improved in both entry and high-end, reflecting new product introduction, but mid-range lagged due to lower large
account sales in the U.S.

When we include Document Outsourcing with Document Technology, revenue declined 5% in the third quarter and is
down 4% year-to-date. Overall, we continue to maintain our equipment revenue market share leadership.
Turning to activity, we delivered good growth across all color activity segments with particular strength in high-end
due in part to the recent drupa trade show. Entry results benefited from better performance in developing markets,
where we've lapped economic weakness in some geographies.
Mid-range had a mixed quarter with continued good growth from the i-Series products launched earlier this year but
weakness elsewhere. Document Technology margin of 13.1% was quite strong, up 50 basis points sequentially,
reflecting strategic transformation benefits and was in the middle of our full year range. Year-over-year, margin was
down 80 basis points as gross margin improvements were not enough to offset a higher SAG ratio. The third quarter
2015 results included materially lower compensation and benefits expense, which we did not expect would repeat.
Transaction currency in the quarter was a relatively modest 30 basis point headwind to margin and, at current rates,
could be about twice that level in quarter four.
So overall for Document Technology, we continued to manage the impact of revenue declines through ongoing
productivity actions, resulting in strong segment margins and cash generation.
And as I wrap up on the segments, I'll repeat what I said last quarter, we will manage our strategic transformation
focus, and we expect continued good profitability in both Document Technology and in Services as we prepare to
separate.
Moving to cash flow, operating cash generation of $370 million was strong, up $99 million year-over-year and reflects
the underlying cash generative profile of our business model. From a year-over-year perspective, good working capital
performance and solid net income more than offset the impact of this year's unique Health Enterprise settlement and
separation payments, which were $39 million and $21 million, respectively, in the quarter. We've generated $522
million of operating cash during the first three quarters of the year with all 2016 Health Enterprise settlement payments
now behind us. Therefore, we entered quarter four, our seasonally strongest cash flow quarter, well positioned to
deliver on our guidance of $950 million to $1.2 billion for the full year.
Investing cash flows were a use of $69 million and included $73 million spent on CapEx. Cash flow from financing
was an $84 million use and includes $85 million for preferred and common stock dividends. Our cash balance at the
end of the quarter was $1.4 billion and continues to provide us flexibility as we move into quarter four and prepare for
separation.
Turning to our capital structure and capital allocation, we ended quarter three with $7.4 billion of debt, a level we've
been at all year. Applying 7:1 leverage to our customer financing assets, our allocated financing debt at the end of the
quarter was $3.8 billion, leaving core debt at $3.6 billion.
We continue to manage our capital structure to maintain credit metrics consistent with our investment-grade credit
rating. On October 11, we filed an amendment to the Conduent Form 10 that included details of its anticipated
post-separation capital structure. We indicated that Conduent expected to be capitalized with approximately $2.4 billion
of debt and $400 million of cash and to transfer $2.05 billion of proceeds to Xerox, which we intend to use to reduce
Xerox debt. Consistent with our expectations, Xerox credit ratings remain investment-grade, and we expect that the
Conduent capital structure would result in a high, non-investment-grade rating.
And to touch on capital allocation, we've paid $79 million in common stock dividends in quarter three. We completed a
$13 million dealer acquisition earlier this month, consistent with our strategy to expand our U.S. Global Imaging
business. And as we've said previously, as we prepare for our separation later this year, we're not planning to
repurchase any shares.
Before I move to guidance on the next slide, I want to mention that Conduent will be filing its third quarter results in
the next few weeks. The Conduent carve-out financials will reflect margin improvement, although not to the same
degree as the Services segment, since Conduent results include the Student Loan business, which resides in our Other
segment. That business is in run-off and declined profit year-over-year as anticipated.

I'll now share with you our fourth quarter and full-year expectations. For quarter four, we expect adjusted earnings in
the range of $0.32 to $0.35 and GAAP earnings of $0.11 to $0.14. For the full year, we continue to expect total
revenues to decline 2% to 4% at constant currency. We're narrowing our adjusted earnings guidance range to $1.11 to
$1.14, which incorporates our fourth quarter expectation.
In Services, we expect full year revenue will be flat to down 1%, and margin will be at the very high-end of the 8% to
9.5% range. We expect Document Technology revenues will be at the lower-end of the full year range and that margin
will be in line with our 12% to 14% expectation.
We expect full year GAAP earnings of $0.45 to $0.48. We continue to anticipate full year restructuring of about $300
million, including approximately $70 million in the fourth quarter and our estimate of pre-tax separation costs remains
$175 million to $200 million and $40 million to $50 million in tax-related friction cost.
Turning to cash flow. As I mentioned earlier, our year-to-date performance positions us well for the full year, and we
are maintaining our expectations of $950 million to $1.2 billion for operating cash flow and $600 million to $850
million for free cash flow. And, finally, our capital allocation expectations remain largely unchanged, although we now
expect to spend about $30 million to $50 million on acquisitions.
So, in summary, despite a somewhat challenging macro backdrop, we are on track and remain committed to delivering
our overall revenue, earnings, and cash flow guidance.
With that, Ursula, I'll turn it back to you.
Ursula M. Burns
Thank you, Leslie. In summary, we are pleased with our results in the third quarter, which were in line with our
expectations and driven by our ongoing operational and cost discipline. We are on track to deliver on all of our
objectives for the year and establish two companies that will be well positioned to drive shareholder value over the
long-term.
Before we open the line for questions, I would like to note that today has particular significance for Xerox, as this will
be our last earnings call as a combined entity. Next time we report earnings, we will be two separate companies, each
on their own path to enhance value for our clients, employees, investors, and other stakeholders. I look forward to
watching both Xerox and Conduent prosper in the future.
We will now open up the line for questions. Jennifer?
Jennifer Horsley
Thanks, Ursula. Joining us today are Jeff Jacobson, Head of our Document Technology business and CEO of new
Xerox following separation; Ashok Vemuri, Chief Executive Officer of Xerox Business Services and CEO of Conduent
post-separation; and Brian Webb-Walsh, CFO Xerox Services, who will be CFO of Conduent post-separation.
Before we get to your questions, let me point out that we have several supplemental slides at the end of our deck, which
provide more financial detail to support today's presentation and complement our prepared remarks. For the Q&A, I
would ask participants to limit follow-on and multi-part questions so we can get to everyone. At the end of our Q&A
session, I will turn it back to Ursula for closing comments. Operator, please open the line for questions now.

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of George Tong from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.
<Q - George K. F. Tong>: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Ashok, first of all, welcome to Xerox. Understanding more
details will be provided at the upcoming Analyst Day. Ashok, can you provide or touch on what your top three strategic
priorities are to improve growth and margin performance in the BPO business?
<A - Ashok Vemuri>: Yes. Sure, George. I think the focus for us continues to be to drive profitable growth. We have
demonstrated a very strong margin performance. We continue to invest in the strategic transformation to turn the
business so that we are invested and investing in areas that are our traditional strengths. We have certain areas where
we would like to continue to drive a higher degree of transformation, especially Customer Care, but we are pleased
with the progress that we have made on the margin front. And I think that will give us the momentum to be able to
continue to drive the transformation that we seek in our business.
<Q - George K. F. Tong>: Very helpful. And the earnings release this quarter disclosed that work to implement the
Health Enterprise platform in New York has been elongated and could result in material increases in future costs to
complete. Can you help frame or quantify the potential cost over-runs? And comment on your desire to remain in the
government healthcare business, given some of the recent difficulties in ramping contracts in the segment?
<A - Ashok Vemuri>: Yeah. So, we are working in a very collaborative fashion with the state. The good news is that
we have learned our lessons and have gained some experience based on our prior implementations. We're working
closely with the state. We are making progress on the implementation. And given that these contracts and
implementations are usually long tenure and have changing requirements and ups and downs, I think we are, given all
of that that, making very decent progress.
<Q - George K. F. Tong>: Thanks very much.
<A - Jennifer Horsley>: Thank you, George. Operator, next question?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross from Cross Research. Your line is open.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Thank you. I have two questions, the first is for Jeff. Just how do we think about what's
going on in the underlying business, in the printing business? Equipment was down 13% in Doc Tech, and then
combined it was – I don't know what equipment was down, but overall the printing business was down about 5%
constant currency when you add in Document Outsourcing. So I'm just curious as to sort of how you see the
competitive landscape? The yen has obviously moved significantly. Your competitors in Japan are not reporting
particularly good numbers. So, what are you seeing out there as you sort of head into 2017? And then I have a question
for Ashok?
<A - Jeffrey Jacobson>: Sure, Shannon. Thanks very much. So, first, let me address it from a global market and macro
standpoint. So the global market environment continues to be challenging. As you mentioned, Shannon, there are
uncertainties with currencies fluctuating, and the yen, and the pound. Certainly the uncertainty of the presidential
election of the U.S., the Brexit adds a certain degree of uncertainty in the U.K. and Europe. But these complexities are
obviously what we deal with all the time and the important thing are the countermeasures. So what we're doing is we're
very aggressive on the productivity measures to drive down our total delivered cost and enhance the operating margins.
As you know what we've done over the last couple of years, we've been pretty aggressive on productivity, and we're
taking that to the next level. We're very focused on innovation and defending our market share, and we're focused on in
the growth areas.
So, specific to this quarter, what I'd say, our revenue was in line and was stable in this challenging market environment.
You're correct that we were pressured on the equipment side, and some of that was more in the high-end in government
bids due to these uncertainties. But we're also pleased with the annuity business driven by supplies, and we were also
pleased on the high-end. We saw the impact of drupa, which will benefit us for the next couple of quarters. And then at

the end of September, we obviously had Graph Expo in the U.S., and we think that will benefit us. So overall, in line,
good color installs, and pressure on more of the mono side as we're moving more to color in the macro environment.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Great. Thank you. And then, Ashok, can you talk a bit about how you think about the
balance between revenue and margin? Because over the last few years, Xerox has sort of bounced between wanting a
lot of revenue growth out of BPO, but then that's obviously impact the margin depending on what you sign versus at
sometimes saying, no, we're going to focus more on margin and, therefore, we saw revenue declines can – and impact
to billings or bookings. So just sort of philosophically, how do you think about – I know it's a balancing act, but what
do you put more weight to? Thank you.
<A - Ashok Vemuri>: So, Shannon, my philosophy on this is we need profitable growth. Revenue growth is important
in order to demonstrate that the investments are in the right place and we are continuing to provide value to our clients.
Margin is an indicator of two things for me. One is the value that our clients perceive that we are bringing to the table
and are willing to pay for it. And, secondly, it's a report card on our – on management's ability to effectively and
efficiently run a business. So both of these are important for the reasons I just described. And I think, even though there
is certain degree of elasticity between them, it is important to manage that elasticity in a way that we have growth on
both fronts.

Our next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan Securities. Your line is open.
<Q - Tien-tsin Huang>: Hey. Great. Thank you. Just wanted to dig in here just on the revenue coming in somewhat
soft. I know the profitability came in nicely, but just how much of that do you think is macro versus your profitability
focus versus maybe, I guess, distractions from the split of the spin? Can you maybe rank those?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: We'll start on the Services side with Ashok and then switch a little bit to the Tech side with
Jeff.
<A - Ashok Vemuri>: Okay. So I think what we have seen in terms of the margin improvement is clearly the
flow-through of all the strategic transformation activities that we've been doing. There's a higher degree of discipline
that we have driven. We have balanced some of the revenue reduction because we are being much more selective in
terms of the deals we are doing, the qualification has approved. The bars that we have put in terms of pricing and the
kind of deals that we want to do, we've raised that. So margins, as I've said in an answer to the previous question, is
extremely important for us, but we need to balance that by also driving revenue growth.
<A - Jeffrey Jacobson>: Yeah. And I think from the Tech standpoint, when you see the equipment revenue that would
tend to be impacted more by the uncertainties and the macro issues. We're very fortunate from the standpoint that 75%
of our business is annuity which provides a strong foundation, strong base. We're also very fortunate that the vast
majority of our contracts, the bundled contracts, with supplies which provide stability for us. So what we're doing is
we're not getting out ahead of our headlights. We're managing our cost and productivity very strongly, and we're
looking for the opportunities to grow certainly in Document Outsourcing, Graphic Communications, and in some
under-penetrated markets for us, such as SMB.
<A - Jennifer Horsley>: Thanks, Tien-tsin. Operator, next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah from Brean Capital. Your line is open.

Ursula on the Xerox side. As we think about where the opportunities for incremental efficiencies could be, as you get
post-split, and then as we think about where the opportunity is for, I guess, increased velocity around the
decision-making could be post-split. How should we be thinking about it? What things have you guys learned about
this opportunity so far? And understanding you probably don't have numbers to give us yet. I guess from a magnitude
perspective, I guess from – what context in terms of – like, how should we think about it in terms of potential to be
impactful on the P&L? What's the right context there as well? And that's it. Would love your thoughts there. Thanks.
<A - Jeffrey Jacobson>: Yeah, so, sure, Ananda. Thanks very much and certainly we'll cover a lot more of the details
at the Investor Conference. But the way we look at it is this, if you look at the strategic transformation we announced
over a three-year period as a combined entity about $2.4 billion and we said that Tech would be about two-thirds of
that. So the linchpin to our strategy is driving that strategic transformation very hard. And the reason is this. In past
years, basically, we've offset the headwinds of annuity, price erosion, and done just enough. What we want to do now is
take this to a totally another level so that we can reinvest back in the business, bring some back down to the
bottom-line, and invest in some of the growth areas we see, certainly in Document Outsourcing, Graphic
Communications and being able to invest a little more into entry, and we'll talk a little bit more about that at Investor
Day.
In terms of the strategic transformation, we're driving it very hard. We're looking at things such as supply chain
optimization, technical service excellence with Remote Call Assist, Remote Connectivity, real estate optimization, how
we can design our products with more efficiency, and then de-layering and simplifying the organization. So we have a
pretty detailed plan. We're tracking very well towards it, and we're pleased with where we are right now.
<Q - Ananda P. Baruah>: And that's really helpful, Jeff. I've got a quick follow-up to that, if I could. Are those
moves, the non-revenue moves, the core organizational moves you talked to, are those incremental to business as usual
at Xerox? And if they're incremental to business as usual at Xerox, would you favor the incremental op profit dollars to
be drop to the bottom line or invest it back into growth or both of those things? Thanks.
<A - Jeffrey Jacobson>: Yeah. So one of the things that our messages is, there's no business as usual at Xerox. So,
what we are going to do is we separate our companies, we're going to take all the good things that we bring from
Xerox, and there are a lot of great things. But we're going to be a much more simplified de-layered organization. And
what we're going to do with the efficiencies we drive in taking strategic transformation to the next level, some will
certainly drop to the bottom line and some will be invested to improve the revenue trajectory.
<A - Jennifer Horsley>: Thanks, Ananda. Operator, next question?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Essex from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
<Q - Brian L. Essex>: Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking the question. Ashok, I was wondering if I could
maybe ask you about the Services performance? And now that you've been there for a little while, and you're rolling up
your sleeves, how much of the lower guidance is due to the more – the greater degree of selectivity in contracts? And I
noticed the margins are now kind of pointed towards the high-end. How much of the margin is due to your strategic
transformation versus pricing?
<A - Ashok Vemuri>: Well, I think the margin improvements, Brian, are to a great extent driven by the efficiency that
we have seen. And remember that this margin improvement that we have seen comes despite our performance in
Customer Care, and I'll elaborate more on that as we go into [audio gap] (39:08) et cetera. But, clearly, where our
business is actually clicking in and the ones that we are investing and amplifying, these are coming in at decent margins
and actually much improved margins than previous periods. But we still have a ways to go in terms of being able to
transform some of our businesses which are core to us, and they – as we do that, as we get more selective, we drive a
much more predictable, and sustainable, scalable business, and we have the foundation for it. I think we would be able
to see the performance of that in future quarters.

<Q - Brian L. Essex>: Okay. And maybe as a follow-up, in terms of transforming the business, again, as I think back
to conversations that we previously had with Bob, for example, we talked about centralizing the legacy – relatively
distributed nature of the legacy ACS business. I mean, how far along from previous initiatives are we? And then how
much more room is there to go within that organization in terms of increasing its efficiency? Maybe if we can get a – if
we can just get a sense of your fresh take on the business? And what's new in the way that you view it?
<A - Ashok Vemuri>: Yeah. So the good news is that this is not something that we've just decided or contemplated to
do, this is in progress. So we've taken enough initiatives and more, if you will, on transforming the business. In some
places, we've been effective. We clearly have a business which is very widespread, both from the range of businesses
that we do, the range of clients that we have, and the geographical spread. So we need to refocus ourselves on those
things that we are really good at, amplify those and invest in them, and continue to drive through the strategic
transformation initiative, drive this to success.
But I think the important thing is to also understand that this is not something that's going to happen overnight or in a
few quarters. This is a transformation. It is going to transition over a period of time. And we will discuss the
appropriate metric as we bridge from where we are to where we really want to be.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Frank Atkins from SunTrust. Your line is open.
<Q - Frank C. Atkins>: Hi. Thank for taking my questions. I want to ask, Ashok, what are the major levers that you
see to pull to drive profitability going forward?
<A - Ashok Vemuri>: Well, I think the number one, of course, is we have to refocus on our delivery model. Customer
Care is a big part of what we do. Innovation in that either through robotics and automation is a key part of what we do.
There are some internal processes in how we run ourselves, which we could use some of those similar processes and
tools to make us much more effective and efficient. We have to look for businesses that will provide us profitable
growth. We have to exploit and to monetize all of the assets that we have within the company, and we have a ton of
them which need to be deployed across the board. We have to look at businesses, and segments, and geographies which
will help us meet those profitability goals. And in some situations, we also have to sort of run-off businesses that we're
deliberately taking a view on running off.
<A - Jennifer Horsley>: Thanks, Frank. Operator, next question?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Cabral from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<Q - Matthew Cabral>: Thank you. I wanted to ask about the proposed Conduent balance sheet. I guess on my
estimates, it looks like the business will start off with north of 3 times gross leverage, which seemed a little bit high
relative where to some of the pure-play BPO competitors are and given the meaningful turnaround that this business
faces going forward. So I guess, what gives you the confidence that this is the right capital structure for Conduent going
forward? And does this level of leverage still give you room to make either the organic or inorganic investments
needed to transform this business ahead?
<A - Brian Webb-Walsh>: So, Matt, it's Brian. As Ursula and Leslie both mentioned, we anticipate being a high
non-investment-grade rated company. We believe the leverage that we're starting with is manageable. We intend to
improve the leverage over time through operational performance improvement. So again, we will use cost
transformation to create room to make organic investments. And the inorganic investments will be timed as we can
afford them, but we believe that it's a manageable starting point.

<Q - Matthew Cabral>: Thank you. And then what...?
<A - Jennifer Horsley>: Sorry, Matt. Do you have another question?
<Q - Matthew Cabral>: Yeah. I'm just going to ask one for Jeff more on the legacy Xerox business. I guess, I wanted
to ask around the USDA contract win that was mentioned in the prepared remarks. And, first of all, if there's any help
around the ramp of that contract. And then, more just taking a step back and looking at that vertical in particular around
U.S. Federal. Was that a sort of opportunistic one-off win or is that an area where there might be a little more bit of a
robust pipeline, particularly given the pending Lexmark acquisition that's out there?
<A - Jeffrey Jacobson>: Yeah. Thanks, Matt. Yeah, not specific to the Lexmark acquisition, but I think more the
USDA win. We're very strong in Federal. We're strong in Public Sector. Document Outsourcing is a strong and really
good business for us. We're the clear market leader and we continue to see growth and strong margins in that business.
It's an area of focus, strategic importance to us and we had a good renewal rate. We continue – we're very strong in the
large enterprise sector. We're always focused on new logos and new customers and this was a big part of that. In
addition to that, we're going to apply that same expertise, if I can call it that, to the managed print services in the SMB
sector as well, where we even have a lot more opportunity for growth there.
<A - Jennifer Horsley>: Thanks, Matt.
<Q - Matthew Cabral>: Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
<Q - Steven Schneiderman>: Hi. This is Steve Schneiderman pinch hitting for Keith today. Thank you for taking my
question. I wanted to direct this to Ashok. As we think about getting an update on the sales cycle, signings for the
quarter were up about 15% and I understand this includes Document Outsourcing. But signings were down by about
the same amount as you talked about trying to be more selective on profitable growth. My question is, where are we in
the cycle in terms of churning out these low-profit potential new deals and being able to – once again, being able to
look at a more steady state to get signings growth?
<A - Ashok Vemuri>: Yeah. So from our signings growth perspective, we grew about 17% and the bulk of that
actually came from renewals. So that is actually good news. We have 8 out of our 10 BPO clients actually renewed
with us, so obviously whatever we are bringing to the party, our clients like, and they want to continue to do business
with us. The area of concern, if you will, for us is new deal signings. That is down and that is an area of focus. I called
in my go-to-market team in October. We basically sat down to look at the opportunities in the market in the spaces that
we are strong in. There continues to be headroom for growth and there are opportunities out there which we will
selectively pick to drive profitable growth.
<Q - Steven Schneiderman>: Okay. is this something you think can be resolved mid-2017, or is that about a little
conservative or aggressive from that perspective?
<A - Ashok Vemuri>: I think it's difficult to put a timeline on this, but suffice it to say that we are intensely focused on
driving revenue and driving new business growth, while, at the same time, continuing to respond to the trust our
existing clients have placed in us by bringing innovative solutions to the table.
<A - Jennifer Horsley>: Thanks, Steve. Operator, next question?

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva from Citigroup. Your line is open.
<Q - James D. Suva>: Thank you very much. I have two questions and I'll ask them both at the same time. First of all,
as you prepare for separation, and I'm sure the ERP or internal IT systems you have are preparing with a lot of effort
ahead of that. Are you going to have a need, to say, meaningfully increase your inventory just to make sure that one
system doesn't accidentally not talk to another system; or is that inventory management have already ironed out? And
then my second question is on the Affordable Care Act and the election, there has been a lot of talk about that and such
as well as costs going up and that. Can you help us quantify what that means to Xerox? Or do we know? Or with costs
going up, is that bad? Is that good? [indiscernible] (48:31) or is there no impact at all? Or how should we think about
the election and the Affordable Care Act of what's all going on in the news? Thank you.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Jim, I should take that. This is Ursula, even though I haven't spoken a lot today, and that's
actually a good feeling. I'll take this question. First, on the transition, and inventory, and how we're looking at that,
we're entering something – I talked about this in my prepared remarks – a phase that we call soft separation. And the
reason why that's important for investors is that it's a time that we can essentially practice, do a phased implementation
of all the complex separation activities and make sure that we don't stumble on when we're actually independent,
including things like the inventory management systems.
Independent of the soft separation, we would have very little problem with this area, but I think the soft separation
makes it such that we could actually double and triple check there. So I don't – we're not managing inventory any
differently than we normally would at the end of the year. All we're doing is making sure that as we do a separation we
don't have any fumbles, which we don't expect.
As far as cost and the impact – healthcare cost, the impact of ACA or any potential changes to ACA on our internal
cost in the marketplace, we actually just don't see any. Internal cost, we'll manager internal healthcare cost in the most
efficient way possible. I mean, we are a good healthcare provider, payer of services for our clients, our customers. That
won't change. And as far as the marketplace out there, we're not really seeing a big set of headwinds or change in the
market dynamics because of any potential changes for ACA. I hope I answered both of your questions.
<A - Jennifer Horsley>: Thanks, Jim. Operator, I think we have time...
<Q - James D. Suva>: Thank you very much.
<A - Jennifer Horsley>: Operator, I think we have time for one last question.
Operator
Thank you. Our last question for the day is coming from the line of Jamie Friedman from Susquehanna. Your line is
now open.
<Q - James Friedman>: Hi. Thank you. I just had a housekeeping question. Leslie, maybe if you could share with us
what the timeframe is from here? So I know you've filed the Form 10 and then an amended Form 10. Is there another
Form 10 coming? Maybe if you could just update us on the sequence as we go out?
<A - Brian Webb-Walsh>: Yeah. This is Brian. There will be amendment to the Form 10 today, actually, and then we
anticipate the Form 10 being effective in early November.
<Q - James Friedman>: Okay. And what is the anticipated date of separation?
<A - Brian Webb-Walsh>: End of the year is the anticipated date of separation.
<A - Leslie F. Varon>: Right, as it has been from the time that we started.
