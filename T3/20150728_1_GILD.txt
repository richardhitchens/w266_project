Bischofberger, Executive Vice President of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer.
Before we begin our formal remarks, let me remind you that we'll be making forward-looking statements including
plans and expectations with respect to our product candidates and financial projections, all of which involve certain
assumptions, risks, and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause our actual results to differ materially
from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in our latest SEC disclosure documents and recent
press releases. In addition, Gilead does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made
during this call. We will also be using non-GAAP financial measures to help you understand our underlying business
performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in our press release as well as on our website.
I would now like to turn the call over to John Martin.
John C. Martin
Thank you, Patrick, and thanks everyone for joining us today. Paul and Robin will elaborate on our commercial and
financial results in just a moment. I would like to first comment on our HIV and HCV development programs. Our
newest antiviral agent, TAF, which is under review as part of multiple products for the treatment of HIV has a superior
safety profile compared to TDF. This is important because most newly diagnosed patients will now be treated for
decades, and at the same time many HIV infected individuals who are in treatment, particularly in the US and Europe,
are advancing in age.
It has also become clear that upon diagnosis, HIV patients should immediately begin treatment. This point was driven
home by the presentation of the NIH-sponsored START study results last week at the International AIDS Society
conference called IAS in Vancouver and the concurrent publication of the results in the New England Journal of
Medicine.
The START trial was a two-arm randomized study in which patients with CD4 counts of greater than 500 were
randomized to immediate treatment versus deferred treatment until their CD4 count had declined to 350. The study was
stopped after it was apparent that there was a clear net benefit in the immediate treatment arm. For patients facing
decades of therapy, the profile TAF suggested that it will be viewed favorably as a new treatment option. We now have
three TAF-containing products under review, two single tablet regimens and a TAF and emtricitabine co-formulated
tablet.
Important data from Gilead Study 109 were presented last week at IAS. Study 109 is an open label clinical trial with
more than 1,400 virologically suppressed patients who were randomized to switch from a TDF-containing regimen to
E/C/F/TAF or to remain on their TDF-containing therapies. The study met its primary endpoint and showed statistical
superiority of E/C/F/TAF in terms of proportion of patients with HIV RNA less than 50 copies per mil at week 48. The
study also demonstrated statistically significant improvements in bone and renal laboratory parameters. E/C/F/TAF is
poised to be the first TAF-based regimen on the market with an FDA PDUFA date of November 5, and a regulatory
decision expected in Europe before year end.
Our second TAF single tablet regimen, R/F/TAF, was submitted for FDA review earlier this month. We are using our
priority review voucher, which shortens review by four months, and means an expected FDA action date in March of
2016. Submission of a regulatory filing application for R/F/TAF in the EU is planned for the third quarter.
In the developing world, more than 30 million people are living with HIV and nearly 8 million now receive TDF-based
treatment regimens. The switch data presented at IAS and the overall safety profile of TAF make it an important option
for these patients, and Gilead has already licensed the technology to our generic manufacturing partners with the goal
of expediting access as soon as initial regulatory approvals are received.
Turning briefly to HCV, since approval of SOVALDI in December, 2013, approximately 470,000 patients globally
have initiated treatment with SOVALDI or HARVONI. The rapid uptake and utilization of these medicines is a
testament to the fact that the real world safety and efficacy parallels the results obtained in our controlled clinical
studies. Three supplemental new drug applications for HARVONI were submitted to the FDA last quarter, each of

which has been granted priority review. If approved, these applications will expand the indicated use for HARVONI to
include HCV/HIV co-infected patients, patients with genotype 4, 5 or 6, and treatment experienced and cirrhotic
patients. A decision from FDA for each of these three SNDAs is expected by November 15.
In closing, I'd like to thank Gilead's dedicated employees for their tireless efforts and collaboration with our partners to
develop new therapies and deliver them to people around the world. I will now turn the call over to Paul.
Paul R. Carter
Thanks a lot, John. I'm pleased to provide an update on our commercial business which in the second quarter generated
$8.1 billion in worldwide net product sales. US revenue was $5.6 billion, a 7% sequential increase and a 16% increase
compared to the second quarter of last year. European revenue was $2 billion during the second quarter, up 8%
sequentially and more than 50% on a year-over-year basis despite the foreign exchange headwinds.
Beginning with hepatitis C. As John mentioned earlier, we're very pleased with the number of patients we're reaching
with SOVALDI and HARVONI, which are now approved in 51 and 40 countries respectively. Total HCV revenue for
the second quarter was $4.9 billion. In the US, HCV product revenue totaled $3.4 billion, with HARVONI representing
$2.8 billion of that amount.
In the first half of 2015, an estimated 130,000 US hepatitis C patients started treatment on a Gilead product, almost
matching the number of treated patients for all of 2014. While this demonstrates that improvements in access have been
made, there are still many more prescriptions being written than being filled. Following the nearly 70,000 patients in
quarter one, more than 60,000 additional patients started therapy on a Gilead hepatitis C product during the second
quarter. This represents a Gilead market share over 90% of all HCV patients with HARVONI alone representing
approximately 85% of all patients captured in the standard third-party tracking data.
We have also maintained our very strong position with US payers. As reflected by our formulary status across all payer
segments, 83% of genotype 1 patients have direct access to HARVONI, a percentage that has remained stable since the
first quarter.
In Europe, hepatitis C revenue was more than $1.1 billion this quarter with over 30,000 estimated new patient starts.
We saw particularly high patient initiations in Spain, Italy and Portugal in the second quarter. As one example of this,
SOVALDI uptake in Spain was driven by unprecedented regional access and a significant increase over historic
hepatitis C treatment rates. Additionally, HARVONI was launched in April and has surpassed the success of
SOVALDI, with more than 6,000 Spanish patients starting treatment in the second quarter.
We have seen a continued broadening of access and reimbursements across multiple European markets. HARVONI is
now reimbursed in four of the five big [ph] EU MAA (9:36) countries. And in France, we completed pricing
negotiations for HARVONI in June, opening access to all patients with a fibrosis score of F2 and to all HIV co-infected
patients. This is a broader group of patients than those previously treated under the French ATU or Early Access
Program.
Looking ahead, we're confident in the opportunities to reach more patients in Europe, including in the UK, where
SOVALDI reimbursement is expected to come online more broadly later this summer, and HARVONI will follow after
that. In both the U.S. and Europe, we're starting to see average treatment duration shortening. For example, fewer
patients are being treated for 24 weeks. And in the United States, approximately 40% of HARVONI use in quarter two
was for eight weeks. This is an encouraging trend as it suggests that payers should be seeing the value of earlier
treatment for appropriate genotype 1 patients and we believe this makes a strong case for payers to further ease
restrictions on patient access.
In the U.S., we saw an unusually large number of patient starts in the first quarter, reflecting warehousing of patients in
anticipation of access to HARVONI. In the second quarter we saw the number of total prescriptions decline from a
peak in the month of March, reflecting a smaller pool of patients who were in need of immediate treatment. When
thinking about hepatitis C patient numbers going forward, this market is still in its early days, with many patients

identified and waiting to be treated. As I mentioned earlier, many prescriptions go unfilled due to denials in the prior
authorization process. Going forward, we believe more payers will lower restrictions, allowing patients with lower
fibrosis scores to access treatment.
The increasing amount of real world data should reinforce the confidence that our highly differentiated products
provide high cure rates that are in line with our clinical trials. Additionally, we and others are increasingly active in
generating awareness of hepatitis C and communicating the benefits of hepatitis C testing and early treatment. We
believe our efforts are bringing in new patients to care and will do so in the future.
So while the number of new patients starting on treatment will continue to be influenced by the restrictions applied by
the payers, we see encouraging trends and remain highly confident, both for the remainder of this year and for the
long-term sustainability of the hepatitis C market in the United States.
In Europe, the dynamics of our hepatitis C business are defined by each country and their respective launch timings.
Like in the U.S., at launch, we've seen unusually numbers of high numbers of patients being treated as there has been
some warehousing and especially so for HARVONI GT1 patients. We also see a changing mix, as the high volume
southern European countries like Spain, Italy, and Portugal start to treat patients.
Our pricing arrangements took into consideration macroeconomic circumstances, hepatitis C prevalence and the
country's intent to increase treatment rates from past levels. As a result, we're likely to see a changing mix in patient
volumes as well as average selling prices over time. We recognize that there remains a huge unmet medical need in
Europe and that just a small fraction of diagnosed patients have so far been treated. As in the U.S., our European teams
are working hard to encourage diagnosis and increasing levels of treatment in the years ahead.
Turning to Japan. We are pleased with the initial introduction of SOVALDI for genotype 2 patients and excited about
the prospects for HARVONI in genotype 1. With the approval in July, we expect reimbursement for HARVONI to be
in place in Japan later this summer. There is consensus within the medical community that Gilead's medications offer
patients a simple and effective cure for hepatitis C. This is evident in treatment guidelines around the world and from
the real world data that have been and continue to be generated and presented and published in peer review forums. We
will continue to work to bring these treatments to more patients as quickly as possible.
And now turning to HIV. This quarter, HIV revenues increased 8% year-on-year to $2.7 billion, as our
TRUVADA-based regimens continue to hold their market leadership positions. In the United States, revenues were
$1.8 billion for the second quarter, showing sequential growth of 21%, mostly driven by the price increase on April 1
and favorable sub-wholesaler inventory levels following the draw down in the first quarter, as well as increased
demand. In the second quarter, we saw the big three wholesaler inventory levels remain at the bottom of established
ranges.
Underlying prescription demand remains strong for STRIBILD and COMPLERA, driving the year-on-year revenue
growth of 58% and 35%, respectively. Gilead's HIV medications continue to be prescribed for approximately eight out
of ten treatment-naïve patients initiating therapy. Six of ten patients initiated treatment with a Gilead single tablet
regimen, and our newest single tablet regimen, STRIBILD and COMPLERA, collectively captured five out of ten new
patients.
In Europe, HIV revenues were $742 million for the second quarter. Despite strong competition, volume has grown in
line with overall market growth. Overall sequential revenue growth declined due to the impact of negative foreign
currency movements net of our hedging activity. EVIPLERA and STRIBILD remained the most prescribed regimens
for naïve patients in the EU Big-5, and half of new patients started on a TRUVADA-based single tablet regimen.
EVIPLERA and STRIBILD also remained the most prescribed regimens for switch patients.
Looking to the future of HIV, John already gave a detailed account of where we stand on the regulatory front and
bringing our TAF-based treatments to market. And I can say that the Gilead commercial organization is focusing on
ensuring a successful launch around the world. We are excited to introduce the TAF portfolio of products to our
customers and to all the patients who can benefit from them. In closing, we are very pleased with the commercial
results for the second quarter.

And now I'll turn the call over to Robin.
Robin L. Washington
Thanks, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report solid second quarter results, with non-GAAP
diluted EPS of $3.15 for the second quarter, up 33% year-over-year. Total revenues were $8.2 billion, up 26%
year-over-year and 9% sequentially. Despite currency headwinds, net product sales for the quarter were $8.1 billion, up
27% year-over-year, driven by the launch of HARVONI across various geographies, continued growth of SOVALDI
outside the U.S. and increased sales of our newer HIV single tablet regimen.
Non-GAAP product gross margin was 90% for the second quarter of 2015 compared to 89% for the second quarter of
2014, benefiting from changes in product mix, including a year-over-year decline in ATRIPLA sales, which have a
lower margin.
Turning to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $702 million for the second quarter, up 30% compared to the
prior year due to the continued progression and expansion of our clinical studies, particularly Phase III studies in the
liver disease and oncology area. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $761 million for the second quarter, up 34%
compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase in our portion of the branded prescription drug fee and higher
costs associated with the growth of our business, including commercial expansion to support our HCV products.
Turning to our balance sheet, we ended the second quarter with $14.7 billion in cash and investments and generated
cash flow from operations of $5.7 billion. On June 29, shareholders received their first quarterly cash dividend of $633
million or $0.43 per share. Our Q3 2015 quarterly cash dividend of $0.43 per share was announced this afternoon.
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 9 million shares at an average price of $102.14, pursuant to our $15
billion share repurchase plan approved in January 2015. As of June 30, we have $14.1 billion remaining under the
current plan and remain active in repurchasing shares. Additionally, we utilized $3.9 billion in cash for the early
retirement of 46 million warrants, which will result in a third quarter decline in diluted shares outstanding of
approximately 25 million shares. Approximately 9 million warrants remain outstanding at the end of June.
Finally, we are updating full-year 2015 guidance, which is outlined on slide 46. The changes are as follows. We expect
product sales to be in the range of $29 billion to $30 billion, an increase of 18% to 23% over 2014. Our guidance for
product revenues is subject to a number of uncertainties, including inaccuracy in our estimates of HCV patient starts; a
larger than anticipated shift in payer mix to more highly discounted payer segments, such as PHS, FFS, Medicaid, and
the VA; the commercial launch of SOVALDI and HARVONI in Japan; the potential adoption in Europe of additional
pricing measures to reduce HCV spending; and the potential for continued volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.
Product gross margin guidance is now 88% to 90%.
We are lowering R&D expense guidance to be in the range of $2.8 billion to $3 billion, driven by cost efficiencies in
our clinical development activities and faster than expected enrollment of HIV and HCV studies. We are lowering
SG&A expense guidance to be in the range of $3 billion to $3.2 billion, primarily driven by the favorable one-time
adjustment to the expected invoice from the IRS for the branded prescription drug fee. Our tax rate is now anticipated
to be 17% to 18%. All other components of our 2015 guidance remain unchanged.
In summary, Gilead had another very solid quarter and we see strong prospects for the remainder of the year, with
higher than originally forecasted revenues and lower than originally forecasted expenses.
Thank you, and we look forward to updating you on our progress during our next call. We would now like to open the
call for questions. Operator?

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Geoff Meacham of Barclays. Your
line is now open.
<Q - Geoffrey Meacham>: Afternoon, guys. Congrats on the quarter, very impressive. Wanted to ask you an access
question about hep C from Paul. And I look on slide 25 and you've broken out new patients by fibrosis state, so I have a
couple of questions. One, what trends have you seen for F0, F1 patients? And then what could be the tipping point for
new starts for F0 or F1? And then how important is that in you guys' view in the durability for US sales? Thank you.
<A - Paul R. Carter>: Thanks, Geoff. Well, the data that we have is on intent to prescribe. We've seen that in this
quarter the data we have is – the intent to prescribe was about 55% of prescriptions were F0 through F2. Now, we
actually don't believe that nearly that many prescriptions were actually filled. By the way, the definition of intent to
prescribe is prescriptions that have actually been written, not necessarily filled.
So there's still a lot of restrictions in place in the United States, and I think this is the variable which really will
influence the number of patients that we see being treated or the rate of number of patients being treated in the rest of
this year and through the next few years. So clearly, what we're hoping is that those restrictions start to unwind
somewhat.
We are encouraged by a couple of things. So, we're encouraged that the number of people being treated for eight
weeks, genotype 1 patients has started to increase. That's now at about 40% of HARVONI prescriptions. So, that kind
of implies that less sick patients are being treated. And we also hope that that, as I said in my script, starts to provide
some encouragement to payers, in terms of value, as they think about curing patients. But we'll have to sort of wait and
see over time how these restrictions unfold. I do think that, as the market starts to become a bit more predictable now,
in terms of the numbers of patients coming through, that hopefully payers will feel more encouraged to sort of open the
gate slightly.
<Q - Geoffrey Meacham>: Okay. Thanks, Paul.
Operator
Thank you, and our next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Hey guys, congratulations on a monster quarter. If I may, John Milligan perhaps, three
pharma CEOs, companies with market caps in some cases smaller than yours have said something to the effect that
mid-cap biotech is priced to perfection. One even said it's in a bubble. The biggest question on everyone's mind for
Gilead is who you going to buy, who you going to buy, who you going to buy, who you going to buy. Every day, this is
what we talk about in investment circles. So I was wondering, A, if you could opine on the general state of valuations
in mid-cap, small and mid-cap biotech land, and B, just kind of give us an update about what you're thinking on
acquisitions. Are you ready to do them now? If so, would you be willing to do a series of smaller ones and would you
be willing to do for example a very large transformative type of deal? Thank you.
<A - John F. Milligan, PhD>: Okay, thank you for that one question.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Well I just followed Geoff's lead.
<A - John F. Milligan, PhD>: A couple of things here. So number one, we've talked about valuation in our industry
and we have seen a dramatic growth of the valuation of a lot of companies, certainly the small and mid-cap companies.
I have to say that has been accompanied by some really significant increases in innovation and some very interesting
and innovative products that have come along. And so I do think the innovation revolution that we are seeing has
driven greater value creation than we've seen in the past. And so it's a little hard to say that we're in a bubble when
you've seen such a dramatic shift in innovation and I ascribe a lot of that value that to innovation. So that's how I think
about yields currently.

The second thing I believe was about what are we going to buy. And I think I'm going to give you the answer that I
usually give, which is Gilead is in terrific shape. We've got a very strong work force. We've got a really strong balance
sheet. We have great scientific expertise on board and so that gives us the capability to do a wide range of things. As
you suggested, we could contemplate small deals. We could contemplate larger, perhaps even transformative deals, and
we are in a position of strength. We could be fairly selective in terms of the things that we'd like to do, and take our
time to make sure that those things that we do choose to do, we can execute on them fairly effectively, bringing new
products to market and continue to grow our top line revenue and EPS. And so we'll take all of those things into
account and obviously further than that I can't comment specifically on any kinds of targets. That would be
inappropriate.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Thanks for taking my one question.
<A - John F. Milligan, PhD>: You're welcome.
Operator
Thank you, and our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges of Bernstein. Your line is now open.
<Q - Geoffrey Craig Porges>: Thanks very much for the question, and echo the congratulations on the quarter.
Probably the most remarkable sort of guidance we've seen in a long time. I have a question for Paul on HCV. You've
treated roughly 300,000, well you and your competitors have actually treated a few as well, 300,000 patients in the US
over the last 18 months or so. And Paul, my question is, is the patient pool that is still to be treated being replenished by
new diagnoses or new patient identifications at the same rate as that 300,000 depletion or faster or slower than that
300,000. Thank you.
<A - Paul R. Carter>: Hey. Thanks, Geoff, for the question. The answer is yes, categorically. We have some
quantitative evidence and we have plenty of anecdotal evidence. So we talk to doctors the whole time and, physicians I
should say in the US, and all of them tell us that they have many patients in the queue, if you like, waiting for treatment
and really the barrier to them being treated is the restrictions that the payers are putting on.
We're also, ourselves and competitors, but also a lot of stakeholders, are working hard to encourage awareness of
hepatitis C, encourage testing, encourage people to think about how they link their status to treatment. And we do try
and measure that to some extent as well. So we do measure the number of patients that are coming from diagnosis to
under treated care, and our definition of that is people who have visited a doctor in the last 12 months with hepatitis C.
And we're seeing at a very stable rate actually around 30,000 a month moving under treated care. So that is the answer
why I gave you yes. We are filling that number I think quite consistently.
And as I said, we're doing a lot and it takes time for that to actually get traction on some of these things. We're doing a
lot of things now with a view to the longer-term future as well to really try and think about how do we increase
diagnosis rates. We've got about 1.6 million people in the U.S. diagnosed. We've treated, as you said, maybe 300,000 in
the last year or two. There's still a long way on diagnosed, but we're not resting on our laurels; we're thinking about
how do we start to increase those diagnosis rates as well.
<Q - Geoffrey Craig Porges>: Great. Thank you very much for the answer.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Matt Roden of UBS. Your line is now open.
<Q - Matthew M. Roden>: Hi, guys. Congrats on the quarter. I hope you can hear me okay. I seem to have some static
on the line.

<Q - Matthew M. Roden>: So I just wanted to ask about the product sales guidance. Nice beat and raise in the quarter
here. If I plug in your half-year sales of about $15.5 billion and look at your full-year sales guidance of $29 billion to
$30 billion, it seems to demonstrate that you're probably not thinking that hep C sales are going to sort of roll off a cliff
in the U.S. in the back half of the year. So could you talk a little bit more about your assumptions that went into your
sales guidance raise here for this year, in particular around the product mix and geographic mix? And then lastly, I
know you only provide guidance for this year's numbers, but anything you can share about your thinking on the outlook
into 2016 in terms of the mix to the extent you can. Thanks very much.
<A - Paul R. Carter>: Thanks, Matt. So very good question. Well, we don't think as many patients in the U.S. will be
treated for hepatitis C as in the first half. And the reason for that really is not that we feel that profoundly patient
numbers are being treated less and less, but that we did see a very big spike in quarter one, as I mentioned in the script,
because there was such a warehouse of patients waiting and people who really needed to be treated waiting for
interferon-free HARVONI to come along. And I do think that we should put it in perspective. HARVONI really did
change everything for patients waiting for treatment.
And to give some context to that, in quarter four last year Gilead treated about 45,000 patients. In quarter two we've
just had, we treated over 60,000 patients. So I know that's only two data points, but that's a 40% increase in patients. So
we don't feel that the overall trend is this market is going down and down. But we did have this very big spike in
quarter one and we don't see that that's going to be repeated in the U.S. during the rest of the year.
And we're still subject to how the restrictions by payers play out in the rest of this year. So I think we've been fairly
conservative in our view. We also have the VA situation, which is well publicized, where the VA is depleted of funds
at the moment. We've already seen VA purchases drop off towards the end of quarter two. Our assumption is that those
purchases will start to come back again when their bucket of funds gets filled, hopefully from October. So we've taken
that into consideration.
And then outside of the U.S., we've got various dynamics going on. And as I said, country by country in Europe we're
launching HARVONI. And we are seeing, somewhat like the U.S., a kind of early spike in volumes as these people
who are very sick and really need immediate treatment do get treated. And then it starts to stable off. We also see in
Europe budget ceilings. The level of treatment in some of the countries is so high at the moment that we do recognize
that budget ceilings may be reached and we're taking a fairly conservative view of that as well.
Then we have Japan, I've touched on. We're off to a good start there, but still a lot of uncertainty as to how our launches
go, although we're very encouraged. SOVALDI, of course, it's the only product interferon-free for GT2 patients.
HARVONI has had incredible 100% SVR clinical data to support its filing for GT1 patients. And we should hopefully
get pricing agreed in the next couple of months. So we're excited about Japan.
But I think overall we're taking a fairly conservative view. The U.S. is still the big market for us and we're recognizing
that the second half is probably going to be smaller than the first half. That's kind of how we're thinking about it.
Going into 2016, we hope all the effort that we're putting into increasing diagnosis, increasing linkage to care start to –
we're calling it linkage to cure now, because our SVR rates really are so high in real life – start to play out. And we see
there's still a lot of patients in the U.S., in Europe, around other countries in the world to be treated. We've only touched
the top of the iceberg. And I should mention countries like Canada, Australia, some of the Asian countries that will be
coming on-stream in the next year or so.
<Q - Matthew M. Roden>: Great. Thanks very much and congrats.

<Q - Michael J. Yee>: Hi. Thanks. Congrats. Just to follow up on a couple of these things. I guess taking a step back,
should the takeaway be that U.S. patient treated continue to get a bit smaller here over the next few quarters, but it's
offset by O-U.S.? And to get people comfortable with the U.S., where do you think it starts to stabilize or bottom out?
Where do you get comfort with that and then start to pick back up? And to that, is Medicaid a big part of that? I know
that you were talking about Medicaid state contracts. We know that those started to come on and haven't really heard
much about that. But we know that's a big part of the population. So with those contracts, where is that in all of this?
And where do you think U.S. can start to stabilize and then stop declining? Thanks.
<A - Paul R. Carter>: Yeah, thanks, Mike. So we don't know for sure yet whether the U.S. is actually stabilized. But
we have a sense that directionally it will stabilize and it will start to grow as payer restrictions start to get loosened up. I
mean, we feel very clear about that. We mentioned the VA just now. I mean the VA should start to come back
on-stream I think in the fourth quarter. And we will see a gradual shift of mix of payers in the US I think slightly
towards the public payers. Year-to-date we're about 70/30 public and Medicare, sorry, private and Medicare to the
public payers. And we would anticipate that might grow to 60/40, let's say, in the second half of the year. So, I'm not
sure I've answered your question, really, but.
<Q - Michael J. Yee>: Well, I guess, the Medicaid population, yeah.
<A - Paul R. Carter>: Yeah, the Medicaid population will start to come on. Our competitors have exclusive access to
some Medicaids, we have to others. HARVONI is, patients in Medicaid, around about 34 states have signed deals with
us to make HARVONI available. That's about two-thirds of the patients covered by Medicaid. So we're getting
reasonable access there. And, as I said, I think that mix will start to shift very slightly towards Medicaid during the rest
of the year.
<Q - Michael J. Yee>: Okay. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Matthew Harrison of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
<Q - Matthew K. Harrison>: Great. Thanks for taking the question. So, I guess I wanted to ask a little bit more about
the access expansion that you've talked about in the US. What's the biggest hold-off in the access expansion? Obviously
you've put rebates in place. It sounds like you've put a lot of ways to help people and plans, whether it's eight weeks or
things like that to help them expand access. So what is stopping them? And are there any things that you can do? Or I
guess, what's your confidence that just taking a little bit extra time will allow them to expand access?
<A - Paul R. Carter>: I think our confidence is high, Matthew, that restrictions will start to loosen up. The question
really is how long will that take. And I think real world evidence is a great help there. So as I said a couple of times, we
are seeing numerous studies now being published and presented which demonstrate that real world data matches, or
even is better than our clinical data in some cases. So I think this gives payers a level of confidence that an expensive
investment is worth making. And I think that will start to play out. I think also, the patient stories and their families'
stories really do resonate very strongly. And when people hear of friends and relatives who have been cured in a very
simple way, and in some cases in as short as eight weeks, that is a very strong message and a great encouragement.
We are hearing stories, as I'm sure you are, that some patients are actually taking legal action against their insurers
because their insurer's not paying for them, paying for their treatment, despite the fact they're insured. So I think there's
just a whole lot of things gradually put pressure on, and as I also mentioned earlier, not least, as we start to get into a
slightly more predictable environment without big spikes of patients that just immediately need treatment and
warehousing and so on, once we get to a more predictive situation, this kind of works with the models of the private
payers and hopefully again, they'll feel more confident in opening up restrictions.

Thank you and our next question comes from Phil Nadeau of Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.
<Q - Phil M. Nadeau>: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just a specific question on the gross to net
adjustment on the HCV franchise. On the Q1 call, you highlighted the fact that it had not fully adjusted during the
quarter. In your prepared remarks this quarter, you suggest that the full effect of the payer contracts is being felt. But
based on your last comment, it does sound like you're still going to get more of an adjustment in future quarters
because of public pay becoming a bigger portion of reimbursement. So, could you kind of discuss where we are in the
evolution of gross to net? Is this quarter's run rate good for the second half of the year, or is there still more of an
adjustment to come? Thank you.
<A - Robin L. Washington>: Phil, this is Robin. I would say this year, as Paul articulated in his script, we do feel like
we got more towards what we'd expect with having a full quarter of the contract in place and that impact on the gross to
net was probably the biggest adjustment that got to near the point estimate that we talked about at the beginning of the
year which we don't necessarily want to repeat. I would say also, as Paul mentioned, you can expect a little further
adjustment based on the payer mix going into the second half, again going from 70/30 to 60/40. But for the most part, I
think you're at a stage where we don't anticipate significant changes quarter on quarter at this point at all to the gross to
net.
<Q - Phil M. Nadeau>: Okay, thank you. That's very helpful.

Thank you, and our next question comes from Cory Kasimov of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
<Q - Cory W. Kasimov>: Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just following up on Phil's gross to net question.
Would you expect to go through another round of payer negotiations upon the potential approval of Merck's regimen
early next year?
<A - Paul R. Carter>: Hi Cory. I'll try and answer that one. So we have agreements in place, and I think if we look at
all the lives in the US, about 96% of lives now that are covered have been agreed, and HARVONI has access to 83%,
either as an exclusive or a parity access. I would take the opportunity just to emphasis yet again that Gilead does not
believe in exclusive access. We believe in physicians and their patients having the right to prescribe whatever they
want to prescribe and not being kind of dictated to by payers.
So certainly we're not aiming to establish any more kind of exclusivity in a competitive way. So we have agreements in
place with most of the payers. Most of those agreements are multi year. We hope that we can compete on our products
and we think that's the way it's going to be, but we will defend our market share vigorously. We have competed before
where the competitors wanted to compete on price and I think the results speak for themselves. So we will consider
every scenario and be ready for it.
<Q - Cory W. Kasimov>: All right, great. Thanks and great quarter.

<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just to focus on something different, in the
oncology area you have Celgene and AbbVie being very aggressive in the blood cancer space with acquisitions, and
you've also mentioned I think many times probably about thinking about immuno-oncology. Just wondering how
aggressive do you think you have to be in oncology to compete? And do you think, I think you said before blood cancer
is crowded. Do you think it's more likely you could go in a solid tumor direction and how are you thinking about blood
cancer versus solid tumor in the new competitive landscape? Thanks.

<A - John F. Milligan, PhD>: Hey Robyn, it's John Milligan. Yeah that's a good question, how aggressive do you
want to be in this certain area. So it is, been fascinating, again the rate of innovation that we've seen in the blood cancer
space and it has gotten extremely crowded, leaving fewer opportunities I think for new products or follow-on products
to make headway into this area. So it has gotten quite crowded. So we are broadening our criteria for the things that we
would be interested in and are looking at a wide range of things.
I think you mentioned immuno-oncology specifically. We've not called that out specifically as an area of interest, also
partially due to how crowded it is. It's certainly in the PD-1, PD-L1 space, but it wouldn't keep us from thinking about
areas that were novel and that could provide further benefit to patients in those areas. I don't know on what scale we
can talk about aggression, but I do think it's clear we're going to be active and we'll be open to opportunities that can
benefit our portfolio in the best way we think is possible.
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger, PhD>: Yeah, Robyn. I would also like to point out that we are pursuing solid tumors.
We have our MMP9 antibody in gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer and then the lung and pancreatic and lung cancer. So
there is of course evidence that these compounds do have effects on myeloid-derived suppressor cells, which is in a
way immuno-oncology as well.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Skorney of Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.
<Q - Brian P. Skorney>: Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess just looking at
SOVALDI, it looks like it's a pretty big quarter in the U.S. that didn't quite match up the with prescription data relative
to the last few quarters. So I was just wondering if you could give any color. Is there some source of SOVALDI
revenue that isn't getting captured in there or are there any one-times last quarter or this quarter that we need to keep in
mind? And also, I'm just curious if there is a specific mid-cap company who you think's roll in the biotech innovation
wave that you mentioned is maybe underappreciated by the public markets?
<A - Paul R. Carter>: I just heard the SOVALDI question. So I don't think there was anything particular about the
SOVALDI. There was a tiny little bit of inventory growth. SOVALDI seems to be pretty stable at this point in terms of
patient numbers. So, I don't think there was anything special about SOVALDI, Brian.
<A - Patrick O'Brien>: Okay, and in terms of your question on undervalued small and mid-cap stocks, I'm not in the
business of giving stock tips to folks. So, I think I will continue to decline that.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
<Q - Terence C. Flynn>: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Maybe just a two part from me. So first, it just looks like,
if we take sales divided by the patient numbers in the US, looks like average price per patient was higher this quarter
versus last. I was just wondering if that's simply a mix question, meaning more SOVALDI patients versus HARVONI?
And then the second question was just, as we think about 5816 Phase 3 data now, just how to think about positioning
there relative to SOVALDI? Would you guys pull SOVALDI from the market or would you keep it on the market?
And then anything to think about on pricing? Thank you.
<A - Paul R. Carter>: Yeah, Terence, the first question on, it's a mix is the answer to your question. And I'll hand you
over to Norbert.
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger, PhD>: And Terry, with regards to 5816, one clear opportunity is here, treatment of
genotype 3 patients. There's still an unmet need. You might have seen that Velpatasvir in combination with Sofosbuvir
got approved a few weeks ago and the response rate, while substantial there, suboptimal, in particular in cirrhotic

patients. They have response rates or SVR12 rates of about 60%. So that's clearly an unmet need. But we're also
looking at other genotypes. And with regards to SOVALDI, no, we would absolutely not pull SOVALDI from the
market. SOVALDI still has a lot of value in sub-population and in use with other agents like Daclatasvir, Simeprivir, et
cetera.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Ying Huang of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
<Q - Ying Huang>: Thanks for taking my questions as well. And it was a good quarter. So first of all, can you talk
about Europe? Do you think the growth could be meaning a bottleneck as restricted by the governments' budget process
in the second half and also next year? And then secondly, your competitor AbbVie commented on the earnings call that
they think the U.S. GT1 patients being treated will be annualized at about 175,000 to 180,000. Do you agree with that
view or do you think you are going to see a actually higher number of patients being treated in the U.S.? Thanks.
<A - Paul R. Carter>: So, let's just deal with the U.S. patient number question. I think that we feel that the AbbVie
number is a little bit low. We're fairly confident – and this depends somewhat, as I said, on the payers in the second
half of the year, whether they open restrictions further or not. And it also to some extent makes some assumptions
about the VA coming back on-stream. But we see no reason why there shouldn't be 250,000-plus patients treated in the
U.S. next year. That's total patients, not just GT1, and it's total patients, not just Gilead's share. We've said in the past
and I think we still feel this, that the capacity in the U.S. to treat HCV patients is around 300,000. We have no reason to
believe it would be higher than that at this point. So I think in the years going forward, we'll see 250,000 to 300,000
patients being treated in the U.S. And that will ebb and flow somewhat, but the main variable will be restrictions by
payers.
And then the European question. Well, I said that the agreements that we had made with European governments take
into consideration ability to pay. And that's defined by some of the macroeconomic metrics on countries by the
prevalence of HCV in those countries, but probably most importantly by the political will of those countries to increase
treatment rates above historical levels. And so we've worked with them to agree a kind of volume-based rebate
structure that encourages a high number of patients to be treated. And we are seeing those coming and executing now.
And as I said, in southern Europe, Italy, Spain, Portugal, we're seeing a substantial number of patients being treated.
We're also very aware of the fact that these countries' single payer systems do have finite budgets. And the countries
have made great efforts to increase those budgets to treat more patients because they do see the value of treating their
hepatitis C patients. Whether we hit those budgets or not, I can't predict at this moment. But one thing's for sure, that
either at the rate of patients being treated, they'll either have to slow down somewhat in some of the countries or they'll
have to increase their funding over the next couple of years if they want to keep treating at the rate they're doing.
But anyway, we're greatly encouraged that a lot of patients are being treated and we're greatly encouraged that the real
world data really supports that investment in treating patients. And we hope that will encourage further increases in
budgets.
<Q - Ying Huang>: Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from John Sonnier of William Blair. Your line is now open.
<Q - John S. Sonnier>: Hey. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a really nice quarter. The question is for
Paul. With Japan coming online, can you talk a little bit more about the HCV market opportunity there? And I'm
particularly interested in how the pricing mechanism works and whether or not there's any statutory discounting
downstream or based on volume? Thanks.

<A - Paul R. Carter>: Hi, John. Yes, so Japan is an exciting opportunity for us. And as you may know, it's the first
product we've launched in Japan. So on the back of this, we're actually establishing or have established our Japanese
entity and we hope that that entity will be a platform in the future for us to launch a whole series of future products, not
just in the hepatitis C space. So it's exciting.
We've launched SOVALDI for GT2. We launched that late in May, the 25th of May we got pricing agreement and
launched. And it's got off to a good start, although it's extremely early days. There are around 200,000 GT2 patients in
Japan who are diagnosed and, as I already mentioned, have really no interferon-free option other than SOVALDI. So
we're very happy to be able to help meet that unmet medical need.
We're working to agree pricing on HARVONI. We should have that agreed fairly soon. And we're confident that will
be a happy outcome for everyone and we shouldn't have any delays in launch.
There are no statutory discounts on pricing in the first years. There is a statutory system. And it's typically 2% to 5%
discounts every two years or so that we've seen historically. And we would envisage that that would happen. There's
also a mechanism whereby you have to forecast your revenues going forward and there is a system of capping prices
based on whether you go through that ceiling that you've sort of self-agreed. So there are mechanisms, but there's no
discounts per se on a day-to-day basis and we wouldn't expect any discounts on SOVALDI or HARVONI, at least for
the first two years.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Jason Kolbert of Maxim Group. Your line is now open.
<Q - Jason Wesly McCarthy>: Hi. This is Jason McCarthy for Jason Kolbert. Congratulations again on another great
quarter. My question is, in terms of building the market for HARVONI in the U.S., how do you see, and I know it's
been discussed before, the cost cutting insurance carriers and discounters like Express Scripts trying to control pricing
and how that could have impact, the growth of HARVONI going forward?
<A - Paul R. Carter>: Well, I think we have to just stand back and look at our product and recognize that there's an
incredible amount of value and an incredible amount of innovation, first of all in SOVALDI then HARVONI, and then
in what we're calling our wave 3 and wave 4 products, and I think it's that innovation that is our negotiation strength,
really. And I think all payers would like fundamentally to make highly innovative medicines that work incredibly well
available to their patients.
And so we have to negotiate and come up with terms that work for both sides, but we're very optimistic and we work
very hard to keep good contacts with the payers across the U.S. to make sure that they're fully aware of what's coming
next, and making sure that we're all on the same page. And so I think we're quietly confident that we can continue to
have strong and good relationships and high levels of access to all of our medicines, and especially our next HCV
innovation.

<A - Robin L. Washington>: Sure. I mean, [indiscernible] (55:01) year-on-year basis and it, both of SG&A and R&D
kind of increased. And again the R&D was driven by just continued acceleration of our pipeline, but as we always do,
and look, we've had really good enrollment levels with those trials. So as we looked at our out year or our second half
guidance, we were able to trim it back again, still making progress but doing it even faster than we had initially
thought.
On the SG&A side, the one big adjustment that you saw Q1 versus Q2 related to the branded prescription drug fee. The
rest is really just related to the ongoing commercial advancements that we're making. Paul talked about the launch in
Japan. The other launches is ex-US as well as just the direct to consumer investments that we're making. Even with all
of those as we looked at our guidance, again we've always been focused on conscious expense management and ended
being able to do a little bit better than we thought, and it's reducing the guidance. The most of the SG&A reduction was
related to the one-time adjustment in the branded prescription drug fee.
<Q - Alan Carr>: And then with respect to a longer term trend here, do you expect this to continue at these levels into
2016 or 2017, and any reason to believe it will be any dramatic growth here or that it might come down?
<A - Robin L. Washington>: That's a good question. I mean we haven't really given long-term guidance. I mean I
think overall, relative to our launches, we'll continue to expand geographically which will drive some of the cost, and
as Paul articulated, we're focused a lot on bringing additional patients to care and looking at linkage to care. I don't see
that being major incremental steps up in terms of SG&A, so there's no significant trend different than what I'd say. But
I am hard pressed to kind of give you too far a look forward without providing additional guidance. Relative to R&D, I
think we've always take an approach that we'll advance things in the clinic as it makes sense, right. We feel good with
the level of spend we have today, but we're very optimistic about our pipeline, so you could see absolute dollars go up.
Where that falls relative to percentage of revenue is something that'll be to be determined as we provide guidance in
2016 and beyond.
