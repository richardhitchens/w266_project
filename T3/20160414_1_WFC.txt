John G. Stumpf
Thank you, Jim. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today.
Our performance in the first quarter once again benefited from our diversified business model and our continued focus
on meeting our customers' financial needs. While the persistent low rate environment, market volatility and continued
weakness in the oil and gas industry provided some near-term headwinds, our long-term results continue to be driven
by our focus on the real economy. For example, we are the largest lender in the U.S., and our loan and deposit balances
are at an all-time high.
We continue to grow our customer base, both organically and through acquisitions, and February was the strongest
month for retail bank household growth in five years. We work to make every relationship, new and existing, a lasting
one, and our focus on providing outstanding customer service was recognized with Wells Fargo ranking number one in
customer loyalty among large banks in the 2016 Customer Loyalty Engagement Index conducted by the firm Brand
Keys.
Let me now highlight our results in the first quarter. We generated earnings of $5.5 billion and EPS of $0.99. We grew
revenue compared with a year ago by 4% with growth in both net interest income and noninterest income, and our
pre-tax, pre-provision profit grew 5%. Average loans grew $64 billion or 7% from a year ago. Our deposit franchise
once again generated strong customer and balance growth with average deposits up $44.6 billion or 4% from a year
ago, and we grew the number of primary consumer checking customers by 5%.
While deterioration in the oil and gas portfolio drove a $200 million reserve build, the rest of our loan portfolio
continued to have strong credit results with our total net charge-off rate remaining near historical lows at 38 basis
points annualized, reflecting the benefit of our diversified loan portfolio. Our strong capital position enabled us to
acquire assets from GE Capital, and we returned $3 billion to our shareholders through common stock dividends and
net share repurchases in the first quarter.
As you know, yesterday, the Federal Reserve and FDIC announced their response to the 2015 resolution plan submitted
by eight banks, including Wells Fargo. While we were disappointed to learn that our submission was determined to
have deficiencies in certain areas, we are focused on fully addressing these issues as part of our 2016 submission.
Turning to the economic environment, while signs of economic uncertainty remain in the global economy, as well as
volatility in the capital markets, the U.S. economy, which is the primary driver of Wells Fargo's results, continues to be
resilient. For example, while low energy prices have negatively impacted the oil and gas industry, the U.S. is still a net
energy importer, and the benefits of falling prices have outweighed the cost for consumers and most businesses.
Job creation in the U.S. remains robust with 2.7 million jobs added over the past year alone. Consumers have also
benefited from low interest rates and modest borrowing. In fact, servicing financial obligations require just 15% of
household income at the start of the year, more than a percentage point lower than the long-term average and several
percentage points lower than what the pre-recession level was in late 2007. The housing market continues to do well
with steady gains in sales, construction and prices. This improvement has continued to benefit our consumer real estate
portfolio, where net charge-offs were down 41% from a year ago. Commercial Real Estate also remains strong with
vacancy rates low in apartment, industrial and retail sectors, and our CRE portfolio continued to generate net
recoveries.
So while the start of 2016 has shown that the economic recovery remains slow and uneven, we remain focused on the
long-term drivers of our success, namely increasing customers, loans, deposits and building capital. This unwavering

focus on our diversified business model positions us well to benefit from future growth opportunities.
John Shrewsberry, our Chief Financial Officer, will now provide more details on our first quarter results. John?
John R. Shrewsberry
Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. My comments will follow the presentation included in the quarterly
supplements starting on page two. John and I will then answer your questions.
We had another quarter of solid results. We have now generated quarterly earnings of more than $5 billion for 14
consecutive quarters, one of only two companies in the country to do so, demonstrating the strength of our diversified
business model and our consistent risk discipline. While earnings declined from year ago, our results from the first
quarter last year included a discrete tax benefit of $359 million or $0.07 per share and a $100 million reserve release.
Our results this quarter included a number of noteworthy items. Our revenue benefited from the previously announced
sale of our crop insurance business, resulting in a $381 million gain recorded in all other noninterest income. All other
income also included $379 million of hedging effectiveness primarily on our own long-term debt hedges, reflecting the
impact of lower rates and foreign exchange rate fluctuations during the quarter. We would expect the hedging
effectiveness to be neutral to our results over the life of the hedge relationship, but the impact in every quarter will
vary.
We had $124 million of other than temporary impairment, OTTI, in our debt and equity securities related to oil and gas
in the first quarter. The deterioration in the oil and gas portfolio drove the $200 million credit reserve build in the
quarter also. I will get into more detail on oil and gas later in the call.
Expenses included $752 million of seasonally higher employee benefit expenses from higher payroll taxes and 401(k)
matching, as well as annual equity awards to retirement-eligible team members. Our first quarter results also included
the GE Capital acquisitions we completed during the quarter.
On page four, we show that strong year-over-year growth John highlighted, including increases in revenue, pre-tax
pre-provision profit, loans and deposits.
Turning to page five, let me highlight a few balance sheet trends. Investment securities declined $12.7 billion from
fourth quarter as we paused most of our purchase activity due to the volatility in the bond market. We had $5 billion of
gross purchases during the first quarter compared with last year's average of $26 billion per quarter. Long-term debt
increased $28.4 billion with $23.8 billion of issuances including $11 billion raised in advance of closing the GE Capital
acquisitions. We also assumed $3.6 billion of debt from previous GE Capital securitizations. Short-term investments in
fed funds sold increased $30.4 billion, reflecting growth in deposits, long-term debt, and our disciplined approach in
managing liquidity and investment securities during the quarter.
Turning to the income statement overview on page six, revenue increased $609 million from the fourth quarter with
growth in both net interest and noninterest income. I will highlight the drivers of this growth throughout the call.
As shown on page seven, we had continued strong loan growth in the first quarter, up 10% from a year ago and 3%
from the fourth quarter. Commercial loans grew $31.6 billion from the fourth quarter, including $24.9 billion from the
GE Capital acquisitions and broad-based organic growth. Consumer loans declined $923 million from the fourth
quarter as growth in first mortgage loans, auto, and securities based lending and student lending, which more than
offset by reductions in junior lien mortgage and seasonal declines in credit card. Our total average loan yield increased
eight basis points from the fourth quarter, reflecting the GE Capital acquisitions, as well as the benefit of floating-rate
loan repricing.
We added a total of $30.8 billion of loans and leases from the GE Capital acquisitions. The benefit of our strong
balance sheet and industry expertise enabled us to add these high-quality businesses, including talented new team
members and valuable customer relationships. This is our largest acquisition since 2008. The integration is on track and
we continue to expect it will be modestly accretive in 2016. We completed the GE Railcar Services acquisition on

January 1, which included $918 million of loans and interest-earning leases, and $3.2 billion of operating leases
reported in other assets. Most of the revenue from this business is reflected in noninterest income as lease income.
On March 1, we acquired the North American based portion of GE Capital's C&I loans and leases, which included $24
billion of loans and interest-earning leases, and $2.7 billion of operating leases. The remaining $2 billion of assets is
expected to close in the second half of the year. The loans and leases we acquired were marked to fair value under the
purchase method of accounting, so there was no associated allowance added as result of these transactions.
Slide nine highlights our broad-based loan growth. C&I loans were up $50.5 billion or 19% from a year ago driven by
the GE Capital acquisitions and broad-based organic growth. Core 1 to 4 family first mortgage loans grew $17.3
billion, or 8% from a year ago, and reflected continued growth in high-quality nonconforming mortgage loans.
Commercial real estate loans grew $15.8 billion, or 12% from a year ago, benefiting from the second quarter GE
Capital acquisition and organic growth.
Auto loans were up $4.3 billion, or 8% from last year. We've consistently grown this portfolio in the upper single-digits
over the past year, reflecting the strong auto market while we've remained disciplined in our approach to credit and
pricing.
Credit card balances were up $3.1 billion, or 10% from a year ago, reflecting new accounts and increases in the active
accounts. Other revolving credit and installment loans were up $2.7 billion, or 8% from a year ago, with growth in
securities-based lending, personal lines and loans and student loans.
As highlighted on page 10, we had $1.2 trillion of average deposits in the first quarter, up $44.6 billion, or 4% from a
year ago. Our average deposit cost was 10 basis points, up 1 basis point from year ago and up 2 basis points from the
fourth quarter. This slight increase in deposit cost reflected an increase in deposit pricing for some wholesale banking
customers. We continue to believe that deposit betas will be lower during this rate cycle than they have been in past
periods of rising rates, especially if the outlook for future rate increases remains uncertain.
Page 11 highlights our revenue diversification. Our revenue continued to be relatively balanced between net interest
and noninterest income. We grew net interest income $79 million from fourth quarter, reflecting growth in earning
assets including the partial quarter impact from the assets acquired from GE Capital, the benefit from higher short-term
rates, and disciplined deposit pricing.
These increases were partially offset by reduced income from variable sources, including periodic dividends and loan
fees and one less day in the quarter. The net interest margin declined 2 basis points from the fourth quarter with lower
variable income. All other growth and repricing were essentially neutral to the NIM.
We grew net interest income in the first quarter by 6% from a year ago, and continue to believe that we can grow net
interest income on a full year basis in 2016 compared with 2015 even if there are no additional rate increases.
Total noninterest income increased $530 million from the fourth quarter, driven by the increase in all other noninterest
income that I highlighted at the start of the call. Noninterest income also benefited from the increase in lease income
related to the GE Capital acquisitions we completed in the quarter, which also included related lease depreciation
expense.
The linked quarter increase in trading gains was due to higher customer accommodation trading results across our
markets businesses. The volatile markets we experienced in the first quarter impacted our trusted and investment fees,
which declined $126 million from the fourth quarter. We also had lower debt and equity investment gains, down $281
million from the fourth quarter.
While linked quarter trends in deposit service charges and card fees were negatively impacted by seasonality, both of
these fees grew 8% from a year ago driven by account growth. Mortgage banking revenue declined $62 million from
the fourth quarter.
Origination volume was $44 billion, down 6% from the fourth quarter due to seasonality, but purchase originations
were up 13% from a year ago, reflecting a stronger housing market. Applications were up 20% from the fourth quarter

and we ended the quarter with a $39 billion application pipeline, up 34% from the fourth quarter. We expect origination
volume to increase in the second quarter, reflecting normal seasonality and strength in the housing market.
Our production margin on residential held for sale mortgage originations was 168 basis points in the first quarter, down
15 basis points from the fourth quarter due to a higher mix of corresponding originations in the first quarter. Releases
of our mortgage loan repurchase liability declined $107 million from fourth quarter, which also contributed to lower
production revenue.
Servicing income increased $120 million from fourth quarter from higher net MSR servicing hedge results and lower
unreimbursed servicing costs.
As shown on page 14, expenses increased $429 million from fourth quarter. As I highlighted at the start of the call, the
increase was primarily driven by $752 million of seasonally higher personnel expenses in the first quarter. While we
will not have the seasonally higher personnel expenses in the second quarter, there are certain expenses that will
increase, including salary expense reflecting annual merit increases, which became effective late in the first quarter,
and certain expenses that are typically lower in the first quarter such as outside professional services and advertising
costs which are also expected to increase.
We had $454 million of operating losses, primarily driven by litigation expense in the first quarter.
Now that the FDIC has issued their final rule, I want update you on the expected impact of the FDIC surcharge that I
mentioned on our call last quarter, which is lower than we previously expected. We currently estimate that the
surcharge, along with a previously approved base rate reduction, will increase our total FDIC assessment by
approximately $100 million per quarter starting in the third quarter of 2016.
Our efficiency ratio was 58.7% in the first quarter and we currently expect to operate at the higher end of our efficiency
ratio range of 55% to 59% for the full year 2016.
Turning to our business segments starting on page 15, Community Banking earned $3.3 billion in the first quarter,
down 7% from a year ago due to the discrete tax benefit we had in the first quarter of 2015 and up 4% from the fourth
quarter. We continue to successfully grow Retail Bank households and increased our primary consumer checking
customers, which were up 5% from a year ago.
This growth along with increased usage and new product offerings benefited our debit and credit card businesses. Debit
card purchase volume was $72.4 billion in the first quarter, up 9% from a year ago and credit card purchase volume
was $17.5 billion, up 13% from a year ago. Customers are increasingly using our award-winning digital offerings with
digital active customers up 6% from a year ago, including 17.7 million mobile active users with continued double-digit
growth in mobile adoption.
Wholesale Banking earned $1.9 billion in the first quarter, down 3% from a year ago and down 9% from the fourth
quarter. The decline was driven by the higher provision expense in our oil and gas portfolio. Revenue grew 6% from
the fourth quarter, with growth in both net interest and noninterest income. This growth was driven by the gain on the
sale of our crop insurance business and the benefit of the GE Capital acquisitions. Investment Banking declined on
overall market weakness, and some of our commercial real estate-related businesses had weaker results coming off a
very strong fourth quarter performance.
Loan growth remains strong, driven by acquisitions and broad-based organic growth, with average loans up $49.8
billion or 13% from a year ago, the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth. Average deposit
balances declined $3.7 billion from a year ago, reflecting lower international deposits from market volatility and the
competitive rate environment.
Wealth and Investment Management earned $512 million in the first quarter, down 3% from a year ago and down 14%
from the fourth quarter. Year-over-year results reflected strong balance sheet growth, with net interest income up 14%,
offset by the impact of weak equity market conditions on fee income. The decline in linked-quarter results was
primarily driven by seasonally higher personnel costs. Balance sheet growth remained strong, with average deposits up
8% from a year ago and loans up 13%, the 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year loan growth, with

continued growth in nonconforming mortgage loans and securities-based lending.
We have successfully completed our recruiting of financial advisors pursuant to our agreement with Credit Suisse. We
were able to recruit substantially all of the advisors that we targeted. We are pleased with the success we've had with
recruiting these financial advisors and look forward to their contributions to our continued growth in Wealth
Management.
Turning to page 18, credit results continued to benefit from our diversified portfolio, with only 38 basis points of
annualized net charge-offs. Net charge-offs increased $55 million from the fourth quarter, including an increase of $87
million from our oil and gas portfolio.
While our oil and gas portfolio remains under stress due to low prices and excess leverage in the industry, the rest of
our loan portfolios have performed well. Nonperforming assets increased $706 million from the fourth quarter. We had
$1.1 billion in higher oil and gas nonaccruals and $343 million of nonaccrual loans from the GE Capital acquisitions,
which was within our acquisition underwriting assumptions. These increases were partially offset by lower residential
and commercial real estate nonaccruals and lower foreclosed assets.
As I mentioned earlier, we had a $200 million reserve build during the quarter, as continued improvements in our
residential real estate portfolio were more than offset by higher oil and gas reserves. Since first quarter 2015, we have
released $1.8 billion of allowance that was allocated to our residential real estate portfolios while providing $1.4 billion
of additional allowance allocated to our oil and gas portfolio, demonstrating the advantage of our diversified loan
portfolio. The total allowance now stands at $12.7 billion.
Slide 19 highlights the characteristics of our oil and gas portfolio, which is less than 2% of total loans outstanding. We
had $17.8 billion of oil and gas loans outstanding at the end of the first quarter, up $474 million from the fourth quarter,
including $236 million in loans acquired from GE Capital. The remaining increase was driven by utilization of existing
lines, primarily in the E&P sector.
The composition of our portfolio has remained relatively stable, with 55% of our outstandings to the E&P sector, 21%
to midstream, and 24% to service companies. Approximately 7% or $1.2 billion of our outstandings are to
investment-grade companies based on public ratings. However, there are other factors that are important to consider
when assessing the quality of these loans.
Our loans are primarily to middle market companies that we know well and have worked closely with across cycles. Of
the approximately 100 bankruptcies that have occurred in the industry since the start of 2015, only 11 of our borrowers
have filed during that time. Our outstandings also included $819 million of second-lien and $374 million of mezzanine
loans.
Our total oil and gas loan exposure, which includes unfunded commitments and loans outstanding, was down $1.3
billion or 3% from the fourth quarter, with declines across all three sectors. This decline reflected reductions to existing
credit facilities in part from spring redeterminations and net charge-offs. Approximately 34% of our unfunded
commitments were to investment-grade companies, as their line utilization is generally lower. In addition to our
exposure to oil and gas in our loan portfolio, we also had a total of $2.4 billion in our securities portfolio.
Slide 20 highlights the credit performance of our oil and gas portfolio as we worked through this cycle. The sector's
performance has been driven by a number of factors that cumulatively have impacted loan quality. In addition to low
oil and gas prices, cash flows and collateral values have been impacted by reduced production, runoff of hedges, and
limited additional cost levers. Reduced access to capital markets has also impacted borrowers' financial condition. As a
result of these factors, we had $204 million of net charge-offs in the first quarter. There were no losses from the
midstream sector during the quarter.
Non-accrual loans were $1.9 billion. We reviewed our loan portfolio on a loan-by-loan basis and placed loans on
nonaccrual status when the full and timely collection of contractual interest or principal becomes uncertain, and loans
are written down to net realizable value when appropriate. Approximately 90% of the nonaccruals were current on
interest and principal. Payments received on these loans are applied to reducing principal, which decreases future

losses. Substantially all of our nonaccrual loans are senior secured.
Given the conditions in the industry, criticized loans, which include nonaccrual loans, increased to 57% of the
portfolio, reflecting continued downward credit migration. This migration reflects changes in the borrowers' financial
condition. Reflecting the downward credit migration, our allocated allowance for the oil and gas portfolio increased
$504 million to $1.7 billion. This portion of the allowance was 9.3% of total oil and gas loans outstanding. But as I've
noted before, the entire $12.7 billion allowance is available to absorb credit losses inherent in the total loan portfolio.
Turning to slide 21, in addition to building allowance for our oil and gas portfolio, we continue to focus on other areas
where the trends in the oil and gas industry may impact performance as we manage through this cycle. For example, we
have assessed regions of the country and have been monitoring 15 regions in eight states where greater than 3% of
employment is directly tied to oil production, and are also monitoring performance in Houston and Alaska, neither of
which have 3% of employment directly tied to oil production.
We're tracking changes in outstandings, utilization, delinquency rates, FICO scores, and LTV migration across our
consumer portfolios in these regions. And having outperformed the rest of our portfolio for the past several years,
consumer delinquencies in oil-dependent regions have increased and are roughly in line with the performance in
non-oil-concentrated communities. We currently anticipate further deterioration. And while we remain committed to
serving our customers, we've tightened our underwriting standards across our consumer portfolios in oil-dependent
regions.
We are also actively monitoring commercial real estate exposure on a loan-by-loan basis in geographies highly
correlated to the oil and gas industry. Our CRE and energy management teams are working closely together and
coordinating monitoring activities. Our total exposure is manageable, and these loans are generally structured with
significant cash equity and various other credit enhancements.
In summary, we are actively monitoring the impact from the disruption in the oil and gas industry in all areas of our
business, and we're working closely with all impacted customers. We've increased the size of our workout team, and
the senior members of our credit team are devoting significant time to monitoring our exposures. We've started the
spring redeterminations and are decreasing borrowing bases. We're proactively reviewing credit agreements and
modifying credit terms and commitment amounts accordingly.
While the level of losses we have in our oil and gas portfolio will continue to be impacted by the volatility and stress in
the industry and it will take time to move through this part of the cycle, the experience of managing through many
cycles will continue to be beneficial to our overall performance.
Turning to page 22, our capital levels remain strong, with our estimated Common Equity Tier 1 ratio fully phased-in at
10.6% in the first quarter, well above the regulatory minimum and buffers and our internal buffer. Our strong capital
generation positioned us to deploy capital for the assets acquired from GE while continuing to return capital to our
shareholders. We issued 35.5 million common shares in the first quarter, reflecting seasonally higher employee benefit
plan activity. But we still reduced our common shares outstanding by 16.2 million shares through share repurchases of
51.7 million shares. Our net payout ratio was 60% in the first quarter.
In summary, our first quarter results demonstrated the benefit of our diversified business model as we continue to
produce strong financial results in an environment that included some near-term headwinds. Our consistent focus on
executing on our vision continued to benefit our fundamental drivers of long-term growth, including adding customers,
loans and deposits while maintaining our strong capital position. We look over to providing you more details on the
strength of our business model while highlighting the quality of our team at our Investor Day on May 24.

[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Thanks. Good morning, guys. How are you? Just on the reserving and energy question, thanks for
the color, John. It seems like you've had a little bit more of the acceleration that was seen so far of those who have
reported as far as the actual losses and the reserve build as well. How do we just get the understanding from here of the
kind of pace of potential reserve additions? And then underneath that, are we effectively at the point where many
benefits from lingering consumer reserve have kind of moved past? Thanks.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: On the second part of your question, it's tough to say. Yeah, we are analyzing the reserve
every quarter, and to the extent that there's continued improvement in consumer real estate in particular, it's certainly
possible that, that produces incremental benefit that absorbs some of what's happening on the oil and gas side. That's
been true for a while, and it may continue to be true for a while. Housing has been strong and that's – that doesn't feel
likely to reverse its course right now. But again, we'll know at the end of the quarter.
With respect to the pace or the trend of incremental reserving throughout the year, we're – we've – we're constantly
reassessing borrower quality. We're doing a semiannual borrowing base redetermination on E&P loans. We are in the
middle of the spring redetermination period right now, call it 20%, 25% have been completed, so we'll have the rest of
that information. That's name-by-name, capital structure by capital structure, so that will continue to inform things.
And we've definitely taken steps or, for example, categorized loans as nonperforming even if we haven't completed
their spring redetermination. But my sense is there's more information there.
So this is going to go on for a while. We're in the $40 context today. We were in the $30s for a while. Some of these
capital structures just need to be restructured. That will take some time, and my assumption is that we're going to be
talking about this all year. I don't know that we'll continue to reserve at this pace all year, because we feel great about
our reserve at the end of the first quarter and it reflects everything that we know, but I'd be hesitant to tell you that this
was the big quarter or this was the quarter. But things will unfold as they are going to unfold depending on what
happens with prices, both spot and forward, and the pace of restructuring of services and E&P companies.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: So, Ken...
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Yes.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: ...I'd just like to remind you, and I mentioned that residential real estate losses were down 41%
year over year and I think that sometimes goes a bit unnoticed. When we went into the downturn, we had over $100
billion of Pick-a-Pay loans and over $100 billion of home equity loans, and those were the two toughest residential
portfolios. Today, those portfolios are less than half of what we started with, and the performance is really, really good.
So there's a lot of momentum on that side that has been – that's happened over the last few years, but especially in the
last year or two years.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: That's a fair point, John. Thanks for that. And just one follow-up on the redetermination and the
structuring. John, how far ahead can you get of redetermination? I get your point that we're only 25% through the
spring, but have you already been able to get ahead of that just in terms of anticipation or you can only make those
adjustments when we get there? And then also, with the price back up, do we go into spring redetermination using the
$40 plus starting point or do you still end up being much more punitive in terms of how you discount and how you
redetermine?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: I think that the price deck for this cycle is – the front month is more in the mid-$30s
context. And it's a curve that you're using, not just the spot price, but it's – we're probably 20% lower across the – our
price deck curve in the spring versus where we were six months ago. And believe me, that's not the only item that
impacts the outcome. It's what's been going on with incremental exploration, what are the reserves in terms of quantity,
and a variety of other things. But in terms of getting in front of it, as I said, we're categorizing loans as nonperforming.
We're recognizing loss.
These loss determinations, the $200 million that we've taken, that's our own credit folks determining that there's
something to be done. It's not as a result of a final resolution or a workout or the completion of a bankruptcy plan, and

Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Hi. I'll switch it up. In terms of net interest income, John, how much have you
benefited from the December hike in the first quarter? Have all the variable loans repriced and will it be additional pull
through benefit from that December hike into the second quarter?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: So our estimation is that we've gotten the full benefit of the December rate hike and the
benefit on the asset side, the cost on the liability side. We talked about the impact on deposits, which has been
negligible. And so I think that's in the run rate at this point.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay, and then a question for John Stumpf. What's the market like, John, for
additional portfolio purchases? That's part one. And then part two is in terms of broader M&A, because of your size
and favored nation status, you're the kind of preferred name for news reporters and others that speculate on M&A for
big financial companies. And since a lot's changed around the environment in the last few years, can you just remind us
your strategy around M&A? Maybe how it's different than when you were smaller, and how Dodd-Frank and Too Big
to Fail might affect your view on acquisitions going forward?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Sure. As you probably know, and those who know us well, 97% of the revenue we produce is
from U.S.-based customers, consumers, small businessmen and women, middle market large customers. And while we
love our International business, it's mostly in support of our U.S.-based businesses. And we have leadership positions in
most of the businesses in which we do. And we don't set out to be number one just to be number one. We work really
hard, and if we do, really, we provide great products and services and great value. We grow because of that. There's a
couple of areas where we are sub-optimized that we are working hard to grow. One of those, I think the most attractive
area would be the area that David Carroll runs in Wealth Investment Management. You heard me say a number of
times where we have 11% of the deposits or so in the country and just a fraction of that in terms of wealth assets here.
Even though we have a powerful, wonderful group of leaders and advisors across the geography, we could still do a lot
more business. There's a lot of our customers who call us their bank who have their wealth away. So we're working
hard organically. That business has been growing double digits. If there was an opportunity to add something in that
area that would make sense, terrific. If there's not, that's also terrific.
On the consumer side, we have leadership in terms of distribution of our online activity, of our checking activity, our
debit activity, but not our credit card activity, even though we've grown that significantly, internally. About over 43%
of our customers who have their primary account here have a credit card, but that's an area that would be opportunistic.
We've been doing a great job organically. If there'd be some opportunities along the line that would make sense, we
would surely consider that. But I would think of it this way, John. I would think of it that we have all that we need right
now, and if something became available that we thought would be a bolt-on that would help us in those areas
specifically, but other areas generally, sure, we'd look at that. But that's – our focus right now – our best opportunity to

Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR & Company. Please go ahead.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Thank you very much. A lot of clients – a lot of questions that I've been getting is that, yeah,
energy, a lot of people might be reserved good for energy, but the second or third derivative of energy – energy was a
lot of the growth of this economy over the last year or two years – and since energy is starting to struggle, that the
economy is going into a recession. I know you've heard of it, but what are you seeing on the second and third
derivatives on the credit book? Are you seeing any real deterioration in CRE markets in some of these areas like Texas
where probably energy's hit them the hardest?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Sure. So as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, in the consumer portfolios, all of them,
we're going MSA by MSA and comparing the performance of our borrowers in the areas that are highly levered to
energy. The greater than 3% employment is one measure that we use, but we've also included Houston, for example, to
your point about Texas being hard-hit, even though it doesn't qualify with the 3% employment trigger.
And what we've discovered is, is those areas have been performing better than average for a long time, no surprise,
because that's where all the growth has been coming from, and they're starting to look more average. So whether it's
measures of delinquency, in some cases, measures of LTV based on what's changing in asset values, they look a little
bit more average. So it doesn't feel like it's a, at least at this point, that it's another shoe to drop in the short term. But as
you expect, less employment, people will – loans will perform differently. And commercial real estate, which is where
we have a big presence, we've recently done a deep dive in Texas in particular, and office vacancies are somewhat
higher in the Houston area, no surprise, I think about 20% including sublease space.
Multifamily is a little bit weaker. And so we're looking at that, first and foremost, frankly, with respect to what it means
to our risks, to our loan portfolio, and feel fine about what our exposures are there. But those are things that those
regions are going to have to grapple with. So when it comes to growth rates or people who have more concentrated
exposures than that, that probably is the first second-order outcome that people are going to have to look out for.
More broadly speaking, I think we still feel we're in a 2% environment. There are obvious pockets of strength around
the country, but when you move out of oil and gas, we're in the same low growth, better consumer, strong employment
environment that we've been operating in for a couple of years. Not enough to make it feel like rates are going to move
as a result of it, but not enough to feel like we're stalling either.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Paul, if I could just give you an anecdotal, I lived in Texas for six years in the mid to
late-1990s, so 20 years ago. And there was a period of time there where there was volatility in the oil and gas space,
and there were some challenges. And I have been back. I was just in Houston last week and I had been back a number
of times in the last year, and things do feel different 20 years later. It's a much more diverse economy. And if you take
– with Texas generally, but Houston specifically, and it feels different this time around. Downturns are always hard.
Volatile markets always have an impact. But this feels different this time because of what the state has done to
diversify their economy.

<A - John G. Stumpf>: Hi, Erika.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: So my first question is actually a follow-up to John's question. My conversations with
investors have often paired Wells, just to be frank, with either large credit card companies or there's clearly the rumor
for Wells potentially buying a large investment bank, which you formerly denied. As we think about what you were
saying, John, about looking at bolt-on opportunities, should we think about the deal size as sizes that are manageable
enough that maybe sort of the real stop here is Wells Fargo not moving up the SIFI surcharge? As we think about the
opportunity for nonorganic growth, should we think about sort of the hard stop in terms of size being that you would
like to keep your SIFI surcharge where it is today?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Erika, here's how I think about it. I'd think about Wells Fargo as an organic growth company.
We have – I've been here almost 35 years, and I've probably been involved in – if there's 250 acquisitions we've done
with all different companies as we've come to the modern Wells Fargo, I've probably been involved in half of those just
because it happened during my career time, and they're hard to do. There's a lot of work in those things, and we now
have a company that is the best company I have ever worked for, the strongest brand, the best people, the furthest
reach, the deepest relationships, the long-enduring customer things, so – and we are very, very careful buyers.
And I see a lot of opportunity to grow, as I said, organically. If something – and what we've done in the last four or five
years have been largely bolt-on. I would say GE was a bigger, a little bigger bolt-on, but those are the kind of
opportunistic things that make sense for our team, for our customers, and ultimately, for our shareholders. After all, this
is your money, our investors' money that we are the stewards of. So it would be out of character for us to do something
that would be – have a high degree of risk and a low degree of shareholder reward on it. That's just not who we are.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Thank you, John. That was very clear. My second question is just looking to capital return.
Since you've been CCAR participants, it seems like your GAAP earnings volatility is the least among your large peers.
As we look forward – obviously, you can't tell us about this year's CCAR submission – but as you look forward, how
are you feeling about potentially continuing to push on that 30% dividend, implicit dividend ceiling?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: It's hard to comment on that during the middle of the CCAR cycle, but I admire you for
asking.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Good morning.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Good morning, Matt.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: I just want to delve into a couple of potential earnings levers going forward. I guess
the first one would be as we think about the liquidity that you've built since you chose not to reinvest as much in the
securities book. How are you thinking about that pool of funds going forward? There are not really any signs that rates
are going to rise materially as we think about market rates. We're obviously off the bottom, but what's your approach to
managing that liquidity from here?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: So it will be informed week-by-week, quarter-by-quarter as we assess the likelihood of
increases in both short and consequently, long-term rates. We won't sit idly on continuous increases in cash forever.
We're going to have to put some of it to work. We are very cautious about what it means entering at these levels in
terms of capital impact in the future. If a subsequent rate rise does occur, that's obviously a big issue for us. And we
would like to be smart about our entry points, but if we're going to hover in the 170 basis points, just to pick a number
on the 10-year, and with mortgage rates where they are, then there will be some amount of redeployment. We'll
probably talk about it a little bit more at Investor Day, but it was really the abrupt market volatility that happened after
the first of the year that caused us to say let's take a pause here and figure out where this is going to settle out. It

happens to have settled out not much above the low points, at least again on the 10-year from January or early
February. But that is an earnings lever when and if we redeploy.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: And then just separately on the expenses, maybe just talk about, is there any kind
of change or even tweak on the approach to expense management given maybe weaker revenues and some of the
ongoing pressures in energy likely lingering?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yes, there is a continuous drumbeat and a high level of vigilance around how we spend
all of our business-as-usual types of dollars. We're constantly trying to find levers and ways to be more efficient to
streamline, to make things consistent. We've provided some examples of that in the past in certain areas. At the same
time, we've talked about the investment that we're making in technology, the investments that we're making in product
capability, the investments that we're making in risk management and compliance and being a better firm. Those are
going to be elevated for some time, and they have been for some time.
We're still comfortable in our 55% to 59% range, which is where we've guided. I don't need to remind you, but that is a
very attractive level for a firm of our size. We think we're pretty lean overall. But it's because we take this seriously day
in and day out, looking for ways to be efficient.

Your next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura. Please go ahead.
<Q - Bill Carcache>: Thank you, good morning. Of your borrowers who drew on their oil and gas lines this quarter,
was there any notable deterioration in their credit profile? I was just trying to understand the extent to which heightened
degrees of financial stress is a factor leading your borrowers to draw down on their lines. And although you mentioned
that your current reserve reflects everything that you currently know today, I was wondering how you're thinking about
the probability that more and more of your unfunded exposure will eventually become funded as we move deeper into
the credit cycle.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Sure, that's a good question. And of course, we absolutely have to make estimates about
what we think the exposure at default would be for any borrower who's got a remaining unfunded commitment. That's
how the process works. In the quarter, there were some of these what you might characterize as defensive draws that
we observed, not that many of them. You can see the increase in the total outstandings in oil and gas rose by about
$400 million. And about half of that was from, frankly, leases that we picked up from GE that have a credit mark in
them, incidentally. So it really didn't amount to that much, but it is a phenomenon that we've seen, that we've read
about. It isn't having that big of an impact today. But we do think that we're capturing that risk as we assess what the
appropriate size is of our allowance for both funded and unfunded commitments in this space.
<Q - Bill Carcache>: So when I guess a previously unfunded energy loan commitment becomes funded, how does that
transition from unfunded to funded impact, your allowance? I guess I think generally the reserve rate on unfunded
commitments is lower than it is on funded commitments, but I was trying to understand the reserving dynamics there of
shifting from one book to the other.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Sure. So in the calculation of the allowance and the migration of credit that leads up to
whether we consider a borrower relationship to be nonperforming or what status we're marking it, we're imagining on a
credit-by-credit basis what the exposure at default would be, meaning that it could be greater than the currently
outstanding amount. That's a part of the loan-by-loan process, analysis-by-analysis that we do when building it, when
re-rating loans every quarter and building up for the allowance. So there's some estimation of what today is currently
unfunded will become funded in the future.

<Q - Bill Carcache>: Okay, thank you. And if I can just ask a final follow-up, can you discuss whether the
methodology underlying your energy reserve is based more on the ability of borrowers to repay their loans through
cash flow generation, or is it more reliant on collateral coverage based on reserves on the ground? There are some
reports suggesting that regulators are less happy with collateral coverage, and I was wondering if you could speak
specifically to the approach that Wells Fargo has taken.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: It's a combination of both, and they're highly correlated for E&P companies in particular.
But it's their sources of repayment, both principal and interest in full and on time, and we're taking into account our
projections of their cash flows, and we're taking into account our projections of the value of collateral that we might
have to liquidate in order to get paid back, or that they might have to liquidate in order to pay us back.

Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kevin J. Barker>: Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. I just want to switch gears here and look at
your auto exposure. You're obviously one of the largest auto lenders in the country, and you've grown that portfolio by
roughly 30% over the last three years. Given what we've seen in the industry and some deterioration in the subprime
portfolios, could you help us get an understanding of what your expectations are through the rest of this year and into
2017 given the state of the auto industry and how hot it's been over the last couple of years?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Sure. I think we've been pretty public with the fact that we are going to hold our ground
with respect to what we think our quality loan terms and borrower profile. And we've actually seen our share slip a
little bit as the overall size of the auto finance market has kept pace with the sale of autos, new cars in particular that
has been at a record level now for a few years. And we were number one, I think we're number two right now. And
we're bidding on and buying the loans that we like at terms that we think are good risk/reward, and we're passing on
those that we don't.
Some of the things that feel a little bit different right now, seasonally obviously we're in a better place in Q1 than Q4
just because those loans behave that way. Collections and losses are lower in the first quarter than they are in the fourth
quarter. Things are a little bit elevated first quarter to first quarter. But we're still from a risk-adjusted basis well within
the bands to which we underwrite each level of credit risk in autos that we buy. We've always had our eye on the
elevated level of used car auction prices. The Manheim Index in particular is evidence that we point to, to get a sense
for whether loss given default is going to be worse in the future than it is today or in the recent past. And that index has
been down I think 3% linked quarter, 2% year over year. So all things being equal, we'd expect severity to be a little bit
worse when repossessions occur.
But having said that, we're still not in a bad place. We've allowed our market-leading position to slip a little bit, let
other people buy the loans that don't make sense for us. It's still a great business for us. It has been for a long time. We
work very closely with dealers. We have a big floor plan business. We have a big Commercial Banking business with
the dealership community, and we're in this for the long haul.
One more thing I guess we've observed is because the ABS market has been under pressure, some of the probably most
aggressive players in the subprime space have a little bit of a funding challenge I think in this environment that may
soften things up a little bit. Those are my current observations.
<Q - Kevin J. Barker>: So just to follow up on that, are you seeing better risk-adjusted returns in subprime auto
versus prime auto right now, and are you growing the subprime auto portfolio at a faster rate?

<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: No, we've held the line. Using our own approach to what a subprime borrower and
subprime deal is, we've limited ourselves to at about 10% of our originations, which has amounted to about 10% of our
outstandings that we'd consider to be subprime. There's often an opportunity to grow that if we wanted to. We've
chosen not to. And we like the risk/return that we get in where we choose to participate in that space. It's performed
very well. It's priced for the risk. And frankly, it doesn't compete directly with some of the specialty finance companies
that are in that space. They tend to be a little bit deeper and they're running a different business.

<A - John G. Stumpf>: Hey, Joe.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Hi, Joe.
<Q - Joe Morford>: I guess first just a quick follow-up on Ken's question at the outset. I was curious how much the
increased oil and gas reserving or provision this quarter can be attributed to the Shared National Credit exam.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: I'd say very little. And the exam came and went and I think it worked out fine. There
weren't a lot of disagreements on how we rate loans. And also the guidance around leverage levels, et cetera, was
introduced, and that didn't have much of an impact either. This is just – these are our folks using consistent
methodology, making determinations on when loans should be nonperforming, when we should take loss, et cetera.
<Q - Joe Morford>: Okay, that's very helpful. Thanks. I guess the other question was I just wondering if you could
talk a bit more about how the GE Capital business integrations are going and how you're feeling currently about the
potential for cross-selling or revenue synergies. And also just wondering if you can quantify the impact we may see in
the second quarter from a full run rate of the expenses.

<Q - Joe Morford>: Okay.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: But we're – is a big opportunity. So this is early stages. This is an important and big
integration, so it will take a full year to get where we need to go and to transition all of the services away from GE and
over to Wells Fargo and get things running. I'm happy to say that the early reports are that we're doing great with
customers and team members, who I think we imagine that there's a real opportunity with these customers.
These are businesses where GE has been an absolute leader and they've done that with credit. So, now, we've got that
credit capability and that credit willingness and the perfect business model for that, but we also have all of the other
Wholesale Banking products and services, Wealth Management services, et cetera, to bring to bear on this client group.
So it will take a while to work with each relationship and find out what they're doing that might be done at Wells Fargo
in addition to their credit, but my sense is that we'll get great adoption over time, and that's part of what makes it such a
high value opportunity for Wells Fargo.
<Q - Joe Morford>: Okay, thanks so much.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: You bet.

Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
<Q - John Pancari>: Good morning.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Hey, John.
<Q - John Pancari>: Just a couple more questions on energy and then one on expenses. On energy, what percentage of
that $1.2 billion in second lien exposure that you provided is nonperforming? Do you have that?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Let's see, $113 million of the combined second-lien and mezzanine today is categorized
as nonaccrual.
<Q - John Pancari>: Okay, all right. And what is your energy criticized ratio as of March 31? I know last quarter it
was 38% approximately.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: It's 57% now.
<Q - John Pancari>: Five-seven?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Five-seven.
<Q - John Pancari>: Okay.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: And that reflects the environment that we're in. That reflects what's going on with the
stress of the borrowers. That migration is what leads us to provide more reserve.
<Q - John Pancari>: Okay. And then through the 25% of the spring redetermination that you completed, what's been
the average reduction in borrowing base that you've seen?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: I guess I'd start by saying that 50% – 60% have actually had a reduction in the
borrowing base, a quarter had no change in the borrowing base, and the balance actually had an increase in the
borrowing base because of more reserves that were included in the borrowing base. And without getting too specific on
the amount of the reserve for people who had a reduction, it was relatively significant and frankly reflected the curve
that we're using today versus where we would have been a quarter ago.
<Q - John Pancari>: Got it. Got it, okay. And then lastly on the expense side, could you just give us a little more color
on why the incentive comp increased as much as it did this quarter, particularly on the backdrop of some of the revenue
headroom?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Sure, yes. It's not really incentive comp so much. Think about FICA resetting in the first
quarter, contributions to our 401(k) happen in the first quarter. And then for people who are retirement-eligible who –
there's lots of people at Wells Fargo who get an annual equity incentive as part of their pay. For most people, it vests
over a few years and the impact bleeds in over the vesting period. If you're already retirement-eligible, it all hits in the
quarter that it's granted because it's immediately vested, and that's why the first quarter has that extra input.
<Q - John Pancari>: Okay, thank you.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: But it's not so much about – commission and incentive are a piece of it, but it's reflects
the actual business activity that's happening.
<Q - John Pancari>: Okay, thank you.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yes.

<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Hi, good morning.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Hi.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Good morning.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Good morning, Betsy.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: A couple of questions. One, and I'll get the energy one out of the way first. So I think
you mentioned 25% of your loans went through the redetermination process in the quarter, is that right?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: That's just where we happen to be today for the spring redetermination. The rest of them
are underway.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Oh okay.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: It's a borrower-by-borrower analysis.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: So as of the ones that finished during the quarter, how much incremental reserve was
required? Is that what drove the reserve up?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: What drives the reserve up is our categorization of the loan as generally speaking as
nonaccrual or nonperforming, meaning that we think there's a chance that we won't get full and a timely repayment of
every dollar of principal and interest. That can certainly come about in connection with the redetermination, but it can
come about for other reasons as well just in terms of our review of the company's overall performance, the value of
their collateral, what their prospects are.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: So is it...
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: So, it's not really a linear, but you can't really draw a line between the redetermination
and – specifically and the change in reserves.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Okay. It could have some impact, but not...
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: It would definitely have an impact. If we reduce somebody's availability and if they were
drawn above their availability, and we actually had a moment of reckoning where they have to write a check, that will
accelerate that analysis because they'll have something that they have to do right then and there. There aren't that many
instances of that.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Just that as we go through the rest of the 75% of the redetermination for this spring
that could drive some more incremental reserve requirements.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: It could. I mean, we're – it could. We capture a lot of that in our general assessment in
our risk rating before having the actual results of the redetermination, but it certainly could.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Okay. And then, just a question on rates in balance sheet, so you brought down Fed
funds a bit, is that right?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Actually, we're up. We're $30 billion higher in cash and cash equivalents at the end of
the quarter because we were less active in the bond market.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Right. And that was mostly because of your view on rates and where you wanted to
reinvest.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yes.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: So, a 25 bp increase in rates today, are you in a more asset-sensitive position now
because of that?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: I think that's right. True.

<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Okay. Any sizing or...
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: No. But we are more asset-sensitive as a result. We also have more long-term debt that
came under in the quarter, right, which – so there's a handful of things going on at the same time. But at the margin,
we're probably a little bit more asset-sensitive.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Okay. And then on the redeployment into securities, I know you might want to have
a higher rate to redeploy into. But is there a point where you say, you know what, I wanted to but it's been 1.7% for
five, six, seven, eight months, whatever it is. I'm going to start to redeploy some of my cash into longer-duration paper.
I mean, can you just give us a sense as to how you think about that?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: That is the discussion that we're having regularly in our ALCO meetings with the board,
et cetera. My sense is that in this low rate environment, we'll probably not go as far out in terms of duration, so that we
were taking less capital risk even though the dollar-for-dollar return would be a little bit lower. But it's the trade-off
between forgone earnings, capital sensitivity, and a handful of other things that we're having to asses, and we're doing it
with our best estimate of where we think rates are going and what happens if they don't go there.
And so the long and the short of it is I don't think that we're going to continue to build cash balances like we did in the
first quarter, but we're reassessing everyday to make a determination on at what entry point and at what point in the
curve we're interested in putting on more duration risk.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Okay, got it. Thanks a lot.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yes.

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Hey, Mike.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: Hi.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Hi, Mike.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: Hey. How much did the GE acquisitions add to EPS this quarter, and what do you expected to add
for the rest of the year?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: So we're not breaking out what it added during the quarter and what we're saying is we
think it will be modestly accretive for the rest of the year and it's about what it costs to transition people, technology,
premises, et cetera, throughout the remainder of the year. We'll update that as we move along and we've got more
information about how those costs are actually coming in and being spent. But I'll tell you that the average asset yield
for those assets is – reflects the same kind of loan mix that we have in Wholesale Banking in general and the
expectation once they're fully integrated and we finished our process is that they will carry the same type of efficiency
ratio as the average wholesale lending business.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Actually, Mike, in the first quarter, it was a little bit – a couple of moving parts here. We
actually, if you will, pre-funded the liability side, meaning that we raised debt to fund this and that was on the books at
the start of the quarter. And most of the loans only came on March 1, so there's a lot of stuff going on in the first
quarter.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: But there's one months' worth of...

<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: One months' worth of really – revenue, if you will.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: So three months of funding, one month of revenue. So you'll see the full benefit in the second
quarter. I was just wondering if you could size that a little bit more.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: We're talking about $30-ish billion worth of assets and the same type of loan yields that
we have on average in wholesale, which gets you to a revenue number. What we're not specifically breaking out is
what the expense impact is until we understand what the full integration expenses are, but you'll see $300 million, $350
million per quarter of NII from the loans and leases themselves.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: And how much of that did you have in the first quarter, the $300 million, $350 million?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: So, as John said, we had one month of the revenue side of it. We had not quite three
months' worth of the funding cost because we weren't fully funded for those months, but more than one month's worth
of funding cost. How about that?
<Q - Mike Mayo>: Okay. And then separately, John, did I hear you correctly? You said benefits of falling oil prices
offset the cost. I think you said that at the start of the call.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Since we're still a net importer of energy and what's interesting, Mike, is that much of
those savings at the consumer level have been saved, if you will. They're not yet been spent, so not all of those savings
at the pump. What consumers have done, and not exclusively, but they're saving more of that what's happening at the
pump as opposed to spending it.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: Okay. And how do you see that? In other words, when oil prices go down, the stock market
declines, bank stocks sell off, and you're saying the market's wrong with that. What do you see in your business that
you think maybe the market has wrong how they think about oil prices?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: I've long stopped trying to figure out the market and why bank stocks seem – or stocks
generally seem to move in concert with commodity prices, especially oil prices. But be that as it may, the consumer –
much of this economy, 60%, 70% is consumer-based in retail and the consumers have never been in better shape.
I mentioned in my comments, just the debt service requirements are 15% of their earnings, wages are starting to go up a
little bit, and we're seeing savings rates go up. These are some of the strongest savings rates we've seen in some time. I
don't know if that's a statement about confidence or whatever, but there's – it's – consumers are benefiting from putting
– filling their tank at $1-something a gallon or $2 a gallon versus $3 or $4, and not all of it has been spent.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: And then the last question, if you could, just give us a sneak preview of the investor conference.
What do you hope to achieve at the investor conference, and do you think you'll have a director show up again at it?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Thank you, Mike, for reminding everybody of that. Steve Sanger, our Lead Director, showed
up last time. Obviously, we invite our directors and I'm – just give me a chance to invite all of you. It's on the 24th of
next month. It's a Tuesday. We have an exciting day to share with you. We'll get fairly granular about how we think
about distribution, how we think about our businesses. It will give us a chance to showcase next-generation leaders in
the company. So we're looking forward to it.
We also will think about guardrails around our three big metrics that we talk about: ROA, ROE and efficiency ratio.
We might talk about that. So it's a bunch of things. And also, everybody talks about fintechs and clearly, there's a good
reason for that. I think our company, specifically in our industry generally, have been innovators for a whole long time.
So if we weren't, we'd have stagecoaches on the freeway right now. And we'll talk a little bit about that.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: All right, great. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Thanks very much. There has been some recent media attention to the build-out you've been
doing in some of your advisory and capital markets capacities and I'm wondering what's your – how you view that now
in light of, of course, the broader marketplace for those services, which may be under some pressure and then also the
fact that your exposure specifically to the energy industry within those business lines was a bit higher than peers. Is that
changing your interest in investment in those areas?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Not really. The pattern has been the same since the merger of Wells and Wachovia to
make sure that we've got the right level of capability for capital raising and advisory activity and hedging and risk
management activity for our corporate and commercial customers and other customers of Wells Fargo who need it.
We think our risks are well sized. We think our capabilities are well sized. As you pointed out, there are things to add
here and there, but from a return point of view, from an ability to service our customers point of view, we like the
trajectory we've taken. That's why it's so easy to respond pretty quickly when people speculate that we might be
thinking about adding an investment bank to our mix or something. That's not what we need. What we need is what we
have today and more great people like it to serve more customers, but we're not thinking much differently about it.
Our results frankly were – we think they're pretty good in the first quarter. As you say, we've been a leader in capital
raising and advisory work for the energy industry for a while. There'll be plenty more need for that as the industry
repairs itself and being in a position to provide that is actually it's good for us.
We've got industry-leading positions in a handful of other industries as well. Energy is just one of them, but like others,
it's a cyclical business. And while there's less capital raising going on there right now, there's more going on in other
spaces and a lot of advisory work to do. So it fits together very nicely with our wholesale bank.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: And is your intent to continue to add personnel into those business lines?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: I think so. We're always – as I say, some industries come and go with respect to their
capital needs and advisory needs. And so we want to make sure that we've got the right people in position to do the
right thing, where we've become an employer of choice for lots of those activities. Wells Fargo is a very nice place to
work. We've got a great customer franchise. Who wouldn't want to work here in those businesses compared to some of
the places that they might be coming from? And we're always adding good people.

<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: John, it got lost in the hoopla yesterday about the living will, but there was a Reuters news
item that says Wells Fargo has become significantly more important to the health of the global financial system in the
past few years says a report by the Office of Financial Research. And it strikes me with what came out in the resolution
letters yesterday that maybe being too important to the global financial system may not be an entirely good thing. And
I'm wondering if you feel at this point that your growth or lines of business, your plans for those might be impacted by
these findings.

<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Sure. So, Nancy, we went and looked at that report after that wacky headline hit the tape,
and it reported the same thing it reported a year ago, which is that we're number 17 among GSIBs in the lowest risk
category among globally systemically important banks. So there's no basis for that story. We are a big bank. We are
globally systemically important, and we're used to being measured, but we ended up toward the bottom of that list. So
that was a funny conclusion that was drawn.
With respect to the feedback that we got in the living will, there are some actionable things that we're going to get right
on, but there's nothing about size, about complexity, about the nature of our business model, about our capital, about
our liquidity. Really it was much more around proper governance and maturation of the process, et cetera, which are
things that are addressable. So frankly, I don't think we're being criticized by our regulators for the types of things that
work their way into the financial press.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: But surely, we're disappointed in the result and all hands on deck here. And we value the
feedback we got from the Fed and the FDIC, and we are committed to have a great submission later this year.
Nancy, one thing I'd like us to share for a few minutes. Even though our company has grown significantly principally
organically over the last seven or eight years, we have continued to simplify our business, and we've shed businesses
quietly that either didn't have scale for us or provided or had a risk/reward relationship that was not consistent. So let
me just check off a few. I was just thinking while John was talking. We're no longer in the wholesale mortgage
business. We're not in the joint venture business. We're not in reverse mortgage business.
We're not in the mortgage consolidation business. We have FHA overlays, so we're not as deep in that business as we
had been in the past. We just sold our RCIS insurance business. The Direct Deposit Advance business is no longer
here. We're not in the government student lending business, but a lot are. We used to have a Wells Fargo Financial
business but that is very different today. So yes, we've grown in deposits. We've grown in our corporate loans and in
Wealth Management, all those kind of things that we're involved in, but a much simpler company today in many
respects.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Now that you've – if I may ask, you've opened up the living will issue, and if I may ask if
there are any of this feedback that you got yesterday that you feel is related to residual issues that are left over from the
Wachovia deal. And I think I'll just say that as an analyst, it was no great secret in the industry that they were not the
best on the reporting side. Are there any tasks left undone that were related to that merger that may have played into
your feedback yesterday?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: No, we own this and we're going to get this right.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Okay. If I could ask a totally unrelated question, home equity lines of credit seem to be
coming back into favor, both at the banks and among consumers. Can you just speak to that business? You've always
been important in it. Is it growing now? And how do you feel about it?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Because of the starting point that Wells Fargo has had, the numbers have really only
been going in one direction, which is down, down, down. The product that we have today where we do sell it is an
amortizing product right out of the gate, so it's very different than it was in the old days where it was more just
incremental leverage that frankly didn't come down until it might hit an amortization point in the future. So we
certainly offer that amortizing product to our customers, but I don't think you'll see it make a difference in our reported
consumer real estate assets. Really, on our balance sheet, it's more about prime jumbo and nonconforming by balance
types of loans to prime borrowers.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Okay, thank you.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: You're welcome.

Your final question will come from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: Thanks. John, I've done a little bit of the math. When you look at the cost of the liabilities of GE
and then the delay in the assets, it looks like from a net NII standpoint, you'd pick up close to $200 million as you move
into next quarter just from the balance sheet side. I'm just trying to piece it together the best I could. Was there any
timing effect on the expenses? So as you came in and brought the operations on board, did you have a pretty full run
rate on the expense side versus the next quarter? So that's my real question, is there any also leverage in a sense that the
expenses were already in place for this quarter going into next quarter.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Right. So the big expense that's related are people expenses. The people joined, the bulk
of the people joined on March 1, so in the last month of the quarter. There were some people in the rail business that
joined at the beginning of the year. Another meaningful expense will be depreciation expense on the lease assets that
we're picking up and they come over that, and that begins when the assets are in place.
But importantly, one of the reasons that we're describing this as modestly accretive in the year is there's a whole lot of
integration expense that needs to occur, including what we're paying for transition services that we're still getting from
GE that will shift over to Wells Fargo at some point in the future or at different points in the future. And then there's
technology work to do. There's some loan file work to do, some paperwork to do. There's a lot of things that it takes to
make all of those assets Wells Fargo assets in the regulated environment that we're operating in, and we'll pay
incremental dollars in the near term to do that. So I'd be hesitant to offer you up a run rate from March that reflects
what Q2 or the rest of the year is going to look like.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: Would you be, on the expense side, isolating those as integration costs so we can know – and not
the total, but just as an integration like you would do with any other kind of merger? And then when we look at that
seasonal uptick that we have in those employee-related expenses, typically you don't see a net benefit as it goes down
because there are other expenses that offset that. But would you expect in the core expenses to see somewhat of a
roll-down given how high the seasonal expenses were this first quarter? So just two things on that side.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: I expect that we'll be between 55% and 59% in our efficiency ratio for the rest of the
year, on the high side of that, and that would capture the change in seasonal expenses. It's a good point that not all of
that seasonal comp expense disappears and that the whole net benefit doesn't come back. We call out in our deck that if
there are some other things that are seasonally depressed in the first quarter that pick up in the second quarter, not as
big, but that are seasonal in that way.
And we'll see how material it is. But if it becomes appropriate to provide clarity on the GE transition-related expenses,
we might consider calling that out, but we haven't begun to yet because we're still developing those expenses. We're
still coming into – we're at the early stage of execution on some of the technology-oriented things that I mentioned and
some other chunky early expenses that will start to run off after a bit.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: And then, John, just lastly, trying to climb into your head a little bit is as you were looking at the
first quarter and you had the gain from selling the crop insurance business and rates were going down and you had so
much market disruption, were you thinking in a sense of, well, I have this gain over here, I don't really feel comfortable
putting my liquidity to work because of what's going on in the market? That gives me some kind of breathing room to
kind of see where things fall and then start reinvesting in the second quarter, re-creating the income that you gave up in
the first quarter.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Investing in relatively risk-free assets doesn't produce that much P&L in the quarter that
we invest. So there really wasn't much of a trade-off in the first quarter between the gain that reflects this business that
we agreed to sell a few quarters ago that closed this quarter. It's really the threshold issue is on reinvestment or more
around our capital sensitivity because we're going to be living with the valuation consequences of buying duration at a
low rate and a low yield entry point. And that really is more where the trade-off occurred. So thinking about the whole
year impact may be on interest income, but also our OCI sensitivity if rates ultimately back up.
