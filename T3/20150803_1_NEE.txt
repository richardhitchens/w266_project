Moray P. Dewhurst
Thank you, Amanda. Good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy delivered solid second quarter results and continued to
make excellent progress towards meeting its objectives for the year. NextEra Energy Partners completed the acquisition
of four projects from Energy Resources during the second quarter and just recently signed an agreement to purchase a
portfolio of seven natural gas pipelines located in Texas. As a result of NextEra Energy's strong financial performance
during the first half of the year as well as this NEP acquisition announcement, we are increasing our financial
expectations for both businesses.
NextEra Energy's adjusted earnings per share increased $0.13 or 9%. Growth was particularly strong at Energy
Resources, driven by continued strong contributions from new wind and solar project additions. The impact of weak
wind resource was roughly offset by another period of good performance from the customer supply business and
increased contributions from the balance of the existing asset portfolio, including the absence of an outage at Seabrook
in comparison to the second quarter of last year.
Energy Resources had another excellent quarter of origination activity, signing contracts for roughly 555 megawatts of
new wind and solar projects since the last call, including an additional 125 megawatts solar project that is expected to
be delivered late in 2016 that was not in our earlier development forecast. Energy Resources growth in adjusted
EBITDA and operating cash flow continues to be strong year-to-date, reflecting the addition of new contracted
renewable projects to the portfolio.
Florida Power & Light remains on track to achieve its full-year objectives. The relatively modest growth in second
quarter earnings per share from the prior year was generally in-line with our expectations and was impacted by share
dilution, timing considerations and a number of smaller items.
Regulatory capital employed, the capital on which FPL is able to earn a return, continued to grow quarter-on-quarter,
with a gradual increase expected throughout the year as FPL continues to make excellent progress on its major capital
initiatives.
The Florida economy continues to expand at a healthy pace, leading to an increase in customer accounts and a decline
in inactive meters, while a warm spring led to higher weather-related usage, increasing both revenues and our reserve
amortization balance. FPL expects to earn in the upper-half of the allowed ROE band through the remainder of the
settlement period.
We continue to invest in the business with a focus on delivering value to customers, and I'm pleased to note that we
received approval from the Florida Public Service Commission on the modified set of gas reserves guidelines which we
expect will allow us gradually to build the portfolio of gas-producing assets to act as a long-term hedge for our
customers.
We also announced our plan to move forward with the Okeechobee Clean Energy Center to meet a capacity need in
2019. And we entered into a settlement agreement with the Office of Public Counsel, the consumer advocate in Florida,
regarding our proposal to acquire the Cedar Bay Generation Facility. While the Florida Public Service Commission
approval is still needed, we view this as a positive development. Overall, we are very pleased with FPL's year-to-date
results.

Both FPL and Energy Resources continue to deliver excellent operating performance. The fossil and renewables
generation fleets had one of their best periods ever with EFOR, or the equivalent forced outage rate, at less than 1% for
the first half of the year.
FPL has continued to provide excellent reliability to our customers and was recently named one of 2015 Most Trusted
Brands according to a nationwide study conducted by Market Strategies International.
NextEra Energy Partners continues to execute against its growth plans while, at the same time, its sponsor, NextEra
Energy Resources, further extends its industry-leading pipeline of potential dropdown assets.
In addition to closing on full project acquisitions from Energy Resources during the quarter, supporting growth in
second quarter distributions, NEP has signed an agreement to acquire NET Midstream, a developer, owner and operator
of seven natural gas pipelines located in Texas. NET Midstream's pipeline assets are all strategically located serving
residential, commercial and industrial load in the Houston, Texas and in the Eagle Ford Shale area, while the largest of
the pipelines interconnects at the U.S.-Mexican border with one of Mexico's critical natural gas pipelines, serving as a
gateway to providing low-cost Eagle-Ford-sourced gas to important load centers in Mexico.
These assets carry with them future growth and expansion opportunities, have an industry-leading 16-year average
contract life, and are expected to provide attractive yields to NEP's investors. In addition, the pipelines will form an
excellent complement to NEP's existing portfolio by providing high-quality predictable long-term cash flows that will
reduce the resource variability in the overall NEP portfolio.
Finally, this transaction is expected to drive NEP's mid-term distribution growth higher, extend NEP's growth runway
and, at the same time, be accretive to NextEra Energy's ongoing earnings. I will provide additional details on the
acquisition later in the call, along with our latest growth expectations for both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy
Partners.
In addition, the NEP board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.235 per common unit, or $0.94 per common unit on
an annualized basis, up $0.12 per common unit on an annualized basis from the first quarter. Overall, we're very
pleased with the second quarter results and are in an excellent position leading into the second half of the year.
Now, let's look at the results for FPL. For the second quarter of 2015, FPL reported net income of $435 million, or
$0.97 per share, up $0.01 per share year-over-year. Continued investment in the business was the principal driver of
modest year-over-year growth, offset primarily by the impact of share dilution.
During the second quarter, average regulatory capital employed, the capital on which FPL is able to earn a return,
increased 5.6% from the prior year comparable quarter, with gradual increases expected in each of the third quarter and
fourth quarters as FPL completes its full year capital investment program.
Results for the second quarter are generally in line with our expectations, and we continue to expect the bulk of this
year's earnings growth for FPL to be in the fourth quarter as the business remains on track for the year to deliver
financial results consistent with our expectations.
Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.5% for the 12 months ending June 2015, and this
remains our target for the full year. As a reminder, under the current rate agreement, we record reserve amortization
entries to achieve a predetermined regulatory ROE for each trailing 12-month period. We ended 2015 with a reserve
amortization balance of $278 million and finished the first quarter with a balance of $179 million to be utilized for the
remainder of 2015 and 2016.
Due to higher revenues driven by weather-related usage and customer growth, supported by a strong Florida economy,
during the second quarter we reversed $66 million of reserve amortization, leaving us with a balance of $245 million at
the end of June which can be utilized in the remainder of 2015 and 2016.
Looking beyond 2015, we continue to expect that the balance of the reserve amortization, coupled with current CapEx
and O&M expectations, will allow us to support a regulatory ROE in the upper-half of the allowed band of 9.5% to
11.5% through the end of our current rate agreement in 2016. As always, our expectations assume normal weather and

operating conditions.
Let me now take a moment to discuss updates since the last call on key capital initiatives. We're very pleased that we
received approval from the Florida Public Service Commission on a set of gas reserves guidelines that will allow FPL
to invest up to $500 million per year in future natural gas projects. Although the amount we invest in each year will
depend on the opportunity set at that time, we view this as an important step in what we hope to be a larger program to
provide long-term hedges against potential volatility in the market price of natural gas for the benefit of customers.
Additionally, since the last call, we've announced our plans to move forward with the 1,622 megawatt Okeechobee
Clean Energy Center to fulfill a need for additional generation capacity in 2019 as Florida continues to grow. With a
projected cost of approximately $670 per kilowatt, we expect this to be the most cost effective combined cycle unit
built to-date in our fleet.
We intend to file for regulatory approval in the coming months and expect a comprehensive process of review over a
14-month to 16-month timeframe. Contingent upon receiving all needed approvals, we expect to be in construction in
2017, with commercial operations mid-2019.
In a positive step-forward on our proposal to purchase the Cedar Bay Generation Facility, we have reached a settlement
agreement with the Office of Public Counsel to support the transaction. We expect a decision from the PSC on the
settlement agreement later this month.
All other major capital initiatives, including the Port Everglades modernization, infrastructure improvements to our
transmission and distribution system, the addition of roughly 223 megawatts of cost effective solar PV to our
generation portfolio, and the implementation of an upgrade solution to our peaker fleet, remain on schedule and on
budget.
The economy in Florida continues to grow at a healthy pace. During the quarter, the state passed another milestone by
regaining all the jobs lost during the Great Recession and, in June, reached 39 months of consistently outpacing the
nation's rate of annualized job growth.
Strong jobs growth has also been reflected in the state's increased levels of personal income and consistently low rates
of seasonally adjusted unemployment, which are now around levels last seen in mid-2008.
Leading indicators in the real estate sector have also maintained a stable pace, reflecting the continued strength of the
Florida housing market. Finally, despite declining slightly from March, the June reading of Florida's consumer
sentiment remained close to the post-recession highs.
Turning now to our customer and usage metrics, second quarter retail sales were up 7.6%, with warm weather driving
very strong cooling demand as the primary driver of overall growth. We estimate that approximately 6.1% of the total
7.6% growth in retail sales can be attributed to weather-related usage per customer.
After adjusting for the effects of weather, second quarter retail sales increased 1.5%, of which customer growth
exceeded expectations by accounting for approximately 1.7%, with weather-normalized usage per customer declining
by approximately 0.2%.
As we discussed in the first quarter, it can be difficult to know how much to attribute to weather, particularly in periods
with relatively strong weather comparisons. Looking ahead, we expect year-over-year weather-normalized usage per
customer to be close to flat, after taking into account the impact of efficiency and conservation programs. We do not
expect modest changes in usage per customer to have a material effect on our earnings.
As a reminder, for this year and next, any effects of weather-normalized usage are expected to be offset by the
utilization of our reserve amortization and, after the expiration of our current settlement agreement, will be taken into
account in our regulatory planning.
The number of low usage customers and inactive accounts continued to decline. The 12-month average of low usage
customers fell to approximately 7.9%, while the average number of inactive accounts for the quarter declined to levels

not seen since before 2000.
Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported second quarter 2015 GAAP earnings of $273 million, or $0.61
per share. Adjusted earnings for the second quarter were $251 million, or $0.57 per share.
Energy Resources' adjusted EPS increased by $0.09 per share year-over-year. The core business results were driven by
continued strong contributions from growth in our contracted renewables business. New wind and solar projects placed
into service during or after the second quarter of 2014 added $0.10 per share.
Although the impact of all other effects was relatively minor, there were a number of individually significant items. Of
particular note, the year-over-year results from our existing generating assets were significantly affected by generally
weak wind resource, which accounted for negative $0.14 per share versus the comparable quarter.
Wind resource was roughly 93% of the long-term average, versus 109% in the second quarter of last year. The
fleet-wide wind resource was the fifth lowest second quarter on record over the last 37 years, with particularly poor
results from the Western part of the portfolio. Unfortunately, for reasons I will discuss later, this resource weakness
may continue for some time. There were a number of offsetting effects, as shown in the accompanying slide.
Energy Resources' growth in adjusted EBITDA and cash flow has been strong year-to-date. As compared to the first
half of 2014, adjusted EBITDA and operating cash flow have increased 12% and 28%, respectively, although the latter
number was boosted by temporary changes in working capital. Nevertheless, we continue to see full year cash flow
from operations growing 20% to 25%, assuming no major changes in commodity prices and assuming normal
operating conditions.
From an economic perspective, NextEra Energy investors' cash flow profile benefits from the LP unit distributions
received from NEP, as well as from the IDRs which we expect to begin receiving in the third quarter of this year.
The Energy Resources development team had another successful quarter of origination activity. Since the first quarter
call, we signed power purchase agreements for 400 megawatts of wind as well as 155 megawatts of solar, of which 125
megawatts is for 2016 delivery and 30 megawatts is for post-2016 delivery.
The 400 megawatts of wind added to backlog since the last call leaves a balance of 500 megawatts to 700 megawatts
necessary to satisfy our previously announced 2016 forecast from the March Investor Conference. Given the strength of
our wind development pipeline, our origination run rate this quarter and last, and the historical customer push to sign
power purchase agreements before the expiration of production tax credits, we expect to be able to sign another
approximately 700 megawatts of wind contracts before the end of the year, which will bring us to the high-end of our
previously announced 2016 wind build range.
We are very pleased with our solar development efforts for the quarter as well. The new 125 megawatts solar project
for late-2016 delivery was not included in our previous development forecast, and we have increased our expectations
for new contracted renewable opportunities by this amount.
Similar to the 80 megawatt solar contract that we mentioned on last quarter's call, recent origination activity includes
another 30 megawatts of solar signed for post-2016 delivery which continues to demonstrate that there is demand for
solar projects based on post-2016 economics after the anticipated expiration of the current special ITC support.
The accompanying chart updates information we provided on last quarter's call that reflects the 125 megawatt increase
in our overall range of expectations for the development program that I just mentioned. In rounded terms, we now
expect to bring into service a total of approximately 4,800 megawatts to 5,200 megawatts of renewables from 2015
through 2018. Our forecast assumes PTCs expire at the end of 2016, with a further extension representing a potential
upside to these numbers.
We are encouraged that the Senate Finance Committee recently passed a tax Extenders Package that includes a
two-year extension of production tax credit. While that is just one step in the process, we are pleased by continued
signs of bipartisan support.

In addition, we continue to pursue development of solar, wind and storage projects in Canada, including the submission
of development projects this September into the Ontario Power Authority's new RFP process, which also represents a
potential upside to our current forecast.
Let me now review the highlights for NEP. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was approximately $102 million and cash
available for distribution was $50 million. These results were slightly below our expectations for the quarter, primarily
due to weak wind and solar resource.
We have made excellent progress delivering future growth opportunities for NEP. As you may recall, last year we
made the decision to undertake a near-term acceleration in NEP's 2015 growth rate in order to reach the high IDR splits
by the end of the year. We believe this offers very attractive value proposition for both NEP and NEE investors.
Against this objective, we completed the acquisition of four projects totaling approximately 664 megawatts during the
quarter, supporting growth in second quarter distributions in line with our previously stated expectations. The NEP
board declared an increased quarterly distribution of $0.235 per common unit, or $0.94 per common unit on an
annualized basis.
NextEra Energy Partners has also entered into an agreement to acquire NET Midstream, a privately held developer,
owner and operator of a portfolio of seven long-term contracted natural gas pipeline assets located in Texas. The NET
Midstream opportunity represents the first third-party acquisition for the partnership and establishes NEP's presence in
the long-term contracted natural gas pipeline space. The combined portfolio includes 3.0 Bcf per day of ship-or-pay
contracts with on-average investment grade counterparty credit and a 16-year average contract life.
The acquisition is expected to provide attractive yields to our investors and complements the partnership's existing
renewables portfolio by reducing the impact of resource variability on the overall NEP portfolio. In addition, the
acquisition provides a platform for future growth and expansion opportunities associated with the NET Midstream
pipeline assets for both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners.
From a NEP perspective, the portfolio has planned growth and expansion projects that are expected to provide an
additional 1.0 Bcf per day of long-term contracted volumes. $200 million of the purchase price is contingent on signing
contracts, representing roughly 60% of this expansion opportunity.
From an NextEra Energy perspective, the acquisition provides economies of scale in pipeline operations and a platform
for future growth as we build out the Sabal Trail, Florida Southeast Connection and Mountain Valley Pipeline projects
while continuing to look for further investment opportunities in the pipeline space.
The seven natural gas pipelines in the NET Midstream portfolio serve power producers and municipalities in South
Texas, processing plants and producers in the Eagle Ford Shale, and residential, commercial and industrial customers in
the Houston area, and provide a critical source of natural gas transportation for low cost U.S.-sourced shale gas to
Mexico. The two largest pipelines in the NET Midstream portfolio have an average age of approximately two years.
The largest pipeline in the portfolio, the NET Mexico Pipeline, is 120-mile, 42-inch diameter natural gas pipeline that
delivers low cost Eagle Ford Shale gas to the Mexico border under a 20-year ship-or-pay contract with a BBB+ rated
wholly owned subsidiary of PEMEX, a Mexican state-owned oil and gas company. This pipeline is the largest,
connecting the Eagle Ford to the Mexican border, and it has the lowest tariff.
There is a strong alignment of interest with PEMEX as it owns 10% of the NET Mexico Pipeline, which in turn,
interconnects at the U.S. Mexico border with a large strategic natural gas pipeline system, the initial part of which is
jointly owned by PEMEX and Sempra. We believe this pipeline system, called the Los Ramones pipeline system, is
critical to PEMEX's growth plans to ensure the adequate supply of natural gas to the three largest demand regions in
Mexico that account for approximately 75% of Mexico's gas demand.
Natural gas demand in Mexico has been growing substantially over the last five years, while at the same time
Mexico-based natural gas supply has been declining, which we believe increases Mexico's need for U.S. gas imports.
As a result, we believe the NET Mexico Pipeline is strategically positioned as a gateway to providing low cost
U.S.-sourced shale gas to meet the increasing demand of Mexico load centers and growing natural gas markets.

The second largest natural gas pipeline in NET Midstream's portfolio, Eagle Ford Pipeline, is an approximately
158-mile large diameter natural gas pipeline located in the Eagle Ford Shale anchored by a long-term ship-or-pay
commitment from an investment grade producer. The systems connection to the Agua Dulce Hub, with access to
multiple pipeline interconnects as well as Mexican markets, uniquely positions the system to attract additional Eagle
Ford Shale volumes.
The third largest pipeline in the portfolio, Monument Pipeline, is an approximately 156-mile, 16-inch pipeline that
transports gas from the Katy Hub to growing city gates of Houston as well as to the Houston Ship Channel and to
Galveston County. There are also four smaller Texas pipelines in the portfolio that serve a variety of power plants and
residential loads.
NextEra Energy Partners has elected not to hold the NET Midstream assets in a master limited partnership format since
the pipeline assets are expected to create and utilize their own tax attributes to shield taxable income for a period
generally consistent with that of the partnership's renewable assets and, as a result, our expectations regarding the
overall tax shield for NextEra Energy Partners remain largely unchanged.
The transaction is valued at $2.1 billion. The total transaction size includes initial consideration of $1.8 billion, which
NEP expects will be financed in part by approximately $600 million of non-amortizing debt secured by the acquired
assets.
The transaction also contemplates a future expansion investment of roughly $300 million in 2016. This $300 million
investment includes the $200 million contingent payment I mentioned earlier, payable only upon signing the expansion
projects, and is expected to be financed primarily with debt.
Overall, permanent financing is expected to consist of approximately $1.2 billion of equity and $900 million of debt.
NEP has secured a $1.0 billion bridge loan facility that is available to draw on, subject to specified conditions, to
support funding requirements. NEP expected to close the transaction within the next 75 days.
The acquisition is expected to contribute 2016 adjusted EBITDA and CAFD of roughly $145 million to $155 million
and $110 million to $120 million, respectively. Assuming the expansion projects are completed as planned, the
acquisition is expected to contribute to 2018 adjusted EBITDA and CAFD of roughly $190 million to $210 million and
$135 million to $155 million, respectively.
The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to NextEra Energy Partners' distributions per unit and NextEra
Energy's earnings per share. We believe the acquisition price is attractive as it compares favorably against precedent
transactions in the pipeline space for similar assets for similar cash flow profiles and is expected to provide an
attractive yield to NEP investors as well.
In addition, this acquisition opportunity extends NextEra Energy Partners' runway for future dropdowns by eliminating
the need for an acquisition of certain assets from Energy Resources that would have otherwise been required to meet its
growth expectations for the year. In addition, the strong renewables origination growth at Energy Resources continues
to expand the pipeline of generating other assets potentially available for sale to NextEra Energy Partners in the future.
We continue to believe that the ability to demonstrate a strong and highly visible run rate for future growth is an
important distinguishing factor for investors and a core strength of the NEP value proposition. We are very pleased
with this particular acquisition opportunity and our future prospects for growth.
Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the second quarter of 2015, GAAP net income
attributable to NextEra Energy was $716 million, or $1.59 per share. NextEra Energy's 2015 second quarter adjusted
earnings and adjusted EPS was $699 million and $1.56, respectively, with adjusted EPS up 9% over prior year
comparable quarter.
As we discussed on the first quarter call, our earnings per share account for dilution associated with the settlement of
our forward agreement of 6.6 million shares that occurred in December of 2014. In June, the settlement occurred for the
forward contract component of the equity units that were issued in May 2012. The impact dilution in the second quarter

was approximately $0.03 per share.
Adjusted earnings from the Corporate and Other segment increased $0.03 per share compared in the second quarter of
2014, primarily due to miscellaneous corporate items, none of which was individually notable. As a reminder, results
associated with NextEra Energy Transmission and Gas Pipelines are reported through the Corporate and Other
segment.
During the quarter, our transmission team continued to work on the execution of awarded projects, as well as our
pipeline of development projects. Additionally, our current gas pipeline initiatives continue to make solid progress. The
development of both Sabal Trail and Florida Southeast Connection continue to remain on track, and we are expected to
be in a position to receive FERC approval in early 2016 to support commercial operation by mid-2017.
The Mountain Valley Pipeline project concluded the scoping process as part of the pre-filing process, with a FERC
application targeted for the second half of this year. We continue to expect approximately 2 Bcf per day of 20-year firm
capacity commitments, with an expected capital opportunity for NextEra Energy of $1.0 billion to $1.3 billion,
supporting commercial operations by year-end 2018.
Despite the strong performance in the first half, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share for 2015 to be in the
range of $5.40 to $5.70. The very strong recovery of our customer supply and trading business in the first half was
largely offset by poor wind resource.
Unfortunately, although we cannot draw any firm numerical conclusions, we do know that the strong El Niño cycle that
we are now in tends to be correlated with below average Continental wind resource, and we also know that
meteorological expectations are for the El Niño phase to continue. Nonetheless, we expect the overall strength and
diversity of the NextEra Energy portfolio to enable us to meet the expectations originally established on our third
quarter 2014 call.
We also expect NextEra Energy's operating cash flow, adjusted for the potential impacts of certain FPL clause
recoveries in the Cedar Bay acquisition, to grow by 10% to 11% in 2015.
Looking beyond 2015, the team has made excellent progress firming up some of the investment opportunities that we
have previously discussed, and the strength of the recent origination activity at Energy Resources has increased our
expectations for growth opportunities in the years ahead.
Having completed a closer evaluation of the 2016 through 2018 timeframe, combined with the anticipated contribution
from the Texas Pipeline acquisition we just discussed, our outlook has improved from the expectations we have
previously shared. We expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.85 to $6.35 for 2016, and in the range
of $6.60 to $7.10 for 2018, implying a compound annual growth rate off a 2014 base of 6% to 8% through 2018.
As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats, including, but not limited to, normal weather and operating
conditions.
Turning now to NEP. The acquisition of NET Midstream increases our expectations for near-term growth. We now
expect the NEP portfolio to grow to support a distribution at an annualized rate of $1.23 by the end of the year,
meaning the fourth quarter distribution that is payable in February 2016. Our expectations for 2015 adjusted EBITDA
of $400 million to $440 million, and CAFD of $100 million to $120 million, are unchanged.
After 2015, we continue to see 12% to 15% per year growth in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of
expectations through 2020. Assuming trading levels consistent with current market conditions, this implies 2016
adjusted EBITDA of $710 million to $760 million, and 2016 CAFD of $250 million to $280 million. These
expectations are net of expected IDR fees of $30 million to $40 million for 2016, as we expect these fees to be treated
as an operating expense.
With that, I will turn the call over to Jim for closing remarks.

James L. Robo
Thanks, Moray, and good morning, everyone. It's been a terrific first half of the year at both NEE and NEP. We've
executed well both financially and operationally, and we've had strong execution of our growth plans all across the
board.
At FPL, the team continued to make excellent progress against our core strategy of investing to further improve our
customer value proposition. Our goal at FPL is nothing less than to be the cleanest, lowest-cost and most reliable utility
in the nation, and we're well on our way to achieving that.
At Energy Resources, we've made terrific progress against our core strategy of being the world's largest generator of
wind and solar energy. I feel better than I ever have about our renewables growth prospects and the quality of our
renewables development pipeline.
In our Gas Pipeline business, I'm very pleased with NEP's announced acquisition of seven high-quality and long-term
contracted pipeline assets in Texas. When combined with Sabal Trail, Florida Southeast Connection, and the Mountain
Valley Pipeline, the transaction is expected to expand our scale and scope in the natural gas pipeline space, serving as a
platform for future growth.
NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners form an excellent strategic partnership. I think NEE is a terrific sponsor
for NEP, with an industry-leading and growing runway of potential long-term contracted assets. NEP offers NEE the
ability to highlight the value of these assets, and is a significant source of cash flow for NEE as well.
In addition, the expected growth of general partner incentive distributions from NEP to NEE will be an increasingly
important source of cash and potential value to NEE shareholders. Based on all of these factors, together with the
strong growth in our underlying cash flow from operations, I'm pleased to discuss an announcement by the board of
NextEra Energy to implement a new dividend policy for NEE shareholders.
As you may recall, in 2012, the board of NextEra Energy approved a dividend policy targeting a 55% payout ratio for
2014 that was based on an analysis of appropriate payout levels for regulated utilities, contracted assets, and other
portions of our business mix. At that time, the new policy led to two years of roughly 10% growth per year in dividends
per share.
In thinking about longer-term dividend policy, the board takes into account, amongst many other factors, the changing
mix of NextEra Energy's portfolio of businesses and the ongoing levels of dividend payout generally supportable by
each major segment of the portfolio, as well as the payout ratios of competing businesses in each of those major
segments.
Through the launch of NEP and other YieldCos, we believe there is new market evidence regarding payout ratios
supported by a strong and balanced portfolio of contracted assets. What has become clear is that a business like Energy
Resources, that is largely composed of contracted generation assets and cash flows, can and should support a higher
dividend payout ratio.
Applying higher market comparable payout ratios to the contracted portfolio of Energy Resources yields a higher
portfolio average payout. In addition, when looking at the payout ratios of a broader peer group of YieldCos, other
infrastructure companies and regulated utilities targeting a higher level would more closely align NextEra Energy with
its peers.
Combining these market factors with the expectation for Energy Resources' contracted EBITDA and cash flow to
continue to increase through 2018 as a result of new project additions and the receipt of proceeds from NEP for asset
acquisitions, limited partnership distributions and incentive distribution rights fees, we feel it is warranted to highlight
more directly the strong underlying cash flow productivity of the Energy Resources business.
Although the decision by the board of directors to pay a dividend must consider all the facts and circumstances at the
time of declaration, the board presently expects to increase our dividend payout ratio from its current level of 55% to a
target dividend payout ratio of 65% by 2018. We expect this new dividend policy, along with our expectations for

growth in adjusted earnings per share, to yield dividend per share growth of 12% to 14% per year through at least 2018,
off a 2015 base of dividends per share of $3.08.
The board of directors of NextEra Energy declared a quarterly dividend of $0.77 per share. Based on the timing of the
increased cash flow [ph] from NEER and its relationships (38:03) with NEP that I just described, we expect the
dividend to begin to increase within the framework of the new dividend policy that I just described in 2016 in a manner
designed to continue to support our target credit metrics and our strong credit position. As a result, we do not expect
this change to have any material effect on our credit ratings.
In summary, I'm as enthusiastic as ever about our future prospects. FPL, Energy Resources and NEP continue to make
excellent progress across-the-board against all our strategic and growth initiatives. Today's announcements of
increasing our expectations for both NEE and NEP, as well as increased payout ratio at NEE, are reflections of that
enthusiasm.
With that, we'll now open the line for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Daniel Eggers with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Hey. Good morning, guys.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Good morning.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: On the NEP acquisition this morning, you guys have been telegraphing that you wanted to do
something out in the market but kind of go in the pipeline side versus the renewable side. Can you just talk about the
returns you're seeing in those different asset classes? And then also, kind of what sort of IRRs you're seeing on that
project, since that's what you keep coaching us to look at for value of these projects?
<A - Armando Pimentel, Jr.>: Good morning. Dan, it's Armando. First of all, the way we looked at it is it's pipelines,
right? So we have different metrics, different economics that we're looking at in that business than in the renewable
business. And it's not a greenfield opportunity, so the returns are certainly not what you would expect from a greenfield
renewable asset.
But having said that, it is based on all of the market metrics that we look at. A very positive acquisition both in just
terms of EV to EBITDA, which is around 12 times, 12.5 times, but also in terms of CAFD, cash available for
distribution. It's important to note that we did the acquisition because it's a good acquisition economically for NEP.
This wasn't an acquisition that we did for other reasons, i.e., IDR reasons at NEE. It is a very positive acquisition and
we're very happy with it.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Just a big – I suppose that you're asking about the IRRs. Without going into the numbers
there, very consistent with other investments that we've been seeing in the pipeline space, and significantly above the
IRRs that we're seeing in the third-party acquisition market for renewable assets at the moment.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: So, these returns are better than what we've seen in the renewables market?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: In the third-party acquisition market, very substantial, yes. That market has, as I think you
know, become a bit down – the returns have just come a bit down significantly.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Okay. And then, I guess just on increase in both the EPS growth rate and the dividend growth
rate, how should we think about long-term equity financing and funding needs of the company as more dollars,
underlying growth or kind of the return back to shareholders, the dividend?

<A - John W. Ketchum>: Dan, this is John. The change in the dividend policy was all about cash flows at Energy
Resources. We've executed very well on our long-term contracted renewables plan. We've had strong growth at NEP as
well. And then looking out at the peers in terms of where the payout ratios are for other YieldCos and infrastructure
plays, we thought that justified a higher payout ratio.
And when you look out what the financing requirements will be long term in that, the finance, the dividend, we have a
lot underlying cash flow that's going to be available to support that. And then, we also have a lot of levers available that
we can pull internally to go ahead and finance what is going to be a small cash need.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Okay. Thank you, guys.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Dan, just to supplement that, remember the one of the effects of having NEP is that we
really are accelerating the realization of the underlying cash flows from the projects. So, effective financing needs are
lower than they were in a pre-NEP world. We're ready for the next question.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Hi. Good morning, guys.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Good morning, Jonathan.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Just a quick one. I'm not sure we had this correctly, but on the expansion of NET, is it
$300 million of additional spend but that breaks down $200 million as consideration and only $100 million of CapEx?
Do I understand that right?
<A - Armando Pimentel, Jr.>: Yeah, that's roughly right. It's about $200 million in additional consideration, about
$85 million in CapEx. We rounded that to about $300 million.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: And so, but then you have $50 million of incremental EBITDA, can you just give us a
little sense of how – does that look like a pretty decent return on that, just if we ignore the consideration piece, what
exactly is going on?
<A - Armando Pimentel, Jr.>: Well, I think what's going on there is we wanted to make sure that for other
incremental opportunities that we booked, we're not paying the same thing as we were for the opportunities that were
already in the door. So, that's why you've got a roughly 6 times EV to EBITDA multiple on that and roughly about 12.5
times on the whole deal.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: And the expansions, Armando, are they contracted and what yet has to be done to?
<A - Armando Pimentel, Jr.>: Well, the contracts would have to be signed, right? They're not signed. If they were
signed, then it would be just be part of the deal. But we feel pretty good about them based on the details that we know
about the opportunities themselves. But we also feel like there's a good alignment of interest between the sellers and the
buyers, that there's an opportunity obviously to increase the purchase price by a couple hundred million dollars. So, we
feel good with the alignment of interest and we feel good with the underlying opportunities, which will again be
long-term contracted-type opportunity in the 20-year range.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Okay. And did you say what sort of timeframe you expect for clarifying that?
<A - Armando Pimentel, Jr.>: Yeah, our expectation is that they'd be done in 12 months.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Okay. And then just, if I may, just one other thing. We noticed this typical slide on the
financial outlook, the Resources business is no longer in the deck. Has that gone permanently or is it just while we're
digesting some of these new things?

<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: It's the latter. The introduction of the NET Mexico acquisition is likely to change our
thinking about further acquisitions for NEP. While we have made a rough aggregate cut at that, we haven't yet rippled
all that down to the level of the individual segments that are shown in the chart that you're referring to, Jonathan. So,
rather than try and do something in haste and introduce the possibility of errors, we pulled it for this quarter, but we
expect to bring it back with the third quarter.

And we'll take our next question from Michael Weinstein with UBS.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Hey, good morning. It's Julien here.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Good morning.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: So, perhaps just to touch base on the credit implications from this all, can you
elaborate on how you're thinking about the overall consolidated NextEra balance sheet from both the GPS and the
acquisitions? Then, perhaps in conjunction with that, speak to a potential desire to expand the platform more towards
midstream and/or perhaps maintain – and with a need to maintain a regulated mix in the portfolio?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Let me ask Jim to comment on the second part, the strategy aspect, and then John will
comment on the credit metric side.
<A - John W. Ketchum>: Yeah. Looking at it from a credit metrics standpoint, we're fine. We're within the range that
we've committed to with the agencies. The acquisition opportunity, again, will be about $1.2 billion of equity, $900
million of debt. I'll jet Jim speak more about the strategic elements.
<A - James L. Robo>: Good morning, Julien. So, I think we've always said that we have liked the pipeline space. I
think, originally when we announced Sabal Trail and Florida Southeast Connection, we said that that was not going to
be a one and done exercise for us, that we felt like the pipeline space was both attractive, it was long-term contracted
typically and it was attractive to our overall business mix both from a shareholder perspective as well as from a fixed
income and credit perspective. And I continue to believe that, and we are going to continue to be looking for
opportunities to expand our presence there. And it is a – this acquisition we're announcing at NEP today is a another
piece of expanding and growing that platform.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Excellent. And perhaps, just the follow-up [indiscernible] (48:21) question here.
Current year guidance, just to be clear about it, effectively you're keeping your guidance in place because of your
expectations for continued weak weather throughout the balance of this year?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: For this year, yeah, that's fundamentally right. We think that there is going to be some
spillover from the El Niño effect into the second half of the year and that's likely to offset the sort of goodness that
we've had so far. Hopefully, we're wrong and we get a normal weather year, but that's kind of how we're feeling right
now.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Excellent. And just – I mean sorry to put you on the spot a little bit on weather
forecasting, but just it would in theory last throughout the duration of this weather cycle? So it's a multi-year effect, just
to be clear? And you raised your guidance in – despite the multi-year weather headwinds from weaker weather, or
weaker wind, specifically?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Yeah, I think we're only taking a view on the impact of the El Niño cycle on this year.
Let's see how it goes. These correlations are not the strongest, but they are at least meaningful in the short term. We'll
see how 2016 looks later on.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Got it. All right. Well, congratulations again. Thank you.

We'll take our next question from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Good morning, Greg.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Congratulations on a great quarter despite the wind resource you're facing. It's a testament to the
diversification of the business. Can you go over the timing on when this deal is going to close, and when you're
expecting to finance it? As per usual in this capital market, over the last few weeks, the YieldCos are responding very
negatively to any financing overhang, even if it's an accretive deal like that one you've announced. So, how do you plan
on navigating that?
<A - Armando Pimentel, Jr.>: So, we plan to close the deal sometime before the middle of October. In terms of
financing the deal, we're going to look for opportunities in the market to raise that equity during that time period.
Importantly, we have – and I think Moray mentioned it, if I remember correctly, in the prepared remarks – we already
have $1 billion credit facility that backs up the equity issuance. It's a one-year term facility at very attractive pricing.
So, we have obviously – we want to be able to meet the financing plans and issue the equity at some point before
closing, but we're not going to do something silly either. And that's why we have the backup credit to take down if we
need it.
<A - James L. Robo>: And just to add to that, Greg, this is Jim. I think it's important to understand that, even with this
acquisition, remember we're going to – this acquisition replaces, in part, several assets that we would have dropped
down this year anyway. And the total equity needs at NEP, while they're a little bit higher as a result of this acquisition
because we're going to have a little bit higher distribution growth than we originally thought for this year, aren't
actually meaningfully higher than what we were going to have otherwise.
And so I think, from a funding standpoint, the reality is, is that we have a lot of different levers there. And as Armando
said, we're going to be smart about it. And we're in this for – we've always said we're in NEP for the long term, and
we're going to continue to do what's right for both NEP unit holders and NEE shareholders.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Thanks. One other question that's a little bit bigger picture, obviously we're getting the big reveal
today from the administration on the carbon rules. The visibility you have on your backlog through 2016 is very robust,
and it's a little bit less so, at least as of your last update, as we go out later in the decade. Is it your expectation that this
should galvanize counterparties to want to enter into arrangements with you for post-2016, or are we really waiting
more for the tax situation to change, in terms of getting passage of the extension of the PTC?
<A - James L. Robo>: So, Greg, I think it's a little bit of both. I think in the near term, most of the drivers behind
incremental renewable contracting will be driven by getting clarity on the incentives. But there's no question that
today's announcement's positive for renewables, and will be positive in the long term for our Renewable business at
NextEra Energy Resources. So, I view it quite positively there, from that standpoint
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Okay. Thanks, gents.

<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Hey, guys. Real quick, this one maybe for Eric and team. When I go back and look at the
slide deck on FP&L [Florida Power & Light Company] in terms of expected capital spending, the slide deck you gave
at the Investor Day, how has that changed? What is your expectation now, both for 2016 and kind of the 2017, 2018
average level for expected CapEx and, therefore, rate base at the utility?
<A - Eric E. Silagy>: Hey, Michael. I would say it's basically roughly the same. I don't see any material changes. The
reserves guidelines were approved. We had that also in the presentation deck, so we're moving forward with that. So, I
think you'd be safe to assume that we're roughly in line with where we were. Okeechobee, we still have to get the need
for that. But the RP process is done, and so we're moving forward with that as well.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Okay. Next year is a rate case year. I know it's probably too early to talk about the numbers
side of it. Can you talk to us just about the process and what some of the key – I don't know – the policy implications or
things you might be looking for, if any, in terms of changes in Florida regulation as part of this process?
<A - Eric E. Silagy>: Yeah, I'll start with the process. So, as you'll recall, Michael, it requires a – first a [ph] test year
(55:07) letter is filed. We would expect that to occur late fourth quarter, early first quarter. And then, that kind of kicks
off formally the process of the rate case. It's a eight-month to nine-month process. The PSC sets the schedule
ultimately, but obviously we have to have it all done, with the final order in place, sometime in the November
timeframe so we can go ahead and set rates for beginning in January of 2017.
As to the overall policy, we're in a strong position, I think, from a standpoint of what we've delivered to customers.
We'll be spending a lot of time with the Commission, reviewing what we've done in the past four years during this last
rate agreement. We've maintained the lowest bills in the state and the highest reliability, and we'll be focusing on that
kind of performance, and how do we maintain that going forward.

We'll take our next question from Brian Chin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Brian J. Chin>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Good morning, Brian.
<Q - Brian J. Chin>: A question for you on the pipeline transaction. I noticed that the debt is non-amortizing debt.
Can you just comment on thoughts around how we should think about that going forward? Are there plans to
potentially convert that to more amortizing debt down the road or is that not really in the cart?
<A - Armando Pimentel, Jr.>: The non-amortizing debt, which comes with the deal, we're not actually adding any –
actually we're adding a little piece of, a couple, $200 million of non-amortizing debt to the deal or so.
We expect to potentially refinance that, but if we do refinance it – they're pretty decent terms on the debt. If we do
refinance it, it will likely be non-amortizing debt. But we don't expect at this point to add significantly to the
non-amortizing debt from the deal.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Brian, just to supplement, the use of non-amortizing debt is fairly common in the pipeline
space. And I think for us, one of the things that we're really started to think about is whether non-amortizing debt has
more of a role on the renewable than it historically has for us. Historical model has not employed non-amortizing debt,
but that may be something that we want to take advantage of later on given the longevity and the good fundamentals
that we're seeing from the renewables business.
<Q - Brian J. Chin>: Could you just go into that, Moray, a little bit more, on the general thought process of why
non-amortizing debt makes more sense for renewable and how that matches up with pipeline? Just if you'd expand on
that a little bit, that'd be helpful.

<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Sure. Historically, we've thought of individual wind contract or wind projects as largely as
standalone entities that need to recover their cost, their capital cost, through the period of the contract. When you put
them in a portfolio in a vehicle like NextEra Energy Partners, and given the long-term outlook for the need for
renewable capacity in the country, I'm certainly taking the view now that we're seeing the potential for those assets to
go on for longer, in which case it makes sense to think about increasing the cash coming off them that's available for
distribution earlier than would otherwise be the case. So, that's what pushes you down the path of thinking about the
use of non-amortizing debt.

And we'll take our final question from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.
<Q - Steven Isaac Fleishman>: Yeah, hi. Good morning and congrats. The couple things that I guess you didn't
mention, first is any kind of thoughts on the Hawaiian deal and [indiscernible] (59:22) some to be opposition, your
ability to get that done?
<A - James L. Robo>: Steve, this is Jim. Obviously, the state filed a testimony 10 days ago saying that they opposed
the deal in its current form, and the Governor held a press release where he – a press conference where he said he
opposed the deal in its current form – I think the key words there in its current form. The state also listed several
conditions that would be, I think, just positive for them to think about changing their view. And we're in the process of
responding to that testimony and we think we have a very strong case to put forward to the Commission around the
benefits to customers. The benefits to customers are actually pretty compelling and I think we're going to be able to
make that case as we go forward.
So, it was not necessarily a surprise to me that the state filed the kind of testimony that they did. And we're going to
continue to move forward on laying out our arguments, and we look forward to the hearings we're going to have in
December to make our case.
<Q - Steven Isaac Fleishman>: Okay. And my other question is just on the – there's some recent story that you might
be looking to sell your Texas merchant assets. I don't know if you could about that. But maybe more, if you can, at a
high level, how much are you looking at maybe monetizing some assets within your business, I guess assets that are
less contracted?
<A - James L. Robo>: So, Steve, I think we're not going to comment on any individual potential transaction that's
been rumored out there. I will say that, and this is not a surprise that we've been consistently pretty bearish about the
merchant markets around the country. I think as we continue to see the technology trends in renewables both in solar
and wind and their impacts in those markets where you see high penetration of solar and wind, we continue to be pretty
bearish merchant markets around the country.
So I think, if anything, our views are even more bearish than they were a year ago. And we will – as we always say, we
always evaluate our portfolio and we're always looking for ways to optimize it, and that hasn't changed and won't
change in the future.
<Q - Steven Isaac Fleishman>: Okay, thank you.
Moray P. Dewhurst
Thanks, everybody. That, I think, completes our time.
