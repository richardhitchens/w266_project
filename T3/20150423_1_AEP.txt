MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the American Electric Power First Quarter 2015
Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer
session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I'd now like to turn the call over to our host, Ms. Bette Jo Rozsa. Please go ahead.
Bette Jo Rozsa
Thank you, Brad. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the First Quarter 2015 Earnings Webcast for American
Electric Power. We are glad that you were able to join us today. Our earnings release, presentation slides, and related
financial information are available on our website at aep.com.
Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future
results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filing for a discussion of these factors.
Joining me for this call today are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Tierney,
our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks. I will now turn the call over to Nick.

Thanks, Bette Jo. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the AEP First Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. Just as
with first quarter 2014, we're off to a great start in 2015, with AEP earnings coming in for the quarter at $1.29 per share

on a GAAP basis and $1.28 per share on an operating earnings basis. This compares with 2014 first quarter earnings of
$1.15 per share on both GAAP and operating basis, so we're very pleased with these strong results and the progress we
have made.
Just as with first quarter 2014, the cold weather and generation performance contributed heavily to these positive
results. First quarter 2014 was the coldest in 35 years; first quarter 2015 was the second coldest. But this isn't the only
story for the quarter. With weather year-on-year being about the same and earnings being higher than first quarter last
year, the difference is the progress we have made in advancing our growth strategy. This strategy of investing in the
regulated companies, particularly wires and transmission, focus on continuous improvement initiatives such as Lean
practices that crescendo in savings over time and a culture of continued disciplined in execution of our employees
around operational excellence continues to produce positive results.
We continue our commitment to this path and reaffirm our previous guidance of $3.40 to $3.60 per share and a 4% to
6% earnings growth trajectory. I know everyone gets excited and believes we should raise guidance, but remember, we
are on a multiyear plan of consistent earnings growth and one quarter does not make a year. We're mindful of softer
market conditions because of [ph] floating (2:41) natural gas prices, changes in seasonal rate structures in Ohio that
reduce summer rates that existed before, and we still have significant outstanding rate cases in Kentucky and West
Virginia, not to mention the timing of capacity performance in PPA outcomes to consider.
We also continued to look for opportunities to advance spending from 2016 into 2015 to further mitigate the PJM
capacity auction revenue deficiency in 2016 that we've been discussing for a couple of years now. The economy, which
Brian will go into more detail in a few minutes, continues to improve. But once again we were reluctant to change the
forecast at this point because of results per load in the quarter, particularly in the residential sectors Brian will discuss
later.
Along with the slowdown in new wellhead activity, we will monitor the impact of low energy prices overall in the
economy. Low energy prices have benefited parts of our economy, but more time is needed to evaluate these trends.
Our process improvement initiatives continue on pace and we continue to be pleased with the results. With the cultural
initiatives through our [ph] power up and lead (3:41) process, along with Lean activities and the ultimate reward of
very positive employee incentive results for 2014, employees are energized and focused to achieve our process of
proven savings objectives. We have completed Lean implementation at 13 plants, including Cook Nuclear and have
four to go this year. 13 distribution districts are completed with the remaining 19 in process to be completed in 2015.
Additionally, in transmission, one area has been completed with the other four slated for this year.
Other areas such as procurement, central repair shops, customer and distribution services, IT, commercial operations,
materials management, et cetera are either completed or in process. We plan to complete all the initial reviews in the
company by the end of the year to get the full benefit of 2016 and beyond. Speaking of baseload generation before,
regarding the February 2015 ESP order from the Public Utility Commission of Ohio that contain the PPA proposal
regarding the OVEC units, among other riders approved and some denied, the Commission did approve the PPA rider
mechanism as a non-bypassable rider, but denied the inclusion of the OVEC units. The order provided several factors
to be considered when future PPA filings are made. AEP filed a re-hearing request in late March on this issue and
others and have since learned that the Ohio Commission did accept the re-hearing request.
We also in October 2014 filed a larger PPA proposal for several other units amounting to approximately 2700
megawatts, and we will supplement that filing soon with additional information requested from the ESP order and will
recommend an expedited procedural schedule from the Commission. With no long-term price signals from the PJM
capacity market to support baseload generation, it is imperative that Ohio defines an energy policy that makes sense for
Ohio consumers, those that invest in generation and for the state of Ohio from an economic development tax and jobs
perspective.
It is clear that the Rube Goldberg capacity market of PJM cannot be depended upon to provide consistent revenue and
price discovery to enable a long-term investment potential and maintenance of existing baseload generation. Ohio must
regain control of its ability to define resources within the state.

With the regard to PJM, AEP believes PJM is trying to in some ways to fix the problem; we appreciate that. AEP is
hoping FERC will realize the importance as well of baseload generation for power energy and ancillary services that
enable our power system to operate properly. PJM's capacity performance proposal is a step in the right direction and
should be a no-brainer to FERC.
With that said, PJM received a deficiency notice from the FERC in February that asked several questions to supplement
the record. From Commissioner Moeller's dissent it appears that there is some support for this proposal and, hopefully,
after review of PJM's responses to the questions posed by the Commission this proposal will be approved,
demonstrating the Commission's concern regarding baseload generation in organized capacity markets.
I just got back from a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction this weekend, so I still have music on mind. So there's a
song I recall that has the lyrics that a choice not to decide is still a choice. We see this indecision in both Ohio and at
FERC with the PPA and capacity performance filings: these cases do have consequences. A vote for these plans are
votes for stability of pricing to consumers, reliability of the grid and the financial integrity of those that provide a
critical service to our economy and our way of life. Doing nothing is not the right answer.
On the state regulatory front, the two major cases I spoke of earlier in West Virginia and Kentucky are moving along.
In Kentucky, the fuel recovery case took an odd twist in January when the Kentucky Commission rejected recovery of
Mitchell no-load fuel costs, even though we accounted for the treatment of these costs for decades in the same way. We
filed an appeal in the Franklin Circuit Court, which in April was stayed pending the outcome of the two-year fuel case
at the commission.
Regarding the Kentucky $70 million rate case, most testimony has been filed and the hearings begin May 5. Settlement
discussions are occurring, and we are hopeful that this can get done soon. Regarding the $227 million rate case in West
Virginia, all testimony and hearings are concluded and we expect to get an order by the end of May. Because of the
chronically low ROEs in West Virginia for several years, we were not able to settle, so we expect the Commission to
render an order on this one. While we understand the economy in West Virginia has been challenged, it appears to be
improving somewhat and investment is needed to maintain and improve quality of service to West Virginia customers.
The Clean Power Plan debate continues debate continues on several fronts. This week NERC released its report which
follows what AEP has been saying all along: the 2020 targets are not achievable, state review timelines, proper electric
system planning timelines, construction schedules for replacement resources and system reliability implications must
be respected.
Many stakeholders, including several states, are raising red flags regarding this expansive proposed rule that impacts
the resources we use and how we use them to serve our customers. FERC technical conferences continue to confirm the
issues of the aggressiveness of the 2020 targets and the need for reliability safeguard mechanisms. We are hopeful that
EPA will actively listen to these major concerns and that the final rule due out during the summer will resolve some of
these concerns.
From AEP's perspective as the owner and operator of the largest transmission system in this country including the
765-kV backbone of the Eastern Interconnect and one of the largest generators in the country, we take our
responsibilities regarding the reliable operation of our grid seriously. We stand ready to work with all stakeholders
including the EPA, Congress and the states to get this right; too much is at stake.
So now I'll move on to the equalizer slide, which is page four, and I'll go through some of the states that we are dealing
with here. So from an Ohio perspective, this ROE is in line with expectations, sort of it's around 12% to 12.2%, so
round off in there, but it's split between the last and the current ESP period, so we don't have any concern about those
numbers. The PUCO yesterday did accept the application for rehearing of the ESP matter, so that was great news that
they are willing to take that on again.
As far as APCo is concerned, I just talked about the current West Virginia rate case, so that's really what is occurring
there. And we've talked about that for several quarters now, so hopefully, we'll get a good outcome on this rate case for
that ROE to move up.

Kentucky is really atrocious at this point. It's at 2.4%. That is because of the provision, the regulatory provision that
was [ph] recording (10:30) the fuel cost recovery disallowance that was related to that Mitchell no-load cost that I
talked about earlier. We have the rate case going on there as well, so hopefully, we'll be able to move forward with
some type of settlement and improve Kentucky's situation.
I&M will continue to improve. There's great regulatory framework in place there and support for capital programs at
Rockport with solar with the Nuclear Life Cycle Management Transmission Distribution projects. There's a lot of great
work going on there, so we fully expect I&M to continue to improve.
PSO is right in line with expectations. There's some O&M timing issues there. So – but at 9.2% it's in pretty good
shape. SWEPCO continues to struggle with the Turk portion, the Arkansas portion of Turk. We did get some positive
legislation that allowed for the ability to really roll through with a rate case and recover Turk, but we really need to
wait for the conditions to be right from a market perspective so that we can make a proper filing. So we obviously are
watching that process. In the meantime, SWEPCO continues with additional cases: transmission recovery in Texas; the
Louisiana commission approved the latest rates there, $15 million of revenue additional; and then also new cases will
be filed in certain areas of the SWEPCO jurisdictions as well. So, we'll continue to see some lagging, but hopefully
we'll get to a point where we can get the Turk portion all settled out.
As far as AEP Texas is concerned it's come down quite a bit because of increased distribution CapEx. We're spending a
lot of money there with additional customers being connected and that kind of thing. But also, we've had to infuse
equity to replace tax obligations that were due to the related deferred taxes from securitization. So there's been an
equity infusion there that's changed those numbers.
And then as far as the transmission is concerned, the holding company for transmission is right on target with where it
needs to be, and we continue to invest heavily in transmission. So, it's slightly down from last quarter. It's 8.7%, but we
expect that to come up in future quarters.
So with that said, I wanted to talk a little bit about the unregulated generation. That process continues, obviously, with
the capacity performance delay that's occurred relative to FERC. Hopefully, FERC will act on that soon and then the
markets can go forward with the capacity auctions which are of considerable value in this process, we believe. So we
need to see the outcome of that and then see how the PPA process progresses as well within the state of Ohio as we
move forward in those decisions. But the framework is set. The groundwork is set. We just need to plug in the numbers
and understand the valuation. So that's really an update on that portion of it at this point.
So before I conclude, I want to give a shout out to our employees who typically listen to some of these calls and
particularly at the disposition plants, which among them are those units that'll be retiring at the end of May. As you
know, we're retiring almost 5,750 megawatts of generation that's going to retire here in May. The closure of the plant
sites is a difficult process, one in which generating units are harvested with a little investment inquiring the ingenuity of
those involved to keep running with what I call Swiss cheese boilers.
And there's also the very personal sacrifice of those employees and their families that'll now move on with their lives at
other plants or retire or sever from the company. These generating units that provide the backbone of the American
dream for decades, providing power to this country and countless benefits to the communities we are privileged to
serve. In the age of the word coal being a four-letter word in some circles and not even mentioned among America's
resources, even though coal still is the predominant fuel, we want to say thank you and job well done for those that
understand what it takes to make our power system work and how important your work has been for so long.
So overall, a great quarter, a great foundation to build upon, and we continue with all cylinders clicking, so I'll turn it
over to Brian.

Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. On slide five you'll see our comparison of 2015 operating results to
2014 by segment for the quarter. Operating earnings for the quarter were $625 million or $1.28 per share, compared to

$1.15 per share or $560 million last year. This solid performance was driven by the execution of our regulatory plans,
continued growth in our Transmission segment, O&M cost control, and strong marketing results, which together more
than offset the adverse effect of lower wholesale power prices. Weather had an equally strong impact on the first
quarters of both 2015 and 2014.
With that as an overview, let's review the major earnings drivers by segment for the quarter on slide 6. 2015 earnings
for the Vertically Integrated Utilities segment were $0.61 per share, up $0.04 from last year. The major drivers for this
segment include the favorable effects of rate changes, regulatory provisions and lower O&M expenses, partially offset
by a decline in off-system sales margins and normalized load.
Rate changes and regulatory provisions were recognized across many of our jurisdictions, adding $0.04 and $0.03 per
share, respectively. The favorable effect of rate changes on earnings is related to incremental investment to serve our
customers. The effect of the Virginia rate freeze included in regulatory provisions added $0.03 per share. This segment
also benefited from lower O&M expense, primarily due to the reduced employee-related costs, adding $0.03 per share
to the quarterly comparison.
The $0.09 per share decline in off-system sales margin was driven by much lower power prices this year. The favorable
$0.04 per share PJM expenses was related to high PJM costs during last year's polar vortex events that were not
recovered in rates. Normalized load adversely affected the comparison by $0.04 per share and was primarily driven by
lower residential sales in the East. I'll talk more about load in the economy in a few minutes.
The Transmission & Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.20 per share for the quarter, unchanged from 2014. The
Transmission Holdco segment continues to grow, contributing $0.07 per share for the quarter, an increase of 40% over
last year. Year-over-year, this segment's net plant grew by approximately $1.1 billion, an increase of 61%.
The Generation & Marketing segment produced earnings of $0.38 per share, adding $0.05 to the quarter. This was
driven by the strong performance of our generation and commercial organizations. The quarterly results also benefited
from lower operating expenses at our power plants.
AEP River operations contributed $0.02 per share in 2015, $0.01 more than last year due to lower operating costs.
Corporate and other earnings were $0.01 better than year's results.
In summary, our regulated utilities executed on their rate and investment plans, exercised cost discipline and benefited
from cold weather. In addition, our competitive businesses took advantages of the opportunities presented to them. The
combination of these efforts allowed us to exceed last year's first quarter performance by 11%. In all, as Nick said, the
company is off to a good start in 2015.
Now, let's take a look at slide seven to review normalized load performance. Starting in the lower right corner, you can
see that weather normalized retail load was down 1.3% compared to last year. Overall, the decline in normalized
residential sales more than offset the growth that we saw in our industrial class. In the upper left quadrant, you can see
that our residential sales were down 4% compared to last year. However, as Nick said earlier, in 2014, we experienced
the coldest winter in AEP service territory in over 35 years including the two polar vortex events which may be
skewing the year-over-year comparison.
As we discussed previously, we saw consumer behavior change during these extreme weather conditions. So while the
4% drop in residential sales this quarter is noticeable, residential usage is in line with expectations. In fact, since 2013
our first quarter residential sales have grown by an average of one-tenth of a percent per year, with modest growth in
customer counts being offset by slight decline in customer usage. Our residential customer growth for this quarter
remains steady at three-tenths of a percent in line with last year. This gives us comfort that the load forecast underlying
our 2015 guidance is on track.
In the upper-right corner of the slide, you see commercial sales were down four-tenths of a percent for the quarter,
consistent with our projection for the year. We saw the strongest commercial sales growth this quarter in the
Transmission & Distribution Utility segment where customer counts increased by seven-tenths of a percent. By
comparison, the Vertically Integrated segment saw commercial customer count growth of four-tenths of a percent.

Finally, in the lower left quadrant, you see our industrial sales growth moderated a bit from last quarter, but still grew
by 1.2%. We continue to see robust industrial sales growth from customers in oil and gas related sectors, despite the
recent decline in oil prices, which I'll cover in more detail later in the presentation. Outside of the oil and gas sectors,
we saw the strongest growth in the chemicals and transportation equipment manufacturing sectors, both of which
benefited from low oil and natural gas prices.
With that, let's review the most recent economic data for AEP service territory on slide eight. Starting with GDP, the
estimated 3.3% growth for the U.S. economy eclipsed the 2.1% growth for AEP's aggregate service territory. The
comparison to the U.S. should not be interpreted as weakness within AEP's regional economy since we've seen steady
growth of over 2% for the last seven quarters.
I'd like to point out in the upper-right chart that the improvement we saw in our Eastern footprint this quarter was offset
by a modest slowing in our Western footprint which has greater exposure to falling oil prices. In the bottom-left
quadrant, you can see that the job market within AEP's service area continues to improve in step with U.S. employment
recovery. Once again, job growth within AEP's Western territory exceeded both the U.S. and the AEP's Eastern service
area. The sectors showing the strongest growth for the quarter included construction, leisure and hospitality and
manufacturing. We should point out that the sector which saw the biggest drop compared to last quarter is the natural
resources and mining sector, which is not surprising given the decline in oil prices and active rig counts.
Now, let's turn to slide nine to update you on the domestic shale gas activity happening within AEP's footprint. We are
still seeing significant load increases in the parts of our service territory located in and around major shale formations.
For the quarter, industrial sales in shale counties were up 14% compared to the six-tenths of a percent decline in
non-shale counties. We've added the price of oil to the slide and it shows that while we are still seeing significant
growth in industrial sales within our shale counties, the growth has moderated somewhat over the past nine months as
the price of oil began to drop. The bottom chart highlights our industrial sales growth by major shale region. It shows
that we are experiencing growth in all the major shale plays within AEP service territory with the exception of the
Eagle Ford area. The strongest growth for the quarter is happening around the Woodford, Marcellus and Utica shale
regions.
The shale county charts on slide nine show the industrial sales growth for specific geographies which includes direct,
indirect and other support industries as well.
On slide 10, I'd like to narrow the scope to show you just the industrial sales performance for the oil and gas related
sectors. There are three sectors to examine here. Oil and gas extraction, which captures the upstream activity of
exploration production; pipeline transportation, which captures midstream activity and includes processing, storing and
transporting oil and natural gas liquids; and petroleum and coal products, which includes downstream activities of
refining and producing the finished product.
We are using this chart to illustrate a few points. First, we've not seen the impact of falling oil prices in our sales to the
oil and gas sectors. We have noticed some impact to customers in support industries like metals who provide the tubing
used in drilling operations. But our sales to the oil and gas extraction sector continue to grow at a steady pace. This is
consistent with the production data published by the Energy Information Administration's monthly drilling report. Thus
far although rig counts are down 43% from the end of last quarter, production remains near historic levels.
The second point to make here is that we are seeing the most substantial growth in sales to midstream customers. In
fact, the pipeline transportation sector has been so large that it has jumped from our 10th largest sector in 2013 to the
5th largest sector currently.
Finally, while we have heard of a few delayed or canceled projects that were originally planned for later this year, we
have also learned of other industrial expansions.
In summary, this quarter's load performance was not a surprise and we are comfortable with our underlying load
forecast.

Turning to slide 11, let's review the financial health of the company. Our debt to total capital has improved to 53.8%.
Our credit metrics, FFO interest coverage and FFO to debt have improved from last quarter and are solidly in the BBB
and Baa1 range at 5.62 times and 22.2%, respectively. The funded status of our qualified pension decreased
approximately 1% over the quarter and now stands at 96% funded. This was largely driven by a 19 basis point decrease
in the discount rate.
The funded status of our OPEB obligation stands at a healthy 116%, down slightly from 118% at year end. This
decrease was also driven by falling discount rates. In addition, our liquidity position stands at $3.5 billion. This is
supported by our two revolving credit facilities that extend into the summers of 2017 and 2018.
On a final note, we are working to refinance our AEP Generation Resources $500 million term loan facility. By the end
of the month, we intend to close on the new facility that will result in reduced rates and fees, while maintaining the
strategic flexibility we need at this juncture.
Let me close with slide 12 by saying the company is off to a strong start for 2015 with all of our business segments
finishing equal to or better than last year's results. We are committed to deliver a 4% to 6% growth rate, and we are
reaffirming our 2015 operating earnings guidance range of $3.40 to $3.60 per share. As Nick described earlier, we are
in the midst of some key regulatory proceedings in Kentucky and West Virginia that could have significant impact on
2015 earnings and beyond.
We are maintaining the discipline around operating expenses that you have come to expect from us. And finally
Transmission Holdco is on track to deliver $0.38 per share of earnings this year, up from $0.31 last year. The
investment in critical transmission infrastructure continues to provide us with growth opportunities well into the
foreseeable future.
With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Daniel Eggers at Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Daniel L. Eggers>: Hey, good morning, guys.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Hi Dan, how are you?
<Q - Daniel L. Eggers>: Great thank you.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Good, good.
<Q - Daniel L. Eggers>: On the Ohio generation conversation you've gotten a little more public as far as your
prospective plans for exiting that business. If we thought about kind of a timeline of progression of thought, how much
clarity do you guys need to see around RPM or around maybe First Energy's PPA process in Ohio before you feel like
you're at a point where you're going to optimize the value of those assets?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah. So certainly we need to see, as I mentioned earlier, the capacity performance.
Hopefully, FERC will approve that. We can get on with the capacity auctions. We have some interim auctions as well
as a result of that. And then we also have some auctions on the Ohio side that occur in April, May timeframe. So – and
then, so that's one set of issues and that's on the right side of the ledger.
On the left side of the ledger is the PPA issue itself. And it sounds like FE is going to be in hearings some in June, July
timeframe. So we would want to hear directionally where the Commission is going regarding the PPAs. Obviously,
we've got the open door in terms of the last order we received. They said it was legal and we could do the filings. But
we really need some directions in terms of what that means going forward. Now whether that's defined by the FE case
or our rehearing or our case remains to be seen. But certainly with the new leadership over at the Ohio Commission,

we're hopeful that we can see a more consistent approach to this and make sure we get these orders out quickly so that
the market, particularly in Ohio, can understand where we're going next. So those are two big value propositions that
we need to get a sense of in this overall process.
<Q - Daniel L. Eggers>: And I guess you guys talked about you're using that money, presumably I guess to go in a
transmission investment or back into the utility business. How quickly can you scale CapEx at transmission if you were
to get that large amount of sale proceeds back in? Is it a multiyear process to deploy the capital? Or how speedy can
you be using that money elsewhere?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah, so with our transmission business, we have a really good speed toward moving
projects forward. I mean, we have a whole litany of projects that are ready, willing and able from a capital standpoint.
So we're ready from that perspective. But typically, it'll take a couple of years before we start to see the earnings from
these facilities to be put in place. So it remains to be seen. It's something we'll have to feel our way through in terms of
whether share buybacks, earnout, or something like that in a transaction. Those things are critically important to
determine the amount of dilution during that period of time and, obviously, we're trying to mitigate any dilution that
could occur during that period. So lot of work going into what the options are – that are available to us. But just know
that we are focused on trying to mitigate any type of transition from that respective.

And our next question will come from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.
<Q - Gregory Harmon Gordon>: Thanks. Looking at page 15 on the key drivers for the Vertically Integrated
Utilities, there's a $31 million favorable in the quarter from decreases in unrecovered PJM charges. Can you both talk
us through what that specifically is? And is that going to annualize or is that sort of related to polar vortex issues?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Greg, this is Brian. Good morning. It was mostly related to the polar vortex issues and it was
related to costs associated with reserves and operating expenses at PJM passed through to us in the real time during
those polar vortexes that over time and rates we could get reflected, but given that it happened in real time and we
couldn't get those in rates immediately, we had to eat during 2014.
<Q - Gregory Harmon Gordon>: Great. While we're on the subject of PJM is the deadline for FERC to allow PJM to
extend its tariff and hold its capacity auction later in the summer than the current schedule is tomorrow. Is it your
expectation that we're going to get an extension?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Certainly that would be the best outcome. Who knows what FERC will come up with, but I
would suspect with the actual operator in terms of the options requesting that because of the disruption that would
occur relative to the market itself I think it's probably – it should be a no-brainer, but it remains to be seen. But our
expectation – I mean, we would surprised if they didn't at this point.
<Q - Gregory Harmon Gordon>: I think so would the market, but...

<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Morning.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: So, perhaps to follow the sales question, can you comment a little bit about the River
operations and where you stand on that? And the thought process about that in the context of a regulated mix a little
bit?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah. So, as far as River ops is concerned, we obviously announced that we engaged
Morgan Stanley to work with us on that process. That process continues and it's another one of our commercial
businesses that we're looking at relative to the valuation and disposition of that business. And they're doing a great job
and the company is in great shape, but we want to make sure that it fits strategically within the framework that we have
going forward. And so that process continues and I really can't say anything more about it at this point in time.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Do you have a timeframe that you're thinking about though, just broadly?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Well, my view is that that transaction, if it were to occur, certainly has less issues with it in
terms of milestones to get through. So I would say that the ease of that transaction is probably very different than the
rest of the unregulated generation on the commercial side.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Got it. And then turning to the regulated business here, let's go down south, Arkansas.
In terms of Turk, can you comment on the process to address that and kind of avenues for this year?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah, so at this point I mean, SWEPCO is in a situation where the market with natural gas
and those types of issues are of legitimate concern. So you want to make sure you can put the best foot forward
whenever you do go in for recovery of Turk. And the legislation certainly helped out in terms of bypassing a CCN
process and being able to file part and parcel to a rate case type of environment. So we've got to make sure that from an
overall rate case standpoint, that it would make sense to file in Arkansas, not only in terms of valuation of Turk and be
able to put forward a credible case, but also where you stand from an overall spend situation in Arkansas as well. So
we're going to have to figure out the timing of that kind of filing.
Meanwhile, SWEPCO continues to work on other things to reinforce the valuation. We have a large steel customer
that's coming online later on this summer, and also we've got several other cases in Louisiana and in Texas with the
recovery mechanisms in place there, with formula rates and so forth, and transmission actually true-ups of those kinds
of investments. So it's sort of a patch work to fill in until such time we can get Turk in line.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Gotcha. Excellent. Well, thank you.

<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Good morning, how are you?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Good morning, Paul.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Looking at slide seven, just kind of the residential sales were very strong last year, down this
year. But this isn't a weather-adjusted slide. Is this just kind of modeling errors on your weather-adjustment because
things were so extreme?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah. Paul, we've been debating this one for a quarter now. But it's sort of interesting and
I'll give my rendition and, certainly, Brian has a lot deeper information on this. But when I was doing load forecasting
early in my career, it was down in Texas and you'd have 45 days of 100-degree weather. And you'd see this thing occur
that wind up being a step change in a super peak. And I think it wound up with customers deciding to heck with it, I'm

going to turn my air conditioner on in this heat. So you sort of see a step change.
I think you saw the same thing in the polar vortex in 2014 where it's consistently sub-zero for a long period of time and
at some point people just sort of decide they want to be comfortable. And so you're sort of measuring a present day
versus an anomaly and that sort of drives a skewing of the residential information. That's why I said earlier we want to
see how that settles out from quarter-to-quarter going forward so we understand exactly what the steady state aspects of
that is. Brian?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Paul, just adding to that a little bit. I think across the industry, we saw weather normalization
in residential in the first quarter of last year look similar to ours and it looked a little bit out of whack and it sort of
normalized over the balance of the year. That's why, as Nick said, the quarter-on-quarter comparison of this year to last
year looks kind of negative. We're interested in seeing how the balance of the year flattens out and what that looks like.
But really believe last year's first quarter weather normalization to be a bit of an anomaly.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: So it's an art, not a science. Okay. And then last year after a very strong first quarter, you
started to talk about pulling forward some O&M from the forward year. At what point are you comfortable doing that
in 2015?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah, Paul, we're starting that process now. Actually, we've already started it. We do have
some O&M we've identified that could be pulled forward, but at the same time it becomes – we can pull $60 million
forward last year. So, now you're really getting into areas where okay, can you pull forward from that perspective. So it
becomes little bit more difficult so we're having to reach deeper and think really hard about how much we can actually
move forward. So that process is continuing and something that we're very mindful of, given that we started the year
somewhat ahead.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Is it reluctance to do it until you get a little more of the year under your belt? Or is it just you...
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: No. No, I think we've identified and started that process and we'll continue it on. Now keep
in mind, last year, we had a relatively mild summer. So we'll continue looking at the levers and looking at the
quarter-by-quarter performance, and we'll make adjustments accordingly, and we've gotten pretty good at that.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Thank you very much.

And our next question in line will come from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Good morning. Can you hear me?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Hello, Paul. Yeah, I can hear you.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Just first of all on the trading business, that seemed to be pretty beneficial this quarter, what are
the expectations for the year?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Yeah, so we think it's in line with what we previously stated for that business, Paul, there are
a couple of things going on there. They continue to do their normal activity. So the trading and marketing that they do,
they had a couple of big deals that they got closed in Texas, which were positive for the quarter. But don't forget that
when we laid guidance out for 2015, there's about a $0.35 hit associated with changes in capacity revenues in that
business. So we think we're on track. We're a little bit skewed towards being ahead for the quarter, but the real drags on
that business are going to be the latter half of the year as we experience the fall-off in capacity revenues.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: And what happened to Texas, I'm sorry if I missed that?

<A - Brian X. Tierney>: We just – we had some normal ongoing marketing activity that we do down there. And so as
we own these businesses, we're going to continue to operate them with an eye towards the long-term. And they were
able to renegotiate and change the terms a bit on a couple of contracts that they have down there, which is normal
ongoing business for us, but that was beneficial to the quarter.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. Then in terms of just Ohio, I mean, is everything pretty much is going to be – I mean,
obviously, there's all this focus on PUCO and stuff, is there any potential for the Governor or any other sort of direction
just sort of come from I guess legislative or the executive branch in terms of the direction that the state wants to go
into? Or is it really just going to be something that PUCO is going to be sort of wrestling with on its own? Any
thoughts about that?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: I think for the time being it's going to be centered at the Commission because Andre Porter
has moved over as Chairman. He previously was involved with the deregulation that occurred some three years ago,
and so he knows and understands the issues and also hopefully understands the lessons that have been learned since
then as well. And I think he and the Commission under his leadership will continue to provide direction, but also
consistency and get these orders done. He has also brought on a new chief of staff, which we have certainly met and he
appears to be very, very professional about what he's doing as well. So I think with some sense of consistency around
leadership and in terms of direction associated with the staff itself, at least I'm hopeful that things will start moving
pretty expeditiously in Ohio.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. And then just finally, you see this issue between PJM and MISO, there's been some
activity in it and I think there's been sort of push on the part of FERC to move things along. Do you guys see any
significant impact from that positive or negative? I mean, you guys are sort of in different areas there and, of course,
we've got questions about what's going to happen with the merchant sector anyway. But anything we should be
thinking about with respect to that and how it might impact your merchant plans?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: No. I don't think we see much impact from our perspective. And as far as MISO is
concerned, I mean, one thing is for sure, they really need to start thinking – PJM and MISO need to administer that
contract they have with each other from an operational standpoint. I know there's been issues that have come up
relative to how they actually administer the flows over the lines. But I think as far as we're concerned though, we're in
pretty decent shape.

And our next question will come from Brian Chin with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brian J. Chin>: Hi. Good morning. Just a quick one.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Morning.
<Q - Brian J. Chin>: On the 4% to 6% EPS CAGR growth rate outlook. In general, is there a Brent crude oil price
environment that you're thinking about when you reaffirm that guidance. I realize these things are sort of probabilistic,
but it would be helpful to know if you've got an oil price in line?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: No, certainly we haven't gotten down into the fundamentals that much, but from our
perspective it's really around natural gas pricing. And as far as oil pricing is concerned, it's a measure of how much the
rig count changes. And – but that's reflected in natural gas as well. So from our perspective, we continue to look at least
our factors relative to the industrial mix that we have and the impact of energy prices because even low oil prices can
reflect well in the economy that we serve. And so, we have sort of a natural hedge going on here where oil and gas
pricing has benefited some counties with shale gas production and that kind of thing. But on the other hand, low natural
gas prices have helped chemical manufacturer, car manufacturing and so forth. Brian, do you have something you want
to add?

<A - Brian X. Tierney>: No, that last point that got – kind of nailed it in my mind, Nick, in that we do have that
natural hedge going on and we see things like transportation, equipment manufacturing is positively impacted by the
low oil and gas pricing. So where we see some delays or closures in terms of economic expansion, we also see some
expansions going on and those things to-date have really offset one another.

And the next question will come from Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - Anthony C. Crowdell>: Good morning, guys. I have a question on slide six on I guess in three of the business
segments. You guys had some cost-cutting error or some cost management where O&M was or operating costs were a
positive driver. I mean, how much more can we expect of that going forward? Or is this more of a timing issue?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Some of it's timing, but overall, you'll continue to see O&M continue to be consistent from
the perspective of ensuring that we mitigate any increases, because obviously you have overheads, salaries, those kinds
of things continue to go up. But we're mitigating that in many respects from an O&M perspective. So our O&M stack
continues to be relatively consistent from year-to-year. We expect that to happen. So Brian, you have [indiscernible]
(46:28)...
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Yeah. Anthony, we've worked really hard to keep that O&M flat to down over the last
several years. And then looking out into 2016 as we have this capacity revenue challenges in that year, we're very, very
focused on keeping O&M in a very tight range. We've been able to keep it in that $2.9 billion, $2.8 billion to $3.1
billion range, even with some of the natural increases that you'd expect that we'd have associated with things like our
transmission expansion. So the Lean activities that Nick talked about have us very focused on O&M, keeping it flat to
down over the long-term. And what you see on slide six is what you should anticipate seeing going forward as well.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: So I think it may be a part of both, but keep in mind that there'll be a consistent view toward
that perspective.
<Q - Anthony C. Crowdell>: Great. And just lastly, I know you've probably spoken ad nauseam of it, just the
unregulated generation in Ohio. If I understand correctly, before any decisions made on how AEP handles it, you want
some clarity on the capacity performance auction and also the Ohio PPA process, is that accurate?

Page 13 of 16
<Q - Ali Agha>: Just listening in to the commentary and from the results as well, is it fair to assume that first quarter
puts you somewhat ahead of budget? Obviously, it's very early in the year. And if so, how much cushion is there for
you right now? You talked about pulling forward some expenses. Is there any way to quantify how much cushion you
have as we look for the rest of the year?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: I think we have enough cushion to be comfortable with starting to take steps on and being
more aggressive about what we do relative to moving O&M up and doing other things to reinforce the issues that we
have in 2016. So just as with last year where we got ahead, we'll be looking at taking additional steps and we'll manage
that from quarter-to-quarter.
So in this case though, I think you have a quarter where certainly it looks – it's really positive. But you sort of have a
different set of underlying factors to consider like last year at this point in time there really wasn't much of a rate stack
to fill in or anything like that. And this time there's some larger swings that can occur. So I'd say overall, we're very
confident about our ability to aggressively pursue in a positive way. I mean, obviously it's a better problem to have than
if it was on the down side. So we feel good about where we're at.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Ali, you kind of come to expect from us over the years that we're going to manage our way
through a year and across years and that's exactly what we're doing. So, the guidance that we laid out we're still
comfortably within that guidance for the year. And as the year goes on depending on what happens with earnings and
cash flows and the like, you're going to see us managing our way to stay in a range that puts us in that guidance and
then within that 4% to 6% growth range that we've talked about over several years.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Okay, got it. And also just to clarify another point on the merchant. In the past, Nick, you've been
fairly consistent that you expected to reach a resolution over the summer timeframe. And we've talked about some
things getting pushed back. Even if the PJM capacity gets pushed back, I think they're still talking June through
August, so I guess technically still in the summer while the PPA rider maybe further down the road. So, is summer time
still what we should think about? Or how should we think about given some of these delays and some of these
milestones?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah, I think it's difficult to tell at this point because obviously PJM is trying to push
aggressively to get the auction done as quickly as possible. So, if we hit early summer and that kind of thing. And then
the previous questioner obviously was asking somewhat the same thing. From the Ohio perspective, we just need to
know directionally what Ohio is going to do. So, whether that comes from our re-hearing or FEs PPA case or ultimately
our larger PPA case, we just need to understand what that sense of direction is going to be. And so, I'm not going to say
it's going to fall back at this point from a decisional process. Certainly, the delay takes away some of the wiggle room
that you had for the summer. But it's really hard to say at this point, and we'll have to keep our ear close to the ground
in terms of what FERC is doing and what the Ohio Commission is doing to resolve that issue. But I guess my main
point is that we've gone through the analysis. Our board had been involved every step of the way. So our reaction time
is very minimal at this point. We just need the factual information.
<Q - Ali Agha>: All right. And one last quick question. In your longer-term transmission growth slide that you've
shared with us, you've had higher growth case scenarios, particularly for 2016 and 2017 that are fairly meaningfully
higher than base scenarios. Any of those projects yet that have moved into base as we look into 2016, 2017 outlook?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Not in that timeframe. We've been able to fill in some of the gap in 2015 so far. But, Ali, as
you look at some of the earlier questions that we got, if there are going to be transactions in terms of use of proceeds,
that's primarily where we'd be focused on filling in the gaps.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Got it. Got it. Thank you.

And our next question will come from Michael Lapides, Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Hey, guys. Congrats on a good start of the year.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Thanks, Michael.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: When we think about last year, you had a great first quarter and you talked about moving
some O&M into 2014. And you've talked a little bit about doing it this year, although sounds like there's not as much
wiggle room there. But one of the other things you did last year is you moved up a couple of hundred million dollars of
transmission spend into 2014 or you raised your transmission CapEx view for prompt year. Just curious whether you're
likely to do the same thing this year, given such a strong or healthy start to the year?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Michael, a couple of things on that. One is we had about a $200 million planned and funded
to higher transmission spend. We've been able to move dollars out of other CapEx buckets that we've had into
transmission, and that includes both the Transmission Holdco and the Vertically Integrated Utilities transmission spend.
So of that $200 million, we've been able to fund about $80 million of that. And then, just on the prior question from
Ali, if there are to be proceeds from transactions that might happen later this year, the primary place for that to go
would be the transmission spend.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Yeah, and I'm just thinking outside of transactions because that's kind of bigger dollars
versus where I'm focused here. I didn't know if you're making another increase to expected transmission spend given a
strong first quarter 2015, similar to like what you did in the first quarter of 2014?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Not at this point...
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Not at this point. No. But just know that we continue to advance our transmission spend and
if conditions wind up that way, we'll be happy to do it.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it. And because when I start looking, Brian, at the balance sheet and kind of your
capitalization ratios, they're getting pretty healthy. They've been getting healthy for the last couple of years, but they're
now reaching I think your FFO to debt is on a percentage wise getting at or even better than some of your targets. Just
curious about when the health of the balance sheet, regardless of having had such a strong first quarter, enables you to
deploy more capital into transmission maybe a little bit earlier than you thought?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: It's a very good point there, Michael. I think the CapEx that we spent last year, the $4.4
billion that we spent this year were predicated on those improving credit metrics. Again, if we were to change the
portfolio of businesses that we have, we think we'd have even more balance sheet capacity. I think you saw Duke get an
upgrade on the sale of its competitive generation business. We would expect similar actions by the rating agencies if we
were to transact going forward, which would give us even more balance sheet capacity. And if and when those things
happen, you know where we're going to be spending those dollars. It's going to be on that transmission growth story
that we have going on.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it. Last question just thinking about transmission, we've seen some changes come out
of the FERC regarding transmission ROEs. We've seen a multitude of cases in other RTOs in the Midwest ISO and in
ISO New England. We haven't seen a lot of activity regarding that in PJM. Just curious for your view on kind of why
PJM is one of the few regions where we haven't seen a lot of Section 206 type cases for FERC ROEs.

<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: I think you haven't seen ROEs out of the realm of the reasonableness. So there is a
bandwidth for that. And certainly I see FERC continuing to encourage the investment in transmission. And so you see
some of these one-off type of cases and they have their own situations whether it's their RTO premium, that kind of
thing. And when you look at the aggregated total from an ROE perspective, we're still within the range of
reasonableness comfortably. So we don't expect much change from our perspective.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated.
<A - Bette Jo Rozsa>: Operator, we have time for one more question.
Operator
Thank you. And that'll come from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie Research.
<Q - Angie Storozynski>: Thank you very much. So I have two questions again about the merchant power business.
So just so we're clear, assuming that the capacity auction clears at strong levels, would that be bullish indicators for a
possibility of PPAs in Ohio, in a sense that that would allow you guys to prove that those PPAs would be beneficial to
rate payers?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Angie, you bring up a great point and certainly one that we think about a lot, because there's
two sides of the equation that are working here. And as you talk about PJM and what FERC could do and the capacity
auctions. If the capacity auctions improve considerably, then that may in fact have a negative impact on the ability for
PPAs. And I'm saying negative from our perspective because the market is saying the value of that capacity is going up
considerably.
So you look at what Ohio is doing and Ohio looks like a long-term PPA customer to us. And typically, long-term PPA
customers will enter into contracts when prices are lower so that they can lock in value for customers in the future. And
my concern is, is if the market continues to increase considerably that we'll be looking at investors saying: well, why
are you entering into PPAs with a market going up considerably and that'll be a problem for us.
So I think the Ohio Commission and the state of Ohio really needs to think about that in terms of the long term stability
of Ohio and where it's placed in the market right now because we've demonstrated that the PPAs are a benefit to
customers over the long-term. And so a decision needs to be made. So to me, I think in some cases the race is on, and
we've got to get this resolved.
<Q - Angie Storozynski>: Okay. And secondly, assuming that you do sign those PPAs for 2,700 megawatts and that –
or similar things happened to FirstEnergy's assets and potentially other diversified utilities in the state, so how do you
think those PPAs are going to impact the value of the remaining 5,000 megawatts that you will be planning to sell on
an auction basis?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah, so the units that are placed in the 2,700 megawatts, they're ones that – or still fit well
in the market, but they're probably the most at risk. And Ohio has to look at that from, we want to keep the generation,
we want to keep it running, we want to keep the taxes, the jobs, but they're still a benefit to customers. So the other
generation will continue to fit very well into the market. And then from the PPA perspective of generation fleet itself, if
it's approved the way we presented it with a long-term approach that's essentially life of plant and those kinds of things,
it becomes somewhat neutral because you have a situation there where it is quasi-regulated.
So I think it could wind up being a really good fit because you would have the certainty around a portion of the
portfolio in Ohio and then Ohio could still take advantage of any market fluctuations that may occur, just like we do
with any other portfolio we have. There's a fixed portion. There's a variable portion. And I think that's ultimately best
for customers, just like we do fuel.
<Q - Angie Storozynski>: Very good. Thank you.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yep.
