MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Bryant, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to
welcome everyone to the BlackRock, Incorporated Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2016 Earnings Teleconference.
Our host for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer,
Gary S. Shedlin; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade. All lines have been placed
on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period.
[Operator Instructions]
Thank you. Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference.
Christopher J. Meade
Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I'm Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I'd like to
remind you that during the course of this call we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your
attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may, of course, differ from these statements.
As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which list some of the factors that may cause the results of
BlackRock to differ materially from what we see today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update
any forward-looking statements.
With that, I'll turn it over to Gary.

Thank, Chris. Good morning and Happy New Year to everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the fourth quarter
and full year 2016. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and
business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I will be focusing
primarily on as-adjusted results.
The differentiation and strength of BlackRock's diverse global investment and technology platform allowed us to
continue to invest for growth during 2016 despite market volatility and macro, political uncertainty during the year. We
saw strong results in our iShares, institutional and technology businesses, but remain committed to investing in a
variety of strategic initiatives that will further enhance our client proposition and generate long-term value for
shareholders.
Against a challenging backdrop for the asset management industry, BlackRock once again executed on each component
of our framework for shareholder value creation. BlackRock generated $202 billion of total net inflows in 2016, the
strongest close in our history, including nearly $100 billion in the fourth quarter. We expanded our full year operating
margin by 80 basis points to 43.7%. Finally, after investing for growth, we returned approximately $2.7 billion of
capital to shareholders during the year.
In the fourth quarter, BlackRock generated operating income of $1.2 billion and earnings per share of $5.14, both up
8% from a year ago. Full year operating income of $4.7 billion was flat versus a year ago, while earnings per share of
$19.29 was down 2% reflecting lower non-operating income and a higher tax rate in 2016.
Non-operating results for the quarter included $6 million of net investment gains. Recall that non-operating results in
the last year's fourth quarter included a $35 million unrealized gain on a strategic private equity investment. Our
as-adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 28.6%, reflecting the impact of several non-recurring items compared to a rate
of 30% a year ago. We continue to estimate that 31% remains a reasonable projected tax run rate for 2017, though the
actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of non-recurring or discrete items and potential tax reform.
In an environment where growth in the asset management industry has been elusive, BlackRock's diverse global
platform is thriving, delivering outcomes for our clients and differentiated organic growth for our shareholders.
BlackRock's fourth quarter total net inflows of $98 billion included $88 billion of long-term net inflows representing an
annualized organic asset growth rate of 7%, $18 billion of flows into our cash management business, and $7 billion of
advisory outflows related to crisis-era portfolio liquidation assignments. For the full year 2016, BlackRock generated
record total net inflows of $202 billion, including long-term net inflows of $181 billion, representing a 4% long-term
organic growth rate.
Fourth quarter base fees of $2.5 billion were up 1% year-over-year, driven by higher average AUM, but offset by the
impact of divergent beta, FX and mix shift. For the full year, base fees were effectively flat. On a constant currency
basis, base fees were up 3% versus last year's fourth quarter and 2% for the full year 2016. Sequentially, base fees were
down 2%, as the negative impact of fixed income beta, divergent equity beta and continued dollar appreciation more
than offset organic fee growth in the period.
While we delivered robust organic asset growth during the year, our blended fee rate has been impacted by a number of
factors that we have repeatedly discussed with you, including divergent equity beta and dollar appreciation, as well as
recent client preferences for lower risk asset classes and index over active strategies.
However, while these headwinds are pervasive in our industry, our broad-based solutions-focused investment platform
is built to meet client preferences in any environment whether risk on or risk off, and we remain confident that
BlackRock can consistently grow client assets and base fees, both of which ended 2016 at record highs. Fourth quarter
performance fees of $129 million were driven by our single strategy hedge fund and long-only equity products. Full
year performance fees of $295 million decreased 52% from 2015, reflecting a challenging year for the hedge fund
industry.
BlackRock Solutions fourth quarter revenue of $197 million was up 15% year-over-year and 13% sequentially. Full
year Aladdin revenue of $594 million, which represented 83% of BlackRock Solutions revenue, grew 13%

year-over-year, driven by a number of sizeable clients going live on the Aladdin platform in 2016. Aladdin is coming
off a record year in terms of new client revenue and continues to benefit from strong market demand from both
institutional asset managers as well as retail intermediaries. We have seen particularly high levels of demand for our
newest product, Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management, in the current regulatory environment and are actively
implementing for clients in the United States, Europe and Asia.
Total expense declined 3% in 2016, reflecting lower compensation expense and continued G&A expense discipline.
For the full year, compensation expense decreased $122 million or 3%, reflecting lower incentive compensation
primarily driven by lower performance fees. Recall that year-over-year comparisons of fourth quarter compensation
expense are less relevant because we determine compensation on a full year basis.
Fourth quarter G&A expense decreased $55 million year-over-year or 13% reflecting lower marketing and promotional
spend in the current quarter and $23 million of deal-related expense associated with strategic transactions executed in
the year-ago quarter. Sequentially, fourth quarter G&A expense increased $43 million, primarily reflected a planned
uptick in the year-end marketing and promotional spend, and higher foreign exchange remeasurement expense.
Full year G&A expense of $1.3 billion was 6% below 2015 level despite the impact of acquisitions on our run rate,
reflecting expense awareness in the volatile market environment. Assuming stable markets, we would expect a
modestly higher level of G&A spend in 2017.
Despite an overall decline in 2016 revenues, driven by a reduction in performance fees, we delivered 4% organic asset
growth over the last 12 months and expanded our as-adjusted operating margin to 43.7% for the year. While we remain
committed to realizing the benefits of our scale for clients and shareholders alike, we do not manage the business to a
specific margin target, either quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year. We do remain keenly focused on striking an
appropriate balance between investing for future growth and practical discretionary expense management.
During 2016, we returned approximately $2.7 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividend and share
repurchases. As we entered 2017, we remain committed to a predictable and balanced approach to capital management.
Consistent with this, our board of directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $2.50 per share, representing an
increase of 9% over the prior level. Since instituting our dividend in 2003, BlackRock has grown its annual dividend
per share at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 21%.
We repurchased approximately $1.1 billion of shares in 2016 and now had repurchased over 13 million shares during
the last four years resulting in a 13% unlevered compounded annual return for our shareholders. We remain committed
to returning excess cash flow to shareholders and anticipate a similar annual level of share repurchases in 2017.
However, such amounts could vary based on potential changes to the relative valuation of our stock price.
In connection with this ongoing commitment, our board has authorized an additional 6 million shares under our
existing share repurchase program, giving us authorization to repurchase a total of 9 million shares, including 3 million
shares which are remaining under our prior program announced in January 2015.
Our 2016 financial results reflect the benefits of our differentiated global business model. Record full year total net
inflows of $202 billion, including nearly $100 billion of net inflows in the fourth quarter, were diversified across asset
classes and benefited from significant flows into iShares, as both institutional and retail clients used ETFs for core
investments, precision exposures, and financial instruments.
Global iShares generated $49 billion of net inflows in the fourth quarter and a record $140 billion for the year,
representing full year organic growth of 13%. Fourth quarter equity iShares inflows of $51 billion were driven by
demand for U.S. market exposures, as equity markets rallied following the U.S. elections. Notwithstanding flat fourth
quarter fixed income iShares flows, which were impacted by the significant move in long-term yields during the
quarter, we continue to see an acceleration in the adoption of fixed income ETFs. Full year 2016 fixed income iShares
inflows of $60 billion represented an organic growth rate of 24%.
BlackRock's institutional franchise saw record long-term net inflows of $41 billion for the quarter and $51 billion for
the year, positive across active and index strategies for both periods. Quarterly institutional active inflows of $6 billion

were led by fixed income, multi-asset and alternatives, as clients utilized BlackRock's broad range of investment
strategies and customized solutions to achieve their investment goals. Institutional index inflows of $35 billion in the
fourth quarter were driven by fixed income inflows of $26 billion, which reflected solutions-based LDI activity
primarily in Europe.
We also ended 2016 with another strong fund-raising quarter for illiquid alternatives, raising more than $1 billion of
new commitments. Over the last four years, we've raised more than $22 billion of commitments for our fund to funds,
real estate, infrastructure, opportunistic credit, and all-solution business, and have nearly $11 billion of committed
capital to deploy for institutional clients.
BlackRock's global retail franchise saw fourth quarter outflows of $2 billion and full year outflows of $11 billion,
reflecting continued performance challenges in the active mutual fund industry, as well as macro, political and
regulatory uncertainty.
Finally, BlackRock's cash business generated $18 billion and $29 billion of net inflows in the fourth quarter and full
year respectively. Investments we've made to expand the scale of our cash management offerings drove strong flows in
2016, and we are well positioned for additional demand in market share gains in the coming year.
In summary, in a year marked by periods of market volatility, divergent beta and significant currency movements, our
diversified business model once again delivered industry-leading organic growth and consistent financial results that
allowed us to continue investing for the future. We are committed to continuously evolving our platform, as our clients'
needs change, and believe our platform is well positioned as it's ever been to meet those needs and to deliver long-term
value for our shareholders.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry.
Laurence Douglas Fink
Thanks, Gary. Happy New Year, everyone, and good morning to everyone, and thanks for joining our call. In a year
dominated by extraordinary macro and geopolitical uncertainty, BlackRock continues to earn our clients' trust by
delivering strong results.
BlackRock's fourth quarter and 2016 results reflect the benefits of continuously investing in our business to better serve
our clients. We are building out our investment teams and resources. We're expanding our technology footprint, and
we're evolving our risk management capabilities as we continue to anticipate change in the world, in our economies and
most importantly in our industry. As a result, more and more investors are turning to BlackRock to design, to deliver
investment solutions that will help them achieve their long-term financial goals.
2016 was a turbulent year for investors, whether institutions or individual investors, one that no one fully predicted.
Global political events like Brexit, the U.S. presidential election and the Italian referendum have forced many of our
clients and also ourself to rethink our assumptions and our perceptions of the world. Even with some political surprises,
the global economy began to show signs of optimism throughout 2016.
The U.S. equity market surged to all-time highs, as expectation for fiscal stimulus, reflation, and tax and regulatory
reform have sparked investor optimism and enthusiasm. The Fed's decision to raise rates in December and the signal of
additional hikes in 2017 suggests that the long period of accommodative monetary policy in the U.S. may finally
subside at a faster rate than many had anticipated.
However, uncertainty and the wave of populism upending the political status quo persists. And despite the rally in the
U.S. for domestic equities since we've had our U.S. election, many of our investors are seeing a very different
performance in their other markets. As Gary suggested, we see negative fixed income markets. We've seen
underperforming international equities and a very strong dollar, which means for the dollar-based investors with broad
global asset allocation such as pension funds, the fourth quarter was more challenging than the market perception.

We don't know exactly how the next few years will unfold, but we do know that in a challenging and changing
environment, investors will look to BlackRock more than ever before, and our responsibility that we feel for our clients
has never been greater. Throughout our history, BlackRock has always been focused on thinking ahead of our clients
and repositioning our firm in advance of those perceived changes.
Our results this year in a difficult environment for asset managers reflect the benefits of our deeper relationships that
we've built with our clients worldwide in areas where we've invested in our business over time. As Gary said,
BlackRock saw total net inflows of $202 billion for the full year of 2016, including nearly $100 billion in our fourth
quarter.
We generated record annual institutional and iShares flow of $51 billion institutionally and $140 billion in iShares. We
actually grew net assets in 15 countries greater than $1 billion. We had more than 53 products in retail and iShares that
generated more than $1 billion of net inflows. I think those two statistics alone identify the breadth of our platform.
In 2016, the BlackRock Investment Institute reached more clients, regulators and policymakers than ever before,
providing a forum for deep, timely and relevant dialog on all macro issues. The institute hosted calls after Brexit and
the U.S. election, each time reaching nearly 5,000 external participants. This type of engagement has created
tremendous value for our clients and built a deeper and more direct relationship with our clients.
We acquired BGI, an iShares franchise, more than six years ago when iShares had $385 billion in AUM. Since then, we
invested in the future of ETFs, building the market, expanding its presence, building a fixed income presence, a global
presence, building products in anticipation of change of demand, whether it's factors or a smart beta, and launched
innovative new products. We've grown our iShares AUM now to $1.3 trillion as more clients than ever before are using
ETFs for transparent, liquid and efficient exposures. And we will continue to invest very aggressively in the growth and
evolution of this market.
iShares generated $49 billion of net inflows in the fourth quarter and a record $140 billion in inflows for the full year,
earning the number one market share of global, U.S., European equities and fixed income ETF flows for 2016. ETFs
are being used by a diversified, growing set of institutional and retail clients. We are experiencing, as I've said in many
of these conferences, that we're seeing more and more investors using ETFs actively, not just for a passive exposure but
using them actively to try to get exposures where they think those exposures will outperform. We believe that will
continue to be a great, great growth area for these products. And importantly, the expansion, the diversification of the
ETF ecosystem is creating a deeper, more dynamic market for ETF trading. It is also enhancing liquidity for all
investors worldwide.
In 2016, we made a strategic investment in our U.S. core franchise to deliver the highest quality product at the best
value to our clients at a time when they needed it most. We received very positive feedback from our clients on this
move, and iShares gathered $29 billion of flows in our global core products in this quarter alone.
We also continue to invest in fixed income ETFs. BlackRock has long seen the value in fixed income ETFs and has
invested for years in building this market, even as many of our industry question this opportunity. 2016, the fixed
income ETF industry reached a milestone, crossing $600 billion in assets, with BlackRock managing a large
component of that.
During heightened market movements after the U.S. election, trading volumes in the U.S. fixed income ETFs surged to
the highest level of the year. Fixed income ETFs or iShares once again performed under stress in line with what our
clients expected when they bought iShares, offering investors substantial on-exchange liquidity. Fixed income ETFs
remain a strategic priority and a significant growth opportunity for BlackRock and our clients.
Smart beta ETFs are another area of strategic investment for BlackRock, where we are the number one player in AUM,
growing at a 37% organic growth rate in 2016. We all know that in 2016, we saw retail investors shifting away from
traditional active funds with the U.S. active equity mutual fund industry experiencing $280 billion of outflows,
representing the industry's worst year on record. And we, at BlackRock, experienced some of the same headwinds
across our traditional active mutual funds. But because the way we are positioned, because how we are trying to help
our clients by having both passive and active, we're working with the clients, as they navigate the need between active

and passive.
I believe investors are going to continue to rethink their approach to active management. They may now move more
towards factor-based strategies. They may have asset allocation or portfolio construction, but I do believe we're going
to continue to see a drive using ETFs for active returns.
We have been purposefully investing in our platforms to provide our clients with a full spectrum of offerings and to
enhance alpha-generating active strategies. We ended the quarter with 88% of our taxable fixed income, 91% of our
Scientific Active equity, and 65% of our fundamental active equity assets above benchmark or [ph] peer median (24:4)
for the five-year period. We are confident that our top-performing franchises like Asian Equities and our unconstrained
fixed income which have proven to thrive in a rising rate environment are well positioned for 2017.
Factor-based investing helps bridge the gap between active and index and has been an area of significant focus for
BlackRock and our clients in 2016. BlackRock manages over $150 billion in factor-based strategies, including smart
beta ETFs, and our factor-based AUM grew at an organic growth rate in 2016 of 17%.
We have a responsibility to provide our clients with the ability to focus on environmental and social issues while
simultaneously generating strong financial returns. We launched BlackRock's sustainable investing platform a year ago,
and it has since built a range of equity and fixed income strategies that target positive environmental and social impact.
We have frequently advocated for the benefits of infrastructure investing, and within the U.S. alone, markets are
anticipating up to $1 trillion of domestic infrastructure investments over the next few years and we all know we
desperately need those investments. BlackRock has built our infrastructure and brought our real estate platforms both
organically and inorganically over time, and we currently manage $29 billion in real asset AUM.
We invested in our global cash management business in anticipation of regulatory reform in a rising rate environment.
BlackRock is now positioned as a scale player with the broadest range of solutions. At a time when we anticipated an
uptick in demand, we saw $18 billion of inflows in our fourth quarter alone, and now we have a cash management
business that's over $400 billion.
Over the past year, we have spoken to the increasing depth and quality of the solution orientation and the
solution-oriented conversations that BlackRock is having or other institutional clients in face of this global uncertainty.
Even as these clients pause to assess the changing investment landscape, growth in 2016 was driven, in particularly, by
our financial institution business, as insurance clients looked to BlackRock for highly-customized portfolio.
Our institutional business saw a record fourth quarter and full-year net inflows across both active and passive. We have
the right pieces on our platform, but the key to designing and delivering a robust solution that targets specific outcomes
for our clients is technology, which has always been at BlackRock's core. We see strong and growing demand for
BlackRock's technology offerings. More and more asset managers, asset owners, banks, wealth managers, insurance
companies are valuing the differentiating ability of our Aladdin platform and other technology offerings at BlackRock
to help them achieve their goals.
We are constantly enhancing our existing technology as well as coming up with new ways to use Aladdin to serve our
clients. In 2016, we launched our Aladdin Risk for Wealth platform, which empowers wealth managers' home offices
to better understand risk. We also introduced Aladdin Portfolio Builder, which provides financial advisors with highly
intuitive portfolio construction tools. We continue to see robust client interest in FutureAdvisor and iRetire offerings.
We also recently announced a minority investment in partnership with iCapital, the leading technology-enabled illiquid
alternative distribution platform for retail investors.
In addition to technology, our people enable us to differentiate ourselves for our clients. Every year, together with our
board of directors, we take a fresh look at our organization, which includes developing talent and positioning our
leaders in role that can broaden their experiences and maximize their potential for BlackRock and our clients.
2016, we unified our active equity platform, we unified our beta platform, and we globalized our fixed income
platform, all of which will help us benefit from the full potential of our global investment scale. At the same time, to
create a more tailored client experience in each geography where we operate, we strengthened our regional

management of our clients and marketing activities in line with our commitment to be global with a local identity and a
local footprint. It is the quality and dedication of our teams across the globe that positions us well for 2017.
There are reasons that we have forged such trusting and trusted relationships with our clients and why our clients turn
to BlackRock to solve the biggest financial challenges. I am really proud of the depth of the talent of the firm and the
leadership we have today. We have never had a more talented group of men and women than we have today, and we
have the finest leadership in the history of the firm today.
BlackRock has been adept at repositioning our investment platform and technology capabilities in advance of change. I
promise you we will continue to be in front of those needs and will continue to change with the needs of our clients. As
paradigm shift, we will have an even greater responsibility to help our clients navigate the markets and plans for their
retirement. We have a responsibility to continue to invest in broadening and deepening our investment platform. We
have a responsibility to be a thought and opinion leader worldwide, globally and locally, to every one of our clients.
And throughout BlackRock's history, we have demonstrated the ability to invest in our business for growth like no
other firm while expanding our margins, raising our dividend rates and prudently returning capital to our shareholders.
As we enter 2017, we will continue to make investments in BlackRock's future, to grow our technology footprint, to
expand our investment capabilities and to further enhance our talent level, all to meet our daily responsibility to every
client. Whether that client has awarded us $1,000 or if that client awarded us $10 billion, we have a responsibility to
every client and we are building a firm to meet those responsibilities every day.
With that, let me open up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Please go
ahead.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Hello Craig.
<Q - Craig Siegenthaler>: Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to see if you could provide an update on U.S. retail
product demand's trends including iShares, as brokers modernize their business models for implementation of the U.S.
DoL rule.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Yeah. We're being very responsive to potential changes that the DoL announced.
Recognize that different distribution firms have decided to go in various different ways to respond to the DoL changes.
So you're going to see from some of them a shift from brokerage to advisory accounts. You're going to see some of the
index funds grow, particularly the ETFs. So there's going to be an increased focus on the performance there and, of
course, the cost. And also, what we're responding to is a growth in portfolio construction services and the need for
greater sophistication and scalable technologies where we are responding with tools like Aladdin Wealth.
So, many of this is going to be model-driven. We're responding by making sure that we are priced correctly in the
products that we're offering so that we will be included in the models at the appropriate price, that we're also providing
the technology for those institutions that need model-driven solutions. And we're also utilizing a lot of the analytics we
have to help those firms. So it's products, it's appropriate pricing, it's technology, and it's portfolio solutions. And
depending upon the distribution center, we're focusing on the appropriate ones for each one of those.

give-up, some of it mix, some of it macro, but very good margins underneath that. Appreciate your guidance on G&A.
As you look out to 2017, how do you think about that interplay between fee rates and margins, assuming the markets
are relatively consistent and not a lot of volatility in currency, which I know is asking a lot, but just trying to get an
understanding of the volume versus margin dynamic for the company looking ahead.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Let me go over some of the headwind issues that we all faced, then we could get into
the specifics. I think we have to understand the context of 2016. First and foremost, the last quarter of 2015, obviously
the equity markets fell. We had equity markets down 12% at one time in the first quarter. And so we had huge
headwinds in the first half of the year. The other big headwind that we had all year and actually accelerated in the
fourth quarter was the strength of the dollar. And so those are two of the big macro issues that we had to face.
One of the great statistics that I think about going forward into next year, our average assets in 2016 were up 2%. Our
spot close is up 11%. And that just gives you a color of some of the issues that we had. And I think that's a big macro
context of thinking about how you should think about our business. Obviously, I'm going to have Gary go into the
specificity of the fee rates, but I would just say from the top of the house, I think you said it pretty well because of the
margins, I think scale is a driver that is so important in how we look at it. I mean, when we look at lowering fees for
market share opportunities, for delivering the needs to our clients and having higher margins, this is how we think
about doing this, working and focusing on the clients' needs, doing what we think is best, building market share, but
also driving margin. But let me have Gary go into the specificity of your question.
<A - Gary S. Shedlin>: So, good morning, Bill, and thanks for asking the question. So, look, let's deal with them
separately. I think in terms of fee rate, there's really four primary reasons that you've seen a decline in our fee rate,
whether year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter or sequentially. First, obviously, is FX. We saw dollar appreciation
primarily versus the euro and the pound, roughly 4% on the euro, 16% against the pound during the year. And that
obviously, relative to the stock of our business, increases the relative weighting of our dollar-denominated assets which
tend to have lower fees than our non-U.S. dollar-denominated product.
In many cases, you're seeing a little bit of the same phenomenon in terms of equity beta. We've talked about divergent
equity beta, but this year in particular, you saw various higher fee international markets, whether it be Europe, Asia-ex
or Japan, underperforming domestic U.S. markets. And as with FX, that also increases the relative weighting of our
lower fee dollar-denominated assets under management.
We saw mix shift. When we talk about mix shift, we really talk about that as a client preference issue. So during 2016,
we saw clients favoring index over active. We saw clients favoring fixed income over equity and multi-asset. And even
within our cash business, we saw a huge preference for government over prime funds. And in each of those instances,
you're seeing changes in fee rates from what was traditionally higher fee product to at least, in this year, lower fee
product.
And then finally, we actually took some of our own action in terms of price reductions with certain iShares Core and
fixed income. That was later in the year, but again with that, what I would call investment, we've been very clear that
we think that would be accretive to shareholder value over time. And I think as you heard, we've had strong progress
to-date in terms of our core performance so far.
So, in each of these cases, all of these items are going to impact fee rates over time, but I think the key issue is, those
set of circumstances, whether they are market-driven or client-driven, will also change over time. And I think the key
issue for BlackRock is that we have a broad-based enough platform to be able to meet client preferences in any market
and to basically deliver solutions-based and outcomes to them that basically make sense. So, that's the fee rate piece of
it.
In terms of margins, I think what I would say, as we think about margins, I'll give the standard statement that we don't
manage to a margin target. I think you've all heard that long enough. But I think that in a year where we obviously saw

a difference, i.e., 4% asset growth versus less organic-based fee growth, I think we were able to demonstrate that we
can basically manage the business in that environment and, in fact, notwithstanding an overall decline in our revenues,
which was fundamentally driven by performance fees, we were still able to deliver not only 80 basis points of margin
improvement, but record flows during the year. So, again, that interplay between revenue growth and margin, I think
we're pretty well established in terms of our ability to operate in most environments.

Your next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Good morning, Ken.
<Q - Kenneth B. Worthington>: Hi. Good morning. So, to continue the fee rate discussion, what has been the
reaction to your announced lowering of fees on active products announced last quarter? And maybe given the reaction,
what are your thoughts about broadening or expanding that investment to other asset classes and other products?
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: So the response actually has been good. And without lowering the fees, we might not
be included in some of the models that a lot of the clients are now using and distribution centers are using. But what's
important to us is not only performance as one of the levers that we look to go out of use to get clients to buy our
products, but also our competitive position and where we stand in price. And most of our mutual funds have boards that
we also have to respond to as well. So since we made the changes, four of our funds have been upgraded by
Morningstar, three of the government funds and one of the high-yield funds. And they've all now become medal-rated.
And so, that's important to us so that they are included in a lot of what our distribution forces can sell and how they're
evaluated.
So beyond performance, we also want to strive to be in at least the top quartile of expenses. And of course, in a very
low-rate environment, that also helps to drive performance. So the response has been very good by those that evaluate
us, the response has been good by the distribution centers, and the response has been shown in creating and getting
more assets. So, over time, we're going to continue to be responsive to the competitive environment to make sure that
we're included in the sales of these and we expect that that sales will continue.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Hi, Michael.
<Q - Michael J. Cyprys>: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question here. Just getting back to G&A, it looks
like it's down about 8% year-on-year if you back out the one-time deal costs from a year ago. So, just can you talk to
what's driving that reduction in G&A? How much of that relates to tech projects rolling off versus a more sustainable
cost reduction? And then just as you think about G&A over the next couple of years, what level do you think is
sustainable to or required to generate your sustainable 5% organic growth?
<A - Gary S. Shedlin>: So, this year, I think, obviously, the G&A delta was, as we talked about, there was some
non-recurring items that basically were tied to our M&A activity last year, which rolled off. And frankly, this year, I
would say the big delta, as you think about G&A, obviously the biggest manageable component of that is our
marketing budget. And I think that one is one that we tried to manage appropriately in a year where we're seeing lots of
clients delay their investment allocation decisions with a lot of volatility. We'll be, obviously, looking at that pretty
carefully in the context of the current environment as we get into this year. We also, as you probably noticed, just also
hired a new Chief Marketing Officer, Frank Cooper, who will be taking his own look at our marketing and our
spending strategy, that we'll clearly be taking a careful look at.

There's also some other items that I think you have to be weary of where FX gets in the way. And also, G&A impacts
training and it has recruiting. It has a bunch of things that are obviously tied to broader growth objectives as we grow
the company. We kept our head count pretty flat last year and that was even after our first quarter reduction that we
talked about. And Larry communicated that we were continuing to be in growth mode during the year, and we were.
So, I think, frankly, the big drivers of G&A spend going forward will clearly be our ability to right-size our marketing
budget in the context of the current environment and will be tied obviously to our desire to grow head count, as we see
opportunities for growth going forward.
The final item is obviously leveraging our scale. So there is technology, there is real estate. Some of that is more a step
function as opposed to overall growth, and I think that will be important to keep in mind. I think those are really the big
issues. I think that this year was clearly, in the context of the environment, a lower year for us, and we would expect
numbers to be modestly higher from the next year.

Your next question comes from the line of Robert Lee with KBW. Please go ahead.
<Q - Robert Lee>: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Hey, Robert.
<Q - Robert Lee>: Hey. I'm a bit curious, with the capital management and your dividend increase and maybe the
signal from that, I mean, a year ago, you increased the dividend 5%. And as you mentioned, it was coming off of a
tougher fourth quarter of 2015 and a rough start to 2016. This year, it's 9%, kind of picked back up. Just kind of getting
the sense of assuming we should believe that to be the year, certainly, having improved outlook for your earnings
profile over the coming year or next several years. I just want to get some color on that.
<A - Gary S. Shedlin>: So I'll jump in and then Larry can add on his views. Look, our predictable and balanced
approach to capital management really has not changed. I think we remain, first, committed to investing in our
business. We then try to target a dividend payout ratio of around 40% to 50% on a full year basis. That's a target. That's
not a policy. And then we effectively look to return any additional cash to our shareholders in the form of share
repurchases.
The total payout ratio is really an output of how we see opportunities for the next year. It's not an input to our
budgeting or financial planning process. And over the last few years, I think you've probably seen that our share
repurchases broadly have been fairly constant in terms of dollar amounts. Obviously, as the share price has gone up, the
number of shares that we're repurchasing is going down slightly. And we've been fairly consistent in trying to increase
our dividend.
So this year, the dividend is obviously up 9% to $2.50 a share. We've obviously reloaded our share repurchase
authorization and expect that next year's share repurchases from a dollar perspective would be broadly consistent with
what we did in 2015. And we think, frankly, that combination has been very effective for shareholders. The dividend
has now gone up at a compounded annual rate of about 11% over the last five years. We've got 13 million shares
repurchased. I think we mentioned about a 13% unlevered return, and I think that's obviously good.
And our share count is down roughly about 4% since we began this, and that's after issuing shares for deferred
compensation while at the same time reinvesting in the business and effectively de-levering as EBITDA has grown
relative to our constant amount of long-term debt. So I think it's a balance, and I think we felt as we – given the
stability and diversification of our model and our ability to deliver more consistent and predictable results that we could
support that dividend going into this year.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Robert, I think you framed the macro setting well. We went into last year with a pretty
harsh market in the fourth quarter in 2015 and first quarter of 2016. We announced a more conservative dividend. As I
said, our average assets are up 11% this year from a spot rate – I mean a spot rate assets are up 11% from an average

[ph] asset of 2% (49:17) during the year. And we're following the same type of formula that, as Gary suggested, in
terms of our dividend policy. I would say in the absolute though, we wanted to show the enthusiasm to our shareholders
of announcing a 9% dividend increase.
<A - Gary S. Shedlin>: And I'll just end with this, which is I know all you guys have incredibly sophisticated earnings
model, so I certainly wouldn't look to project your earnings per share based off of the dividend that we basically declare
each year.

Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous. Please go ahead.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Good morning, Patrick.
<Q - Patrick Davitt>: Good morning, guys. On the comment you just made about institutional delay, is that
backward-looking or ongoing? And within that vein, you obviously saw a big uptick in institutional index flows. Do
you get the sense that that's just institution kind of meeting equity exposure rolling into index with the intention of,
maybe, reallocating that to a more active strategy at some point?
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: No. I don't think there's been any – as I said, we are seeing more institutions using
index and the allocation to these various exposures as an active strategy. And I think this is one of the key
characteristics that the market is not taking into the full context. In terms of institutions, I think into fourth – we said in
the third quarter, institutions are pausing. They put some money to work in the fourth quarter, they put a lot of money
to work at BlackRock in the fourth quarter. We're having deeper dialog with more institutions than we've ever had. I
mean the dialogs we're having with some very large insurance companies, pension funds worldwide are very
encouraging. Whether they act in the first quarter, the second quarter of 2017, we'll see.
But I do believe clients are reassessing their liabilities in the form of pension funds. Clients are really looking at what
their liability rates in the terms of insurance companies. They're looking at their asset allocations accordingly now and
how they're going to do it where insurance companies, the rise of interest rates to steepening the yield curves is very
positive. And many insurance companies that I talked about early last year were short their liability. They were
anticipating higher rates. And now with higher rates, some of them are putting some money to work. So I don't want to
– I think it would be unfair to say that we're going to expect these types of flows institutionally at BlackRock quarter by
quarter by quarter, but we do feel very good about our positioning and working with our global institutions.
In terms of asset allocation, we are having dialog with some clients right now. We're talking about more about
alternatives. Rob Kapito has had two conversations with two large [ph] states (52:26) in the last week about a bigger
allocation in alternatives. So I don't want to suggest there's one macro trend and one way of looking at asset allocation,
but I can't say we're involved in a lot of very deep conversations. And I do believe the market is still misunderstanding
how people are using passive strategies. They're not just using them because they want to be indexed. They are using
passive strategies that are very liquid, that they can navigate around markets to take active exposures.

allocation and implementation right into the deadline? Maybe just longer term, what's your view on how you think the
Department of Labor's fiduciary rule might change with any kind of administrative changes?
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Well, A, I don't know how it's going to change. Obviously, there was lot of talk about
it will be modified. Some conversations about it, it'll be totally eliminated. We believe the DoL rule has some very
great components to it. As you know, we've spoken for years and years and years that we have done a very bad job in
our country in helping people navigate to the outcome of retirement. And having better outcome-oriented strategies
whether we have a DoL or not is not imperative or we're going to have more and more people angry that they're close
to retirement with an adequate pools of money to retire. That anger then does not go away. So we believe the DoL rule
has quite a bit of merit, but I know as much as you do in terms of how that would change, if it's going to change. Does
it get totally eliminated? We'll see.
What we see in terms of behaviors, and this is the important thing, and Rob said it very well, we have not seen much
change in behaviors from the large distribution platforms. As Rob suggested, they're moving from a brokerage
relationship to an advisor relationship. They're moving ahead with doing more model-based structuring. In fact, we
won a biggest – we were a part of a big award in terms of how models are going to be created in terms of whether
you're going to be using our products or not.
So in terms of behaviors, most firms are moving forward that some component, if not all of the components of DoL
will be moving forward. We are very active in helping whether the DoL rule happens or not. More and more of the
distribution houses are saying we need better technology to help us navigate our clients' relationships and their
portfolios. And that is why Aladdin for Wealth is growing very rapidly and has a potential for even more substantial
growth in the future.
So, in terms of our relationships with most of our advisors, we are seeing very little in terms of behavior changes. Now,
I am not here to tell you on April 1 this year everything is going to change. Could it be elongated? Sure. But I do
believe, in most cases, most large advisory firms believe this is a good thing for their clients and a good thing for them.
And I believe we will see some form of DoL in the future, but I know as good as you what specifically does that mean.

Your final question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Hi, Michael.
<Q - Michael Roger Carrier>: Hi. How are you doing? I guess the question, another one on the institutional side. And
I hear what you're saying in terms of you saw a lot of money moving in in index, but there's demand for alternatives. So
I guess there's been a lot of cash that's been on the sidelines for a while now. I'm just trying to get a sense, I know it's
one quarter, but based on those discussions, are you starting to see more interest to put that money to work? And could
this be a trend that we kind of see follow through over the next few years as institutions have more confidence and if
rates are rising and things are starting to move forward?
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Well, I think I said this earlier today on television. I think if you reflect back to the end
of 2016, for those who panicked the first quarter of 2016 and stayed underinvested or out of the market entirely, they've
been hurt. If you think back to those investors who ran away from the market in 2008 and 2009, they've been really
hurt.
We are working with all our clients to try to help them be more invested. So let's be clear. We believe it's a mistake, the
amount of cash that's sitting in the sidelines worldwide. The problem is, clients say, oh, I just missed the last 10% or
15%, maybe I should stay in the sidelines longer. Our job is if you're helping our clients worldwide and helping them
think about markets, thinking about exposures, and helping them build an asset base to meet their liabilities. I don't
believe, as you said, one quarter versus another is going to really determine whether we are seeing a renewed interest in
putting the money to work. Certainly, in the fourth quarter, we did.

Our dialogs that we're having worldwide indicate that we may see more money put to work, but I don't want to forecast
that. I'm always disappointed of how much money is sitting in the sideline. And I believe at the end of every year, we
talk about this that we need to have more of our clients, more of our investors that focus on the outcome of investing
and not whether the market's rich or cheap, because that gets caught up in getting in and out of the market, and
therefore missing big market movements. And this is a big issue.
I believe this is one of the reasons why we're having deeper dialog with our clients because we are talking about
outcomes. We're not talking about a specific product. We're not talking active or passive. We're allowing our clients to
make those decisions whether they should have a bigger allocation in passive or active. We're making our clients
determine whether they should be in high yield or an unconstrained bond fund. We're allowing our clients to work on
how to navigate. We'll give them input about what we think, but I do believe the fourth quarter of 2016 positioned us
well because of how we are constantly repeatingly talking about solution-based relationship.
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks?
Laurence Douglas Fink
Let me just add on to what I just said. So we believe the 2016 results again highlighted our benefits of BlackRock's
differentiated investment position, our technology positioning, our risk management platform and positioning. And the
impact of our investments we made over the last five years are the biggest growth products at BlackRock.
And so, when I reflect on our 2016, it is about those investments we made two, three, four years ago that is really now
creating the volume of growth that we have. It is the scale of our operation, the global footprint of our operation that
has given us broader, deeper conversations with more clients throughout the world, and will continue to drive deeper
and broader conversations with our clients in 2017.
Our stable financial results allow us to continue to pursue that long-term view, investing in these future growth areas as
we adapt to stay ahead of our clients, and that's key. Staying ahead of our clients' needs is imperative. Not responding
to the question, and if we're responding to the question at the moment and we're not prepared, that question will be
answered somewhere else. So I believe it is that philosophy that is carrying BlackRock, that is differentiating
BlackRock, and I think it is that positioning that is going to build momentum into 2017.
I want to thank everybody for joining us this morning and having continued interest in BlackRock. And let's have a
good year.
