MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Target Corporation Fourth Quarter Earnings Release
Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will invite you
to participate in a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being
recorded, Wednesday, February 25, 2015.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hulbert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead,
sir.
John R. Hulbert
Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Sorry about
the technical difficulties that delayed us a couple of minutes there. On the line with me today are Brian Cornell,
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Mulligan, Chief Financial Officer; and Kathee Tesija, Chief
Merchandising and Supply Chain Officer.
This morning, Brian will discuss our fourth quarter performance and our priorities going forward, and Kathee will
provide insights into holiday and fourth quarter results across our merchandise categories. And finally, John will
provide more detail on our fourth quarter and full-year financial performance. Following their remarks, we'll open the
phone lines for a question-and-answer session.
As a reminder, we're joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments via
webcast. Following this conference call, John and I will be available throughout the day to answer any follow up
questions you may have. Also, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to
risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings.

Also, in these remarks, we refer to adjusted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A
reconciliation to our GAAP EPS is included in this morning's press release posted on our Investor Relations website.
Finally, given that we're hosting our Financial Community Meeting in New York next week, our remarks today will
focus on Target's fourth quarter performance and our guidance for the first quarter of 2015. At next week's meeting, we
will describe in detail our longer-term expectations, including full-year 2015 financial performance. As a result, we're
shortening today's call to 45 minutes and will look forward to spending another two-and-a-half hours with all of you
next week.
With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for his comments on the fourth quarter and holiday season. Brian?
Brian C. Cornell
Thanks, John, and good morning to all of you. Appreciate your patience this morning. We're very pleased with our
fourth quarter financial results which we announced earlier this morning. Our fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $1.50 was
14.9% higher than last year and above the high-end of the updated range we provided in our January 15 press release.
Our fourth quarter comparable sales increase of 3.8% was also stronger than the updated guidance we provided in
January as we saw unexpected strength in our store channel sales in the last two weeks of the quarter. And, of course,
when we look back at our point of view going into the fourth quarter, comparable sales growth turned out to be nearly
double our original expectations as our combination of products, promotions, holiday marketing, fulfillment
capabilities, and in-store execution drove profitable growth in an intensely promotional environment.
We're pleased that comps in all three months of the quarter were positive, and November strength was particularly
notable given that we were annualizing a strong increase in November 2013. We're also pleased that traffic was the
primary driver of our fourth quarter growth as well as the fact that the digital channel growth contributed nearly a full
percentage point to our fourth quarter comparable sales increase.
Our fourth quarter gross margin performance was also very strong with a favorable mix reflecting strength in signature
categories. Our merchant teams did an outstanding job of managing inventory flow, benefiting both in-stocks and gross
margin, which was particularly challenging this quarter in light of the slowdown in productivity at the West Coast
ports. Once again, our store team did an outstanding job of managing costs in the fourth quarter, delivering productivity
improvements along with outstanding service to our guests. As I've mentioned to many of you, one of our priorities
going forward is to harness best practices from our stores and apply them to the rest of the organization to modernize
the way we work and drive productivity improvements while maintaining quality in everything we do.
If we look back at the full-year, it's clear that 2014 was a year of transition in which we began to lay the foundation for
the transformation we will accomplish in the next few years. A year ago, we were in the recovery mode, working to
repair guest relationships following the data breach while we undertook an assessment of the long-term prospects for
our Canadian business. Fast-forward to today, and we've ended the year with the data breach fully behind us. And now
that we've made tough decision to exit the Canadian business, our team is focused and aligned on five priorities I
outlined in our third quarter call.
The first priority is to drive industry-leading digital sales growth as we build the capabilities to become a leading
omni-channel retailer. Our digital growth led the industry in 2014, and we're working to build on that success in 2015
and beyond. Our second priority is to clearly define roles for each of our merchandise categories and build appropriate
plans for each of them. While we're in the early stages of this journey, I'm pleased with our efforts to invest in the
growth of our signature categories, like style, baby, kids and wellness. These are the categories we're most famous for
and our guest has asked us to lead with them in the years ahead.
Beyond these signature categories, we're defining appropriate roles for each of our categories, and we'll invest in them
appropriately to ensure we're providing our guests convenience through a differentiated, inspirational, and one-stop
shopping experience. Our third priority is to become much more localized in the assortment and experience we provide
in our stores and more personalized in our digital interaction with our guests. We are in the very early stages of these
efforts and we see huge opportunity ahead of us. To invest in these capabilities, we'll need to make progress on this

priority over the next few years.
Our fourth priority is to develop and test new formats that will help us better serve our guests over time. We're seeing
strong financial results from our eight CityTarget stores and we've seen very strong initial performance in the test of
our first TargetExpress location, which opened here in the Twin Cities last August. In 2015, of the 15 new stores we're
planning to open, more than half of these are new formats with eight additional Express stores and a new CityTarget set
to open in Boston next to Fenway Park. And finally, we're committed to reducing complexity and controlling costs in
order to fuel our investments in the growth priorities I've just outlined.
As mentioned earlier, our stores have been leading the way in these efforts. So in the next few years, we're looking for
opportunities outside our stores to become more agile, move faster, gain scale efficiencies in the way we work. We
believe meaningful opportunities exist and the leadership team is committed to moving decisively to modernize the
way we work and create the capacity we'll need to invest in the priorities that will drive growth and returns on invested
capital.
At our meeting with you next week, we're looking forward to providing you more specifics on how we're planning to
advance these five priorities while providing insights into how our plans will translate into financial results, both this
year and over the long-term. Our plan for the day is as follows: I'll lead-off the day by providing details on our strategic
priorities, our approach to growth, and the principles guiding our leadership team as we work to deliver on these
priorities, then John will provide more detail on our financial expectations for each line of the P&L going forward. And
he will provide full-year guidance for 2015, financial results from continuing operations reflecting our plan to grow
earnings-per-share this year.
Casey Carl will follow with details on our digital progress and his plans to transform the organization by developing
new capabilities that will support our growth, control costs, and recapture the innovative spirit that is part of the
company's DNA. Then, Kathee Tesija will provide more insights into our core guests and our plans to develop
products, experience, and formats to serve those guests over time. And then Jeff Jones will provide insights into the
guest relationship with the Target brand and as teams work to modernize our marketing and the way we interact with
today's core guests. Finally, we'll end with a Q&A session.
We're looking forward to the opportunity to share these plans with you next week, and we're confident that we can
build on the early momentum we've seen over the last few quarters. We have a fantastic foundation to build on with a
great brand, loyal guests, and an outstanding team, and we're committed to maintaining our focus on our key priorities
and making the tough decision to position Target for long-term success.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Kathee to recap our fourth quarter and holiday season performance. Kathee?
Kathryn A. Tesija
Thanks, Brian. Across the U.S. retail landscape, this year's holiday shopping season began earlier and ended later than
ever before. This lengthening of the season reinforced a pattern we've seen for well over a decade, where we saw the
strongest sales in the early and late portions of the season and experienced a period of softness in the middle.
Specifically, throughout November, our comparable sales performance including the Black Friday weekend was very
strong on both a one year and two year basis, driven by strong promotions throughout the month combined with
in-store events and Cartwheel daily deals. In December, following the characteristic low that we've seen for more than
a decade, we saw a very strong surge in traffic and sales in the days leading up to and after Christmas, and in January
we continued to see unexpected strong results throughout the month.
As Brian mentioned, we saw particularly strong trends in fourth quarter sales in our signature categories, specifically
healthcare, beauty, apparel, and home all grew faster than our overall sales. Within apparel, results were strongest in
baby and kids, and home comps were led by domestics and seasonal items. In hard lines, our toy category had a
fantastic quarter, recording a double-digit increase in comparable sales, driven by a strong lineup of Target-exclusive
items throughout the assortment. Average retails were up across all of our categories as guests were trading up within

assortments, and we saw strong regular price sell-throughs in seasonal and markdown-sensitive categories. Digital
channel growth also contributed to the growth in the average retail, particularly in home and apparel, both of which saw
digital channel penetration growth of more than a percentage point in the fourth quarter.
Throughout the holiday season, we were very pleased with the performance of our fourth quarter limited time
partnerships with TOMS and Faribault Woolen Mill. Guests responded to the stories behind these brands and were
delighted by the combination of quality and price we could deliver. I already mentioned the great quarter in toys, which
we supported this year with the launch of our kids' Wish List app, a fun, interactive way for kids to let their families
know which gifts were at the top of their list. We saw strong guest engagement with this new app, as nearly half the
families who used it created a list for two or more kids, and by the end of the season, thousands of new target.com
accounts have been created by Wish List users.
Our attention-getting offer to ship all digital orders for free during the holiday season provided compelling value and
convenience to our guests. The offer created a surge in traffic and conversion on both our conventional sites and
mobile, which, as expected, was partially offset by a moderate decline in average transaction size. Because our guests
responded so well to this holiday promotion, we were excited earlier this week to announce that going forward, we are
reducing the order threshold for free shipping from $50 to $25, with virtually no exclusions. This new minimum is
among the most compelling offers in digital retailing, putting us ahead of many of our key competitors.
In our digital channel for the fourth quarter overall, we saw a high-single-digit increase in visits, driven entirely by
growth in mobile, which includes both tablets and smartphones. Orders were up well over 50%, driven by very strong
conversion increases on both the conventional site and mobile. Mobile is becoming increasingly important to all digital
retailers, and given the profile of our guests, it's particularly important for Target as mobile accounted for more than
40% of our digital orders in the fourth quarter. And notably, on Black Friday, 10% of our iPhone app revenue was from
guests purchasing on their phone while they were simultaneously shopping one of our stores. Our flexible fulfillment
efforts play a key role in supporting our digital growth, and we're pleased with the results of our store pickup program
and our recent rollout of ship-from-store capability.
This was the second holiday season in which we've offered store pickup, and since last year, we've added more dry
grocery items, extended the pickup window from two days to four days, and we've begun testing dedicated parking
spots. This year, we had more than 400,000 store pickup orders on the Black Friday week alone, and they accounted for
half of our digital traffic in the last four days leading up to Christmas. For the year in total, 84% of store pickup orders
were picked on time, and 35% of the time guests who picked up a digital order also shopped the store on the same visit.
This was our first holiday season with ship-from-store capabilities having rolled out to 139 stores at the end of the third
quarter. This capability allows us to ship more than 60,000 items directly from stores to our guests' front doors,
dramatically cutting shipping times while reducing our shipping costs. We were pleased with the ability of this initial
group of stores to handle the shipments from their backrooms, which peaked in the last week of November. And
importantly, this capability allowed us to continue to fulfill holiday orders late in the season for items which were
already sold through in our fulfillment centers but still available in our stores, allowing us to capture incremental sales.
Before I move to our plans going forward, I want to pause and discuss the situation at the West Coast ports. As you
know, the slowdown at these ports began several months ago, and our fourth quarter performance clearly demonstrates
that our team was effective in handling the slowdown by rerouting, expediting, and pre-ordering inventory to support
in-stock. We were very pleased with last weekend's news that a tentative agreement had been reached, but we know it
will be some time before the backlog at these ports will be fully eliminated. In the meantime, we have contingency
plans to continue to work around potential issues, but at times, we may encounter periods of light inventory in some
assortments.
Now I want to give you a few highlights of our plans going forward and, of course, we will have much more to cover
with you next week. Last year, we began to test and roll out a variety of store presentations, innovations to elevate the
shopping experience and differentiate our brand. Based on the guest response to these changes, we are planning to
accelerate our rollout in 2015. For example, following the addition of mannequins at the apparel floor pad in more than
600 stores last fall, we're planning to roll them out to another 400 stores this quarter. And based on the guest response

to our enhanced entertainment and electronics experience, which is currently in 42 stores, we plan to roll this
environment out to another 275 stores this year.
In Home, we've begun testing highly inspirational vignettes to show product in lifestyle settings which we're rolling out
to another 15 stores this quarter. Farther back in the testing phase, we're looking at innovations to bring even more fun
to our toy area with easier navigation, interactive experiences, larger-than-life displays, and floor graphics. We're
always looking for creative platforms to engage guests in new ways that are meaningful to them. Snapchat provides a
fun channel for us to quickly share exclusive, behind-the-scenes content with our guests that they can't get anywhere
else.
If you were one of the fans who witnessed Target's Snapchat debut, you caught a glimpse of the first story, which
teased our history-making Grammy commercial with Imagine Dragons to announce the Target exclusive version of
their new album containing four exclusive bonus tracks. Jeff will have more to say about this groundbreaking Grammy
moment at our meeting next week.
Guests are excited about the recent launch of our new plus-size brand Ava & Viv, which launched earlier this month.
Designed by our own product design and development team, Ava & Viv features stylish basics along with trend-driven
statement pieces. Similar to Target's other apparel lines, Ava & Viv will be updated monthly with prices ranging from
$10 to $80. And the anticipation is building for our upcoming partnership with Lilly Pulitzer with a modern
interpretation of the American resort-wear brands, exuberant prints and patterns, the limited edition Lilly Pulitzer for
Target collection features 15 exclusive prints which are original works of art created by Lilly Pulitzer artists
specifically for this modern collaboration, available exclusively at all Target stores in the U.S. and on target.com
beginning April 19.
The 250-piece collection includes apparel, accessories and shoes for women and girls as well as home accents, outdoor
entertaining accessories, beach gear, travel essentials, and more. And finally, as Brian mentioned, wellness is one of the
signature categories in which we're reinventing or investing to differentiate our brand and our assortment from the
competition. We have a huge opportunity in this space because our guests have told us it's particularly important to
them.
Specifically, nearly every household that shops at Target buys natural and organic products, and more than half of them
indicate that they'd prefer to purchase natural and organic products when available. These guest insights are reinforced
by their behavior in our stores while overall sales in the natural and organic industry are growing rapidly, sales of these
categories at Target are growing even faster, outpacing the industry by 50% in 2014. The Made to Matter collection
remains one of the most prominent and active examples of Target's focus on wellness, offering guests a selection of
natural, organic, and sustainable products across multiple categories.
In 2014, sales of the brands featured in our Made to Matter collection grew twice as fast at Target than they did
elsewhere in the market. In 2015, we'll reinforce our commitment to newness and better-for-you choices with the
refreshed, Made to Matter – Handpicked by Target collection. This year's collection will double in size compared to
last year, delivering more than 200 new and exclusive products from 31 leading and upcoming brands.
As we look ahead to the new year, our priorities in merchandising are clear. We will be build appropriate plans for each
of our categories based on the role they play in supporting our brand and delivering a superior shopping experience. In
our signature categories, we will invest in product development, marketing, fixtures, and store service to elevate and
differentiate both the assortments and the shopping experience, fully delivering on our Expect More. Pay Less. brand
promise. Our fourth quarter results demonstrate that we are making some early progress in this work, and we are
dedicated to moving much faster in this transformation in 2015.
Now, I'll turn over to John who will share his insights on our fourth quarter financial performance and our outlook for
first quarter 2015. John?

Thanks, Kathee. Our first quarter financial results were stronger-than-expected, driven by better-than-expected sales
performance in the U.S., our adjusted EPS of $1.50 was better than the high-end of the guidance provided in our
January 15 update and about $0.11 better than our expectations for U.S. performance at the beginning of the quarter.
Fourth quarter diluted EPS from continuing operations was $1.49, about $0.01 lower than adjusted EPS, driven by a
combined $0.02 of dilution from the reduction of the beneficial interest asset combined with net data breach expenses,
partially offset by the benefit from the resolution of income tax matters. Fourth quarter GAAP EPS losses of $4.10
reflected $5.59 in losses from discontinued Canadian operations.
Our fourth quarter comparable sales increase of 3.8% was above the guidance of around 3% that we provided in our
January update and nearly double the 2% growth we expected at the beginning of the quarter. More than all of the sales
outperformance in the last few weeks of the quarter was in our stores as digital channel sales came in a bit softer than
expected in those last few weeks, reflecting a slowdown in demand sales growth as we annualized over-promotions
from a year ago combined with returns which came in somewhat higher than expected. Even so, digital channel sales
increased a robust 36% in the fourth quarter, on top of a very strong increase in the fourth quarter of 2013. And, as
Brian mentioned, digital channel growth delivered about 90 basis points of our fourth quarter comparable sales
increase, up from a 60 basis point contribution in the third quarter.
U.S. REDcard penetration of 21.1% was about 20 basis points ahead of last year and in line with our expectations. As I
mentioned last quarter, based on trends in new accounts, we believe this quarter represented a trough in penetration
growth. And we expect to see a moderate reacceleration in penetration growth in 2015. This growth should benefit later
in the year from the introduction of chip-and-PIN technology for all of our REDcards and the changeover to
MasterCard on our legacy co-branded credit card program.
Our fourth quarter EBITDA margin rate of 9.9% was somewhat stronger than expected driven by a very strong gross
margin rate performance, partially offset by a small increase in our SG&A expense rate. Specifically, our fourth quarter
gross margin rate of 28.5% was nearly a percentage point higher than a year ago and the strongest fourth quarter
performance we've seen since 2010. This year's rate benefited from a favorable mix of sales growth in our signature
categories combined with better markdown rates as we annualized last year's clearance and promotional activity
following the announcement of the data breach.
I want to pause here to comment on our inventory position at the end of the quarter, which was about 6% higher than
last year. This increase was intentional and reflects two separate decisions. First, in the last six months, we've chosen to
increase our inventory and commodity categories to enhance in-stocks in these frequency driving businesses. And
second, we are ahead in some import categories in light of the slowdown at the West Coast ports. Bottom line, the
inventory increase is a result of specific decisions we've made and we feel very good about our overall inventory level
as we enter the new fiscal year.
Getting back to the fourth quarter P&L. On the SG&A expense line we benefited from productivity improvements in
the stores and overall leverage on pay in benefits, offset by higher marketing technology and incentive expense rates
compared with last year. Altogether, our fourth quarter SG&A expense rate was about 20 basis points higher than last
year.
Moving to consolidated metrics. Fourth quarter interest expense was up about 6% to last year, and we paid $330
million in dividends in the quarter, an increase of 22% over last year. As expected, we didn't repurchase any shares in
the fourth quarter. However, as we discussed in our January update, the exit from the Canadian market will
meaningfully improve our credit metrics going forward, and provided the wind-down of our Canadian operations
continues to operate to proceed as planned, we will be in a position to revisit the possibility of share repurchase later in
2015. As always, I will reiterate that we will only resume repurchase activity if we believe it can be accomplished
within the limits of our current investment grade credit ratings.
As we look back at the full year performance in the U.S., our 2014 adjusted EPS of $4.27 was down slightly from
$4.38 in 2013, driven by early year challenges as we recovered from the data breach. However, the healing of our
business has been evident in the progression of our financial results throughout the year. Specifically, comparable sales,
digital channel growth, and year-over-year gross margin rate performance all improved as we moved throughout 2014.

And expenses remained well-controlled throughout the year. Next week at our meeting with you in New York, we will
outline in detail our plans to build on this early momentum over the next few years.
Before I turn to the outlook for the first quarter of 2015, I want to cover a small change to our adjusted EPS reporting,
which we present in order to reflect the results of operations from what is now a single segment business. Given that we
have now amortized $151 million, or two-thirds of the original value of the beneficial interest asset related to the 2013
sale of our credit card receivables portfolio. Beginning in 2015, we will no longer remove the amortization of the
beneficial interest from our adjusted EPS calculation; this is because both the quarterly amortization amounts and the
year-over-year changes in those amounts are expected to be immaterial going forward and, therefore, we believe our
reporting will be streamlined if we make this change. In our reporting throughout 2015, prior-year adjusted EPS results
will also reflect this change to ensure consistency for comparison purposes.
With that, let's move to our outlook for the first quarter. We expect our comparable sales to increase about 2%, driven
by an increase in digital channel sales of 30% or more combined with modest growth of in-store channel sales. While
it's still early in the quarter, our results for the first few weeks of February are consistent with that forecast. On our first
quarter sales, we expect our gross margin rate to improve 40 basis points to 50 basis points from last year as we
annualize last year's very intense promotions, which we used to recapture traffic coming out of the data breach.
On the SG&A expense line, we expect our first quarter rate to be flat but down slightly from a year ago as we expect
that the benefit from store productivity improvements will be offset by higher marketing and technology expense rates
compared with last year. We expect our D&A expense rate to be about 10 basis points higher than last year, reflecting
the impact of continued investments in technology to support our digital flexible fulfillment efforts. Altogether, we can
expect an improvement in our first quarter EBIT margin of 30 basis points to 40 basis points above last year. First
quarter interest expense should be approximately flat to last year, and tax expense is expected to be about $50 million
higher than last year, reflecting improved profitability and a higher consolidated tax rate compared with a year ago.
Altogether, these expectations would lead to first quarter adjusted EPS representing results of continuing operations in
our single segment business of $0.95 to $1.05, compared with $0.92 a year ago. As John mentioned at the beginning of
the call, we're going to wait until next week's financial community meeting to provide specific guidance for full year
2015 earnings growth, as well as our expected financial algorithm over the longer term. This will allow us to present
our financial outlook in the full context of our specific business plans, which reflect necessary investments to accelerate
growth and build capabilities along with the opportunity to reduce costs over time, providing fuel to fund those
investments.
With that, we'll conclude today's prepared remarks. Now Brian, Kathee, and I will be happy to respond to your
questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Simeon Gutman>: Thanks. Good morning. It's Simeon Gutman. First question on gross margin for John or for
Brian. It was quite solid in the fourth quarter. Last year, you had a little pressure but not nearly as much as I guess we
all expected given some of the discounting, so can you talk about what drove the expansion year-over-year in this
year's fourth quarter?
<A - John J. Mulligan>: Sure. I'll start, and I'm sure Kathee will jump in. I think overall what you observed is there's
certainly some savings relative to last year with the clearance activity that went on, but I think much more important to
that is you saw the acceleration of the signature categories, home, apparel, style, kids, many of those with margin rates
well in excess of our average margin rate. And I think for the first time, Kathee and I couldn't remember the last time
where both home and apparel out-comped the company. So we really saw very strong mix in the quarter delivered by

the product in the stores.
<A - Kathryn A. Tesija>: Yeah. So on top of the mix, I would also say that regular price sell-through was very high,
so less on clearance or markdown and more at full retail, which also contributed.
<Q - Simeon Gutman>: Okay. And just one follow-up. I'm sure this will get addressed next week, but can you just tell
us what the average wage for full-time associates and/or part-time associates are at Target?
<A - John J. Mulligan>: We don't disclose the average wage for our team members. What I would tell you is the
stores team has always been a point of differentiation for Target, and we've always prided ourselves and believe we
have the best team in retail. And so very focused on ensuring we have competitive wages and that we're developing our
team members. We're all the time assessing the marketplace to determine competitive wages and making adjustments,
and we feel very confident that we'll be paying the teams appropriately. I think importantly, if you look at our team
leaders, 60% of them came from team members, so development is a really big part of what we offer to our team as
they progress. Overall, as we look at some of the announcements that have been made in the marketplace and the
minimum wage legislation that's been enacted, really hasn't changed our view of the quarter or the year really at all, and
won't be material changes to us.
<Q - Simeon Gutman>: Okay, thanks.
<A - Brian C. Cornell>: Let me build on that. I'm sure we're going to receive this question again next week, but to
John's point, and our goal is to make sure we have the very best team in retail, and we're going to continue to invest in
their development and make sure that, from a marketplace standpoint, we're very competitive with the wages we
provide. So I've been very pleased to learn that over 60% of our team leaders actually started as part-time hourly
employees. That development is critically important. It allows us to attract terrific team members. And as John stated,
we do not expect to see any material change next year.
<Q - Simeon Gutman>: Okay, thanks. See you next week.

Your next question is from Matt Nemer from Wells Fargo Securities.
<Q - Matt R. Nemer>: Thanks for taking my question. I want to follow up on that last comment on around wages.
Brian, could you just provide some context around how much opportunity you think there is to reduce complexity and
improve efficiency in case you needed to respond to wages or you wanted to respond?
<A - Brian C. Cornell>: Well, it's certainly going to be an area that we'll highlight next week. And I think you've
captured it really, really well. Our focus right now throughout the organization is to reduce complexity, simplify the
way we work, the way we operate each and every day, continue to empower our team members to make the right
decisions that are going to impact the business. We want to create an organization that's much more agile, that moves
with much increased pace as we go forward, and we deliver the right innovation and product that our guest is looking
for.
So it is a significant area of focus for us. We're going to talk about it in great detail. But we think it's going to be a very
important part of our strategy going forward. It's going to fuel the key growth priorities that we've been talking about
and will go through in great detail next week. But our goal is to make sure we eliminate complexity at Target, we
simplify our operating model, we empower our team members, and create an environment where we're agile, we're
taking advantage of marketplace opportunities, and we're bringing products and services to market that respond to the
needs of our guests.
<Q - Matt R. Nemer>: Thanks. And then just a quick follow up on higher online return rates. Do you think that's
primarily a function of the free shipping offer? Is it more prevalent in certain categories and is it related at all to error
rates?

<A - John J. Mulligan>: Actually, the return rates were higher than our expectation, but they were essentially right on
last year. We had seen some improvement throughout most of the year, and they basically just returned to last year, so
not a material change, just a little bit different than our expectation for the last couple of weeks.
<Q - Matt R. Nemer>: Understood. Thanks so much.

Your next question is from Scott Mushkin from Wolfe Research.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions. The first thing I wanted to poke at was
frequency. Brian, you mentioned that you were real pleased with the frequency going up in the quarter. Is that a focus
for the company to drive frequency to the stores? And kind of maybe as a preview, how do you get it done?
<A - Brian C. Cornell>: Yeah. Scott, well, there's certainly a number of critically important metrics as we look at the
business going forward. I can tell you that the entire leadership team is prioritized: one, increasing traffic to our stores;
and two, visits to our site. Those are critically important as we go forward. So we're going to do that by executing many
of the priorities that we outlined today. We certainly want to make sure we're building the right digital and,
importantly, mobile capabilities that drive greater visits to our site and build greater engagement with our guests, not
only when they're shopping at home, but also when they're shopping inside of our stores. And Cartwheel is a great
example of how we've used digital to drive greater engagement.
I'm really pleased, and Kathee highlighted the fact that our signature categories drove our growth in the fourth quarter.
And it's critically important that while we're in the early stages, we're already seeing the guests react well to our focus
on style, on baby and kids and importantly, wellness in the fact that healthcare and beauty and home and apparel
outpaced our overall performance in the fourth quarter is a sign that we're connecting with the guests and we're
certainly driving more of the traffic because of these great new offerings in store.
So our focus on elevating signature categories we think brings our guests back to Target more often. They are going to
be coming back into see what's new, and Kathee and her team have a great lineup in 2015 of new, exciting products
coupled with an improvement in our in-store experience in merchandising. So those elements are critically important.
We think localization allows us to build a more meaningful relationship with the guests, which will result in more
traffic and more visits. And certainly, as we expand our smaller format, both CityTarget and TargetExpress, it's a way
for us to engage the guests in these urban settings that are critically important.
So all of those are focused on making sure we build greater engagement, but the metrics that are going to be important
for us is to ensure it results in more traffic, like it did in the fourth quarter, and more visits to our site. So we're pleased
with Q4. Lots of work in front of us, but I felt very good as did the entire leadership team that our comp increase of
3.8% in the fourth quarter was primarily driven by traffic. And our industry-leading growth in digital was certainly
going to be fueled by more visits and better conversion from our site.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: That's perfect. And I just have one quick follow up. I have a ton of questions, but I'm just
going to do one quick follow up to what you said, Brian. You didn't mention, although Kathee did, she mentioned food
– how do you think of food in context of traffic? And then I'll yield. Thank you.
<A - Brian C. Cornell>: Scott, I think you already know the answer to that, and we're going to talk about this
specifically next week. Food is very important to our guests, and they have confirmed that with us as we've gone back
and researched the food category through the eyes of the guests recently. We all know food trips drive traffic, and we
want to make sure we complement our signature categories with guests that are coming to us for the great food
products we can curate. We recognize we have a lot of work to do in food. And Kathee and I were recently out in the
market together, we spent several days visiting our stores, looking at competitive food retailers as we begin to build our
reinvention plans for food.

But as Kathee will talk about next week, we recognize we need to make changes to our assortment, Made to Matter and
some of the changes we're making right now in our assortment to deliver more organic, natural, gluten-free items,
critically important to the guests, and we also recognize we have to change the in-store experience and really make sure
our food and grocery merchandising complements the great experience we create at Target. So a critically important
area of opportunity. We won't get there overnight. It'll be a multi-year transition. But food is going to play a very
important role in complementing our other signature categories and making sure we drive traffic to our stores and to
our site.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Thanks. That was great – great answer. I appreciate it.
<A - Brian C. Cornell>: Scott, thanks. Hopefully we'll see you next week.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Definitely see you next week. Looking forward to it.

Your next question is from Matthew Fassler from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Thanks a lot, and good morning. If you could frame some of the marketing and technology
spending in the fourth quarter, just let us know what that was directed towards? And I know you're holding back to
some degree on 2015 guidance but were some of those initiatives that you would expect to persist through the
upcoming year?
<A - Brian C. Cornell>: Matt, we'll certainly go through much more of this next week. I think if you were to look at
the changes we made from a marketing standpoint in the fourth quarter, the big change would've been a significant
increase in our digital support of our brands. So as we continue to make sure we're connecting with our guests, or
connecting with them the way they're looking to connect with the Target brand, digital's going to play an increasingly
important role, and we were very pleased with our overall marketing in the fourth quarter. We had some outstanding
creative on-air, it received very positive response from the guests, and we complemented that with a very strong digital
campaign. So I felt and the team felt very good about the progress we made from a marketing standpoint in the fourth
quarter. We had creative that broke through the clutter, connected with our guests, drove traffic to our stores. We
complemented that with really impactful digital and online communication, and tied that back in with great in-store
marketing. So you'll see more of that as we go forward into 2015, and we'll take you through a lot more of the
investments and the plans we have when we see you next week.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Thank you.

Your next question is from Sean Naughton from Piper Jaffray.
<Q - Sean P. Naughton>: Hi, guys. Good morning. I just wanted to follow up on the food question, and then
specifically inside of the fresh component of the business. This was supposed to be a big part of driving transactions to
the store over the long term. Could you just maybe give us a little bit on where Target is with its fresh offering today?
How is it evolving, and are you happy with the performance of the sales and margins on this segment of the business?
<A - Kathryn A. Tesija>: Sean, we're going to talk about food in much more depth next week, but fresh is a very
important part of food, not only traffic and number of trips for our guests, but just in terms of what's important to them
in terms of wellness. Fresh food plays a very important part. And as Brian said, we've got a lot of work to do here, so
both in SuperTarget as well as in PFresh format, and it centers around our assortment, how fresh the product is and
ways that we can improve upon that, the presentation, showing abundance in that great product. So we have a lot of
work to do, but critically important to us, because our guests have said they want to be able to eat better both natural
and organic. We see it in our results today, and we know that there's much, much more opportunity.

<Q - Sean P. Naughton>: Okay. And then maybe as a follow up here, just on the inflation front. Can you just give us
an idea of how inflation trended maybe across the store in the quarter and your expectations kind of in the near- and
medium-term? Thank you.
<A - John J. Mulligan>: Sure. Lots of variability across categories as is always the case. We saw some inflation in
food. We saw some – a lot of deflation in electronics, like we always do. But if you look across the entirety of our
business, essentially flat to last year. So no net impact to the business from inflation in aggregate. But as I said, lots of
variability within that.
<Q - Sean P. Naughton>: That's helpful. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: Good morning, guys. Thanks a lot for taking my question. As you look back at the
fourth quarter, can you dimension what you think – how the performance was driven by your own initiatives, the easy
comparison versus last year, and just improving macro environment due in part to the lower fuel prices? If there's any
way you could potentially quantify that I think it would be really helpful.
<A - Brian C. Cornell>: Michael, let me start, and I'll let Kathee and John jump in. I think you've certainly identified
some of the big levers, and I think as we sit here today, we recognize that the consumer confidence has certainly
improved. Lower gas prices certainly helping the industry overall. We did have some favorable overlap, certainly, as
we overlapped the breach. But I also think we made significant strides from a merchandising standpoint, from a
marketing standpoint, and we continue to deliver great execution and service inside the stores.
And when you look at the two year stacks, we had a very challenging November, a very strong November from 2013
that we overlapped and saw growth, that to me was the sign that not only was the consumer healthier, but they were
choosing to spend their dollars in target stores. And they came back in December, as Kathee alluded to, we had a very
strong close to the holiday season, but importantly, we felt really good about traffic and our performance in January,
particularly in the last two weeks of the quarter. So a combination of, we certainly did have some issues from last year
that we're overlapping. The consumer, we do believe, is healthier, and we're pleased that they are spending in our
stores, both in our stores and online. But I also think we made significant strides from a merchandising standpoint. We
had terrific marketing and a great digital connection with our guests.
We were able to leverage both an improved in-store experience, the convenience of shopping online and picking up in
store, and we had industry-leading online sales, and we leveraged our stores to help make sure that we fulfilled the
needs of our guests. So I think the combination of all those elements added up to a very solid quarter.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: Okay, thanks for that. And then as a – please go ahead, Kathee.
<A - Kathryn A. Tesija>: The only thing that I would add to that is just that a lot of that focus came in our signature
categories, which is why you saw our growth there in particular. So major investment in product, both quality as well
as aesthetic and number of SKUs, newness that we brought to the market. The marketing reinforced that and that was
very well received by our guests. And then coupled with presentation, both online with enhancements in our app and
our desktop site, and the presentation in our store driven by focus on signature categories really helped drive our
growth.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: That's helpful. The follow question I had is, are there any particular callouts you can
offer about the strength in the last two weeks of the quarter? It just strikes us as interesting and we're curious about
what drove that strength? Thank you.
<A - John J. Mulligan>: I think we continue to see gift card redemption. We intentionally – we had a significant gift
card promotion on Black Friday that was very successful. We saw all of those come back in January, I think that
helped. And we saw continued strength in the product in home and apparel, very strong sales in home and apparel. And

I think that was an element of it as well. I think that's a combination of both.
<A - Kathryn A. Tesija>: And our wellness business is healthy as we turn the corner into the new year. We saw that
continue. So the trade up that we had seen during Christmas, we saw continuance into January, which is just guest
choice for products in our discretionary category. So I think lots of things drove it.
<A - Brian C. Cornell>: Michael, I think – well summarized. I would put four elements on the list. John talked about
gift cards; I think that was very important. We certainly saw our guest come back to Target with gift cards after the
holidays and through January. Our focus on wellness certainly well received by the guests. We had great newness in
our stores to start the new year, and our store teams did a terrific job of recovering after the holidays, and we offered
our guests a very strong in-store shopping experience. So a lot of the basics, but our gift card plans were well executed.
We saw the guests come back in January. Our focus on wellness, that's an important signature category, well received.
We brought newness into the stores to start the year, and our store teams did a terrific job of recovering after a very

Operator
Your next question is from Greg Melich from Evercore ISI.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: That's great. Thanks. I had a couple of follow-ups. It'd be great to know, you said the signature
categories did well. Do you have the actual numbers, like which ones were better by category for food and wellness, et
cetera?
<A - Kathryn A. Tesija>: Well, health and beauty were both very strong. So in the health categories, that spread
across many categories, I talked about Made to Matter, I talked about better-for-you product in food, but it was also in
our health business and our style business, both beauty was strong as well as in apparel it was driven really by kids and
by baby. And in home, it was domestics and seasonal products. And then in kids, we had incredible season in toys with
a double-digit comp. We really were pleased with the overall holiday.
<A - Brian C. Cornell>: Yeah, I think as we mentioned earlier in the call, wellness, home, apparel, all comped in
excess of the 3.8% we reported for the quarter. So strength across all those categories and to win in the fourth quarter,
you have to win in toys. Well, our team won in toys. And showing a double-digit comp was critically important. So we
felt very good about the early progress in those signature categories, and we'll build off of that momentum as we go
into 2015.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: And maybe to follow up on that momentum and seeing the traffic get back to up 3%, when you
look out to your first quarter, that 2% expectation, do you expect traffic to be half of that comp or positive in the first
quarter? Or what's built into your expectation?
<A - John J. Mulligan>: Well, I think Brian hit on it earlier, right? We're continuing to drive for positive traffic. I
think positive in the store and growing digital online. And that's part of our guidance.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Great. And then, John, maybe a quick follow up on SG&A. It looked like, and I could be
backing the math out wrong here, but SG&A dollars in the fourth quarter accelerated to maybe 4% or 5% growth. Was
there anything that caused that in particular?
<A - John J. Mulligan>: Yeah, I think like we said, it was a little bit of deleveraging, there was some marketing
expense we talked about in November, moved from November into – or from Q3 into Q4, as Brian said, we made some
investments in marketing. The other elements were ongoing all year. We had some technology, and then the thing that
really drove a lot of it relative to the other quarters was incentive expense. We clearly out-delivered our expectations,
and that'll be reflected in our incentive expense.
