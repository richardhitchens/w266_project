Clay C. Williams
Thank you, Loren, and welcome everyone to National Oilwell Varco's fourth quarter 2014 earnings conference call.
This morning we announced that the company earned $1.39 per fully diluted share in its fourth quarter ended
December 31, 2014. Excluding transaction and asset impairment charges, earnings were a record $1.69 per fully diluted
share, an increase of 4% sequentially, and 13% year-over-year.
Fourth quarter revenues were $5.7 billion, up 2% sequentially and up 8% year-over-year. Fourth quarter EBITDA
excluding other items was $1.2 billion or 21.3% of sales. EBITDA on this basis improved 1% sequentially and 8%
year-over-year.
For the full year 2014, GAAP earnings per fully diluted share were $5.82. Excluding other items and impairment
charges, earnings were a record $6.07 per fully diluted share, up 12% from the prior year. EBITDA for the year
excluding other items and impairment charges was a record $4.6 billion, up 14% from the prior year on the same basis.
Looking forward, we obviously face some significant challenges in the markets that we serve, and we will be
discussing these through the next hour. But first, I want to take a moment and reflect on the company's
accomplishments in 2014 and say thanks to the world's best oilfield services team.
NOV completed the spinout of our distribution services business to our shareholders as NOW Inc. in May, which led us
to reorganize our remaining business along four new reporting segments and promote several executives into new
leadership positions.
Our new segment architecture is around customer axes which opened up new strategic possibilities for us. So our
leadership team spent the summer developing long-term strategies for each business. We presented these at our first
Investor Day in November where we also laid out ambitious five-year goals. 2014 also saw us announce a large
increase in our dividend, lifting our payout ratio to within the range of 30%, as well as the authorization of a $3 billion
stock buyback. Given the pace of change here through 2014, it would've been easy to have been distracted. I think the
pace of change here makes NOV's 2014 record results doubly impressive. We had several business units post record
annual and record quarterly results in 2014.
I would like to express my gratitude to every one of our 60,000 employees who continue to execute exceptionally well
on behalf of our customers, despite all these changes, to deliver great financial results for our shareholders. Thank you.
As we look forward, though, we face a tough market. With oil prices down more than 50%, our customers are quickly
cutting spending. And the downturn we face will be severe in 2015 and, possibly, beyond.
Drilling activity is falling sharply, and our visibility is limited. The industry finds itself in this downturn, we believe,
because rapidly growing North American oil supply, coupled with slowing demand in the OECD, slowing demand
growth in China and other emerging economies, and a strong U.S. dollar all contributed to a supply-demand imbalance
for oil late last year.
With regards to slow oil demand in Europe and emerging economies, significantly lower energy costs are a meaningful
widespread economic stimulus. As economies in Europe and Asia eventually strengthen, low oil prices and rising
economic activity will spur oil demand growth from these regions.
Second, we do not believe that global excess production capacity is excessive by historical standards. We do not face
the kind of structural global overhang the industry faced in 1986, when Saudi Arabian production had been curtailed
down to about 4 million barrels of oil per day and spare global oil capacity exceeded 15% of demand. We believe that
this downturn will be more like 2002 or 2009. In both prior instances, recovery came within about two years.
Third, we believe the recent swing source of incremental global oil supply is coming from North American shales. The
production type curve from these basins exhibit extraordinarily steep decline rates, which is well documented across
thousands of wells in multiple shale basins. New shale reservoirs exhibit perhaps the highest natural decline rates from
any major source of oil in the industry's modern history. We see North American shale drilling slowing dramatically
and quickly. Soon, the rate of new shale wells coming online will decline, and the 4 million barrels of oil per day from

U.S. shales will then begin to decline, and will decline steeply.
We believe this could lead to modest oil price recovery as early as late 2015. However, we expect shale production to
continue to grow through the first half of 2015 before it begins to fall, as the remaining inventory of wellbores is
completed and brought online, which means a recovery, once it arrives, may be a slower grind higher, despite the steep
decline curve behavior of shale oil.
So in summary, a significant oil demand component to the imbalance driven by macroeconomic conditions, lower oil
costs contributing to eventual economic recovery, a major source of supply from extraordinarily high decline curve
reservoirs, and a sharp drilling reduction response from the oil industry are a pretty good set of ingredients with which
to bake an oil price recovery scenario.
Nevertheless, we acknowledge many factors could keep oil prices down for longer: deteriorating global economic
conditions, continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, or the return to market of oil from certain sideline countries are a
few that come to mind. However, given the speed at which we see drilling activity slowing, it is very difficult for us to
imagine that we will not see a significant oil supply response relatively soon.
We don't believe the world can sustainably grow its oil supply with prices below, say, $75 a barrel. And with prices
below $60, oil production will begin to contract. Since oil supply growth will eventually be required at some point in
the future, it stands to reason that oil prices must eventually cycle back up above $75, over the long run.
Given our short-term lack of visibility into the timing of the recovery, our approach to 2015 will be to focus on what
we can control. We plan to manage NOV to the market, quarter-to-quarter, in view of near-term orders and activity,
while we steadily reduce costs as utilization levels permit, while also continuing to advance the long-term strategic
goals we outlined at our Investor Day. We will manage to the realities of the markets we serve, but we plan to emerge
from the cyclical downturn a better company, achieving new, higher levels of operational excellence.
The record fourth-quarter results that we just announced reflect very little of the impending downturn. In fact, many of
our operations spent the fourth quarter working three shifts, 24/7, to meet our delivery obligations. Through 2014, we
shipped record levels of top drives blowout preventers, fiberglass pipe, jacking systems, and numerous other products.
In January, we did begin to see the drop in activity affecting our operations in a more widespread way, most acutely in
Wellbore Technologies, but really, all segments seeing some impact. In view of the challenges ahead, we are beginning
to bring work in from our suppliers to keep our own facilities better loaded. So for instance, right now, 52% of our
machining requirements within Rig Systems and Aftermarket are outsourced. As work declines, we will be
repositioning some of that work into our own facilities.
We're examining opportunities to consolidate facilities where possible, and we're working with our suppliers to
improve efficiencies and costs, as our customers press us for cost savings for their supply chains. I have tremendous
confidence in the NOV team's ability to manage through the downturn and reduce costs.
Although we have new leadership and new positions throughout our new organization, I will stress that these measures
are not new to NOV, nor are they new to the industry or to cyclical downturns. By my count, this will be the sixth
cyclical downturn we have faced through our careers. Unfortunately, despite our cost reduction measures, we will,
nevertheless, expect to see steep decrementals through 2015, as pricing pressure and lower absorption on lower
volumes will pressure margins.
Orders for all our products have slowed sharply, offshore, land, drilling, Completion and Production. Customers are
delaying purchases of both capital and consumables wherever possible, seeking to conserve cash in the face of market
uncertainty.
We soon expect to see our customers begin to cannibalize existing equipment for capital components. For instance, pull
a top drive off an idled rig within their fleet rather than place a new order for a new one with NOV, in order to keep
another contracted rig in need of a top drive working.

Our customers will raid the spares inventory from their idle rigs to support those that are contracted and contributing
and continuing to work, rather than place a spares order with us. They will redirect drill pipe bits, jars, shakers and
other kit, rather than place new orders with us. History teaches us to expect this behavior to continue for at least the
next couple of quarters, meaning orders will continue to be slow and our book-to-bill in Rig Systems well blow one.
However, this behavior is not sustainable over the long term. Drilling consumes rigs, much like driving consumes your
automobile. The rate of consumption of capital equipment and consumables is declining with drilling activity, but
customer spending always seems to over react through cyclical downturns by living off their inventory and postponing
maintenance and upgrades where they can.
That only works for so long. Maintenance and upgrades can be deferred but cannot be postponed indefinitely for
drilling rigs, so demand will return. In the past, this behavior has fueled demand surges for the kit NOV provides. Our
markets change quickly in both directions.
Also, we see drilling contractors continuing to upgrade their rigs to meet contractual requirements or simply
differentiate their rigs, in a race to offer the most efficient drilling rigs. There remains interest, if only academic for the
time being, in what the next big thing is for drilling, configurable drill floors, closed-loop automated drilling systems,
automated pipe tailing and stand transfer of vehicle for land rigs, retrievable subsea BOP pods, low-cost mid-water
floater designs, concepts which NOV continues to advance, in accordance with our 10-year goals.
Offshore, we are seeing customers defer some of their SPS survey work, although our total volume of SPS work
continues to rise. As we've described in the past, offshore rigs are required to undergo shipyard surveys and obtain
OEM certificates of compliance, an activity called a special periodic survey, or SPS, to maintain their class
designations and be qualified to drill in those markets.
In an $80 oil world, contractors will proceed with the SPS on an un-contracted rig to ensure it is qualified for any
potential contract which may arise, which would require a pressing spud date. In a $50 oil world, contractors are
incrementally less willing to invest in the SPS for an un-contracted rig and be more willing to forego the possibility of
missing a quick spud date contract. As an aside, I'll note that, when the recovery comes to the offshore drilling market,
shipyard capacity to execute SPSs may become a very scarce resource.
In the $50 oil world, contractors become much more circumspect about all investments in older rigs. We expect to see
even more rig retirements, both land and offshore, both announced an unannounced, in addition to those that we've seen
already. This phenomenon has been witnessed in every category of drilling rigs passing through periodic cyclical
downturns and incrementally contribute to better supply-demand balance for the fleets.
Rig Systems posted new orders of $470 million, or a book-to-bill of just 21%, reflecting the customer mindset I just
discussed. This resulted in a Rig Systems backlog of $12.5 billion to start 2015.
This is a high backlog for NOV by historical standards, 16% higher than we carried into the 2009 downturn, for
instance. We expect it to partly, but not fully, mitigate the effect of lower orders through 2015 on our day-to-day
operations in Rig Systems. We foresee revenue out of backlog remaining strong through the first quarter 2015, north of
$2 billion, but beginning to decline modestly in the second quarter and more steeply in the third and fourth quarters of
2015.
While 2015 orders will be slow, we do continue to see modest demand for certain markets like 20,000 PSI deepwater,
Middle Eastern land markets, Mexico, and Argentina. Orders for Completion and Production Solutions did better for
the fourth quarter, posting a book-to-bill of 60% on $469 million in orders, which resulted in a backlog of $1.8 billion
to start 2015.
On the production side, we continue to advance discussions around some large FPSO projects, in spite of the low oil
prices. In fact, the downturn and the troubled offshore project execution performance by the majors in NOCs has
opened the door to new ideas amongst our large E&P customers. There's growing interest around doing things
differently in deepwater developments to drive lower costs. We're excepting lots of invitations from majors to discuss
our modular approach to vessel construction to bring modern supply chain management techniques to bear to produce

better results.
Necessity is the mother of invention, and this market is wide open to new approaches. Our new approach is to offer a
tightly integrated package of NOV kit to minimize the interface conflicts brought about by the fragmented supply chain
approach currently used to build these vessels. We seek to recycle designs and avoid reinventing the wheel for each
new vessel, which inevitably leads unplanned manufacturing costs and delays.
NOV has a tremendous track record of success in bringing this modular package approach to the construction of
offshore drilling rigs through the last decade. Our extensive experience in working closely with shipyards to execute,
install and commission these complex construction projects uniquely positions NOV to help the industry pioneer a
better way.
Although a large integrated package FPSO order for NOV is still a ways away, we've made great progress in securing
customer buy into our new approach on two specific FPSO projects, which we ultimately expect to turn into firm
orders, perhaps as early as late 2015.
For both the Rig Systems and Completion and Production Solutions segments, we are glad to be able to carry strong
backlogs into the downturn. Except for minor exceptions, the firm contracts governing our backlog projects do not
permit cancellation for convenience. In 2009, we saw about 4% of our backlog evaporate, not really from cancellations
but rather, from customer payment defaults. We expect the vast majority of our current backlog to be executed in
accordance with the agreed terms, like we experienced six years ago.
In certain instances, we are considering customer requests for delivery delays, which can help us better manage costs in
our currently stretched supply chain. But generally, we expect the continued on-time execution of our backlog to
continue. Our 2009 stress test provides good empirical evidence for this outlook.
Our 22 Brazil Atlas Project floating rigs constitute about $3.5 billion of our backlog. We are ahead on progress
payments on each of these projects, meaning we have collected more than we have invested in the inventory delivered
on these, as planned, as we continue to fabricate components. We will begin installation and commissioning operations
soon and are commencing riser manufacturing in Brazil currently.
Generally, progress has been steady but a little slower than originally planned, which has not surprised us. While we
have had some payment delays with some of our Brazilian shipyard customers who are building out their new shipyard
facilities, we are confident in the successful completion of these rigs, due to the financing package provided to Sete, the
shipyards customer, by the Brazilian Development Bank and a consortium of banks a few weeks ago to fund the next
18 months of construction.
Additionally, the shipyards have Asian partners who are, in some instances, providing additional capital to complete
the construction of their facilities. The country of Brazil is all-in on this, and the rigs will be completed successfully.
Like I said earlier, NOV will emerge from this downturn a stronger and better company. We are continuing to advance
new technologies, like closed-loop automated drilling, which has significantly improved drilling performance through
several pilot programs.
Other innovations, like our WaterWolf Oil Recovery System for produced waters, thermal cutting desorption
technologies, TUNDRA MAX mud coolers, automated pipe handling equipment for land rigs, and retrievable pods for
subsea BOPs will continue to make the oil field safer and more productive. We have a strong balance sheet to help
weather this downturn.
We are seeking to invest opportunistically through this downturn. We continue to pursue our singles and doubles
acquisition strategy, which improves our capabilities and global reach and our technology portfolio. We have seven
letters of intent in place and probably triple that in potential prospects.
We also began investing in a share repurchase program during the fourth quarter. To date, we have repurchased over
11.6 million shares of NOV for $779 million, which is a 2.7% reduction in our share count. Thus far, we have been
able to accomplish this using cash on our balance sheet, which we have been able to repatriate from overseas locations.
The $2.2 billion remaining on our current authorization, we plan to continue to repurchase NOV shares through the

downturn, including, if necessary, using modest levels of debt from time-to-time to bridge to the next opportunity to
repatriate cash from overseas.
Importantly, we acknowledged at our recent Investor Day that this is a cyclical business, and once or twice every
decade, oil as a commodity tests its microeconomic variable cash cost floor of the marginal barrel. In setting our
long-term strategies, we intentionally look through the cyclical downturn to entrepreneurially focus on actionable
opportunities that we see ahead.
My sixth cyclical downturn has not dissuaded me from the basic pieces we outlined in November, in line with Exxon
Mobil's outlook 2040 study. That the world's population will grow from 7 billion to 9 billion by the year 2040,
economic growth will continue, standards of living will rise, oil and gas production will grow from a combination of
shales and deepwater to fuel the world's appetite for energy and a better life. Specifically, the Exxon study calls for
25% growth in oil and 65% growth in gas through the next 25 years.
In the near term, the E&P industry will sharpen its focus on improving economic efficiency and marginal cost of
production of oil from all sources of oil as it has always done. And as the leading provider of innovation and
technology and industrial capability to this critical entrepreneurial industry, National Oilwell Varco will play a key role
in making that happen and emerge better positioned for the inevitable upturn.
With that, let me turn it over to Jeremy to take you through our fourth quarter and outlook. Jeremy?
Jeremy D. Thigpen
Thanks, Clay. Since Clay already covered the consolidated results, I'll just dive straight into our segment operating
performance for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, and then attempt to provide a little
color on the outlook for 2015.
The Rig Systems segment generated quarterly revenues of $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter, down 4% from a record
third quarter, as revenue out of backlog on offshore projects was not quite as strong sequentially. Compared to the
fourth quarter of 2013, Rig Systems' revenues were up 7%, due to heightened demand for high-spec land rigs and
equipment and our recent capacity additions, which have enabled us to convert more revenue out of backlog over the
prior year.
Operating profit for this segment was $511 million and operating margins were 20%, which were flat with the previous
quarter despite the 4% sequential decline in revenue, and up 90 basis points from the prior year.
Fourth quarter EBITDA for the segment was $534 million or 20.9% of sales. For the full year 2014, Rig Systems
posted record revenues of $9.8 billion, up 16.5% over 2013, and produced operating profit of almost $2 billion or
20.3% of sales, which resulted in year-over-year flow through or leverage of 27%.
Now, let's transition to the capital equipment orders for our Rig Systems segment for the fourth quarter of 2014, and
our resulting backlog. In the quarter, we recognized $2.3 billion of revenue out of backlog and captured $470 million in
new orders, resulting in a quarter-ending backlog of $12.5 billion.
In the quarter, we secured three each drilling equipment packages for jack-ups, five each land rigs, and a smattering of
offshore land components. Of the total $12.5 billion in quarter-ending backlog, approximately 91% is offshore and
91% is destined for international markets.
The Rig Aftermarket segment posted record revenues of $850 million in the fourth quarter 2014, up 2% sequentially
and up 12% over the fourth quarter of 2013, as our large and growing installed base of equipment, combined with the
investments that we have made in additional personnel, training, global infrastructure and inventory, have resulted in
solid growth.
Operating profit for the segment was $245 million or 28.8% of revenue. That's up 140 basis points sequentially and up
300 basis points from the prior year, on more favorable mix, with a higher percentage of high margin service work and

an unseasonably lower percentage of lower margin repair work.
For the quarter, EBITDA for the segment was $252 million or 29.6% of revenue.
For the full-year 2014, Rig Aftermarket posted recorded revenues of $3.2 billion or 19.7% over 2013, and produced
operating profit of $882 million or 27.4% of sales, which represented 29% leverage on the incremental revenue.
The Wellbore Technologies segment posted record revenues of $1.5 billion, up 4% sequentially and up 11.5%
compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. In the quarter, several businesses, including our drilling intervention, formerly
Downhole, our Grant Prideco Drill Pipe, our IntelliServ Wired Pipe and our well site services businesses delivered
record or near-record results for customer revenue, which explains both the sequential and year-over-year increases.
Operating profit for this segment was $276 million, or 18.1% of sales, down 80 basis points sequentially, but up 20
basis points over the prior year. The slight sequential decline in margin was expected, as the holidays invariably lead to
under absorption in our manufacturing and service facilities.
For the quarter, EBITDA for the segment was $387 million, or 25.3% of sales. For the full-year 2014, Wellbore
Technologies posted record revenues of $5.7 billion, up 12% over 2013, and produced operating profit of $1 billion, or
18.3% of sales, which represented 31% leverage on the incremental revenues.
The Completion and Production Solutions segment generated revenues of $1.3 billion, up 11% sequentially and up
15% from the fourth quarter of 2013. On a sequential basis, the revenue growth was driven by strong deliveries of
intervention and stimulation equipment, which were up 24%, and floating production equipment, which was up 29%, as
well as solid sales of fiberglass systems and subsea production equipment.
On a year-over-year basis, most businesses within this segment delivered low to mid-teens percentage growth, with the
exception of our intervention and stimulation equipment business, which posted a 40% gain over the fourth quarter of
2013.
Operating profit for this segment was $215 million, or 16.2% of revenues, which was up 80 basis points from the third
quarter of 2014 and up 30 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2013. Fourth-quarter EBITDA for the segment was
$273 million, or 20.6% of sales. For the full year 2014, the Completion and Production Solutions segment posted
record revenues of $4.6 billion, up 7.8% over 2013, and produced operating profit of $700 million, or 15.1% of sales.
Now, let's transition to the capital equipment orders for our Completion and Production Solutions segment. During the
quarter, the segment secured $469 million in new orders, which were more than offset by record shipments of $776
million out of backlog, resulting in a quarter-ending backlog of $1.8 billion.
Sequentially, orders for production-related equipment increased slightly. However, this increase was more than offset
by a 45% reduction in orders for intervention and stimulation equipment into the North American land market.
Overall, it was another solid quarter that marked the end of a transformative and record-breaking year for NOV. So like
Clay, I would like to thank each and every member of the NOV family for their commitment, their focus, and hard
work in the fourth quarter and throughout 2014.
As we move into 2015, it's clear that the sharp decline in oil prices will negatively impact our business. While we have
some visibility into the first quarter of 2015, our forecast for the balance of the year seems to be changing by the day.
For the first quarter, we believe that Rig Systems' revenues could decline in the high single-digit percentage range and
that margins could erode on lower volumes. A higher percentage of Brazil-related revenue and additional expenses
associated with customer requested scheduling changes, with some customers requesting that we slightly delay projects
and others actually asking us to expedite deliveries. And from an order perspective, we believe that the pace and
composition of orders could look somewhat similar to the pace and composition of orders that we received in the fourth
quarter of 2014. However, continued market uncertainty could lead to indefinite delays on some of these expected
orders, which could result in even lower bookings sequentially.

For our Rig Aftermarket business as we move into the first quarter of 2015, we believe that revenues could actually
decline slightly for two reasons. Number one, our customers clearly started scaling back in the fourth quarter, as
evidenced by the noticeable reduction in bookings for spare parts and fluid end expendables. And two, we are facing
significant and rising pricing pressure from our customers, which could lead and probably will lead to some pricing
concessions and negatively impact our top line and our margins.
For our Wellbore Technologies segment, it's important to remember that this segment is driven by drilling activity.
More rigs drilling more wells and more footage creates more opportunity for the various businesses within Wellbore
Technologies.
Unfortunately, given the precipitous declines in oil prices and the active rig count, our customers are dramatically
cutting spending, while simultaneously demanding significant discounts. As such, for the first quarter, we believe that
Wellbore Technologies segment revenues could decline in the mid-teens percentage range, with decrementals in the
50% to 60% range.
And finally, for our Completion and Production Solutions segment, we believe that first quarter 2015 revenues could
decline by as much as 25%, with decrementals in the mid-30% range, as we expect sharp declines in our higher-margin
intervention and stimulation equipment business, as orders for coil tubing units and pressure pumping equipment and
consumables have virtually disappeared.
Predicting the full-year 2015 is impossible in this environment. Still, I will make a few comments about each segment
that I hope are helpful.
At our Analyst Day in November, when oil was $75 a barrel, we included a chart that essentially forecasted a 10%
year-over-year revenue decline in our Rig Systems segment. And in the Q&A section, we specifically stated that
despite this 10% decline in revenue, Rig Systems margins could hold fairly steady at that 20% range.
Unfortunately, after watching oil prices plummet below $50 a barrel, our underlying assumptions have changed. In
November, we expected about $7 billion to $7.5 billion of our third-quarter ending backlog to flow out as revenue in
2015, and we expected demand for land rigs and for discrete components for both land and offshore to remain strong in
the fourth quarter of 2014 and well into 2015. But as evidenced by the $470 million in fourth quarter 2015 bookings
and the recent announcements from our land and offshore drilling customers, the previously expected book and turn
revenue in 2015 is now clearly in question.
Additionally, as you might expect, we've received requests from some customers to delay specific projects and
shipments on select projects, which could ultimately push some revenue out of 2015 and into 2016. And since we may
not receive the higher-margin book and turn orders that we expected, and since we may have to juggle manufacturing,
delivery, and installation and commissioning schedules, all of which could add cost, we believe that margins could tick
down slightly on the additional revenue reduction.
For our Rig Aftermarket segment, we do not really know what to expect on the top line. However, we know that rig
counts are falling and that customers are uncertain about their future prospects. And when customers are uncertain
about their future prospects, they often curtail spending, consume existing inventories, cannibalize underutilized assets,
and indefinitely postpone upgrades.
So when you couple that customer behavior with pricing concessions, we do not expect to see the same mid-teens
percentage year-over-year growth that we have come to enjoy in previous years, and we believe that margins could
erode slightly from 2014 levels.
Because it's based on drilling activity and because we do not know how quickly or how far the rig count will ultimately
fall, forecasting the full year for Wellbore Technologies segment is equally challenging. If one wanted to use the 2008
to 2009 timeframe as a proxy for 2014 to 2015, one could predict revenues to fall between 20% and 25% with steep
50% to 60% decremental margins.
As a point of reference, Wellbore Technologies segment revenues for the full year 2009, excluding non-recurring
items, were 9.8%. Obviously, faced with the top line decline similar to 2008 to 2009, we will make every effort to

maximize profitability and improve upon the margins that we posted in 2009. However, it's important to remember that
this segment is already facing substantial pricing pressure, and it carries a heavy D&A load, including manufacturing
and service facility infrastructure, sizable rental fleets, and intangibles associated with prior acquisitions, that work
together to challenge profitability in a severe downturn.
And finally, our Completion and Production Solutions segment is perhaps the most difficult to forecast, due to the fact
that it supplies both long lead time capital equipment and short cycle consumables to support a very volatile
completions market and a sometimes frustratingly slow to materialize offshore production market. As we move
throughout 2015, we believe that demand for pressure pumping and coil tubing units will most likely be very soft in the
U.S. with pockets of opportunity internationally, and we think that demand for floating and subsea production
equipment will continue to be lumpy.
But since we're entering the year with a reasonably healthy backlog, we would expect revenues to slightly outperform
the decline in the overall market. And depending on the suddenness and magnitude of that top-line decline, we believe
that decremental leverage for this segment could be between 40% and 50%.
So, 2015 could certainly prove to be challenging. But as Clay stated and as we've clearly demonstrated in the past, we
remain confident in the ability of this organization to adapt and not just survive, but thrive in a cyclical downturn.
So with that, let's turn to some of the remaining elements of National Oilwell Varco 's consolidated fourth-quarter 2014
income statement. Gross margin declined 20 basis points sequentially but increased 60 basis points year-over-year to
27.1%. For the full year 2014, gross margin also improved 60 basis points to 21.7%.
SG&A decreased $7 million sequentially but increased $46 million year-over-year. As a percent of revenue, SG&A
declined 40 basis points sequentially and increased 10 basis points year-over-year to 9.2%. For the full-year 2014,
SG&A increased $214 million, or 11.7%, but as a percentage of sales, SG&A actually declined slightly to 9.5%.
Other items, which includes the impairment of some indefinite lives trade names within our Wellbore Technologies
segment, as well as the loss associated with the sale of a non-core industrial business that was acquired in the Robbins
& Myers transaction were $163 million in the quarter. For the year, other items were $214 million versus $53 million in
2013.
Interest expense was flat sequentially at $26 million and interest income increased $1 million to $5 million. As
compared to 2013, interest expense decreased $6 million and interest income increased $6 million.
Equity income in Voest Alpine JV increased $7 million sequentially to $60 million, as the plant was, once again, fully
operational, following its annual maintenance in the third quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2013, equity
income was flat, and compared to the full year 2013, equity income declined $5 million to $58 million. For the first
quarter and full-year 2015, we believe that equity income will fall, as demand for drill pipe and therefore, Green Tube
will moderate.
Other expense for the quarter was $20 million, which represents a $29 million delta sequentially, but is more consistent
with historical trends. For the full-year, other expense was $32 million versus $30 million in 2013.
The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 28.1%, which was 70 basis points lower than the 28.8% rate that we
posted in the third quarter of 2014 and 200 basis points to 300 basis points lower than historical trends and our
expectations. Excluding discrete items in the quarter, the company's effective tax rate would have been closer to 30%.
Therefore, as we move into 2015, we believe that 30% to 31% continues to be a realistic estimate of NOV's effective
tax rate.
If you now quickly turn to the first supplemental schedule, you'll see that eliminations were $556 million for the
quarter, down slightly from $569 million in the third quarter of 2014. Unallocated expenses and eliminations were $229
million for the quarter, down $6 million sequentially on the lower volume of inter-segment revenues. As compared to
the full-year 2013, eliminations increased 38.6% on higher volumes, and unallocated expenses and eliminations
increased 31.7%.

And finally, if you turn to last supplemental schedule, you will see that depreciation and amortization expense in the
quarter was $199 million, up $1 million from the third quarter and up $4 million from the previous year. For the full
year, depreciation and amortization expense was $778 million, up 5.4% from 2013.
EBITDA for the fourth quarter, excluding other items, was $1.2 billion or 21.3% of sales. For the full-year 2014,
EBITDA was a record $4.6 billion, up 13.9% from 2013.
Turning to the balance sheet, our December 31, 2014 balance sheet employed working capital, excluding cash and debt
of $5.4 billion, down $125 million or 2.3% sequentially. Looking more closely at working capital, accounts receivable
decreased $66 million or 1.5% sequentially, despite the $122 million sequential increase in revenue. Inventory declined
$183 million or 3.3% sequentially, as reductions in Rig Systems, Wellbore Technologies and Completion and
Production Solutions were partially offset by inventory growth in Rig Aftermarket.
Also leading to a sequential reduction in working capital, accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased $138
million. Unfortunately, due to the sequential decline in bookings for offshore new builds, costs incurred on major
projects significantly outpaced milestone invoicing, which resulted in the $297 million sequential decline in customer
financing.
For the quarter, the company generated $736 million in cash flow from operations. Capital spending for the fourth
quarter was $231 million, up almost 38% sequentially, due to better-than-expected progress on several significant
ongoing construction projects.
In the quarter, we also invested $110 million in three acquisitions, we made dividend payments of $196 million and we
spent $779 million to repurchase shares.
As a result, we ended the fourth quarter of 2014 with a cash balance of $3.5 billion, down $555 million sequentially,
but up $100 million from the prior year. And we ended the year in a net cash position of $370 million, as we were able
to make the previously-mentioned investments without assuming any incremental debt. Of the $3.5 billion in cash,
almost 16% of the balance was in the U.S. at December 31, 2014.
As we move into 2015, we will continue to invest in our 10-year strategies. However, we will do so at a more measured
pace than previously envisaged. As a result, we will expect to reduce year-to-year capital spending by 15%.
Now, let me turn it back to Clay.

<A - Clay C. Williams>: Hey, Jim.
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: Good morning.
<Q - Jim D. Crandell>: Clay, you just touched on M&A, and you described your efforts as mainly a continuation of
the singles and doubles strategy, which NOV has done very well at over the past 15 years. But you've also done very
well at the home-run strategy, and you have a great record of that the last 15 years. In order to execute sort of the

home-run strategy, I think you'd agree you need to be proactive. What kind of place in the company strategy does
proactively looking for larger acquisitions have, at the current time?
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Well, thanks for your kind comments, Jim. We absolutely are continuing to look for larger
transactions. Those take much – typically take much longer to cultivate, and so we have had conversations with a few
larger potential counterparties out there. What we generally find is in a declining market, it's hard to get the bid and the
ask to converge.
And most of those transactions are better accomplished and you get more agreement between the counterparties as
markets are increasing. So, I think until we begin – start to see a little bit of recovery and a little bit stronger outlook,
it's going to be hard to get bids and ask to come together. But we're – as you know, we're always out there looking for
opportunities to deploy capital into good return opportunities and recognize that those conversations are long-term
investments.
And so, we do have a couple going on now, but nothing, really nothing to report. I don't think there's any sort of
transaction out that's imminent in the near term.
<Q - Jim D. Crandell>: Okay. And my follow-up, guys, is could you hit on your major businesses in North America
and talk about the magnitude of pricing weakness at such things like Tuboscope and Grant Prideco and Mission and
some of your other important domestic businesses?
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Yeah. I'll say that our customers are being very aggressive and seem to have the same form
letter that they are sending to everyone able to receive a letter and are demanding very high discounts, double-digit
percentage discounts. We are responding to those by sitting around the table with those customers – by product line,
nothing that's across the board, by product line and discussing ways that we can work together to mutually drive cost
out of the system. And so I think, by and large, every business is handling it individually by customer.
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: Yes. Trying to make lemonade out of lemons, we're also trying to turn those conversations
more towards volume-based rebates, so that we get more volume out of the concessions that we're making. Ideas like
that are what we're trying to push forward.
<Q - Jim D. Crandell>: Great. Okay. Good job, guys. Thank you.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Jud Bailey from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
<Q - Judson E. Bailey>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Good morning.
<Q - Judson E. Bailey>: A question on, you kind of think about your revenue out of backlog for this year and trying to
think about margins at Rig Systems, understanding your customers are giving you – are bombarding you with other
requests like you said, delaying or accelerating, did you give an exact number on what you think revenue out of
backlog could be? And then on top of that, how quickly can you adjust your cost structure as you have to delay
projects? Help us think about, as you bring your production in-house, how quickly can you preserve margins at Rig
Systems?
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: Yeah. Jud, thanks. On the – in the prepared remarks, I talked about at the end of Q3 and as
we got to our Analyst Day, we actually thought that about $7 billion to $7.5 billion would flow out of our current
backlog, and that was the backlog at the end of Q3. We then assumed that we'd get some book and turn in Q4 and
throughout 2015 that would take that number up.

Given the pace of orders, we think it's probably going to be closer to that $7 billion range in terms of revenue flowing
out of backlog this year based on what we see today. Now, we could receive some orders here in the next few months
that we can turn into revenue before the end of the year. But right now, it's looking pretty soft. So, I think somewhere in
that $7 billion range is probably reasonable.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: And with regards to the margin, we're probably a little beyond our optimal kind of efficiency
in terms of margin production in the backlog. Meaning, we have more work. And we're relying on graveyard shifts and
a lot of overtime and kind of third and fourth and fifth-tier suppliers. I think there is some benefit, actually, as volumes
start to back off just a little bit in terms of reducing some overtime, of reverting to our most productive shifts, reverting
to our most productive sub-suppliers. And so that will help on the margin front.
But – and I would add to that too, our own suppliers, we're in discussions with about reducing the prices that they
charge us. We're hesitant though to wrap margin improvement around that scenario because, no doubt, we're going to
continue to see price pressure and face challenges that are coming out of the current slow market.
<Q - Judson E. Bailey>: Okay. And my follow-up is a bigger-picture question, when you think about the decline in oil
today, and people like to reference 2009, but as we stand today, deepwater rig rates are coming down much more
quickly, in general. The backlogs for the offshore drillers is much less than that timeframe, and there's probably a
legitimate discussion that offshore rig rates could go close to cash breakeven. How do you think about Rig Systems and
orders over the next two to three years if that happens? And how you think shipyards will react from a price
standpoint? Last time, they reduced price, which helped, but will it really help if rig rates are at such a depressed level
that – do they even bother to reduce price because no one is going to order anyway?
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Yeah. I don't think lower cost or price of rigs delivered is going to catalyze much demand
right now. And as I said in the opening remarks, our plan is to manage to the market realities kind of
quarter-by-quarter. We have a great backlog which will burn off over the next several quarters. As we find ourselves,
let's say, this time next year without a resumption in orders in the offshore world, we expect two things to happen.
One is our installation and commissioning efforts around the rigs that are being built will continue strong through 2015
and well into 2016. As that starts to wind down a little bit though, we'll have good opportunities to pivot and refocus
the technical capabilities of that group and the infrastructure that supports that group towards SPSs which we do see
rising in spite of the market challenges. We see opportunities to pivot and refocus that group towards more onshore
aftermarket support. I think there's great potential out there for NOV to build on its franchise in the land side and
provide better aftermarket support of those customers. Likewise, on manufacturing, we expect to pivot, kind of refocus
in the aftermarket opportunity around that.
And then secondly – that'll help a lot, but secondly, we're going to be sizing to what the market dictates. As I also
mentioned in my opening comments, we're outsourcing more than half of our machining work in Rig, for instance. And
so, we have a lot of sort of flexible or flex supply chain out there that supports our efforts that we can diminish.
And then thirdly, we've got two other big segments that have different cyclical behaviors. And so, a recovery in rig
counts in 2016 would do a lot to very rapidly lift demand by Wellbore Technologies for machining capabilities, for
assembly, and likewise, Completion and Production Solutions is on a little different cyclical trajectory. So, by having
three different segments that sort of have different cyclical behaviors, it gives us an opportunity to refocus resources
into places that may need them.
<Q - Judson E. Bailey>: All right, great. I'll turn it back, and I appreciate the commentary.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Thanks, Jud.

<Q - J. Marshall Adkins>: Good morning, guys. Thank you for all the detail in the sub-sector. That's very helpful.
Clay, I want to ask a bigger-picture question, you've touched a little bit on it, so far. Typically, in downturns, you guys
win, in that you have strong cash flows and you pursue this M&A strategy. Now, it looks like you have the stock
buybacks going on, as well as there's a possibility which you didn't have before. Walk me through how you prioritize
those and you mentioned M&A is going to be kind of slow to develop, given the bid-ask spread. But how are you
thinking about it in terms of the timing of spending the excess cash over the next couple of years?
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Well, I think, Marshall, we came into this downturn with $4.1 billion of cash on our balance
sheet at the beginning of Q4, a lot of credit capacity and expectation that as business slows, we will have cash come out
of working capital and off of our balance sheet plus $14.3 billion backlog translates to a pretty significant margin
embedded in that backlog, which will turn to cash over the next year or two. So, we kind of entered this downturn with
a lot of resources, and I think what that means is we have the capability to really do all the above. And so, we have very
intentionally stepped up our focus on M&A mostly around the smaller company opportunities because, frankly, they're
more doable in this kind of market downturn.
I think it's challenging for a public company to enter into an agreement to sell itself. It's not distressed when the stock
price is way below its 52-week high, and so it makes it difficult to do a larger transaction in this kind of environment.
That's not to say – like I mentioned earlier to Jim, it's not to say that we're not continuing conversations, surveying
landscape out there, but in terms of how we prioritize, I think we can do all the above and do so in a way that doesn't
sacrifice future flexibility and do so in a way that keeps some powder dry for those opportunities as they arise. So,
that's kind of the thought process that we're going through.
Specifically, with regard to the share buyback, I mean this is the company we know best. We can buy in shares with no
purchase premium and we can size those transactions to whatever size which we're comfortable with, which is why at
our Analyst Day, we sort of linked the application of capital in the share buyback program to the repatriation of cash
from overseas.
<Q - J. Marshall Adkins>: Okay. Just one quick, unrelated follow-up. We're going to see a lot of rig retirements both
on land and offshore or stacking, whatever you want to call it. I presume that hurts your aftermarket business, but help
me to understand kind of how that flows through for you all, as you retire rigs. I presume, that's a lot less aftermarket
stuff, but I'm not sure about that.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: No. That's exactly correct. The older rigs are less – far less aftermarket-intensive than the
new rigs. And so, the newer rigs that are coming out of the shipyard now, that have come out of the shipyard in the last
few years have much higher levels of electronic controls, many, many, many more miles of wiring and cabling and
more precision machined components that help them work more efficiently.
And what we know is that, that kind of equipment, that style of equipment is going to be much more
aftermarket-intensive than the old rigs that are being laid down. So the old rigs, we've got some level of participation
really in all rigs. So the old rigs, there's a little bit of aftermarket that goes away, but it's a good trade for us. And all
things considered, we much, much prefer a new rig in terms of its aftermarket potential.
<Q - J. Marshall Adkins>: Perfect. Thanks, guys.

<Q - Jeff Tillery>: For the Rig Aftermarket business, could you just provide some qualitative color around the mix of
that, in terms of onshore versus offshore and then, the deepwater component? And do I think about that – the level of
business for you guys, just tracking kind of working deepwater rig count? Just trying to think of different ways to
forecast the business over the next year.
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: Sure, Jeff. Obviously, it moves around a little bit depending on the quarter, but by and
large, it's about an 80%/20% split offshore to land.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Yeah. And which gives us the belief that there's more to do there in land and think longer
term there's opportunities to kind of grow that business to focus on the land fleet. The other kind of interesting
observation about our aftermarket business is that as our customers have become a lot more focused on their
expenditures, they are probably going to be more open to repairing old drilling equipment rather than replacing it with
new drilling equipment.
So, we think there'll be lots of instances where rather than selling, for instance, a new set of draw-works out of Rig
Systems that we'll actually have our Rig Aftermarket business, now fixing an older set of draw-works and kind of
getting it back up and running. And so that may actually help the aftermarket business somewhat later in the year.
<Q - Jeff Tillery>: Thank you. And then for the Wellbore Technologies segment, if I think about the composition of
the business today versus 2009, walk us through kind of the puts and takes that would make either the 2009 comparison
valid or something to drive either better or worse decremental performance relative to the 2009 cycle.
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: Yeah. I think, obviously, all of the businesses are larger now. But in terms of kind of the
percentage of total revenue, they're probably fairly similar to the way they were in 2009. But I'm not – I think the
comparison is probably fair. It won't be exactly that. It'll be reasonably close, I would think.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Yes.
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: It could be if the market deteriorates as quickly as it did and as deeply as it did from 2008
to 2009 and 2014 to 2015.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Yes, generally, they're all very high operating leverage businesses. And so, you will see –
we'll feel that as they come back down. Not sure pricing ever got up to the levels we had in 2008.
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: No.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: And I've heard some of the other oilfield service companies referencing that, which they
point to as limiting – potentially limiting decrementals. I'm probably hesitant to forecast that. Previous downturns point
to pretty high decrementals and Wellbore Technologies businesses will probably likely to see the same thing in 2015.
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: The one thing that could be encouraging, Jeff, is if you think back to 2008, 2009, you've
had a number of years of steady increases. Here, we went through kind of a destocking late 2012 and throughout 2013.
I'm not sure that we – actually, our customers actually built inventory levels...
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Yeah. Right.
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: ...in 2014 to degree they did in 2008. So that would suggest, hopefully, that as the market
starts to rebound, that demand comes back to us more quickly than it did, just because I don't think we have the same
inventory overhang as we did back in 2008 and/or 2012 as well.
<Q - Jeff Tillery>: That's very helpful color. Did pricing erode more than 10% in 2009? I'm trying to think, on
balance. I seem to remember 5% to 10% is what's stuck in my head for pricing reductions.
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: Yes. I actually believe it was probably north of 10% for a lot of businesses.
<Q - Jeff Tillery>: Okay. Thank you.

<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our last question will come from Robin Shoemaker from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Robin E. Shoemaker>: Yes. Thanks a lot. I was wondering if you could update us on the portion of the $12.5
billion of Rig Systems backlog that relates to Brazil. And how has this ongoing internal investigation in Petrobras –
that's clearly slowed down drilling, how has it affected the pace of rig construction or shipyard construction, the things
that you referred to?
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Yes. Thanks, Robin. Actually, thankfully, for us, it really hasn't created a big impact on our
programs. If you remember back a few years ago when Petrobras settled this up, they set up a separate financing arm
called Sete in Brazil that is actually the customer. And it went out and secured its equity partner investors and secured
its bank financings. And it kind of – so it's sort of moving along separately without – there's virtually no capital support
from Petrobras into those projects to construct the rigs.
Where the support comes is in the contracts to operate those rigs once they're delivered. And that's still a couple of
years out. But based upon Sete placing orders to construct these rigs with their partners, shipyards jumped in the fray
and including a couple of new shipyards that were constructed for this program. And so, those have been proceeding
along relatively smoothly, that's not to say without some delays and some issues, some challenges that we fully
expected. But by and large, those projects are moving ahead. We expect the first rig to be delivered, I think, Q3 or Q4
this year, and the first of 22 rigs that were signed up to deliver.
And the specific challenges that group of projects and shipyards have faced have been more around cost overruns on
the construction of the shipyards that led to a few payment delays for us. We're working through that. And the good
news here within the past few weeks, a couple of financing packages have been made available to Sete. I mentioned in
my opening comments the Development Bank of Brazil, I think the Central Bank is involved, the Banco do Brasil and
then some of the Asian partners to some of the shipyards are also financing the completion of the construction of those
yards. So net-net, we're in pretty decent shape. I think important for NOV shareholders is that we're ahead. We've
received more payments than we have delivered equipment into these projects, and so, very important to us that we
maintain that position from a risk management side. So we're in pretty good shape on these, Robin.
<Q - Robin E. Shoemaker>: Okay. And on the pricing discussions that you're having with customers and where
they're coming to you, just wanted to clarify that – does any of that pertain to existing backlog in Rig Systems or
Completion and Production Solutions? Or is it entirely on new orders?
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: Entirely on new orders and really mostly around kind of the short-cycle consumable type
items.
<Q - Robin E. Shoemaker>: Sure. Okay.
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: [ph] There's a minority on that that aren't in backlog (60:16).
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Yeah. To the extent we're entertaining any changes in backlog at all; it's usually around just
delivery dates like I said...
<Q - Robin E. Shoemaker>: Okay.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: ...and push things out just a little bit, we can actually save money.
<Q - Robin E. Shoemaker>: Right. And in reference to my earlier question, did you want to give a portion of your Rig
Systems backlog that pertains to Brazil or...?
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: Yes. $3.5 billion...

<Q - Robin E. Shoemaker>: Okay. Great.
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: ...out of the $12.5 billion is the Brazil Atlas Project 22 floating rigs.
<Q - Robin E. Shoemaker>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. I'd now turn the call over to Mr. Clay Williams for closing remarks.
