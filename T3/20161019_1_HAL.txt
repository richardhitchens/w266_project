David J. Lesar
Thank you, Lance, and good morning to everyone. Let me start by saying that I am very pleased with our results. I
never thought I would be so satisfied by barely making a profit. But given where this market is, I certainly am. Through
hard work and determination, we have returned to positive territory for our earnings.
Now, this has been a historic down cycle for the industry, and has had its fair share of challenges. Our organization is
meeting those challenges head-on and fighting through them. I am very proud of our leadership and all of our
employees. We are the execution company and I believe this quarter we out-executed even the very high expectations
we place on our organization.
Let's take a minute and talk about what transpired over the quarter. Our North America revenue grew 9% for the
period, representing the first revenue increase in seven quarters. Our results improved as we took advantage of the rig
count growth by focusing on increasing utilization, and working our surface efficiency model. Our customers' animal
spirits remain alive and well in North America, even though for some, they may feel caged in a bit by cash flow
constraints in the short-term.
The average U.S. rig count increased 14% over the quarter, driven primarily by rig additions to smaller operators where
we saw a trend of less service intensive wells, which is not activity typically worth chasing at today's pricing. This
quarter was also impacted by the natural lag time between drilling and completion activity. However, we are now
seeing completion activity starting to pick up as we start the fourth quarter.
We continue to aggressively implement our structural cost reductions announced in our first quarter call and we have
met our goal. On a monthly basis, we have already achieved the run rate of $1 billion of cost savings annually. We also
generated over $1 billion in cash flow from operating activities this quarter. As you all know, as we executed our play
book, we gained significant market share globally through the downturn.
As the market stabilize, our primary focus will now switch to improving our margins, while maintaining that market
share. In the U.S., we believe we now have the highest market share we've ever had. And at this point, if we have to
give some of it back to move margins up, we might take that approach. In North America, we achieved a 41%
incremental margin. This was a strong step in the right direction as we work to regain profitability there.
We remain steadfast in our belief that significant activity increases from our customers starts with sustainable
commodity prices over $50 per barrel, which we haven't seen in any meaningful way yet since the rig count activity
bottomed out. Operators have had time to reflect on their future drilling plans, and I believe they will approach the
recovery with a rational, methodical response in activity based on commodity price fluctuations.
Now, looking ahead to the fourth quarter on North America land. Activity levels are difficult to call at this point. Based
on current customer feedback, we remain cautious around customer activity due to holiday and seasonal
weather-related downtimes. Our customers may take extended breaks, starting as early as Thanksgiving, and push
additional work to the first quarter of 2017.
As one customer told me, Dave, it doesn't make any sense for me to rent an efficient high-spec rig if I have to start and
stop all the time for the holidays, over the last five weeks of the year. I just can't get the efficiencies I'm paying for in
the rig. I'd rather just wait until next year to start drilling. And I believe we'll see a lot of that mentality in the fourth
quarter. But that being said, it does not change our view that things are getting better for us and our customers.

Now, let's turn internationally. I like where our market share is today in the international markets. And I believe we
continue to outperform our peers. I expect the international markets to slowly grind downward, due to the lower
commodity price environment. We experienced activity in pricing headwinds during the quarter, but in anticipation of
those forces, we aggressively managed our costs. Although, we have had to concede some on pricing, we have worked
closely with our customers during the past year to improve their project economics through technology and operating
efficiency.
We expect to see a bottoming of the international rig count in the first half of 2017. Land-based mature field activity
should lead the international recovery, while we expect the deepwater complex to remain severely challenged for the
foreseeable future. Even though the light at the end of the tunnel is getting brighter, there is no question we remain in a
very challenging market. However, we are confident in our ability to navigate through this cycle and in our continued
focus on unconventional mature fields in deepwater markets.
As we have said before, unconventionals, particularly those in North America, are leading the recovery in activity,
providing the optimal combination of short cycle returns and fastest incremental barrel to market. Mature fields
continue to be resilient, given their relatively low lifting costs. And finally, deepwater remains structurally challenged
with higher costs and long duration project characteristics. While each faces a different set of circumstances today, you
can be sure we are looking at our business closely, to ensure that we accelerate our growth in each sector as the
industry begins to heal.
As we have said for some time, North America has assumed the role of swing producer in global oil production.
Because of the shift away from production discipline, which was historically created by OPEC, our industry will likely
experience shorter commodity price cycles going forward. So we see the future market as a combination of shorter
cycles in range-bound commodity prices. In that environment it is imperative that returns focus companies like
Halliburton be more asset light. Having an organization structured in a way that is flexible, nimble and efficient and
that can adapt to these new quick-moving cycles will be critical to drive the returns results our shareholders have come
to expect.
Our philosophy has been in prioritizing returns over margins and revenue. And that philosophy will continue. Now,
don't get me wrong, we are always focused on improving margins, but keep in mind the last cycle of $100 oil covered
up terrible inefficiencies across the industry. In today's environment, asset utilization will be just as critical to
improving margins. And I have full confidence we are taking the necessary steps to achieve that. Positioning us for
success while navigating through this deep cyclical downturn was one of the most intellectually-stimulating
management challenges we have ever had and I am confident the Halliburton management team has and will continue
to successfully meet each and every challenge.
With that, let me turn the call over to Mark and Jeff to cover our financial and operational results. Mark?
Mark A. McCollum
Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everyone. Let's start with a summary of our third quarter results compared to our second
quarter results on an adjusted basis. Total company revenue for the quarter was flat at $3.8 billion, while our operating
income doubled to $128 million. These results were primarily driven by increased activity in North America, and the
continued impact of our global cost savings initiatives.
Moving to our regional results, North America revenue increased 9% with a $58 million increase in operating results,
or 47%, sequentially. The higher U.S. land rig count coupled with better equipment utilization and our ongoing cost
management efforts drove this improvement.
In Latin America, revenue and operating income declined by 13% and 50%, respectively. These results primarily
reflect reduced activity levels in Mexico, Argentina and Venezuela as we've now experienced a 15-year low in the
regional rig count.

Turning to Europe/Africa/CIS, revenue declined 6% as a result of lower drilling activity in West Africa and Continental
Europe. Operating income increased 19%, primarily related to our cost savings initiatives and improved pressure
pumping and pipeline service profitability throughout the region.
In Middle East/Asia, revenue declined 3% with a decline in operating income of 4%. The decrease for the quarter was
primarily driven by reduced activity across Asia-Pacific, including Australia and Indonesia, as well as pricing pressure
across the entire region.
Our corporate and other expense for the third quarter totaled approximately $47 million, which was positively impacted
by a true up of some of our insurance reserves. For the fourth quarter, we expect our corporate expense to return to our
previous run rate of approximately $60 million.
Interest expense for the quarter was $141 million, and was positively impacted by the interest income we're now
earning on the Venezuelan promissory notes we accepted in exchange for some of our trade receivables last quarter.
We expect that this level of net interest expense will be our new run rate for the next several quarters.
Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 114% benefit, well above the already-unusual 50% rate we anticipated
on our last call. As we've discussed before, these unusual effective tax rates are primarily the result of having tax losses
in the U.S. that are offset by taxable income in foreign jurisdictions with lower statutory rates. However, the difference
this quarter from the rate we anticipated was largely due to an adjustment reflecting the beneficial use of an
Argentinean tax treaty that limits the taxation of royalty payments for intellectual property and will allow for more
efficient movement of our foreign cash in the future. Based on our current outlook, we anticipate that our effective tax
rate for the fourth quarter will be approximately 65%.
Turning to cash flow, we improved our cash position during the third quarter, ending the period with $3.3 billion in
cash and equivalents, even after paying off $600 million of senior notes. This increase in cash flow was primarily due
to working capital improvements, which included a seven-plus day reduction of our days sales outstanding and the
receipt of a series of tax refunds. Capital expenditures for the year are still expected to be approximately $850 million.
Now, turning to our short-term operational outlook, let me provide you with our thoughts on the fourth quarter. In
North America, the uncertainty surrounding customer activity around the holiday season makes the quarter difficult to
predict. Based on what our customers are collectively telling us, we anticipate our revenue to perform in line with the
rig count, and we expect our sequential incremental margins to be 35% to 40%.
In our international business, we believe the typical seasonal uptick in year-end software and product sales will be
minimal this year as customer budgets are exhausted and may not fully offset continued pricing and activity pressures.
As such, we expect fourth quarter revenue and margins to come in flat compared to the third quarter.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for the operational update. Jeff?
Jeffrey Allen Miller
Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to thank and congratulate all of our employees for their
fantastic execution throughout the cycle. It's been a tough two years and our organization has delivered on service
quality, has delivered on cost savings, and has absolutely executed on our value proposition, collaborating and
engineering solutions to maximize asset value for our customers. The result of this execution was improved margins
and repeat business.
So let's start with North America, while the supply and demand balance for U.S. onshore services is heading in the right
direction, we are still in an oversupplied equipment market. Our customers remain focused on cost and producing more
barrels. I believe this puts us in an excellent position. No one is better at collaborating with customers to engineer
solutions that deliver the lowest cost per BOE than Halliburton.
In fact, the more I talk to customers, the more I am convinced this is the winning formula. In pressure pumping, we
estimate that the U.S. active fleet, I emphasize active, grew to over 7 million-horsepower and the utilization of that

active marketed fleet is about 70%. This is a long way from full capacity, but it represents substantial tightening during
the third quarter. And as I said last quarter, this is the first step towards a balanced market for the industry's available
fleet. And while we know the industry has additional horsepower on the sidelines that could come into the market, we
also know that this additional equipment requires substantial maintenance to be put back to work and will require
adequate price increases to justify its return.
So as we look ahead, we expect pricing to work its way through a couple of predictable steps. The first step, which
we're starting to see now, is a tightening of active capacity. This will have a modest price impact but, more importantly,
it allows increased utilization to have a positive contribution to earnings. Step two is when we see equipment requiring
significant investment returning to the market. I expect that this will require significantly higher pricing to justify the
investment. This is by no means traditional pricing power. Instead, it's the industry recognizing the relationship
between investments and returns. Let's hope.
Market share is valuable and that's why we build it in the downturn. I think Dave was crystal clear that our target is
leading returns and we have not forgotten that. High market share gives us choice in the recovery to work with the most
efficient customers who value what we do and who ultimately reward us for helping them make better wells. There is
no doubt that, in this environment, our clients are planning work based on commodity price. The stakes have never
been higher for us to help maximize the value of their assets and this is exactly what we're doing. So let me take you
through some examples of how we're doing this today.
Last quarter we worked with a Permian operator who wanted to step outside of their core assets and find a way to
optimize the value of their acreage. With a robust drilling and completion plan in place, the customer sought to
minimize completion damage during flowback to maximize overall recovery. Through the use of our CALIBR
engineered flowback service, we were able to prevent damage and achieve a 15% higher cumulative production on this
well than on wells nearby with similar completions.
The well is now the best producer in the customer's portfolio despite it being in the geology that had been originally
considered marginal. There has been a lot of talk about drilling in core reservoir rock recently. I believe it's now our job
to help our customers extend the definition of core. This is a great example of how we listen to our customers' drivers
and work with them to develop a unique solution to meet their goals. CALIBR had not been used before in the Permian
but thanks to this success, it's gained traction in that basin.
In the Middle East, we recently engaged in a highly-collaborative project where the customer's drivers were to improve
delivery time and production. We developed a solution that stimulated a well in less time and in a more cost-effective
manner. Using our [indiscernible] (19:44) squeeze technique where coil tubing is used to deliver more focused
stimulation to selective areas, we were able to use fewer chemicals and reduce pumping time by 40%. This highlights
how Halliburton systematically collaborates with the customer to engineer a solution that maximizes their asset value.
In Brazil, we worked to maximize our customer's asset value through intelligent completions. These are essential in the
pre-salt area to improve reservoir management and production while reducing the overall well cost. In the quarter, we
completed a multi-year campaign of 40 successful intelligent completions, which lowered the lifting cost dramatically.
This is what clients like about Halliburton. We collaborate, meaning listen and respond to our customers. We focus on
creating and maintaining strong client relationships. It's why we win and keep work. It's how we get things done and
why we are the execution company.
To sum up, I've walked through our value proposition in action and it's equally effective in all of our strategic markets;
unconventionals, mature fields and deepwater. The takeaway is that Halliburton is well-positioned to win the recovery
in each of these markets.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Dave for closing comments. Dave?

Thanks, Jeff, and let me summarize. As we predicted, the North America unconventional market has responded the
quickest, demonstrated by the increase in recent rig count activity; however, we continue to believe meaningful activity
increases from our customers will not start until we see sustainable commodity prices above $50 per barrel. And while
the international markets will take a little more time to rebound, we are maintaining our integrated global services
footprint, managing costs and continuing to fight for market share. We expect to see the bottom for activity in this
market to occur in the first half of 2017.
In this global recovery, we expect cycle times to accelerate. I believe successful companies will be characterized by a
lighter asset base, faster asset velocity and job site execution all geared to respond quickly to deliver returns. So to me,
no matter what market is handed to us, Halliburton is well-positioned and our dedication to execution gives me
confidence that we will continue to outperform our peers.
With that, let's open it up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from James West with Evercore ISI. You may begin.
<Q - James West>: Hey. Good morning, gentlemen, and congrats on a well-executed quarter.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Thank you, James.
<Q - James West>: I wanted to dig in Dave or Jeff on the pricing question around North American pressure pumping.
Now, at this point, I know you've indicated you've got the market share, so you will give up some in order to get the
profitability up. Are you starting to see the early signs of some pricing gains in certain basins and maybe it's not in the
Permian but maybe some of the basins where equipment has migrated out of?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Well, thanks, James. This is Jeff. Pricing is still – I'll describe it overall as a brawl. As I
said, we're always pushing on pricing. We are seeing small increases in different basins. But where we're most focused
are on those customers with whom we collaborate the best.
<Q - James West>: Right.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: And I've always said that the tightening of utilization was a critical first step and we are
beginning to see that. We're also moving away in some cases from work where we don't see a similar clear path to
returns.
<Q - James West>: Okay. And then maybe a follow up on that. So I guess your strategy for un-stacking equipment at
this point you suggested it's more of a conversation about returns on the assets, that would assume that you need at least
some level of price increase to bring stacked equipment even if it's in great shape, back to work.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Spot on James. I mean, the equipment has got to make returns. And in my view this does
require a step-up in price. And so for that reason, we don't have current plans to add horsepower to the market and we
expect the next round of investment broadly to drive better discipline related to returns.
<Q - James West>: Okay. Great. Thanks, Jeff.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Thanks.

<Q - Judson E. Bailey>: Thanks. Good morning. A question for Dave or Jeff. I was hoping could you expand maybe
Dave on your comments – in your prepared comments on the need to be asset light. I think you said in the context of a
shorter cycle that you envisioned. Does this reflect any type of change in how you're going to run the business or
strategy or how you think about investing in the business given your comments?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Yeah, Jud. This is Jeff. We're focused on everything that drives returns. And in my view,
the shorter cycles are really closer to our value proposition which is execution in the last mile. So for example, it's not
vertical integration for the sake of integration and it's not – and it's variablizing everything that makes sense to
variablize in our business. So then therefore we're moving margins through better utilization and obviously pricing.
Velocity as we come out of this will be more important than ever and we continue to do things to drive that velocity in
all parts of our business. And we clearly believe this is how we drive leading industry returns.
<Q - Judson E. Bailey>: Okay. Thank you for that. And I guess my follow up is, the guidance for North America in
the fourth quarter was I think pretty straightforward. I was wondering what kind of visibility you may have in terms of
calendar for the first quarter early 2017. Obviously it will be dependent on where oil prices shake out and what OPEC
ultimately does. But it sounds like you've got some customers who are starting to line up work for 2017 at this point
and I was wondering if you could perhaps give any color to that effect.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Well, we see the – as we talked about Q4, at this point the board is full. But we're not clear
whether that's customer optionality or not. History would say we slowdown in the holidays. That would push more
work into the first part of next year. But, again, that part of the market is not as clear at this point in time. So we are
going to manage our cost and manage our businesses, we look at that to keep the structural costs and savings in place
and be absolutely positioned for when the recovery happens. Or when that happens.
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: This is Mark. I think our general view is that Q1 is going better, right? Customers are
engaging. But the amount – how much better it's going to be is still going be highly dependent on what the commodity
price is going into the first part of next year. But we think we're clearly on a path for recovery.
<Q - Judson E. Bailey>: Okay. Great. I appreciate it. And congrats again on a good quarter.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Scott Gruber with Citigroup you may begin.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: Good morning.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Good morning.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Hi, Scott.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: So I was down in the Permian about a month ago, met with a collection of operators and
everyone just was discussing more sand per well and longer laterals, two trends that everyone's been discussing for a
while. The trend that stuck out to me, which appears less well-appreciated, is the trend towards more frac stages per
well. A couple of operators were discussing shifting towards 40 stage wells, 50 stage wells and, one was actually
discussing pushing towards 90 stage wells. Are you seeing this trend in the Permian? And if so, can you discuss the
impact on the requisite pump time to complete these wells?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Yeah, thanks, Scott. Look, we are seeing a move towards shorter spacing on the stages
which ultimately drives more stages. And this will drive more service intensity for us. More stages means more plugs,
means more perfs, means more sand. So you get the point. But let's don't forget that the most important thing is making
a better well, ultimately which involves stimulating more rock. And so I would say that the precise placement of the
sand is probably the most important thing and that's where we spend our time is optimal frac design and placement.
And really further precisely why we focus so much around sub-surface insight and ultimately how to make a better
well.

<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: Got it. And just generally, are you seeing operators outside of the Permian squeeze the
spacing as well? Or is this just a Permian phenomenon?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Look, I'd say that what's right is what's right for the rock. And I think you're seeing that
move in the Permian Basin. Probably less so in other places, though, constantly trying new ways to again get more sand
in the right place as opposed to just more sand.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: Got it. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Angie Sedita with UBS. You may begin.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Thanks. Good morning, guys. I echo the congrats on an impressive quarter given market
conditions and also, Dave, your sense of realism on shorter cycles and range-bound oil prices is certainly appreciated.
On the question, I think the first question is for Mark is do you – we're talking about this asset light model. Do you still
see other structural costs that you can be pulling out of the system in North America and internationally into 2017?
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: I think that we're never finished in terms of reviewing our overall structural cost. Jeff
made the comment earlier about variablizing costs and I think that there are some things that we haven't necessarily
always thought of as structural. That they are – they would be variable in a definition of how we would typically look
at them.
But when we talk about variablizing those, we're talking about possibly looking at do we lease versus buy? Do we turn
a depreciation charge into a lease charge? Do we rent versus own? What can we do to continue to try to increasingly
create optionality in our business so that we can flux with the market overall but more importantly flux with our
customers to making sure as they continue to evaluate how they want to do their wells, or where they want to do their
wells that we can move with them and be as nimble as possible.
So I think that we're going to go into next year, Jeff alluded to this. Even though we believe the year will be better,
we're going to plan very aggressively flat in terms of our structural cost. And even planning flat requires the
organization to continue to really focus in on what can we do from a continuous improvement standpoint to continue to
drive out cost. Well, I believe you're never done and we're going to continue to go for it.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Great. That's very, very helpful, Mark. So going back to North America, pressure pumping,
you've made comments in the past on what you thought the margin outlook would be if you have your fully deployed
fleets at full utilization. Can you give us your updated thoughts there?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: The...
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: The currently deployed fleet at full utilization?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Yeah, well, what I would do is let's go back to kind of a margin progression for the
business. And in my view it's a path back rather than a dramatic jump. And so, as we've said, certain things have to
happen around equipment tightening and attrition. And it starts with making positive operating income then returning
the cost of capital and then pushing for industry-leading returns. Clearly, we're starting from a lower base, but the
formula is very much the same and it's a formula that we know.
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: That's right. We're definitely going to need some price right to get back toward the historic
margins that we've had in the past and historic returns. But the first order of business is get capacity tightened up in the
market. We believe the activity levels in the Permian and others are all are serving to work the equipment harder. It's
going to tighten up equipment faster and we're starting to see pricing at the edges, and we'll continue to drive that
forward as we hold the line on cost and we're going to get there. The model is the same. We've just got to execute.

<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: And so is it fair to assume that that pricing outlook, that improvement is back-half 2017 based
on what you know today?
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: I think we'll start seeing pricing earlier than that. But we're working on it every day with
every customer and the fringes. It will be probably a slow march forward initially until things tighten up and then begin
to accelerate. And, hopefully, we're going to be pushing as hard as we can to get back to 20% as quick as we can.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Herbert with Simmons. You may begin.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Thank you. Good morning. So, Mark, a quick question with regard to the guidance for the
fourth quarter. Sensibly you seem to be waxing a little bit conservative about North American top-line and sort of in
line with the rig count or at least the expectation. But you've got a loaded frac calendar according to Jeff's commentary,
Dave's commentary, completions lagged activity in the third quarter and now starting to pull through in the fourth
quarter. Why wouldn't completions be – why wouldn't completions and frac activity and Halliburton's North American
top-line outpace the rig count in Q4?
<A - David J. Lesar>: Yeah, hey Bill, this is Dave. Let me take that one. I think, as Jeff said, the frac calendar is full,
but my 20 years of being – 20 years or so of being in charge of this thing shows me that customers like to grab
optionality in the fourth quarter by filling the frac calendar. And it doesn't always come true that we utilize that work
and that calendar can get dumped pretty aggressively toward the end of the year, toward the end of the fourth quarter.
So we're just cautioning people that we don't know yet. It's really up to our customers as to whether they're going to go
forward and turn the optionality into real work.
And my experience has been some years it happens but most years they start to pull things off the calendar as the
holidays get there. And you've got the added I think dimension this year of where the commodity price is, what they
can buy. Are they going to spend their money buying strips for next year? Are they going to basically want to continue
to use these high-spec rigs in a sporadic way or just wait till next year where they can run them out on a pad and run
them for 60 days, 80 days, 90 days, 100 days and get the efficiencies from them? So we're just trying to draw a little bit
of caution out there that there is probably more variables in this Q4 than typically there might be because we're
bouncing off the bottom at this point in time.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Okay. And in line with...
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: Bill, I was going to say as a follow on you also recognize...
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Yeah.
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: ...you saw it a little bit in Q3 that, as we try to improve our margins and returns on this, we
are in some cases letting some bad contracts go, things that don't work for us, making money in order to improve the
utilization and profitability on others. And so it may not necessarily follow directly with the rig count until we get [ph]
out of the cycle (36:49).
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Okay. All right. That is helpful. Thank you. And then, Dave, in line with your pretty stark,
but realistic commentary about deepwater, I'm just curious as to how you're thinking about your global deepwater
footprint right now and whether that represents another significant round of, call it, rightsizing for Halliburton in terms
of cost-cutting reductions?
<A - David J. Lesar>: Yeah, Bill, let me let Jeff handle that one because he is dealing with it every day.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Yeah, no, Bill, we like our footprint around the world and I think deepwater certainly has
an important role to play. It's clearly the most stressed today and that's partly just because as we collaborate and look at

ways to lower the cost per BOE that they just don't get as many [ph] at bat (37:42). Clearly, it's structurally
disadvantaged because of duration which gets to not only the time value of money but also the speed with which those
barrels meet demand requirements.
All of that said, still believe it has an important role and we know how to flex the cost around those facilities. But I will
tell you keeping that footprint in place is something we will do. Again, I've described our value proposition around last
mile execution. That means you have to be present to win. And we plan to be present.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from David Anderson with Barclays. You may begin.
<Q - David Anderson>: Thank you. I think, Mark, you just kind of touched on what I was going to ask you there. I
was just wondering if you could expand a bit on the increased utilization in North America. Is that just continuing to
squeeze out the whitespace? Is it dropping certain customers who aren't as active? It doesn't sound like you're
reactivating equipment. And I'm just trying to understand how I should think about utilization going forward
considering you're saying margins are now taking a priority over market share.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Look, we're in a unique point in the market right now where we are setting up with –
we've got choice because we have market share. And so as we go through that, it's not one way or the other necessarily.
It's all about where we see the path to profitability. Those clients that utilize what we do best in the best way so that it's
mutually beneficial for both of us. So it's not as clear as one or the other by any means, particularly as we work through
this part of the market. What I really like is where we're positioned and as I've said, we're not going to add equipment
until we see clearly better returns. And I think that's going be prohibitive to others to add equipment until the price
moves to where it needs to be.
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: But clearly our utilization has gone up quite dramatically as a part of this process. And
that was a large part of what helped with the margins this quarter. We're going to continue to work that formula here for
the next quarter or so.
<Q - David Anderson>: Okay. And just a follow-up question. One of the other things we're hearing from E&Ps now
has been a talk about moving more to slick water fracs. Just wondering how that could potentially change kind of the
revenue and margin potential on your pressure pumping business as you move ahead into next year?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Yeah, I mean, slick water is clearly harder on equipment and it's something we ought to
get paid for. Fortunately, the Q10s were designed to operate more effectively at the higher rates that are demanded by
slick water so we're preferentially positioned around that. And I would also go further to say that today's market is a
mixed bag of frac designs. So we still see quite a bit of gel, some hybrid, and yes certainly slick water. But when I think
about the longer-term future of where does it go, the key point is controlling the frac, in our view. And that's why we
study chemistry. And we think that it's not one size fits all. It's actually what is the right size for that rock? And that's
why we are dead focused on making better wells.
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: It's always important to remember that Halliburton operates in every basin across the
whole of North America, and so what's happening just in the Midland or Delaware, in the Permian at large isn't – every
basin, every rock is different. And so we go to market the way the customer need to get the best well in those markets.
And so it will be – we're uniquely positioned to really – to get the best out of our equipment and out of our projects.
<Q - David Anderson>: Okay. Great. Thank you.

<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Yes. Hey. Good morning.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Good morning.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Dave, a question for you. You mentioned the shift in the strategy to go asset light. By definition
frac is very asset-intensive. So I was hoping you'd give a little bit more color around the context of asset light.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Yeah, I think, as we've said, it's not a shift in strategy. It's a continuation of a strategy or more a
continuation of a philosophy is that we are returns-driven first. And to the extent we can get by with less assets, we can
variablize our asset base, then we are going to continue to do that. And that's really all it means. So I don't want
anybody to read too much into this. It's just a prioritization of returns. And when you are prioritizing returns first, the
fewer assets you can do the same amount of work with, the better your returns are going to be, the better your margins
are going to be. And that's really where we are.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Got it. And then your follow up on the comment about potentially being willing to give some
share for margins, was that U.S. market specific?
<A - David J. Lesar>: No. I mean, we take a look at every basin, every customer, every geography, every day and
make those decisions on a real-time basis. It's the benefit of having the market share we have having the great customer
base we have, having a great footprint that we have and allows us the optionality of making those decisions each and
every day.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: All right. Great. Thanks, Dave.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Jim Wicklund with Credit Suisse. You may begin.
<Q - James Wicklund>: Good morning, guys.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Hi, Jim.
<Q - James Wicklund>: There has been a lot made about the rigs that have gone to work so far, have been low calorie
rigs, private companies by private equity sponsors drilling wells primarily in the Permian and trying to drill as cheap as
they can. It would seem that in your market share progression that you've gone after bigger companies, that work 24/7
that drill complex wells. Has the move so far off the bottom been a rig count that is not purely beneficial to you guys
and is that one of the issues that will be solved as we get into 2017, and the more established companies pickup
drilling?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Well, Jim, the rigs that we're seeing as you described them, are probably less service
intensive. And they've also tended to be less about big new capital programs and more around – what we've seen has
been more around repairing or trying to sustain a bit of production which looks and feels quite a bit different. I fully
believe though that this comes right over the next period of time because again, where we tend to engage is when they
start to make the bigger decisions around how to design fracs, where are we going be positioned? And getting up to sort
of full speed and full velocity that's when our assets work the hardest and that's where we're the most efficient. And
again, part of being, as Dave said, around asset light is not – is velocity as much as it is anything else. And so we're
drilling long horizontals and we are full on. That's where we're absolutely at our best.
<Q - James Wicklund>: Yeah, and I have no doubt about that. I just didn't – we hadn't seen a lot of the drilling that's
taken place here in the last six months be those kind of programs and those kinds of wells but I'm sure that'll turn. My
follow-up if I could, sand. If I just do back of the envelope stuff, you guys buy and supply to your customers a great
deal of sand, I'm coming up with at least $1.5 billion a year that comes through. Does that all come through your
income statement, Mark? And is there a margin to that? Or if I were to take the sand pass-through revenues off your
income statement, would that have the appreciable benefit to margins? Am I looking at this right?

<A - Mark A. McCollum>: So, yes, we do buy sand for our customers' account and that's on the ticket. We bill, in a
typical market, we would bill that sand with a margin that's designed to recover the cost of the delivery, right? We do
the delivery. We take it to mine. We move it by rail through trans-loading and essentially then arrange logistics to move
the last mile to the well site. We don't articulate all that cost out but the margin is designed to recover that cost and put
it in line with the other margins that we have across the pumping and other service side of our business. Obviously
what's happening right now is we're not earning a margin on a lot of that business.
In some cases, we may, but the practical reality when you're negative in North America, particularly on the pressure
pumping side you're not making money on the sand. I mean, you can look at it as if right now we're buying sand for our
customers' accounts. And that's not a sustainable practice. So that's a large part of what we're trying to repair. But we do
believe that our ability – the scale of the operation that we have, the amount of sand that we move, the quality and the
efficiency of the trans-loading operation that we provide is a significant value add to our customers.
We can make sure that arrives on time and in quantity when the supplies get tight, or logistics get complex, they don't
have to worry about working with Halliburton to get it there. And we're never waiting on sand.
<Q - James Wicklund>: I figure if the MLP valuations ever come back you're going to get a great deal of pressure to
spin that off. That's how good you are. Okay, Mark. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Sean Meakim with JPMorgan. You may begin.
<Q - Sean C. Meakim>: Hey. Good morning.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Good morning.
<Q - Sean C. Meakim>: I think you guided to flattish margins next quarter for international, given the minimal
seasonal benefit. Thinking about the first half of 2017, how much of that bottoming comes from the seasonal drop-off
in the first quarter versus ongoing bucket challenges in some markets like Latin America. Just trying to think about,
does that guidance imply 2017 budget's likely flatter versus say flat to lower year-over-year? But with that sequential
improvement in the back half?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: This is Jeff. The international business traditionally lags North America by six to nine
months. So that's just sort of broadly across all of the markets in terms of activity. And we're continuing to see, and if
you look at sort of geographically outside of the resilience in the Middle East, there has been a substantial decline in
activity commensurate with the commodities, and those certainly Latin America is at a historical low. Asia-Pacific is
down in some ways as much as 50% in terms of rig count that we see in the marketplace.
And so I think that that continues into kind of the first part of next year. And there is obviously the resetting budgets
with national oil companies and a lot of things that conspire to slow that down. So certainly not clear, but expect
consistent with sort of our outlook that middle of next year is where we start to see that repairing.
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: I think that we don't really have a lot of visibility from customers yet. The first quarter
will be down seasonally, it's usually in North Sea and Russia that has the largest impacts, and then to lesser extent in
Latin America, you'll have some delays as NOCs reset their budgets and then begin to let work. But I think that the
veracity of the – once we hit the bottom in international the early part of next year, the veracity of any recovery is going
to be based on what the commodity price outlook is at that point in time.
<Q - Sean C. Meakim>: Got it. Understood. It's certainly still early. And then just, one more question on the Permian,
if I could. The Permian is very much the focus among the E&Ps today, particularly the Delaware and the Midland. Just
curious, if the recovery in activity is less broad-based than last cycle and more limited to the Permian. Just how do we
think about competition in that market? Mix of wells and customers? How some of that can have an impact on margins

and pricing in that basin?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Well, Permian Basin is the most competitive basin in North America today. The majority
of the rig adds were in the Permian Basin. Quite a mix of customers that added rigs doing a variety of things. As we've
already talked about some vertical wells, some proving up acreage, just a range of activity. Starting from a smaller base
in other parts of the country. Are we seeing some pickup? Yes, in the rig count. And that's part of the reason we stay
engaged in all parts of the market. So I think that Permian, from an activity standpoint, will be busy. But again, it's a
highly supplied marketplace as well.
<Q - Sean C. Meakim>: So maybe some of those other areas could provide opportunities for you all given how much
competition is likely left as lower activity basins?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Yeah, I mean our strategy is clear that we want to be in the business and we want to be in
the business in a full service way in all of the markets.
<Q - Sean C. Meakim>: Great. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Dan Boyd with BMO Capital Markets. You may begin.
<Q - Daniel J. Boyd>: All right. Thanks. I'd like to follow up on one of the questions earlier from Jim. And as you
think about your logistical network in the infrastructure, I think that's something we all view as one of the key
competitive advantages of Halliburton. Can you maybe give us an update on where your infrastructure currently
stands? Maybe how much capital was invested in that business? And would you consider different structures to get that
off your books in the future?
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: So we're not going to give specifics on the total capital invested or anything like that. But
I would tell you that we've got trans-loading capabilities in all of the major basins. We feel like that we've got sufficient
capital and resources to make sure that we can service our own business. It was purposefully designed in a way that
doesn't meet 100% of our needs. And talking about how you variablized your business, one of those things has been
that we have tried to construct that in a manner that meets a significant portion of our trans-loading needs but allows us
to also to be able to flex with the market should the need arise.
And so we believe right now that it's an important strategic asset. We're going to continue to hold that, but I can't tell
you where, or if. It's just one of those things that, like any other portion of our business, we'll continually look at that,
look at the returns that we earn off of that business that's relative importance to customers in the market and make
evaluations as we get there.
<Q - Daniel J. Boyd>: Okay. Thanks. And a follow up is, just looking at the Permian and the trans-loading facilities
and basically the sand deliverability infrastructure there, how well utilized is that network? And could that be a limit to
activity in the Permian at some point?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Look, I don't see any limitations currently. There are always parts of that chain that we're
working on how to improve, how to make better, but ultimately we're able to overcome those sorts of things pretty
consistently. As we've demonstrated in the past, we've led and how we've resolved those types of opportunities in
markets. And I think to the extent the Permian continues to strengthen, those investments will be made where required.
<Q - Daniel J. Boyd>: Okay. Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question is from Rob MacKenzie with IBERIA Capital. You may begin.
<Q - Rob J. MacKenzie>: Thank you, guys. I had a follow-up question on the margins front from earlier. I guess my
question is, is with the lean cost structure you talked about, variablizing costs where you can, underutilized existing
asset base, why would incremental margins only be in the 35% to 40% range? Why shouldn't we be able to expect to
see something higher than that?
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: At some point they will go higher, and it's usually a progression. Right now coming off
the bottom, we're fighting every day for some level of pricing and trying to get crews above water. When you have
crews below water, it creates some level of stress on your incrementals, and it's not consistent. A crew one month could
be doing fine. The next month based on customer choices about working or downtime, maintenance, whatever else,
could go under water.
So until you get everybody consistently above water, the incrementals stay a little bit choppy. But they've moved up
from what we were expecting, and as a result of the utilization that we're getting, we're now sort of seeing in that 35%,
40%, and they can go higher from there.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Historically, we would see a trough following – the trough in rigs was followed by a
trough in margins, and so in my view we've actually accelerated that, and a lot of that on the back of the cost reductions
and the structural cost moves that we've made which we've always said we wouldn't see the real benefit of those until
we saw some sort of bottoming. And so we've seen that. And so in some ways we're moving more quickly than we'd
expected.
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: Yeah.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Yeah, and I would just add one more thing and it continues to be – the comment was on
incremental margins for the fourth quarter, for North America, and as we said earlier, we're continuing to factor in
some downtime over the holidays, which means your revenues go away but your costs don't. And that clearly has an
impact on your incremental margins at that point in time.
But all of that being said, and as we said in the call, we said in the release, things are getting better in North America.
And I think if you take something away from this call, it's that thought. Not the sort of tactical things we have to do
day-to-day to work our way through the quarter.
<Q - Rob J. MacKenzie>: Great. Thanks. That's a good answer, guys. And my follow-up question comes back to the, I
guess, the frac calendar, if you will. What are you seeing if anything in terms of a larger job requests from your clients?
Either term work, multi-well pads versus kind of the real very structured spot work we've seen? Where does that stand
in terms of the evolution of backlog for you guys?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Yeah, we're obviously seeing some increase in that in terms of both terms and size.
Obviously, we're not going to comment on strategy at this point in time. But we manage through kind of the optionality
and manage an entire portfolio.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Yeah, I would just say listen, our customers are smart. They see 2017 shaping up to be better.
And they're going to try to lock in as much time and price as they can at this point in time. And it's up to us to navigate
our way through those requests and make sure that we are not only there to service them with the equipment they need,
but we are there with a price that gives us the kind of returns we need to satisfy our own shareholders. So it's going be a
give and take but there's certainly some of that going on right now.
<Q - Rob J. MacKenzie>: Great. Thank you, guys.

Thank you, Shannen. And I'd like to wrap up the call with just a couple of key points. First, North America
unconventional market has, as predicted recovered first and should continue to strengthen in a plus $50 oil price
environment.
Secondly, Halliburton's strategy is directly pointed at the most important part of the market. And collaborating and
engineering solutions to maximize asset value for our customers. This, along with our customer relationships,
geographic footprint, and service quality, positions Halliburton to outperform in the recovery.
Thank you, and I look forward to speaking with you next quarter.
