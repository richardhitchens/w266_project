MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Greetings, and welcome to Monsanto's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2015 Earnings Call. At this time all participants are
in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]
As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Laura Meyer, Investor Relations Lead for Monsanto. Thank
you. Ms. Meyer, you may begin.
Laura J. Meyer
Thank you, Rob, and good morning to everyone. I'm joined this morning by Hugh Grant, our Chairman and CEO;
Brent Begemann, our Chairman and Chief Operating Officer; and by Pierre Courduroux, our CFO. Also joining me
from the IR team are Tim Boeker and Priyal Patel.
Our second quarter call provides our first view into how the Northern Hemisphere season is shaping up, and today we
will be sharing a business and strategic overview as well as a summary of our second quarter results and a full-year
outlook. This call is being webcast and you can access the webcast, supporting slides and the replay at monsanto.com.
We've provided you today with EPS measures on both the GAAP and ongoing business basis. Where we refer to
non-GAAP financial measures, we reconcile to GAAP in the slides and in the press release, both of which are on the
website.

This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on
assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may vary in a
material way from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statement. A description of the factors that may
cause such a variance is included in the Safe Harbor language, in our most recent 10-K and in today's press release.
First and foremost, let me review our second quarter results as shown on slide four. Our second quarter ongoing
earnings per share is $2.90, which is within the range we outlined at our first quarter call. Our free cash flow
year-to-date is $986 million as compared to $290 million year-to-date in the prior-year, reflecting the absence of The
Climate acquisitions and the Novozymes transaction in the current fiscal year. These results, combined with our revised
outlook for the year, still give us confidence that we are within the guidance ranges outlined at the beginning of the
fiscal year, namely $5.75 to $6 of ongoing earnings per share and $2 billion to $2.2 billion of free cash flow, although
now trending to the low end of each of the respective ranges as shown on slide five.
With that brief summary, let me hand it to Hugh to add context with the strategic outlook.
Hugh M. Grant
Thank you, Laura, and good morning to everybody on the line. As we look across the current landscape, we clearly
acknowledge the reality facing the global players in the ag industry, namely declining corn acres and rapidly weakening
foreign currencies. These industry-wide economic challenges have led us to point to the lower end of our earnings per
share and cash flow guidance. And yet even at the low end of our original guidance range, we still expect double-digit
ongoing earnings per share growth, reaching a new record level for annual earnings per share for our business.
Two years of spectacular growing conditions have translated into the current oversupply situation for corn, and in
response acres continue to decline while demand from feed accelerates to rebalance supply. In tandem, farmers have
sharpened their pencils across their input costs as they in turn balance risk with returns. Even so our grower customers
continue to ask us to innovate in agriculture. They're seeking yield and productivity tools like newer hybrids,
technology traits and digital agriculture tools, clearly reflecting that yield and productivity will differentiate them in
times of compressed margins.
Further, while we continue to monitor these headwinds and mitigate where feasible through the management of our
expansive and a balanced product portfolio, we won't let this distract us from the business execution that's critical to
our longer-term growth. And it's that execution, combined with our innovation, which truly differentiate us. The
accomplishments in the first half of the year are a testament to that commitment to seamless execution on the variables
that we control, as seen in slide five. Intacta acreage now stands at 15 million acres for fiscal year 2015 and with seed
production in place for targeted penetration of 30 million acres for fiscal year 2016, we're well down the path of this
100-million-acre opportunity.
The excitement for the Xtend platform is building, both with growers and internally as we continue to make strong
progress. Bollgard II XtendFlex cotton has now sold out for our limited commercial introduction and plans for more
than a 3 million acre launch and Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans in 2016 are on pace for this nearly 200-million-acre
opportunity. Our footprint continues to expand in corn, even with a smaller acreage base, and growers continue to
embrace the latest technologies and hybrids. Our investment in Climate and biologicals has ramped and with the focus
on penetration and engagement, the next generation of Climate PRO is now reaching the hands of growers as we speak.
Our organization has managed spend to allow for accelerated funding of these new platforms like Climate, and we now
expect full year operating expenses to be down slightly. And finally, we continue to deploy our capital effectively and
return value to our shareowners with a $6 billion accelerated share repurchase that we expect to fully close in April, a
significant step in our commitment towards a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.5.
So the fundamentals of our business are unchanged, and these accomplishments are the cornerstones for our long term
growth drivers. The annual dynamics of agriculture may cause our rate of gain to be uneven at times, but it doesn't
change the trajectory for growth, particularly given the backdrop of long-term demand for both corn and soybeans.

As shown on slide six, we continue to see annual demand for corn increasing by more than 500 million bushels per year
while soybean demand grows by more than 200 million bushels per year. Recent WASDE estimates now indicate that
the global demand requirements for corn have grown by nearly 900 million bushels as compared to the prior season.
And on the supply side, we now estimate that at least 11 million to 12 million acres of corn will have come out of
production in the primary markets since 2013. The efficiency of the global corn market's undisputed, as is a growing
population's demand for more protein and more grain.
As always, we develop much more than the usual annual ebbs and flows of agriculture. Our focus is on the innovation
that improves and protects the yield for the grower through a multitude of conditions and in an increasingly balanced
portfolio. This foresight in the development and investment in soybeans has paid off, and we expect it will continue as
the decade of the soybean marches forward.
Roundup Ready 2 Yield, Intacta and Xtend remain very much on track for their expected long-term growth trends.
While the former two products provide current year earnings growth as acres rotate from corn to soybeans, and beyond
the fast-growing soybean growth drivers, we're anticipating the next generation of solutions across six broad
technology platforms, expanding from the core seed and traits platform, as shown on slide seven. Today we're adding
to that foundation with complementary chemistries and seed treatments, biological solutions, and finally, digital
agriculture for the application of data science through our Climate offerings can enhance each and every decision in a
grower's operation.
As we look across this pipeline of new products as well as our existing portfolio and brand [ph] franchisees (9:03), we
continue to attract and pursue significant licensing opportunities, and some of that could come as soon as this year. We
remain strategically aligned to the long-term horizon, as demonstrated by our disciplined near-term execution.
Agriculture remains an excellent space for investment given the continuing long-term demand projections and our
consistent delivery of innovation that so effectively aligns to those trends. Near-term conditions require measured
adjustments to spending and risk management. As shown on slide eight, we're continuing the investments in the
platforms required to deliver our long-term commitment to more than double our ongoing earnings per share by 2019.
So with that, let me hand over to Brett for the operational update that underpins these first half accomplishments and
our long-term strategic outlook.
Brett D. Begemann
Thanks, Hugh, and good morning to everyone on the line. Despite the industry cross current of lower global corn acres,
I remain extremely confident in the foundation of our global corn business and the long-term mechanisms for growth.
As I said before, our corn yield performance has never been better, our multi-pronged go-to-market strategy continues
to serve us and our customers well and the proof points are in the results we see in this quarter and in the outlook for
the rest of the year. Let's take a look at the specifics, as shown on slide nine.
At the halfway point in our fiscal year, we have now wrapped up our first season in Brazil and capped it with more than
two share points of growth in our branded market share in the summer season that we now believe contracted closer to
13%. We also had a small but meaningful launch of our first triple stack product in corn, continued upgrades to our
second and third generation traits and nice price/mix lift in our germplasm excluding currency effects. Looking
forward, the Brazil safrinha season is underway and we expect flat corn acres and similar trends in our performance
from the first season in Brazil. And in Argentina, triples continued to be the product of choice and we held our strong
share position on an acreage base that was 16% smaller than last year.
Within the U.S. corn seed business, as we've been indicating, our results year-to-date reflect the timing shift of our
Channel brand businesses from second quarter to third quarter. We are encouraged by the changes we've made in this
business and we still expect roughly $275 million of gross profit, mostly in corn, to move between quarters based on
our view into our order books. Beyond this timing shift, the reduced refuge family of products is maintaining its
percentage of the portfolio from the prior year. We continue to see conversion to our dual mode of action products, like
SmartStax and Double PRO, as well as improved uptake of our DroughtGard hybrids. Although, on a corn acreage

base, we now see trending closer to 87 million to 88 million acres.
Demand for the combination of one-year and year two DEKALB hybrids is expected to be approximately 40% of the
total portfolio with particularly strong interest in the more familiar high-performing year two products. In the spirit of
dollar cost averaging and due to the consistent exceptional performance in some of our proven hybrids as depicted on
slide 10, we did see some higher-than-normal demand for this generation at the expense of the midpoint of the
portfolio. While this is expected to migrate the germplasm price/mix lift to the low single digits this year, the general
portfolio mix curve is intact and demonstrates that even in this environment growers are demanding the newest hybrids,
giving us confidence in the long term outlook for this business.
Across Europe and South Africa we expect to hold or grow share in a region of declining corn acres, and when setting
aside the punishing currency effects and despite the challenging competitive dynamics, it appears that our germplasm
price/mix lift will be positive across the region for the year. In Asia, we continue to see adoption of traits in the
Philippines and we recently received approvals for our first biotech traits in corn in Vietnam, allowing us to move
forward with pre-commercial trials.
Like much of the rest of the world, we expect to grow share and have positive lift in our germplasm price/mix,
exclusive of parity, as we look across all of Asia. Overall, we remain on track to hold or grow our branded share
footprint in every major market in the face of declining corn acres and exclusive of currency headwinds, we expect to
deliver positive germplasm price/mix lift for the full year. This is an outstanding achievement in the time of
compressed margins for our grower customers, reflecting their continued demand for high performing seed technology.
Even more compelling is the outstanding performance we continue to see in our soybean business, which is proving
critical in this challenging environment. The power of a balanced portfolio is evident as our soybean business continues
the momentum that has carried from a record fiscal year 2014 and an excellent first quarter. Across South America, as
seen on slide 11, our value proposition for Intacta delivered and we reached a record 15 million acres in our second
year of launch, a five-fold increase over the first year. As we review the seed production plans across the multipliers
and the licensees for the next season, we now believe we will have Intacta available in 150 varieties for Brazil alone.
This edition of 50 new varieties in Brazil will be enough to fully serve all maturity zones for the third year of
commercialization. Overall, we now expect to penetrate an estimated 30 million acres with Intacta in South America in
fiscal year 2016, a meaningful tipping point in the 100-million-acre opportunity for Intacta.
Backing up these plans is yet another year of strong product performance. As shown on slide 12, our early yield results
reveal that we once again delivered more than a four-bushel average yield advantage with Intacta soybeans over
comparisons of Roundup Ready soybeans managed by insecticides. In addition, we continued to see a reduction in
insecticide sprays and insect damage with the use of Intacta soybeans, clearly visible in the photo from this year's
production. As we continue to plan for the expansion of our Intacta business in South America, we've also advanced
our negotiations with the grain traders and elevators and have now secured more than 90% of the origination points
across Brazil to allow for a very robust point of delivery payment system.
Approximately 95% of the Intacta soybeans planted were paid for upfront this season in Brazil, and we expect a similar
pattern of certified seed sales for next year. Nonetheless, securing options to pay at the end of the season with the
delivery at the elevator provides our growers with the choices they value. And in Argentina, not only are we seeing
Intacta penetration for the first time, but the point of delivery system implementation is off to a good start in its
inaugural season. We have now secured agreements with more than 95% of the origination points in the North and
more than 70% of the growers pay for their seed purchases in advance, again providing growers with choice in how
they secure this game-changing technology.
In the U.S., the combination of shipments and our order book leads us to conclude that soybean acres and our share are
both growing, with farmers continuing to choose Roundup Ready 2 Yield as the product of choice across both our
branded and our licensed footprint. Preparations for a record trait launch of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans continue
as we await final regulatory approvals and secure seed production acres for what we expect to be a greater than
3-million-acre launch in 2016 and available in more than 60 varieties, as shown on slide 13.

We see strong alignment from our licensees in the plans for launch and our remaining regulatory approvals are
proceeding. We have submitted all the required data to the China Ministry of Ag and they have all necessary
information required to grant an approval. Again, we are maintaining our focus on execution for this next wave of
growth in our soybean business, one whose acre opportunity is almost double that of Intacta, as the need for flexible,
exceptional weed control reaches across the Americas.
Cotton is also notable this quarter because we are sold out for the limited commercial introduction of Bollgard II
XtendFlex on more than 500,000 acres as shown on slide 14. We announced our pricing of $6 an acre for the added
value from flexible improved weed control along with a full XtendFlex chemistry rebate to reflect that growers are
unable to use dicamba over-the-top as we await final regulatory approvals. Interest in the technology has been
tremendous, as demonstrated by the sold-out position. Altogether, more than 1,600 growers and stakeholders have
attended grower education sessions across the South since the 1st of January. This limited introduction is allowing our
grower customers to experience the improved performance of new Bollgard II XtendFlex cotton varieties as well as the
benefits of two of the three herbicide tolerances that are currently available for use with this product, namely
glyphosate and glufosinate tolerance. And based on the look into our order books, we expect these new varieties to
drive back-to-back share growth in the Deltapine brand in the U.S.
We have also rolled out our Climate PRO offering for the season, featuring the newly-improved nitrogen and field
health advisors, and we recently enhanced our introductory pricing of $3 per acre through marketing programs that are
driving penetration and engagement with the technology. At a time when a grower's attention to every line of their P&L
is heightened, the meter-by-meter optimization our precision tools have to offer becomes even more beneficial. The
application of data science to our extensive field trial and genetics data through the development and application of
software has the potential to create unprecedented value for growers.
To facilitate this rollout, we have already trained more than 1,000 selling agents across our broad retail partnership,
touching virtually every corn and soybean acre in the U.S. And while it is too early to estimate the acres for Climate
Basic or Climate PRO for this season, we remain committed to our targets to increase our active Basic users by 50%
from our fiscal year 2014 base of 30 million acres and to more than double our 1 million premium acres from fiscal
year 2014 as shown on slide 15.
In our Ag Productivity business, we are in the midst of the largest quarter of the year in the Northern Hemisphere as we
provide customers with our branded products for their critical over-the-top sprays and their Roundup Ready crops. As
we guided, our volumes continue to shift to the second half of the year, closer to these key application windows, as a
greater portion of our business is sold as branded volume this year. This shift in volumes to the latter half of the year
also explains the majority of the decline in the business year-to-date. In addition, we're seeing some of the anticipated
softening in price at the retail level and have followed suit with low to mid-single digit price adjustments to maintain a
small premium over the generics, consistent with our strategy.
I remain very optimistic about the business and our outlook. Our accomplishments year-to-date are impressive with 15
million acres of Intacta penetration, Climate product introductions, Xtend launch plans and early share growth and
price/mix lift in corn, despite substantial currency and corn acreage headwinds. Further, we will continue to leverage
the benefits of a balanced portfolio as the Decade of the Soybean continues with expected Roundup Ready 2 Yield
acreage expansion, expected branded seed share growth and production plans to potentially supply 30 million acres of
Intacta in South America and a greater than 3-million-acre launch of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans in 2016.
With that, I'll pass it to Pierre for the financial update.
Pierre C. Courduroux
Thanks, Brett, and good morning to everyone. As we sit at the midpoint of our fiscal year, we can now reflect upon the
accomplishments of the first half while refining our strategy and outlook for the rest of the year. Intacta has been a
tremendous success in its second year of commercialization, our corn share footprint has grown in the Southern
Hemisphere this season, and Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans continues to meet the milestones necessary to propel it

forward to what is now expected to be a more than 3-million-acre launch in 2016.
We have responded to the weakening of foreign currencies and declining corn acres with reduced operating spend
while still spending on newest platforms, namely Climate and biologicals, at a pace far ahead of last year's. And finally
we remain committed to our capital allocation strategy with the expected full closure of our $6 billion accelerated share
repurchase in April. Altogether, we continue to deliver on the key drivers of our long term growth plans, remaining
acutely focused on the variables we control and true to our strategy of innovation through a balanced portfolio. There is
no doubt, however, that the further weakening of foreign currencies has led to what now appears to be a $0.35 to $0.40
headwind for this fiscal year, primarily concentrated in corn gross profit and to a lesser degree in Ag Productivity gross
profit, and driven by the deterioration of several key currencies versus the dollar very close to today's rate.
These currency headwinds, coupled with a more certain decline in corn acres and some moderation of corn germplasm
mix lift now means that we are trending to the low end of our original guidance range of $5.75 to $6 of [ph] ongoings
(24:30) per share, as well as to the lower end of our free cash flow guidance of $2 billion to $2.2 billion as shown on
slide 16 and slide 17. Within that guidance, we now expect that our Seeds and Genomics gross profit growth will
migrate to low to mid-single digit, with the expected growth in soybean gross profit more than offsetting the anticipated
slight decline in corn gross profit resulting from the currency and acreage headwinds.
Ag Productivity gross profit is expected to decline approximately 10% versus prior year due to anticipated generic
price softening and an incremental 2% to 3% due to deteriorating currencies. Total operating expenses, including the
new platforms, are now expected to be down in the rate of 3% to 5% versus the prior year as we further tighten our
spending in light of the current trends and as we benefit from the expected weaker foreign currencies in our operating
expenses. Interest expenses remain consistent with prior expectations, reflecting the additional debt and our progress
towards our stated goal of a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.5, and other expenses are expected to be roughly a third of
the prior year as we are anticipating less of a devaluation of the Argentine peso in fiscal 2015.
Meanwhile, the tax rate has migrated to the low end of our original guidance of 28% to 30% through continued
expected discrete tax benefits. When converting this full year guidance into a quarterly look, we expect around 80% to
85% of the remaining earnings per share to fall into the third quarter, with a residual in the fourth quarter. In Q3, we
expect [ph] the sheet (26:18) of roughly $275 million of gross profit in the Channel seed business to benefit our results,
and in the fourth quarter we expect a strong start to our South American business, more normalized corn returns in the
U.S., continued momentum in soybeans and a very disciplined management of our operating expenses to drive the
growth.
If we take a deeper dive into the margins and the outlook for the year, the success of our Intacta franchise and
continued demand for Roundup Ready 2 Yield is clearly reflected in the nearly four-point improvements in soybeans
margins year-to-date. And while we expect that to moderate some, we do expect positive marginal lift in soybeans for
the full year. For corn, the margins are down roughly 2 points year-to-date as a result of the shift in the higher margin
Channel business to Q3, the continued year-over-year decline in the trait pricing for Brazil and the
higher-than-expected cost of goods sold in South America. We continue to convert the Brazil corn seed business to
higher cost, single cross-trait hybrid, and while this has widened our performance advantage and enabled share growth,
it does increase our cost of goods. This, combined with the flooding in Argentina during last production season, has
elevated our cost in corn year-to-date.
By the end of the year, we do expect corn gross profit margins to be relatively flat with the prior year as South America
becomes a smaller component of the total mix of our corn business for the full year. Altogether, when looking at the
Seeds and Genomics segment as a whole, we expect roughly 1% margin improvement for the full year, reflecting the
benefit of the broadening soybean portfolio.
The last thing I would like to share with you today is our outlook on free cash flow. We are now tracking to the lower
end of our original free cash guidance of $2 billion to $2.2 billion, as we now estimate that cash flows from operations
will be $3 billion to $3.3 billion, with cash flows from investing activities expected to be a use of cash of $1 billion to
$1.1 billion. The decline in our operating cash flow projections is twofold. Our projected net income is tracking lower
for the reasons we mentioned earlier, primarily currency and acreage related, and our inventories have increased as

corn acres have retreated more than we originally planned and corn seed production yields were higher than expected.
Looking ahead to fiscal year 2016, this continued decline in corn acres and strong production yield from last season, as
seen across the industry, is translating to a reduced corn seed production plan which we are just finalizing for the
Northern Hemisphere. Our current inventories are in excellent conditions and will carry to the next season, topped off
by the smaller production plan from this summer. While this is the optimal choice from a cash and inventory
management perspective, this will result in higher cost of goods for fiscal year 2016, after which we expect to see some
normalization in the size of our production plan and the benefit of lower hedged commodity prices.
In response to this expected reduction in cash flows from operations we are being more diligent in the management of
our investing cash flows, allowing us to deliver an expected free cash flow of at least $2 billion. With this continued
excellent conversion of our earnings into cash, we remain committed to returning value to our owners through our
capital allocation strategy. I'm pleased to announce that half of our $6 billion accelerated share repurchase plan has
officially closed, resulting in the delivery of an additional 6.6 million shares. We expect the remaining $3 billion of the
ASR to close in April with similar results.
Following the close of our third quarter, we plan to evaluate our next steps in advancing to a net debt to EBITDA ratio
of 1.5 after the full closure of our $6 billion accelerated share repurchase and after we have a clear line of sight on our
short and midterm cash needs at the end of our two most significant quarters.
Similar to the industry, we are seeing significant currency and acreage headwinds in fiscal year 2015, but we also see
the confirmation of the long-term growth drivers that support our gross profit expansion through a global balanced
portfolio while still delivering on a new record for earnings per share this year. When combined with our disciplined
balanced approach to funding our growth platforms and our continued commitment to effective capital allocation, I am
confident we are on track in the first year of our five-year plan to more than double ongoing earnings per share.
Thanks, and I'll turn it back to Laura for the Q&A.
Laura J. Meyer
Thanks, Pierre. With that, we'd now like to open the call for questions. As we typically do, I'll ask that you please hold
your questions to one per person, so that we can take questions from as many people as possible. You're always
welcome to rejoin the queue for a follow-up.
Rob, I think we're ready to take questions from the line.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We'll now be conducting the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. First
question today is coming from the line of Don Carson, Susquehanna International. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Don D. Carson>: Yes. Thank you. Question, Pierre, on the foreign currency impact. Are you saying that without
the incremental $0.15, $0.20 of foreign currency pressure that basically your guidance would be unchanged? And then
a specific impact on corn: is the slight reduction in corn gross profit due primarily to foreign exchange, or what are the
other drivers in terms of price, volume and cost of goods sold?
<A - Pierre C. Courduroux>: So, Don, to your first question, I mean, the way you look at it is definitely a way to
think about it actually because we point now to the low end of our guidance, and I mean, the guidance range was about
$0.25. So, yeah, I would agree with you on this one.
Regarding the second question, regarding corn gross profit, so the way we think about it actually is when you look at
the first half, more than $200 million of the difference we see versus last year is related to the shift of our Channel

business from Q2 to Q3, and the rest of the difference is basically split two-thirds related to currency and acres
headwinds, so about two-thirds of the remaining difference, and one-third is related to the trait pricing and COGS we
referred – in South America that we referred to in the prepared remarks. Looking into the full year, we expect the
impact of acres and currency to be more than $300 million. This is how we think about it right now.
However, we expect also to see the combined benefits of germplasm price lift and the share gains we are anticipating
resulting in about more than $200 million of benefits. So that's the way we are thinking about the corn gross profit
going forward, and the difference we may see at the end of the day will be the balance in between the soybeans, which
today we anticipate to be more than offsetting this decline in corn, it's going to be the difference in between the
soybeans and the corn that's going to make the final number.

Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Vincent Stephen Andrews>: Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Question on – obviously Intacta's going to be
big in the fourth quarter, the Brazilian reals had a big move, and who knows whether it's done or not. But could you
talk a little bit about what your opportunity is to address the pricing of that product, both in the near, medium and long
term, as it relates to the real?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Yeah, Vincent. Thanks for your question. We're delighted with the performance and the ramp
and yield is now – I referenced this in the slide, yield is not coming in, the early read was 12%, 13% and the harvesters
were beating our four-bushel goal. So still rolling out price, Brett, but what was the early read on price?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yeah, good morning, Vincent. The way we're looking at it now is let's keep in mind that
strategically what our intent has been with Intacta from the get-go, and that's been to introduce it into the marketplace
in a very aggressive fashion, going from 15 million acres headed to 30 million acres for next year, which means that
we're expecting a very aggressive ramp-up. As we look at pricing, as Hugh mentioned, we've had another spectacular
performance year with Intacta. We're highly confident in the performance going forwards. And as we look to the future,
we will be taking that into consideration with pricing and I would say at this point in time we're leaning into looking
upwards on the price curve.
The thing that I would remind you is soybeans, we keep talking about the Decade of the Soybeans, and we've got an
incredible next generation Intacta already coming. So as we think about this over the longer term, Vincent, we're
thinking about moving Intacta very aggressively into the marketplace, building out that position. And as we bring up
the price on Intacta we'll be thinking about the next generation to move that market as well.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Vincent, I'd just add one thing. We see phenomenal growth opportunities. We're in the ground
floor of that growth. As we think about pricing that, I don't know if we'll fully offset the real devaluation, but we'll be
very, very careful not to stall the growth opportunity by reaching for that incremental real. This is much more about
philosophy and really growing that platform as fast as we possibly can.

<A - Pierre C. Courduroux>: So as I mentioned, and I was referring to the gross profit impact of the – in the first half
of the year, a big part of that is just the pure timing related to the move of our Channel business for $200 million of
gross profit. If you give and take a 60%-plus margin, you can get the impact on sales, and I don't have the number in
front of me. And the rest of the difference, similarly upgraded for the guidance – for the margin, two-thirds of the
difference related to currency and this one definitely hitting us pretty hard, and the acreage headwinds. So two-thirds of
the remaining difference, and the last third is the trait pricing, which definitely on the sales line also has an impact
when you look at Brazil, specifically. And this one, as you know, we talked about that during the first quarter, was
related to the price adjustment in the market related to some of our competitors' issues with resistance there in Brazil.

Our next question is from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Kevin W. McCarthy>: Yes. Good morning. A question related to U.S. corn seed. I think you had mentioned a
slight mix shift from year one to year two hybrids. I was wondering if you've observed that sort of a shift in years past
and throughout your experience and whether you could comment on what is driving it? In other words, it would seem
economically irrational if the yield is there and the value is being shared with the customer. Thanks.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Yeah, Kevin, I'll – it's we've probably seen more of it this year than we've seen in a long time
and I think it's a function of the euphemism of growers sharpening their pencil, number one, and number two, we had
some really great products in that category, and they had, growers had fantastic experience with them last year and
reached back for them. So it's the curse of having really great performing hybrids. I don't know if you'd add anything to
that, Brett?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: No, I think you covered it very well. I think, Kevin, if you look at our year one and year
two products we're at about 40%, and plus/minus that's a reasonable number to think of; essentially every year that's
been our experience is around that 40%. This year we got a little bit more of year two than we have in year one. Now
here's my takeaway from it is farmers are clearly voting for our newest hybrids, and that's why I'm so confident in the
strategy for pricing our germplasm is they're voting for the best. And what they're doing with their sharp pencil is
saying well, maybe two versus one, but they're not going backwards down the portfolio, and that's why the pricing
curve's still intact.
<Q - Kevin W. McCarthy>: Thank you very much.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: I think, just to add to Kevin's question, I think this year, if you can climb above the headwinds
and get above the noise and look at the business, I think this last question really illustrates that even in tough times we
see growers reaching for innovation and reaching for the really great performing hybrid. So in a tough ag environment,
we feel really good that the model is still alive and well and that growers are selecting the best possible hybrids out
there.

<Q - Robert Andrew Koort>: I was wondering if you could talk on Xtend a bit. I think maybe your competitor in that
arena suggested a retail price of $12 an acre. Is that sort of order of magnitude of what you think the retail capture
might be for Xtend? And do you have any regulatory hurdles to sell that product and get it qualified in South America?
I know you mentioned China in terms of approving it, but what about for use in South America?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Yeah, so, Bob, thanks for the questions. I'll let Brett say a few words. The competitive pricing
is news I haven't heard, but I mean, we're focused on our own franchise. Here's what I can tell you and we've
mentioned this in the prepared remarks. Tremendous interest and enormous amount of pent-up demand. I wish we had
it today, but tremendous grower interest, and I think we're going to be so much smarter with the, Brett said in excess of
0.5 million acres that are already committed. This thing sold out faster than a Rolling Stones comeback concert, so
we'll see this fly off the shelves. Brett, a word on just that regulatory timetable and maybe how Latin America looks?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yeah, thanks, Hugh. Good morning, Bob. I think the excitement around Xtend is as much
or more than I've seen around any biotech launch we've ever had, and I've been around for all of them. And it's really a
compelling vote of confidence by our growers and it also is the expression of a huge need. And that's demonstrated by
how quickly we sold out of the XtendFlex varieties that we have available for Deltapine this year in the South. On
Xtend soybeans, we're going to be ramping aggressively for an over 3-million-acre launch next year, which I'm highly
confident will be in high demand by customers. We'll take full advantage of this year to do testing again, to look at the
product and get farmer feedback as we've done with our new products before we get to final pricing.
I would point you to, we did price the XtendFlex cotton in the South at $6, but we also extended a rebate to farmers
because they won't have the opportunity to use dicamba this year, but they will get the opportunity to use two herbicide
modes of action with glufosinate. In South America, let me split South America into Argentina and Brazil. In
Argentina, dicamba has had a registration in the past. We'll be moving very quickly there. They have similar challenges
to what you see in North America, and dicamba with Xtend we'll have a nice fit, and I would expect that we will lag
where we're at in the U.S. but we will be moving very quickly down there. In Brazil, we have more work to do with our
partners there to get the original dicamba product approved in Brazil and then we'll move into the over-the-top with the
Xtend. So Brazil will be lagging by a margin compared to Argentina and Argentina will be right behind the U.S.
<Q - Robert Andrew Koort>: Great. That was very helpful Thank you.

Our next question is from the line of Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Christopher S. Parkinson>: Perfect. Thank you. Despite some volume headwinds, I guess, in the U.S. since
2012, you've been gaining some solid corn share across South America and Europe, particularly in Eastern Europe.
How much farther can this go? And do you feel it's getting more difficult to gain share in a lower soft commodity
environment? And then also just kind of on the peripheral, how do you feel about South Africa and Southeast Asia as
another pillar or an aggregate, is it too small to move the needle? Thank you.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Yeah, Chris. Thanks for the two questions. I think we referenced, or I made comment to the
model, our premise on how we deliver and share value with growers, and it's hard to say in a tough year [indiscernible]
(44:51) I'm heartened see that even in these tough times that model is intact, and as the dust settles I think as we look
around we'd probably say that we held or grew share in every one of our major markets worldwide. So it's never easy
and every year is a new year and every year the grower decides fresh, but I'm heartened by the results and the fact that
they continue to reach for innovation even in a $4 corn environment. And then your other question was Southeast Asia
and South Africa and Brett, I don't think these are – we don't consider them small markets, right?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: No, I think the – we have to be careful calling them small markets because there's a lot of
corn in South Africa as well as in Asia, and here's how I think about it is a million acres of corn's a million acres of
corn. It doesn't matter what country it's grown in. We've done extremely well in South Africa. We continue to do really

well with those products. I have to tell you I'm getting more excited about Southeast Asia. We got the approval for our
biotech products in Vietnam in corn most recently, we'll get to get those in the field with farmers. We're hearing really
good conversations from some of the other countries in Southeast Asia. We've been in the Philippines for a number of
years and gone very well there, so there's a real opportunity there to expand the biotech opportunity in Southeast Asia,
and that could carry over to India, which is another large corn market. So it's a good opportunity across the corn, even
in some of these smaller countries.
<Q - Christopher S. Parkinson>: Perfect. And just a quick follow-up, regarding Intacta, can you just comment a little
more on what you're hearing from the existing growers and then potential new growers given the addition of 50-plus
varieties year-on-year? So in other words, what part of that incremental 15 million acres, next year that 30 million acres
versus the 15 million acres, will be contingent on new varieties versus older varieties? And is there any [ph] implied
(46:56) impediment there based on the new varieties? And then also you mentioned the yield benefit, but what are you
hearing from the customers regarding the cost savings angle going forward?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Well, as I said, I'm really excited about the Intacta performance. It's really knocked it out
of the park when you have two years back to back of four-bushel yield advantage and you see the kind of insect
performance we're getting out of the product. So specific to your question, I don't believe that we will be supply
constrained in the core markets of Brazil where we've had products in the market for a couple of years. The new
varieties really expand the footprint across Brazil to where now we will have varieties available in virtually every
growing zone of Brazil. We were getting close last year, now we're there.
So we have the real opportunity, and doubling when you have a small acreage is one thing but doubling when you have
15 million acres and saying were going to 30 million acres, what we're hearing from growers that are already using
Intacta is they're going to use a lot more. And what we're hearing from those that haven't used it a lot is they're hearing
from their neighbors and what they've seen, and they're going to use it a lot more, so I expect a robust expansion of that
business next year.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: This is the transition from the what if to the what is so it's the performance is concrete and
demonstrable, and the coffee shops are helping in the sales conversation there.

Our next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Yes. Hi. Good morning.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Good morning.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: So I had a question about cadence of earnings. Now you're saying that third quarter EPS will be
80% to 85% of the second half, so fourth quarter is 15% to 20% of second half. That seems much larger than what you
previously expected. I think in January you said fourth quarter would be breakeven to slightly positive. So I guess my
question is, are we seeing earnings shift from 2Q into 3Q and then from 3Q into 4Q?
<A - Pierre C. Courduroux>: P.J., thanks for the question. What we're assuming in the way we're thinking about the
fourth quarter right now is we're assuming that the timing of the deliveries in the U.S. will allow for lower returns. So
whatever moves from Q3 to Q4, depending on the returns, we are assuming there will be more in Q3 this year. Last
year, as you remember, we had usually high returns in Q4 and we are not expecting that, but if – I mean, we could plan
one way or the other, but at this point in time we are planning for lesser returns and potentially lesser sales in Q3 to
adapt to those returns. So that's a big variable there in the equation.

The second variable is we're expecting a strong start in South America based on what we're seeing right now in
safrinha. I mean, the dynamics in South America are turning towards corn a little more favorable and we're expecting a
strong start of the season in South America, so that would be a nice upside versus last year where you remember this
was the beginning of the decline. So right now we're expecting the level of rebound in South America in the quarter.
Obviously, continued very strong performance of soybeans. I mean, as Brett was saying, we were talking about Intacta,
we talked about the U.S. as well, so strong soybeans.
And the last point I want to make is, obviously, and we talked about that in our prepared remarks, is also Q4 is our
largest opportunity for expense management and that's where we spend our discretionary dollars. Most of our
discretionary dollars are spent in the fourth quarter, and the reduction in spend we're looking at right now, a big part of
that will happen in Q4. So for all those reasons, that's why we have – and we've ranged it. Obviously, we've not given a
precise guidance for the quarters, but that's the way we are thinking about the quarters and the timing and the cadence
of the earnings to come.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Thank you. On your first point you said you expect lower returns this year. Why is that? Thank
you.
<A - Pierre C. Courduroux>: Well, we expect lower returns because actually right now, I mean, the mood in the
market has been fairly pessimistic, so we think that retail and the farmers have not over committed onto the volumes of
corn. Remember, last year at this time people were way more bullish than they are right now, so that's why – and if
returns are going to be higher, we should be showing more sales as well in the third quarter, so this is a correction
variable in our planning based on acres. That's the way we've been thinking about it.

Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Thank you. Hugh, there's been some negative news on Roundup the last few weeks. Given
that, how do you assess the overall risk to the portfolio and to earnings from Roundup given what's happened and going
forward?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Yeah, David, thank you. We are – so I don't see any impact on the business. We continue to
support the platform. There's strong demand out there. And I think it's unfortunate that junk science and this kind of
mischief creates so much confusion for consumers, but we continue to grow. Growers are looking for safe, effective
solutions and I think Roundup and the combination of Roundup and the upcoming dicamba work that we're doing this
is going to be a blockbuster product. It's going to be huge. So we continue to be committed. And you look at, the
product is now close to 40 years old. It's been in almost constant regulatory review for that time, and it's had a spotless
bill of health through that entire four decades, David. So unfortunate noise, but it's a distraction more than a reality.

issue now as opposed to prior periods?

regulatory body that took a look at glyphosate. I will say this is like painting the Golden Gate Bridge. By the time you
finish you start again. Germany took four years. They were the rapporteur country for the European Union. They took
four years to study the safety of the product and gave it once again an impeccable opinion. The IR team took a week
and during that week they reviewed a handful of products, and reached the conclusion. So I said at the time that there's

Our next question is from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Mark W. Connelly>: Thanks. Hugh, so farmers didn't really trade down and U.S. corn acres weren't down all
that much, either. So two big worries didn't come to pass. But there were some state to state changes, and as you think
about those shifts, is that going to meaningfully affect your ability to penetrate markets like Doubles where you've
historically been lighter? And related to that, as marginal acres do come out, is it safe to assume that your share in those
markets tends to be lower anyway?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Yeah, I'll – let me ask – I think – so it's a great question, and you do see the play out on the
mosaic between that. I think that one of the general trends this year we've seen in some of these marginal acres is
growers looking for a bit more value. We talked earlier about people holding on to some of those high-performing
hybrids for one more year. So we've seen that, and it plays out in your observation on a little bit more in Doubles. But
Brett, we've kind of been tailoring the portfolio to some of them.
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: That's exactly right. If you think about the Double PRO product, that's the fit that it has in
the marketplace. If you're a farmer in a rootworm area, you're focused on rootworm products, and SmartStax and that's
why we see strength in SmartStax this year. And if you're on the fringe, you're the one taking a look at this saying hey,
what's my opportunity. And as we said a few people did make a trade there but it was small. Specific to your question
on the puts and takes across the states, we've planted very little corn so far and what happens between now and the
middle of the summer is Mother Nature will have a whole lot to do with which states are up and down. And there's
intentions right now, but the weather will have a big play into where we end up, and I'm still confident at this point in
time those will all wash out and we'll be in a good position by the time we get to the end of the year. It won't change
our outcomes.

<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Yeah, as we mentioned earlier, so we've all the files in, we've done all the submissions. The
Chinese authorities, in our opinion, now have the dossiers that they need to make their decision. And it's important. So
we need that Chinese approval. But if you look back over the years, China has been consistent. They're usually the last
approval, but they've been consistent in their processes, so we've no reason – at this stage, we've no reason to doubt that

The next question is coming from line of Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Joel D. Jackson>: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. This first question is on and going back to Intacta, you talked
about 30 million acres. Can we talk about, are there production constraints? What could the range be if the demand
proved better than that? Maybe you could break down into how much of that would come to Argentina?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Yeah, I guess we are beyond the production constraints stage now in terms of size of the
markets and more importantly, the range of varieties. So that won't be the constraint going forward and I think it goes
to my early point on velocity and growing that pie, so we'll be realistic in our pricing and try and drive penetration as
quickly as we can. Brett, anything else on...
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: So the 30 million acres that we're talking about, it's early; we're still counting how much
seed's coming in from harvest, and we won't know that because we work through the multipliers and seed producers,
but we feel good about the 30 million acres. And I'd just point to that's for the whole South America market, and we're
further along in Brazil than we are in Argentina, so as that mix comes to light, we'll share that as we go forwards.
<Q - Joel D. Jackson>: Okay. And finally, if you look at the operational spend coming down a little bit more than you
thought, can you talk about where we would see most of the cost coming down? And any programs that might be
getting delayed?
<A - Pierre C. Courduroux>: So as I mentioned, I mean, the fourth quarter is where we have most of our
discretionary spend, and it's going to be coming mostly – I mean, a large part – on top of what we've already done. A
large part is going to be coming from that discretionary spend and it's going to be – I mean, the key driver in addition to
that, I mean, since we point to the low end of our guidance and compared to last year we may see lesser accruals
regarding our incentives. And obviously, I mean, it's a downside for the full year, but we also have positive impact
from the currency. So it's a downside for our all business, but when you look at operating spend, this is a tailwind I
would say just for that very specific line of the P&L. So these are – discretionary spend is the bigger one, currency and
then potentially some adjustments on our accruals.

And, Rob, I think we're close to time here. We're actually a little bit past time. So from a Q&A, I'd like to thank
everybody for joining us today with their questions and pass it over to Hugh for some concluding comments.
Hugh M. Grant
Thanks, Laura, and apologies to everybody on the line for running a little bit late. I hope you feel the second quarter
gives you a clearer view into our 2015 opportunity. With the continued strength in our soybean business, and we're
very pleased the performance. And despite the sizable currency and corn acreage headwinds, we still expect this year to
deliver double-digit ongoing earnings per share growth and more than $2 billion of free cash flow for this fiscal year.

And I think more importantly, it reinforces the confidence that we have in our five-year plan to at least double our
ongoing earnings per share, as we delivered on several key milestones, including a record second year ramp with
Intacta and continued progress towards our capital allocation commitments.
So as I shared at the start of the call today, the fundamentals of our business are unchanged and these accomplishments
are the cornerstones for our long-term growth drivers. Cyclicality in agriculture may cause our rate of gain to be uneven
at times, but it doesn't change the trajectory for growth, particularly given the continued growth of long-term global
demand for both corn and soybeans. So with that, I'd like to thank you for your interest in Monsanto and for joining us
today.
