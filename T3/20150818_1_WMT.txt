Doug McMillon
Thanks, Carol. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to hear more about our second quarter earnings and
get an update on how things are progressing relative to our strategy. We just returned from our Walmart U.S. holiday
meeting in Denver. As you may know, we gather all of our store managers and market managers to talk about the plan
for the holiday season and take stock of where we are as a business. I can tell you that the feeling in the room was as
good as it's been in years.
Our stores in the U.S. are getting better, our associates are happier, and our managers are leading it. I talked with our
managers about how our company has always changed to serve customers, and we're in another period of change right
now. I shared an article from FORTUNE magazine that I keep in my office titled Can Walmart Get Back the Magic?
It's a pretty strong indictment of our future. And the fun fact is that it was written in 1996. Just as it was in 1996, we
will win the future of retail if we make the right choices as a business. We have a strong point of view on what that
future will look like.
Through technology, data and mobile, we have incredible new ways to serve customers today, and the opportunities are
only growing. We believe the winners in retail will be those who can bring together the best of the offline world with
the best of online to serve customers however they want to shop. And we believe Walmart has unique competitive
advantages in this race. We're moving forward on our enterprise strategy to position ourselves to win, playing offense,
which is the only way to play in retail. This is true around the world. It's not just a U.S. opportunity.
The changes we need to make require investment, and we're pleased with the step we've taken. We made continued
progress towards our plan this quarter. Even if it's not as fast as we'd like, the fundamentals of serving our customers
are consistently improving, and it's reflected in our comps and revenue growth.
Our strategy starts with running great stores and clubs. In Denver, we talked about the choices we're making as a
business. As you know, in the first quarter, we initiated a comprehensive multi-year plan to increase starting wages and
training for associates in our U.S. stores and clubs. During the second quarter, we implemented the next phase of
changes to our Walmart U.S. store structure, including adding department managers.
Our focus on running better stores that are clean and well-stocked, have friendly associates and an efficient checkout is
resonating with customers. They've always counted on Walmart to have great prices. Now, we're building their trust
with better in-stock and delivering an enjoyable shopping experience.
As a result, Walmart U.S. delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of positive comp sales, as overall net sales grew
nearly 5%. Customer traffic was strong again this quarter. Lower gas prices have helped. I continue to be encouraged
by the sales momentum that we're seeing, especially in general merchandise. And I'm confident that customers are
benefiting from the investments we're making in our stores and associates. Obviously, we'd like to see it ramp higher
and faster. We also recognize it won't be a linear path up and to the right, but we like the trend line.
Although we grew top line sales, we did fall short on managing the bottom line. During the quarter, operating expenses
were higher than expected and our gross margin was lower than planned. We are not pleased or satisfied. For the back
half of the year, we will manage these items closely with a continued commitment to efficiency, cutting costs where
appropriate, even in a period of investment.
Similar to the first quarter, Walmart International constant currency sales growth was solid this quarter, with Mexico
and Canada delivering strong comps. We're also excited about the opportunities we see in China, despite slower
economic growth and currency pressures. Our position is improving. We're gaining market share in the hypermarket
category. Sam's Club continues to perform well, and we have great opportunities in eCommerce. Brazil and the U.K.

remain challenging markets, but for different reasons.
I'm pleased that our U.S. Sam's Club comp sales improved this quarter and membership income was up close to 6%.
Members are recognizing the enhanced value in our Plus memberships, which drove continued growth this quarter,
both in club and online.
Another piece of our plan to win is to build and run great eCommerce. We've made a lot of progress improving our
mobile and eCommerce capabilities this year, with several important milestones in the second quarter. You'll hear more
details from Neil shortly about the investments that we've made in Pangaea, our global technology platform, and the
progress on opening our four new fulfillment centers in the United States. These investments are designed to give
customers the ability to find what they want more easily, and get what they want faster, while enabling us to fulfill
orders in a more cost-effective manner.
Another important milestone in the quarter was our acquisition of the remaining stake of Yihaodian, our eCommerce
business in China. We're extremely excited about the growth potential of Yihaodian and the opportunity it presents
over time to deliver for customers in a seamless manner. In the second quarter, Walmart's worldwide eCommerce sales
grew approximately 16% on a constant currency basis, led by solid results in both of our U.S. businesses, Walmart and
Sam's Club.
The third leg of our strategy is to innovate the future of retail by bringing online and offline together. Here, we can see
the pieces starting to come together. In the U.S., the response to our grocery home shopping offering has been strong.
I'm particularly pleased with the number of repeat customers we have and the strength of our average ticket.
Anecdotally, I can share that customers have told us it's changing their perception of the shopping experience at
Walmart. In stores, we've been aggressively pursuing store pick-up options, and Pickup, while on a very small base in
Walmart terms, is growing very quickly.
At samsclub.com, we're also seeing stronger sales, as members appreciate the convenience of our Club Pickup. We are
also focused on leveraging data to bring exciting member-relevant merchandise to our clubs and online with an eye
towards growing our share of members from the higher income household demographic.
Internationally, one of the encouraging signs we're seeing in Mexico and Canada is that customers are not only
purchasing more in our stores, but are also driving sales through eCommerce and mobile commerce.
In China, we're expanding our omni-channel offerings with the new test of in-store pickup of online orders in a number
of our Shenzhen stores. Chinese customers increasingly value the choice of both picking up their online orders in a
local store and having it shipped to their homes. And we've started integrating our digital and physical offering for
these customers.
Winning in the future requires change. Change, in this case, requires investment. And investment pressures short-term
earnings. Our strategy is designed to create robust and sustainable growth that will deliver returns to shareholders. We
obviously want to do that in the short and long-term, and it all starts by winning with customers. The good news is that
our short-term investments help build a bridge to the mid and long-term.
In the second quarter, Walmart generated more than $120 billion in revenue and delivered earnings per share of $1.08.
I'm encouraged by the improvement in our constant currency sales and recognize that our bottom-line results should
have been better. We had margin pressure from pharmacy reimbursements and higher shrink than we expected during
the quarter. These impacts, coupled with higher wage investments, impacted EPS.
Walmart U.S. is the driver of our bottom-line results. With the headwinds I just mentioned continuing the rest of the
year and the level of investments we have, our operating income will continue to be pressured. We have a strong
balance sheet, one that allowed us the opportunity to invest significantly in our business and the acquisitions like
Yihaodian. You'll hear more on the impact of these investments from Charles when he updates EPS guidance.
In the short-term, we expect Walmart U.S. comps to accelerate, as the service from our associates gains even more
traction with our customer experience. When all of our eCommerce fulfillment investments come online, we expect
them to lower our distribution costs in the mid-term, starting in the fourth quarter, and having a larger positive impact

next year. Over the longer-term, we believe we'll continue to grow in key markets around the world and further
integrate our store and eCommerce offerings. We know that to deliver for our shareholders in a sustainable way, we
must first win with our customers and associates. So I'm confident that these are the right decisions to position Walmart
for the future.
Finally, I want to mention an important moment we'll observe this week. Nearly 10 years ago, our customers and
associates on the Gulf Coast were impacted by Hurricane Katrina. Throughout the devastation that the residents of this
region faced, Walmart associates demonstrated extraordinary courage and passion for these communities. I often think
how simple acts of kindness can have a dramatic impact. Our people really do make the difference at Walmart, not only
for our customers but also for the communities we serve. I look forward to joining our associates and community
leaders in New Orleans later this week to look back at this event and to discuss how to get better at disaster resiliency
and response.
Now, I'll turn it over to Neil. Neil?
Neil M. Ashe
Thanks, Doug. We delivered a lot during the quarter at Walmart U.S., at Sam's Club and in our key markets around the
world, all possible because of the groundwork we laid over the last few years.
As a quick recap, we've re-platformed both our technology and physical distribution network for eCommerce. The
technology platform Pangaea is consistently improving the customer experience and conversion for walmart.com,
which has led to solid sales growth. We've created a U.S. grocery home shopping business that is getting great reviews
from our customers. And we've developed eCommerce at Sam's Club and in key markets around the world, notably in
Brazil and in China.
All of this was made possible because we have built a talent-dense Internet technology company inside of Walmart.
We're now able to create new experiences for customers across digital and physical.
Overall, Global eCommerce constant currency sales grew approximately 16%. GMV, or gross merchandise value, grew
approximately 18% on a constant currency basis. The highlight was solid growth in the walmart.com and
samsclub.com U.S. businesses, while International was soft due to economic challenges in several of our key markets.
Because of the softness in International, we are resetting our Global eCommerce sales growth forecast for this fiscal
year from the mid-20s to a range in the mid-to-high teens.
As I mentioned, both businesses in the U.S. are going very well. A great example of how everything came to life was
our walmart.com Dare to Compare event that we kicked off in July. This event created a perfect opportunity to
highlight that customers can trust us to offer them the assortment they want at low prices every day, not just during a
one-day sale. We were able to use our technology platform and sophisticated pricing algorithms to help us track and
deliver lower pricing than competitors.
Given that we've tripled assortment in the past three years, we had more items for customers to shop. Customers could
then choose how to get their purchases in the most convenient way for them. We offered customers the option to get
orders shipped to their door or to a store with same-day pickup. In fact, it led to our biggest day of the year so far for
same-day pickup.
The flexibility of our new platform allowed us to move very quickly, and the new site delivered a better, faster
shopping experience to customers. And, those customers who were shopping on mobile devices had an improved
experience, thanks to the responsive design we rolled out in the quarter.
We are using eCommerce to bring both new customers to Walmart as well as to deepen our relationship with our
existing customers. On the largest day of our Dare to Compare event, we saw more than double the number of new
customers to walmart.com than a typical day.

During the second quarter, we had a number of milestones for Walmart U.S. We migrated 100% of customers to the
new cart and checkout, based on our new technology platform. We delivered responsive design to dynamically adjust
the site to whatever device was being used. We started rolling out a significantly-enhanced store search capability on
mobile.
We opened two new automated online fulfillment centers, each bigger than 20 football fields. And we have two more
coming this quarter. These fulfillment centers are strategically located across geographies and will begin to serve our
customers this holiday. They will be cornerstones of our fulfillment network going forward. We also started a targeted
test of an unlimited free shipping program, priced at $50 for one year.
I'm also pleased with the expansion and progress on grocery home shopping in the U.S. We're in five markets and sales
continue to grow because customers, especially moms with children, love the convenience of ordering online and
having their car loaded at a pickup location. In addition to expanding pickup in stores, we are offering customers
remote pickup points that are convenient to them, including their corporate campuses. In fact, we launched one here at
our campus in San Bruno.
We've also made great progress at Sam's Club, where we have been tightly aligned with clubs to deliver a better
member experience, which has helped deliver high growth on samsclub.com. Sam's delivered new Club Pickup options
that make it easier and more convenient for members to shop online and pick up at the club.
Pre-paid Club Pickup rolled out across the country and we started testing mobile check-in and drive-through in several
clubs. We've also improved the assortment and pricing online. Knowing that members that love the treasure hunt, we
launched Shocking Values on samsclub.com that gives member access to special items at outstanding prices for a very
limited time. Our enhancements to mobile have also built on our member experience and we've seen double-digit
growth in mobile.
As I mentioned earlier, sales in our international markets were softer during the second quarter than we've seen
previously. While still growing, grocery home shopping in the U.K. has slowed down, commensurate with the market.
Asda opened 14 petrol stations during the second quarter, and these were enabled with click & collect lockers for both
grocery and general merchandise items.
In Brazil, the overall economic environment is very challenging, but we have continued to take share in this down
market. We are growing sales faster than the market and we are continuing to see growth in GMV. Our team has used
this opportunity to build a lean and nimble operating model that can succeed in any market condition.
As Doug mentioned, we acquired the remaining shares of Yihaodian in China. In 2012, we became 51% owners and
have seen strong growth since that time. Yihaodian now has about 100 million registered customers, more than twice as
many as when we first invested. Our prior goal is to continue to accelerate Yihaodian's core eCommerce business and
maintain strong local Chinese expertise.
Now that we are the sole owners, we will be expanding our leadership team from within the Yihaodian business, from
within Walmart, and from the eCommerce industry in China. We will also leverage Walmart's global reach and scale to
better benefit Yihaodian, including global sourcing.
Wang Lu, who joined us earlier this year to lead Global eCommerce in Asia, is overseeing Yihaodian. He brings a
strong background in developing digital businesses in China. China is an exciting, dynamic, large, and competitive
market. We are excited about our long-term opportunity in China.
We are delivering important eCommerce capabilities around the world and, ultimately, these capabilities are enabling
experiences that impact the stores and clubs as well as eCommerce. Customers see us as Walmart and Sam's Club, not
a collection of shopping channels. We are delivering experiences on apps and sites and in stores and clubs that come
together to differentiate us in the eyes of our customers and members.
To remain in a leadership position, we must continue to invest in technology and people to deliver the customer and
member experiences.

Now, I'll turn it over to Greg. Greg?
Greg Foran
Thank you, Neil. As Doug mentioned, we are encouraged by our top line growth, particularly traffic. Our bottom line
came in substantially below what was planned.
Three major factors contributed to our underperformance: a decline in gross margin, primarily related to lower than
expected pharmacy reimbursements; and accelerating pressures in shrink; as well as a higher than planned investment
in store hours, which was essential to improving the customer experience.
I want to be straightforward. These issues will present continuing profit challenges for the remainder of the year. We
are certainly disappointed, but we are not standing still. We know we can do better and we will.
For the Walmart U.S. business, doing better means staying focused on an aggressive strategic plan to improve the
customer experience in our stores, and deliver sustainable top and bottom line growth for the long-term. This strategic
plan includes a number of large specific projects that fit within our broader focus on assortment, price, access, and
customer experience. This plan requires significant investments, and we are confident we are making the right
decisions for our customers and our business.
Amid the investment, we are focused on growing sales and controlling costs, as you would expect from Walmart. We
are staying true to our roots. However, we are committed to improving the customer experience, and we will protect the
investments necessary to achieve this goal.
Let me dig in a bit on details. I'm pleased to report that we're seeing progress on our top line, as net sales for the second
quarter were up 4.8% and comp sales increased 1.5%. We also improved inventory, meeting our goal to grow inventory
less than sales growth. Additionally, we've seen improvements in traffic and customer experience from these actions.
Each decision was in line with the strategy we laid out, and progress has been steady and consistent.
Let me share with you some of our accomplishments in the first half of this fiscal year, many of which occurred during
the second quarter. First, across all our formats, we're focused on improving the shopping experience for our customers.
We've continued our Checkout Promise initiative, ensuring more registers are open during peak shopping hours. We've
invested in providing customers with a cleaner, better-maintained shopping environment, and we've added
approximately 1,700 items, primarily in grocery, to warehouse stock, driving faster replenishment times to the stores
and ensuring the product is available for our customers.
Second, we're investing in our associates. This April, we raised the minimum starting wage in our stores to $9.00 per
hour, resulting in over 500,000 associates receiving a raise. This new wage structure is expanding our applicant pool.
We're also introducing 8,000 new department manager positions, a more focused role that allows the associate to be
trained and become more knowledgeable with the areas they support, providing our customers with a better experience
in the store.
Additionally, we are continuing to focus on career development for all our associates. Finally, we've increased the
amount an associate will receive upon being promoted into higher levels of responsibility. These changes gave pay
raises to an additional 150,000 associates who are critical to improving the in-store experience.
Alongside wage improvement and to support career development, we're rolling out new training programs designed to
help associates grow their careers at Walmart and provide a better experience for our customers. These programs,
which will be rolled out this fall, are hands-on, instructor-led, and tailored specifically to a position, ensuring the
training is relevant to an associate's current role or to a future role they aspire to achieve.
And we're piloting new scheduling tools that allow associates to select shifts that work best for them, while ensuring
the store is staffed appropriately for customer demand. This program is reducing associate absences and turnover in the
pilot stores and providing managers with better visibility to coverage gaps.

Lastly, we're investing in operational improvements. In the second quarter, we began an overhaul of our inventory
management systems, routines, and schedules. The Customer Availability Program, or CAP, will supplant decade-old
processes with modern technology and new routines that keep associates on the sales floor rather than in the stockroom.
Processes for truck deliveries at peak times and for stocking shelves have been significantly simplified, freeing more
associates to be on the floor during peak customer traffic.
We've also begun rolling out MC-40 technology to all department managers. This smaller, more intuitive handheld tool
allows us to replace the current devices with one that can provide enhanced technology. This will simplify how our
associates work in a way that was not possible before. Additionally, this month, store managers are receiving mobile
tablets that will help them stay connected to the business, while keeping them on the sales floor to help our customers
and associates.
As part of our focus on EDLC, we have reduced supplier marketing funds that have traditionally offset a portion of our
advertising expenses as we work towards better product costs. This will translate into lower prices for our customers.
As a result of this reduction, we have lowered our second quarter print advertising count from 20 pieces last year to just
four pieces this year. Moreover, since June, we've been working on amending terms and allowance agreements with
our suppliers, driving consistency and simplification across our business. We have also reinstated our shrink training
program for our asset protection and store management teams as part of our efforts to improve in this area.
And finally, we have reduced feature and modular changes across the store, ensuring there is space for each feature and
associate hours to make these changes. Along with this reduction, we have moved some feature and modular decisions
back to the stores, allowing them to set features that best align to their local customer needs and preferences. Whilst
there are numerous initiatives being landed across our business, these are being executed in a coordinated and
systematic fashion to allow us to achieve our full potential.
We are pleased with our progress in the first half of the year, but we recognize that we still have a lot to do to meet our
long-term goals and that it will take time to get where we want to be. I recognize these actions have and will continue
to pressure our bottom-line. But they are already driving meaningful improvements. Over the past year, we have seen
growth in store traffic and comp sales.
Additionally, our customer satisfaction scores continue to improve. Every day, a sample of customers in every store
rate us across a number of metrics, including providing a fast checkout, friendly service, and a clean store environment.
Based on the ratings from these surveys, we can see that our stores are making significant improvement from their
baseline, and we expect that trend to continue. Improving the customer experience is fundamental to our success.
Finally, we are proud of the impact these decisions have had on our associates. Nearly 80% of our 1.2 million U.S.
store associates participated in our annual associate survey, administered during this quarter. Our associates'
engagement has increased approximately 100 basis points this year, after remaining static for the prior two years.
We remain committed to the strategy we laid out for you earlier this year, ensuring we are making the right decisions to
benefit both our customers and our associates and to drive long-term, sustainable growth. We know we will continue to
face considerable challenges, but our goal for the back half of this year is to build on the improvements in top-line and
customer experience. And our list of things to accomplish is even longer.
Now, let's cover the details on our financial performance for the second quarter. Net sales increased $3.4 billion, or
4.8% versus last year. Comparable store sales were up 1.5% and driven my strength in traffic, which increased 1.3%.
Traffic was particularly strong on the general merchandise and softlines side of the box. Seasonal categories resonated
well with customers, and changes in replenishment strategies ensured product was on the shelves when and where
customers needed it.
Finally, eCommerce sales contributed approximately 20 basis points to our overall comp. Neil shared the details on our
progress on technology infrastructure and fulfillment for walmart.com orders. We are pleased that these efforts will
position us even more competitively for the back half of the year. Our grocery home shopping pilots remain underway
in five key markets, and we are happy with increased customer counts in these areas.

All formats delivered positive comp sales growth this quarter. In particular, comps in Neighborhood Markets were up
approximately 7.3%. We remain encouraged by the performance of this format. As mentioned, the general merchandise
and softlines side of the Supercenter performed well this quarter, driving strong traffic and sales growth through
relevant offerings and better in-stock positions. While warm weather, particularly in July, helped propel sales in
seasonal categories, our ongoing focus on the basics across apparel, indoor home and hardlines drove momentum
throughout the quarter. Additionally, while we saw a shift of back-to-school sales into August as several states adjusted
the timing of the tax-free weekends, early indications are positive.
Health & wellness benefited from continued growth in pharmacy scripts, along with new brands in optical and a focus
on better in-stock positions and OTC. And while we saw improved trends in our entertainment business from better
in-stocks and stronger online sales, comps continue to run negative, pressured by ongoing industry declines and the
shift from post-paid to installment wireless plans.
On the grocery side of the box, consumables had positive comps, driven by a strong base business. New products,
particularly in chemicals, drove additional momentum. More noticeably, continued pressure in food from declining
inflation negatively impacted our total box comp by approximately 60 basis points.
Moving on to the remainder of our financials, gross profit rate declined 41 basis points this quarter. As I said before,
this was driven by a handful of key issues.
Let's talk about pharmacy. Reflecting industry-wide trends, we are seeing reduced reimbursement rates from Pharmacy
Benefit Managers, which is negatively impacting gross margin. We are also seeing a lower mix of higher-margin cash
transactions, reflecting a marketplace shift in which more customers are now benefiting from greater drug insurance
coverage. While we are taking a number of actions to lessen the impact, we expect to have pressure on pharmacy for
the rest of the fiscal year.
Additionally, inventory shrinkage was meaningfully higher than planned for the quarter. We are reviewing the
end-to-end inventory management process with a special focus on shrinkage and working to close gaps. Investments
are being made in training programs for store and asset protection associates as well as investments in staffing in high
shrink areas of the store. But it will take time to see results, so this will impact versus plan for the rest of the year.
Operating expenses deleveraged 50 basis points to last year, primarily due to our higher than planned investments in
customer experience. These investments included the planned wage rate increases and structural changes I mentioned
earlier, as well as additional associate hours needed to improve customer service. This quarter, we thoughtfully added
back hours to specific areas of the store, such as the front end and stocking positions. This was a strategic decision to
invest where we can drive the most benefit for our customers. These adds were significant and more than we had
planned, but we felt it was the right decision to meet the goals we have set. And we've started to see the investment
translate into better top-line performance.
The focus on customer experience, along with ongoing investments in eCommerce and the reduction in gross profit
rate, led to an operating income decline of approximately 8.2% versus last year.
Moving on, in the second quarter, total inventory grew slower than the rate of sales at 2.2%. Comp store inventory
declined by 2.4% versus last year. The majority of this improvement came from decisions we made regarding
replenishment strategies whereby we strategically moved inventory for certain items upstream from our store back
rooms to our distribution centers. Additionally, we continued our focus on clearing our back rooms of excess inventory,
improving operational efficiency in the stores.
These actions, along with better management of seasonal inventory and reducing modular changes and feature
shipments to the stores, allowed us to reduce comp store inventory, while improving both in-stock levels and sales.
Inventory management will continue to be an ongoing focus for us.
This quarter, we opened 16 Supercenters, including relocations and expansions. Additionally, we opened 22
traditional-format Neighborhood Markets and the final six of our smaller-format Neighborhood Market test locations.

As we think about future store openings, we'll continue to focus on quality versus quantity. Having opened more than
350 Neighborhood Markets in the past two years, we have a better understanding of what customers value most, from
the choice of location, to the size of the box, to the product offerings. Based on these learnings, we've decided not to
pursue a number of potential locations, as they would not provide the type of quality experience customers expect from
a Neighborhood Market.
We now expect to open a total of 160 to 170 Neighborhood Markets in fiscal 2016, including the 51 locations already
opened. Our previous forecast was to open between 180 and 200 Neighborhood Markets. We are still on track to build
approximately 60 to 70 Supercenters this year, which was our original forecast.
We know that we still have a lot of work to do to achieve the long-term goals we have set for our business. The
investments we're making, along with the headwinds we've mentioned, will weigh more heavily on operating income
than initially forecasted. Amid the pressures, we are thoughtfully evaluating every decision and use of company
resources as we go through the back half of the year. But we are confident in the direction we are headed. We are
seeing improvements every day from sales and traffic growth, to increased customer satisfaction, to more engaged
associates.
For the third quarter, we expect our ongoing investments in stores and customer experience to drive further sales
momentum, offset partially by continued deflationary pressures in food, especially in meat and dairy. For the 13-week
period ending October 30, we anticipate a comp sales increase of approximately 1% to 2%. Last year, our comp sales
for the period were up 0.5%.
Now, I will turn it over to Dave for an update on Walmart International. Dave?
David Cheesewright
Thanks, Greg. The International business had a fairly solid quarter, given tough economic environments in certain
markets and ongoing currency impacts. In Q2, we saw accelerating sales growth in Mexico and Canada, offsetting
ongoing challenges in the U.K., Brazil and China. Overall, I continue to be enthusiastic about our long-term prospects
to profitably grow our International business in a controlled and disciplined manner.
Similar to last quarter, the performance in Mexico and Canada continued to be solid. Our Mexico team has done an
excellent job reenergizing that business, driving strong performance across all formats. We continue to see significant
growth opportunities in Mexico, along with the improving core business. In Canada, we continue to gain market share,
driven by our fifth consecutive quarter of positive comps. These two markets will continue to play a key role in our
back half performance. I'll provide more details on key market performance in a few minutes.
Now, let's jump to our overall results. In the second quarter, net sales grew 2.8% on a constant currency basis, despite
headwinds in Latin America from lapping last year's World Cup and the timing shift of Easter. The U.S. dollar remains
strong, which led to a currency impact of $4.2 billion, resulting in a 9.6% sales decline on a reported basis. Comp sales
were positive in Mexico and Canada, while the U.K., Brazil, and China posted negative comps. All other markets had
positive comp sales.
Operating income declined 1.5% on a constant currency basis, negatively impacted by increased employment claim
contingencies and higher than expected utility rates in Brazil, as well as continued investments in Global eCommerce.
This was partially offset by gains from the sale of the bank operations in Mexico and certain properties in Canada.
Excluding the impact of these items, operating income would have grown faster than sales. With the currency exchange
impact, operating income decreased 14.2%.
On a constant currency basis, inventory grew faster than sales at 4.2%, driven primarily by slower sales in the U.K.. On
a reported basis, inventory declined 10.5%.
Now, let's discuss market results, presented on a constant currency basis for our largest markets. In all countries except
Brazil and China, financial results are inclusive of eCommerce.

Let's start with the U.K. The market remained highly competitive during the second quarter, with significant ongoing
vouchering from Asda's competitors. Grocery deflation remained at near record levels, as prices decreased 1.7% versus
last year for the 12 weeks ended June 21, according to Kantar. The total market declined 0.1%, a reversal from a slight
growth in Q1, in part due to the timing of Easter.
U.K. sales declined 4.1% and comp sales, excluding fuel, were down 5.2%, driven by declining traffic, especially in
fresh food categories. Grocery home shopping sales continued to grow, and we remain focused on driving
improvements to our customer metrics. Operating income increased year-over-year, mostly driven by the timing of
Easter and margin improvement in non-food categories from a favorable mix shift.
For the rest of the year, we are focused on strengthening the assortment in private label and improving pricing on
national brands. We will continue to drive aggressive cost reduction initiatives supporting our £1 billion five-year price
investment strategy. We're investing to improve store standards and on-shelf availability and to maintain recent
improvements in grocery home shopping service metrics.
In addition, we launched our new branding and marketing campaign based around adoption of the Walmart Save
Money, Live Better mission to help build brand and quality perception. Collectively, these actions are designed to
address some of the challenges we face in store traffic and fresh food.
Let's now discuss Mexico, which released their earnings on July 21. Please note that Walmex release is under IFRS and
the results here are under U.S. GAAP; therefore, some numbers may differ. Consolidated Walmex net sales increased
7.2%, with solid comp sales in both Mexico and Central America. Mexico sales grew 7.4% and comp sales increased
5.4%. We continue to see strong comps across all formats, including Sam's Club, which delivered 4.6% comp growth.
Self-service continues to gain share and delivered 190 basis point improvement in market share, according to ANTAD.
General merchandise performed very well at 4.9% comp growth, despite a tough year-over-year comparison from last
year's World Cup. Operating income grew faster than sales.
The sale of our banking unit in the second quarter, along with the Vips restaurant divestiture last fiscal year, helps us
focus on our core business, which is our strength.
We are intent on being the most relevant retailer for our customers through excellent prices, great assortment, and
consistent execution. We remain confident that the steps we have in place to improve Walmex are working and will
serve as a catalyst for our business over the long-term.
In Canada, sales grew 5.4% and comps grew 3.9% in a low growth economic environment, driven by strong
performance in food, health & wellness, home and toys. We're investing in price and value, as we look for
opportunities to lower costs in our business. We continued to gain share in our core categories of food, health &
wellness and infant categories, as per Nielsen data for the 12 weeks ended July 18.
Additionally, our Canadian eCommerce business grew sales at more than 40%, albeit on a small base. In July, we
successfully launched our online grocery business, starting with 11 store pick-up locations in the Ottawa area. In
addition to top line performance, we remain focused on our low-cost operating model. Operating income grew
significantly faster than sales.
In the quarter, we finalized the acquisition of 13 stores and one distribution center from a former competitor. Seven of
the stores are planned to open by the end of this fiscal year and the remainder will open next year. In May, we also
closed the sale of a portfolio of properties under development with our shopping center joint venture partner, which
generated the previously mentioned gain. Overall, I'm pleased with our results in Canada and expect consistent,
profitable growth to continue.
In Brazil, the country is facing a prolonged recession and the highest inflation rate in 12 years, driven in part by
electricity rate increases of more than 50% versus last year, which is driving a cautious approach to consumption.
For Walmart Brazil, net sales declined 0.9% and comp sales were down 1%, largely impacted by the World Cup event
held during the same period last year and the timing of the Easter holiday. We experienced a decline in the hypermarket

format, driven by electronics, but are pleased with the double-digit comp sales increases in the wholesale business.
Brazil operating income declined for the quarter, driven by the previously mentioned employment claims and rapidly
rising utility rates compared to last year. The management team is making progress on the operational, people and legal
fronts to address ongoing employment claims as they work through a challenging business environment. In addition,
they're focused on key leverage initiatives to increase store productivity and help offset inflationary pressure.
We continue to make progress on converting stores and distribution centers to standardized systems, which provides
better visibility to business results, leverages costs, and reduces compliance risk. Last year, we integrated all of our
stores in the South region. This year, we're focused on converting the south dry DC network as well as approximately
100 stores in the northeast. Next year, we plan to convert the remaining northeast stores and dry DCs to this unified
platform.
Despite challenging market conditions, the eCommerce business in Brazil continues to perform well. Sales grew
double-digits and outpaced the Brazilian eCommerce market. Market share rose from 8% to 8.5% in Q2 according to
[ph] eBit (49:00), an eCommerce research firm, with share gains in several categories, including babies, toys and
games, and auto parts. Marketplace sales growth was also strong.
Last, let's discuss China. Walmart China's sales grew 1.2%, while comp sales declined 1.4%. Walmart increased market
share in fast-moving consumer goods in the hypermarket channel and maintained share in the modern trade channel,
which includes smaller format stores, for the 12 weeks ended June 28, according to Nielsen.
While there are ongoing market headwinds from slower economic growth, we're confident we'll continue to deliver
sustainable growth in China. Walmart continues to outperform the market and gain market share in hypermarkets for
the 10th quarter in a row.
We're focused on driving efficiency, reducing expenses and strengthening our portfolio through We Operate for Less
and We Buy for Less initiatives. These actions contributed to operating income growing significantly faster than sales.
The team continues to set the foundation for our business, positioning it for increased growth and profitability in the
future.
Throughout the quarter, we made significant progress in our omni-channel efforts. Walmart China launched Walmart
To Go in 23 stores in Shenzhen, bringing customers the convenience of ordering through the Walmart app and the
choice of pick-up in store or delivery to their home. We're also testing ways to bring added payment choices and the
convenience of mobile payment to our customers in our stores.
In addition, as Doug and Neil mentioned, we increased our ownership of Yihaodian, our China eCommerce platform,
to 100%. We're excited about the opportunity to deliver new experiences to customers in China, and further leverage
Yihaodian in Walmart's global and local assets.
In the second quarter, Yihaodian grew sales double digits, driven by strong growth in orders and continued
improvement in conversion rates. Mobile contributed more than 55% of orders.
As I wrap up the International portion of today's call, I'd like to express how pleased I am with our associates around
the globe and their efforts in driving consistent and solid performance in the first half. We're growing comp sales across
the majority of our portfolio, and stepping up investments in eCommerce, while setting our business up for long-term
success. We expect continued economic challenges in the U.K. and Brazil, but also expect continued strong
performance in Mexico and Canada. We're optimistic about our growth prospects in China, despite a softening
economy, and will continue to invest in that market.
Now, I will turn it over to Roz for an update on Sam's. Roz?

Thanks, Dave. We were pleased that our investments are contributing to the improvements in Sam's Club. In the second
quarter, we grew comp sales, without fuel, 1.3%, and net sales 2.8%. Our square footage also grew due to three new
clubs opening during the quarter. We are accelerating our efforts to strengthen the Sam's Club member value
proposition.
Since last year, our investments have been targeted to better merchandise assortment, membership acquisition,
engagement and retention, new programs to enhance member value, and our investment in eCommerce. By staying on
a consistent path and driving these priorities, we continue to simplify our business. We saw the benefits in improved
membership trends and higher traffic during the second quarter. What is most important is the overwhelmingly positive
feedback we're hearing from our members, not just about our clubs, but also about improvement in the eCommerce
experience. I'll provide some examples shortly.
Now, on to the numbers, with fuel, operating income declined by 13.4% to $428 million. Fuel profitability improved
from Q1, but is still below planned levels and below last year's dollars. For additional results with fuel, please reference
the accompanying presentation.
Net sales, without fuel, grew 2.8%. Comp sales, without fuel, were up 1.3%, with ticket contributing 80 basis points
and traffic 50 basis points. Savings member traffic was positive, partially offset by a decline in Business member
traffic.
Our gross profit rate declined 38 basis points versus last year, driven in part by our ongoing Cash Rewards investment,
increased seasonal markdowns and industry headwinds in pharmacy prescriptions, similar to those referenced in the
Walmart U.S. business.
Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased by 13 basis points, due to continued investments in new
clubs, technology and eCommerce. Membership and other income grew 6.1%, with membership income up 5.8%,
driven in large part by Plus upgrades.
As a result of both of these factors, operating income declined 9.7% versus last year. We continue to manage our
inventory appropriately. Inventory, without fuel, grew by 3.4% driven in part by new clubs.
In our merchandising areas, let me start by highlighting two of our stronger categories, home and apparel and health &
wellness. Home and apparel delivered low single-digit comp sales, with strength in apparel offset by softness in kitchen
electrics, domestics and furniture. Health & wellness posted mid-single-digit comps, driven by generics and by
increased member adoption of our Free/4/10 prescription program. Since the launch of the program last quarter for Plus
members, we see that those who utilize the program transfer, on average, two-thirds of their scripts to Sam's Club. We
are optimistic that these trends will continue to drive traffic.
Our fresh/freezer/cooler business was softer than expected, due to deflation in key dairy commodities, such as milk and
cheese, along with higher costs in areas such as meat.
Grocery and beverages delivered low single-digit comps, with dry grocery delivering solid comp sales. The
consumables business also delivered low single-digit comps, driven by laundry and tabletop categories.
Our technology, entertainment and office businesses, albeit posting negative comps, saw improvement from Q1 levels.
We saw acceleration in certain key categories such as tablets. That was offset in part by our wireless business, which
has been negatively impacted by the industry shift to installment plans.
We continue to make progress in eCommerce to build the most convenient club in the industry. We're pleased with our
ongoing integration of digital and physical. eCommerce contributed approximately 60 basis points to our club comp
performance during the period, and traffic to our site was up just over 20%. We delivered new club pick-up options that
make it easier and more convenient for members to shop online and pick up at the club.
Pre-paid Club Pickup rolled out across the country and we started testing mobile check-in and drive-through in several
clubs. The number of members trying it for the first time during the quarter exceeded our expectations. And we expect
ongoing acceptance of this service.

We have also improved the assortment and pricing online. Knowing that members love the treasure hunt, we launched
Shocking Values, that give members access to special items at outstanding prices for a very limited time. Shocking
Values products are carefully chosen based on members' interest, top trends and items from the company's most
popular shopping categories. In addition, our enhancements to mobile have also built on our member experience and
drove double-digit growth in traffic.
Membership income was up versus last year, with growth driven by social media campaigns as well as strong Plus
renewals and upgrades, due to the benefits of Cash Rewards. We also continue to emphasize our award-winning Sam's
Club 5-3-1 MasterCard, which allows members to save inside and outside the club. We've received very positive
feedback from our members on this program.
We recently hosted our annual supplier summit here in Bentonville. And we were pleased with the excellent attendance
and engagement. Our suppliers are very interested in the work we've done to ensure their great items are getting in front
of our member base. They are supportive of the innovation and merchandising transformation we have in place. We
have great items coming for the holidays.
We are focused on further progress in the Sam's Club business for the back half of the year. For the 13-week period
ending October 30, 2015, we expect comps sales, without fuel, to be between flat and up 2%.
Now, I'll turn things to Charles. Charles?
Charles M. Holley, Jr.
Thanks, Roz. I'll start with the top-line. We're pleased with the sales increases we saw in the U.S. as well as in our
international businesses, when considering constant currency. We believe traffic and comp sales increases for Walmart
U.S. show we are on the right track with our investments.
Walmart U.S. now has had positive comps for four straight quarters. As expected, these investments impacted both
operating expenses and profits. In addition, Walmart U.S. experienced gross margin pressure from pharmacy and
shrink that we had not expected.
Looking forward at the rest of the year, operating profit will be pressured more than we originally planned. This is
primarily driven by the headwinds to Walmart U.S. gross margins that I just mentioned. We will continue to scrutinize
and evaluate how we manage our capital in order to optimize both the customer experience and returns.
Before I turn to guidance, let me cover some other items. You may have read in our earnings release that we are
reviewing leases across all of our segments. This is part of a comprehensive ongoing lease review. One item that we are
focusing on, and may need to be corrected, relates to leases where our payment of certain structural component costs
during a lessor's construction of the leased store causes us to be deemed the owner of the property for accounting
purposes. This results in us capitalizing these leased assets on our balance sheet.
We don't know the impact to our financial statements, but believe it mostly to be a balance sheet issue at this time. We
will provide more information once the review is complete.
Turning to cash, during the quarter, we spent approximately $760 million to acquire the remaining shares of Yihaodian,
a strategic acquisition for eCommerce growth in China. In addition, we continued to provide shareholder returns in the
form of dividends and share repurchases. And in the second quarter, we paid approximately $1.6 billion in dividends
and repurchased approximately $1 billion of shares. This represents our larger share repurchase activity in the last four
quarters. As always, we will remain opportunistic with share repurchase throughout the year. As of the end of the
second quarter, we had approximately $9 billion remaining under our current $15 billion authorization.
Membership and other income increased 13.9% to $899 million. Other income primarily benefited from the gain on the
sale of the bank operations in Mexico.

FCPA and compliance-related costs were approximately $30 million, comprised of approximately $23 million for the
ongoing inquiries and investigations, and approximately $7 million for our global compliance program and
organizational enhancements.
Last year, FCPA and compliance-related costs were $43 million in the second quarter. We expect FCPA-related
expenses to continue to trend down, so we now expect our full year FCPA-related expenses to range between $130
million and $150 million. This compares to our guidance in February of $160 million to $180 million.
Return on investment for the trailing 12 months ended July 31, 2015 was 16.2%, which compares to 16.7% last year.
The decline in ROI has primarily been due to continued capital investments as well as our decrease in operating
income.
Earlier, Greg mentioned that as part of our commitment to EDLC, we are working on amending terms and allowance
agreements with our Walmart U.S. suppliers to drive simplicity and consistency across our business. We began this
effort in June, and discussions will continue over the coming months.
On a constant currency basis, inventory grew slower than sales. While we are pleased with the progress in managing
our inventories, working capital is still an opportunity for us to generate stronger free cash flow.
Now, let's turn our attention to guidance. In February, we indicated that we expected our full year fiscal 2016 earnings
per share to range between $4.70 and $5.05. Today, we expect our fiscal 2016 earnings per share to range between
$4.40 and $4.70, including a range of $0.93 and $1.05 for the third quarter. This new range includes the following
updated assumptions. First, the impact from our investments in wages, training and additional hours in our stores will
be approximately $0.24, including approximately $0.08 in the third quarter.
Through the first half of this year, we have incurred approximately $0.10 of the expected full year impact. This
compares to our original guidance in February of approximately $0.20. As you heard from Greg earlier, our decision to
increase associate hours beyond our February plan to areas of the store, such as front end and stocking positions, are
intended to drive the most benefit for our customers.
Next, the incremental investment in Global eCommerce will range between $0.06 and $0.09. This is unchanged from
our guidance in February. In the third quarter, we expect the impact to be approximately $0.02. Through the first half of
this year, we have incurred approximately $0.04 of the expected full year impact.
Third, we expect a full year impact of approximately $0.11, including approximately $0.03 in the third quarter from the
unplanned headwinds that I discussed earlier. The headwinds are primarily in Walmart U.S. pharmacy margins, as well
as higher than expected shrink continuing through this fiscal year.
Assuming currency exchange rates remain at current levels for the remainder of the year, we now expect the full year
impact to be approximately $0.15, up $0.02 from last quarter's revised guidance of $0.13.
Our effective tax rate is expected to range between 32% and 34%, unchanged from our guidance in February. Now, as
a reminder, our tax rate will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and may be impacted by a number of factors, including
changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in law, outcomes of
administrative audits, the impacts of discrete items, and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international
operations. And, in any given quarter, our effective tax rate could be higher or lower than the full year.
We will host our annual investment meeting in New York on October 14. As we have in prior annual investment
community meetings, we will provide an update on our capital plans at that time. We look forward to seeing you there.
Thank you for your interest in Walmart, and have a great day.
