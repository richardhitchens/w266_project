Frederick Wallace Smith
Thank you, Mickey. Welcome everyone to the discussion of our results for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2016,
a significant year for FedEx.
We announced sometime ago we would complete the acquisition of TNT Express in the first half of calendar 2016 and
we officially acquired the company on May 25. We greatly appreciate the outstanding work of our Express finance and
legal teams in getting this transaction completed without conditions.
Annual revenue exceeded $50 billion for the first time and we're particularly pleased with our adjusted operating
margin improvement of 1% year-over-year to 10% for fiscal year 2016 and our adjusted operating margin of 11.7% for
the fourth quarter.
We believe we will continue to increase margins, earnings-per-share, cash flows and capital returns over the next
several years given expectations for moderate economic growth and excluding TNT financial results and pension
mark-to-market costs.
I congratulate and thank all FedEx team members around the world for their dedication to our Purple Promise which
simply states, I will make every FedEx experience outstanding.
As we integrate the acquisitions of TNT, GENCO and FedEx CrossBorder, we'll continue making investments in
modernizing the FedEx Express aircraft fleet and expanding the highly automated FedEx Ground network to extend our
leadership in the rapidly growing e-commerce market. These initiatives are integral to achieving our goals.
Let me close with a few brief remarks regarding Friday's successful conclusion of the Internet pharmacy case. First, I'd
like to thank our inside and outside counsel. They did an outstanding job representing our company. FedEx has always
been innocent of these charges which should never have been filed. We strongly believe we should not admit the things
we did not do and pay millions to avoid a criminal trial. FedEx delivered packages for licensed pharmacies registered
by the federal Drug Enforcement Administration. Very few companies have done more during the last four decades to
cooperate with law enforcement than FedEx, as was true in these matters, and we will continue to do so
We're especially proud of the hundreds of thousands of FedEx team members worldwide who demonstrate every day
their commitment to provide our important services safely, reliably and at all times, ethically.
Now, let me turn it to Mike Glenn who will comment on the economy and our revenue followed by Alan Graf who will
discuss FedEx's financial performance. Mike?

T. Michael Glenn
Thanks, Fred. I will open with our economic update and outlook and then we will discuss business performance in each
of the segments and then I will have some commentary on broader business trends.
On the economic front, we continue to see moderate growth in the global economy. Our U.S. GDP forecast is 1.8% for
calendars 2016 which is 40 basis points lower than our forecast last quarter. And we forecast 2.4% for calendar 2017,
led by gains in consumer spending. We expect industrial production to decline 0.6% in calendar 2016, 120 basis points
lower than last quarter and increase 2.3% next year.
Our global GDP forecast is 2.3% for calendar 2016, 20 basis points below last quarter and calls for 2.8% growth for
calendar 2017.
Now, I will review revenue, volume and yield trends by segment. In the Express segment, U.S. domestic average daily
package volume was flat in the quarter due to decline in the deferred product category. Yield per package increased
approximately 1% year-over-year despite lower fuel surcharges.
Excluding the impact of fuel, year-over-year Express domestic package yield grew 2.3% primarily due to rate and
discounts. Revenue grew 2.1% year-over-year driven by one more operating day and yield growth. Excluding the
impact of the fuel surcharge, domestic revenue grew 3.7% year-over-year.
FedEx International Economy average daily volume grew 3.5% while FedEx International Priority average daily
volume declined 2.1%. International export revenue per package decreased 2.6% as lower fuel surcharges and
unfavorable currency exchange rates negatively impacted yields.
Excluding fuel, international export Express package yield was slightly positive primarily driven by the positive impact
of rate and discount changes which outweighed the negative impact of exchange rates.
In the Ground segment, FedEx Ground revenue increased 20% in the quarter driven by higher Ground volume and
yield and the recording of SmartPost revenues on a gross basis versus the previous net treatment. FedEx Ground
average daily volume grew 10% year-over-year in Q4, primarily driven by continued growth after peak season for both
residential and commercial deliveries. FedEx Ground revenue per package increased 7% year-over-year in Q4 due to
the recording of FedEx SmartPost revenues on a gross basis and higher base rates partially offset by lower fuel
surcharges.
Excluding the impact of fuel, Ground yield per package including SmartPost increased 8.6% year-over-year driven
primarily by extra service charges and weight per package offsetting a decrease due to SmartPost volume mix.
FedEx Freight revenue increased 2.3% as average daily shipments increased 7.5% year-over-year and revenue per
shipment declined 5.3% year-over-year. As a reminder, Q4 in FY 2016 contained one more business day than Q4 in FY
2015. The continued strength in shipment volume is driven by our sales efforts with small and medium customers and
reflects the speed, reliability and choice of Priority and Economy service for our LTL customers and we also saw
increased demand from our larger customers during the quarter.
Revenue per LTL shipment declined due to lower fuel surcharge revenue and lower weight per package. Excluding the
impact of fuel surcharge revenue, revenue per shipment was down 2.1% year-over-year due to lower weight per
shipment.
Now, I'd like to take a few minutes to further discuss and address the growth of e-commerce which continues to
outpace GDP growth both in the U.S. and globally. E-commerce has become a way of life for consumers acquiring
goods around the world, but the success of e-commerce continues to be dependent on transportation companies' ability
to reliably and quickly make residential deliveries around the world.
As we noted during our last conference call on earnings, more than 95% of e-commerce packages in the U.S. are
delivered by FedEx, UPS and the United States Postal Service with whom we have a strategic relationship to transport
their priority mail. E-commerce would be impossible without these companies and our expansive networks. If you were

to isolate the FedEx e-commerce business, it would become clear, FedEx is one of the most profitable e-commerce
companies in business today.
During the past quarter, we've made significant investments in expanding global transportation portfolio and
e-commerce capabilities around the world, including the acquisition of TNT and the introduction of FedEx
CrossBorder.
The TNT acquisition will transform the global transportation and logistics industry. It is the largest acquisition in
FedEx history and instantly accelerates our European and global growth strategy. FedEx now has a strong presence in
Europe with a range of transportation options, from Express to Economy, for both parcel and freight.
This significant enhancement to our portfolio in Europe helps not only our customers in Europe, but also provides
benefits for customers around the world shipping into Europe. In addition, we will substantially enhance our
capabilities globally by leveraging TNT's lower cost road networks in different regions around the world. While the
integration will take time to fully execute, we have the benefit of similar and complementary corporate cultures and a
common mission of providing superior service and value to customers around the world.
FedEx CrossBorder offers e-commerce technology solutions that enables e-tailers to navigate common cross-border
selling challenges such as regulatory compliance, secure payment processing, multiple currency pricing or credit card
fraud protection and also offers access to e-commerce shoppers around the world.
CrossBorder is the relaunch of Bongo International, a company FedEx acquired in 2014. When combined with our
recent GENCO acquisition, we have significantly strengthened our e-commerce portfolio of services. Of course,
demand for e-commerce increases significantly each year during the peak holiday season, we're deep into preparations
for the upcoming 2016 peak season. We're closely collaborating with large e-tail and retail customers to understand
their peak shipping needs including geographic mix and package characteristics so that we can once again have our
resources positioned and ready to provide outstanding service.
We will also be leveraging some new and evolving services to meet the heavy demand during peak including FedEx
Delivery Manager FedEx SameDay and an expansion in FedEx Hold at Location services. Delivery Manager allows
U.S. package recipients to customize home deliveries to fit their schedules including changing the time and location of
delivery, requesting a signature upon delivery or leaving instructions for the courier.
FedEx SameDay City is available in 24 markets across the country offering customers same-day service with
uniformed FedEx drivers, branded vehicles, real-time tracking and world renowned FedEx reliability. FedEx Hold at
Location offers secure package pickup at more than 2,400 FedEx locations including more than 1,800 FedEx Office
retail stores. These hold services allow customers to redirect packages for pickup and drop off at FedEx and many other
third-party locations.
One additional point is we continue to get questions concerning Amazon and the evolution of their transportation
capabilities and needs. Amazon continues to be a valuable customer and they're among the large e-tailers that we stay
in close dialog with throughout the year to understand their transportation needs as they continue to experience
significant growth and generate demand for FedEx Transportation.
Because of our close relationship with Amazon and close collaboration, we have a very clear and specific
understanding of their needs across the FedEx portfolio during FY 2017 and further we expect them to be a significant
customer for many years to come. Having said that, it is important to remember that no single FedEx customer
represents more than approximately 3% of total revenue.
Finally, I would like to mention the introduction of the new FedEx Freight box which makes transporting less than
truckload shipments simple with improved flexibility, increased security, better shipment integrity and best of all, no
freight classification.
The FedEx Freight box comes in two sizes, a standard freight box that requires a pallet to ship and a smaller freight box
with an integrated pallet. The freedom to choose your freight box makes freight shipping accessible for any business no
matter the size.

With a distance-based pricing structure, the FedEx Freight box allows you to ship LTL, avoiding the complex and
antiquated pricing structure used in the industry. The Freight box was introduced in selected markets with great success
during the second half of FY 2016, and is rolling out to customers nationwide this month.
And now, I'll turn it over to Alan Graf.
Alan B. Graf , Jr.
Thanks, Mike, for your very informative comments, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a great quarter. Adjusted
earnings of $3.30 per diluted share increased 24% year-over-year, and our adjusted consolidating operating margin
increased 11.7% versus 10.5% last year. Among the operating companies, Express was the most valuable player of the
quarter, posting an impressive double-double. Operating income was 27% higher versus last year's adjusted income,
and operating margin climbed to 11.3%.
Operating income grew at Ground as average daily volume increased 10%, and Freight's operating income was
unchanged. Profit growth at Express, despite essentially flat revenue for Q4 year-over-year, is a strong testament to
Express' continued yield and cost management efforts. Fuel did have a positive impact year-over-year on the quarter,
while currency exchange rate changes had little net impact. One additional operating day also provided a benefit.
We expect Express operating income in FY 2017 to continue to improve as we manage network capacity to match
customer demand, reduce structural costs, modernize our fleet and drive productivity increases throughout our U.S. and
international operations. These benefits will be partially offset, due to timing of aircraft maintenance events and one
fewer operating day.
The capper on our remarkable year was the acquisition of TNT Express. We had a seamless and very successful first
day when we acquired TNT on May 25, a few days before our fiscal year-end. Today is our 28th day of owning TNT.
We have a solid integration plan that we are in process of validating with live data. Our senior leadership team is in
place, and we are partnering together in the marketplace for commercial opportunities to bring the best solutions for our
customers. The transaction, financing and integration planning expenses related to this acquisition were $132 million,
or $0.45 per diluted share in FY 2016, which considers certain non-tax-deductible costs as a result of the closing of the
acquisition.
These expenses include TNT's operating results from the time of acquisition, and are predominantly included in
corporate, eliminations and others in FY 2016. In FY 2017, we will report the operating results for FedEx Express and
TNT separately in two different segments. We will also provide an overview of the FedEx Express group which
combines the two segments.
Given the timing and complexity of the acquisition, the presentation of TNT on our financial statements, including the
allocation of the purchase price, is preliminary and will likely change in future periods. We plan to complete our
purchase price allocation no later than the fourth quarter of FY 2017.
TNT operates road transportation networks and delivers documents, parcels and freight to over 200 countries. This
strategic acquisition broadens our portfolio of international transportation solutions, with the combined strength of
TNT's strong European road platform and our strength in other regions globally, including North America and Asia.
Prior to our acquisition, TNT announced its outlook strategy aimed at doubling its adjusted operating income and
margin percentage by 2018. That profit improvement program includes various initiatives focused on yield
management, operational efficiency and productivity and customer service.
We plan to continue these profit improvement initiatives in FY 2017 and will also begin activities to integrate
operations. Our focus will be on combining TNT's strong European capabilities with our strength in other regions
globally.

Although we are in the very beginning of the integration process and are continuing to validate our information, we
currently expect our FY 2017 integration CapEx for TNT to be about $100 million and integration costs to be around
$200 million. However, the timing and amount of these costs is subject to change as our plans are refined.
Integration expenses including professional fees, information technology costs and intangible asset amortization related
to TNT are expected to impact the operating income and margin during FY 2017. We are very excited about the TNT
acquisition, and we'll provide you updates on the operating results and integration costs on a quarterly basis going
forward. We do expect TNT to be accretive to earnings in FY 2018.
Turning to our Ground segment, operating income grew year-over-year due to higher volumes and increased revenue
per package as well as the benefit of one additional operating day. These factors were partially offset by higher
operating costs, including network expansion expenses. Operating margin was lower due to the change in SmartPost
revenue reporting.
We expect Ground revenues and operating income to increase in FY 2017, driven by e-commerce volume growth and
market share gains. We also anticipate continued yield growth due to yield management programs, including changes
to our pricing for larger shipments. However, we anticipate Ground operating margin will be negatively impacted by
higher operating costs in FY 2017, driven again by network expansion. Other operational costs may also impact
margins as residential volumes grow from e-commerce.
Capital expenditures at Ground are expected to be about $2 billion in FY 2017, as we continue to make investments to
grow our highly profitable network through facility expansions and equipment purchases. The impact of the
depreciation of these investments will continue to partly offset earnings growth in FY 2017 at Ground.
At Freight, operating income was unchanged, as improved operating efficiencies, higher revenue and an additional
operating day were offset by increased salaries and employee benefits expense and the impact from lower weight per
shipment. During FY 2017, we expect revenue, operating income and operating margin improvement at Freight, driven
by continued effective yield management as well as modest volume growth from small and mid-size customers. Freight
earnings growth will also be positively impacted by improvement in productivity and further investments in
technology.
We incurred a non-cash, pre-tax mark-to-market pension accounting loss of $1.5 billion in 2016. Due to its effect on
income before income taxes, the adjustment for mark-to-market accounting reduced our 2016 effective tax rate by 120
basis points. Our effective tax rate was 33.6% in fiscal 2016, which was also favorably impacted by an internal
corporate restructuring done to facilitate the integration of FedEx Express and TNT, was offset by nondeductible costs
incurred as part of the acquisition. For FY 2017, we're anticipating making contributions totaling $1.1 billion to our
U.S. pension plans.
In FY 2016, we continued to buy back shares, repurchasing $2.7 billion of our common stock through open market
purchases. From FY 2014 through FY 2016, we repurchased 63 million shares of FedEx common stock and returned
more than a $8.8 billion to shareholders at an average price of $140 per share. As of May 31, 2016, we had
approximately 19 million remaining shares authorized for repurchase. Few weeks ago, we announced that we were
boosting our dividend by 60% for a total of $0.40 per share per quarter.
Turning to our outlook, based on the outlook that Mike described from an economic standpoint and the momentum we
have, we project adjusted earnings to be $11.75 per diluted share to $12.25 per diluted share for FY 2017, excluding
TNT financial results, including integration and financing costs and year-end mark-to-market pension accounting
adjustments.
Our expectations for earnings growth in FY 2017 are dependent on key external factors, including fuel prices and
global economic conditions. Due to our recent acquisition of TNT, FY 2017 will be a year of intense integration
activities for our dedicated team at Express. We are committed to the successful integration of these two great
businesses. Meanwhile, FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight will continue to be focused on achieving their goals,
independent of the integration at Express.

Our capital expenditures are expected to be about $5.1 billion in FY 2017, excluding TNT. We anticipate that our cash
flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our increased capital expenditures in FY 2017, which will include
spending for network expansion at Ground as I discussed, and the continued aircraft fleet modernization at Express.
Our balance sheet remains strong and we are well-positioned to continue to increase corporate earnings, cash flows,
returns and margins.
And with that, we will open up for strategic questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions]
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Okay. This is Fred Smith speaking. Mickey asked me to take several of the questions
that were sent to us in advance. There were 43. There may have been one or two others that have come in on the
Internet, and Mickey will be looking at the calls coming in and we'll try to answer as many of these that we can. There
were a lot of questions in the 43 that were submitted that we won't address for one reason or another, and let me deal
with those. One, there were a number about Brexit. The reality is we don't have any better crystal ball than anybody
else, so we don't think it's appropriate for us to be speculating on what may happen in the United Kingdom. And should
Brexit take place, obviously, we'll be telling folks what we intend to do to adjust to the new situation, but it's certainly
premature.
Second, lots of questions on TNT. We'll take a number of them, but quite a few are focused on areas where it's just too
early in the process for us to deal with. For instance, what are the implications of the South American Road Network of
TNT and the Southeast Asian Road Network of TNT, and our Regional Presidents and the Express management are
working through that with the integration team, so we're going to defer those until we get a little bit further along.
Third, there are a fair number that are hypotheticals about what new services we might offer or our adjacencies, and of
course, that's not in our best interest to answer from a competitive standpoint.
So now let me get to some of them that do hit the nail on the head. With the acquisition of TNT, can you discuss major
IT requirements going forward? Specifically, are the current systems robust enough for the combined entity, and are
there any needs at the product service level? So I'm going to ask our great CIO, Rob Carter to opine on this.
<A - Rob B. Carter>: Well, thanks, Fred. Obviously, there are a lot of systems needs and integration needs that have
lined up, with regard to the TNT acquisition. This is our largest acquisition, but it's certainly not our first. We've
prepared diligently over the years with integrations of acquisitions in Mexico, Brazil, the UK, Africa, India and others
around the world to become really quite good at the process of integrating customers, integrating products into the mix.
We also have been working very hard on our systems here at FedEx to modernize and simplify them in ways that really
position them to be very effective with integration activities. That's a key design point for the systems that we've been
building and pushing forward.
And then lastly, we've had a planning and execution team on the ground with the teams. We've done very robust
planning, with regard to these integrations, including what it would take on day one, which was executed flawlessly,
what our needs are at day 100, and then as we go forward, the preferred future state of the organization and the systems
that will be needed to operate with the combined entities. So we're very confident in the systems that we have, the team
that we have and the efforts that are underway to support our customers.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Okay. Thank you, Rob. Alan, what was the primary reason for hiking the dividend?
And does this significant dividend increase indicate a shift in preference to returning capital through dividends, rather
than buybacks? And how should we think about the volume of share buybacks in the next few years, compared to FY
2014, FY 2016 levels? This question comes from Allison Landry of Credit Suisse, and I should have mentioned the
question about the IT integration was from John Barnes of RBC. Alan?

<A - Alan B. Graf , Jr.>: Allison, thanks for the question. And we've been talking about this for a number of years,
how we wanted to be more aggressive in our dividend piece of our shareholder returns, and so we picked the 60%
increase to try to get it up to a 1% or as close to a 1% yield as we could, which we think is an important milestone. I
can't make any promises for a year from now, but we'll look to continue to drive up our dividend, and we will continue
to buy back stock, and we will balance that with all of the other needs that we have for capital in the company. But we
feel that that's an important part of our shareholder returns as well.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Let me ask Dave Bronczek this question with maybe a follow up from Alan, it's also
related to TNT. How long do you think the TNT integration will take? UPS recently said they expect it would take
1,000 people five years? What is your margin outlook for the EU business longer-term? Is there a structural reason you
can't add margins similar to UPS' international business over time? What are the milestones? Well, that's our entire
business plan, but David Bronczek will give you as much of it as he can. Okay, Dave?
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Thanks for asking, and that is my business plan. Well, let me just say – and Rob Carter said
a lot of it already – we've had a team on the ground, our best of our best people in operations and sales and marketing
and IT and really across the board, and they've been working for many, many months now. And so what we are coming
away with is a company that we believe is going to be very, very strong and powerful into the mix with FedEx.
If you remember, I ran FedEx Europe for many years, and TNT was my partner over there in the outlying areas, so I
already knew that their service was good. I already knew that their culture are lined up with our culture. I was over
there on day one for the integration 28 days ago, and I can tell you that they're excited and we are excited. So going
forward, you're going to have the integration take place, that need to take place, so that we make sure we do it right,
and when we come out of the integration process, we have the most powerful service, cultural for people and profitable
business that you can have over there in Europe, and that will be the case.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: That question was from Kelly Dougherty of Macquarie, and she had a follow-up
here, before we take a call from Mickey. Can you give us a sense of what you're planning to spend in dollar and project
terms, as you invest in the TNT network?
<A - Alan B. Graf , Jr.>: Well, we – I said earlier we think about $200 million of expense – integration expense and
about $100 million of integration capital but it's very early days. Our team is extremely excited and there are a lot of
great ideas out there that look to have high returns and actually the demand probably is even higher for that, but we're
going to have to channel that so that we don't do anything too fast and have some sort of breakdown or whatever. So
we'll be gating that as we go. Again, I have a pretty good idea about the outlook on its own, about where TNT plan to
finish here through calendar 2016, but we're working right now on finalizing their plan for what the integration will do
to the outlook plan and carry it all the way through to May 31 of 2017. And so we'll be talking to you about that in the
September timeframe.
<A - Mickey Foster>: Okay. We'll now take questions, live questions, on the call.
Operator
Thank you. Our question comes from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Allison M. Landry>: Thanks. Good afternoon. I was wondering could you clarify whether directionally you
expect margin improvement at both Express and Ground in fiscal 2017 in spite of the negative impacts from the TNT
integration and the Ground network expansion costs that you highlighted?
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: This is Fred Smith. Let me take that question on a broader front because this is one
of my hot buttons as you probably know. We don't manage FedEx Corporation trying to maximize each segment
margin each year. If we did that, we would never be able to take advantage of this broad portfolio and the cross-selling
that's available to us. So sometimes, we're doing things like we're doing in Ground now, putting the SmartPost and
Ground operations together, going to six-day delivery on and on down the line, at the same time we have the winds in
our sails from the basic Express operation excluding some of the TNT issues that were just mentioned. So our

comments of improved margins and returns are at the corporate level and it would be wonderful if every year we could
have maximum margins at all of our operating companies but that's not realistic. So do you want to put any more color
on that, Alan?
<A - Alan B. Graf , Jr.>: I would say we are putting a significant amount of long-term capital into Ground. We did in
2016 and we're increasing it in 2017. That has a pretty high drag. We're also converting to – our model which also has
some drag. And we're putting in new services that take a while to roll out and develop. So I'm not going to sit and tell
you whether Ground's margin is going to go up or down because we're going to just manage to what we think the
long-term growth needs of it are here in 2017, but I'm sure that the operating income is going to go up. And to Express,
if you exclude TNT, absolutely, we're on an improved margin and operating income level and we'll again maybe talk
about that more later.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Another question.
Operator
Okay. Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom Wadewitz with UBS.
<Q - Thomas Wadewitz>: Yeah. So let's see. I think you – I know, Fred, you want to talk about the margins together,
but just going back when you -- whatever it was, I think like four years ago you said you had an Express improvement
plan. You've had a lot of great execution on that. And you talked about a $2.8 billion target, would we assume that in
fiscal 2017 you're still on track for that or would you just say don't focus on that anymore because that's not the way we
run the business going forward? You just said real optimistic comments on that in the past and kind of running ahead of
track, so I wondered if you had a brief comment on that or even a look forward going beyond $2.8 billion. Thank you.
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Hey, Tom. This is Dave Bronczek. I'll answer the question. Yes, we're very optimistic
going forward. Alan has already said it. It's in our DNA now. We've been successful with our profit improvement plan.
It continues to roll out. All five of the pillars are doing great. We beat the plan, execution a quarter earlier than we
thought and yes, it's in Alan's outlook, Express is going to continue to roll. So on the operating profit side, yes; up, on
the margin side, yes, up.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Okay. We will take another call from the live call.
Operator
Okay. Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citi.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Hey. Great. Thanks, guys. I wanted to ask about TNT and then thinking about some of the
potential opportunities for synergies. So, Alan, I know you mentioned fiscal 2018, highly accretive. When you think
about sort of where some of these opportunities are, I understand, I think, revenue getting put into the system is a big
part of it, when you think about the cost side, can you walk us through on your thoughts on where some of those targets
might be and when you might be able to get them?
<A - Alan B. Graf , Jr.>: Yeah, I said accretive in 2018, just to be sure because there may be some things that we want
to do early on in 2018 that we don't get done in 2017, but it'll be accretive in 2018, Chris. And I think, obviously, the
European road network is the gem, significantly lowering Express' costs for intercontinental pickup and delivery and
allow us to be much more competitive in Europe than we've been able to be in the past. I'm seeing, I think, in the tax
area, we're going to get some good synergies. I have no doubt about I've underestimated what we're going to get on the
sourcing side of the house, and I think we're going to see great productivity as we integrate these networks. Dave?
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Yeah, Alan is right about all of that. I've looked at it now for a lot of months, and they have
the best road network in Europe by far, and when you layer all of our international businesses around the world coming
into Europe at that efficient, productive, low-cost network and you add it to the European network on its own, all of a

sudden you start multiplying the benefits and they're very high. On top of that, we actually have a very excited sales
force between their team and our team, and we've been meeting with them. I think, we're going to see a lot of benefits
there that we actually hadn't really added into the equation yet. They're going to be coming and of course, the sourcing.
So I think on all fronts, we're going to end up with one powerhouse in Europe going forward.
Operator
Our next question is from Rob Salmon with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Robert H. Salmon>: Hey. Good evening, guys. Alan, a quick clarification with regard to the fiscal 2017
guidance. I've been getting a bunch of e-mails from clients who are, and frankly, I'm a little bit confused as well. When
you're guiding to – the current guidance, does it include the $200 million of integration costs you're expecting with
TNT?
<A - Alan B. Graf , Jr.>: The $11.75 per share to $12.25 per share is nothing from TNT.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Yeah, let me make sure you understand that comment that was just made. There's
nothing in that guidance, pro or con, from TNT. So obviously, we picked up the TNT revenues and whatever
profitability they have plus the integration expenses. That's what I meant when I started early on by saying it's very
early days with us and we'll update this in September. But I will say one thing here that it's obvious to me, looking at
some of the questions and some of the reports that have been published, there's this sort of underlying theme that TNT
is its own business and it's had these low margins, and so that's going to go forward.
The whole rationale of buying TNT, in fact, it's right in the middle of this whole e-commerce debate. In this business,
the number one item after the linehaul and upstream systems is delivery density, the cost per stop, the number of stops
per hour and so forth. So the two plus two equals seven equation, so to speak, of us buying TNT is extraordinary, and
that's why Alan says to you with such authority, as we integrate these PUD networks and take advantage of the
unmatched surface networks of TNT, there's going to be a tremendous opportunity to increase the margins and earnings
in the Express segment. So we know we're going to have about $200 million in integration expense. We can't tell you
exactly when it is, but offsetting that are going to be the TNT revenues and the profitability of their existing business on
a go-forward basis. So I hope that clarified it a bit.
Let me take another couple or three of these Internet questions submitted in advance. David Vernon of Bernstein: how
important are store replenishment activities in the FedEx portfolio of services, as e-commerce takes share from
traditional retail, is there a risk that demand for any set of services falls off in a consequential manner? Mike and
Henry, you want to comment on that?
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: Commercial ground delivery and LTL delivery to stores is an important part of our business.
I would just say and remind everyone that today e-commerce is about 10% of total retail and while growing faster than
traditional retail, traditional retail is still growing. So we don't expect any major impact in terms of our volumes going
to retail. As a matter of fact, we think there may be opportunities going forward as omni-channel plays begin to be
more prevalent and e-commerce strategy involves pickup at the store level. So, we think there's an opportunity there
and quite comfortable with our position.
<A - Henry J. Maier>: The only thing I would add is, is that historically when you get close to peak we've seen B2B
business drop off and convert mostly to B2C. Last peak because of the trend toward stores being used as e-commerce
fulfillment sites, we actually saw our commercial traffic, through the month of December, stay fairly strong.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Let me say a couple of other things which I think may be informative to the people
that are interested in this segment in FedEx. We know from research that the millennial generation, the largest
generational cohort in American history, is not going to stop going to stores. In fact, we had a wonderful presentation
about it just a couple of weeks ago at our board meeting.

So, e-commerce is fantastic and it's going to continue to grow and we intend to be a major player in that space, but as
Mike just said, it's not going to, in our opinion and in the research from very credible sources, going to eliminate retail.
What it may do is change the character of retail. And one of the things that you see happening are very focused
integrated product and store networks, two that come to mind that are just fantastically successful are ZARA, which is
a company that's located in Spain and well known for its fast cycle small shipment, replenishment of its stores. They're
able to turn on a dime with what's selling and move it around the world. And in Japan, a great company called
UNIQLO that does the same sort of thing.
So as these types of retail operations continue to proliferate there will be a fair amount of B2B business. And as Mike
said, remember, of all retail, e-commerce is now about 10%, growing fast, taking share, but it's going to be a long time
before retail is threatened. And B2B, meaning the underpinnings of the business world, medical production, automotive
and things like that, that in the main is not going to be diverted to e-commerce anytime soon and that is the backbone of
the FedEx network.
Let me take one more here while we're queuing up another call. Demand for final mile service by the USPS is
outgrowing demand for traditional package services, driven in part by the popularity of SmartPost. Does FedEx see any
risk or opportunities associated with the USPS' ability to invest and keep pace with that demand? Mike, Henry, you
want to take that one?
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: Well, clearly, the U.S. Postal Service could face some challenges going forward with
dramatic growth of e-commerce and we won't speculate on how they deal with that, but we see e-commerce as a
tremendous opportunity. At some point, it may make more sense for us to deliver a lot of the SmartPost packages in our
network, as Henry has talked about. We certainly have the technological capability to do that and when we do that our
cost goes down. So we think we're pretty well prepared.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Alan, what level of debt capital or debt to EBITDA should we be thinking about
over the long-term for the company? And there are a number of questions about future CapEx, so let me just lump all
that together into a balance sheet question for you?
<A - Alan B. Graf , Jr.>: Well, balance sheet is strong. Our credit metrics are, I think, [ph] that were (48:13)
accompanied with the growth opportunities that we have need to be, and we intend to work on improving those over
the next 24 months. So I think, I've been in financial markets from a debt standpoint a lot in the last couple of years,
and we'll probably take a little break on that because as I said, we think – well, we know we have the cash flow
coverage for what we're trying to do.
So going forward, we've always said we're a capital intensive, growing transportation company. We think the sweet
spot for CapEx is 6% to 8% of revenue. Next couple of years, we're going to be above that basically because we're
re-fleeting, we're expanding Ground as rapidly as we can, as efficiently as we can, and we've got the TNT integration to
put together. But having said that, it's very manageable what's in front of us.
As I said, we are going to continue to increase earnings, cash flows, returns and margins, and we have been improving
our ROICs, and we've been definitely improving our return on equity. But at the end of the day, that's not the most
important metric. The most important metric is shareholder return. So over the last five years, we have had a share
price return of 88%, which is a CAGR of a little bit over 14.1%. That compares to 53% for UPS, 63% for S&P 500 and
47.5% for the Dow Jones Transports. That's the number that's most important for our shareholders, and the same goes
for total return. And when you want to go back longer term, last 15 years, our total return to shareholders have been
377.6%, UPS has been 170%. So while ROIC and ROE are nice metrics, they don't win the ballgame.
Operator
All right. And our next question is from Jack Atkins from Stephens.
<Q - Jack Atkins>: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for the time. Just a couple of things here on the Ground side.
The $2 billion in CapEx in FY 2017, would you characterize that as sort of peak CapEx for the Ground segment this

cycle? And if not, how should we think about that? And then could you give us an update on the integration of
SmartPost into Ground? What major milestones have been achieved there so far? And sort of what additional items do
you expect to accomplish in FY 2017?
<A - Henry J. Maier>: Well, let me just say this, Jack. We think that FY 2017, this should be the peak. It's not going
to drop much off of this going forward based on the growth we're seeing and the expansion we have planned. And I'd
like to remind everybody that our volume grew 10% year-over-year, and on an average daily volume basis, our volume
has doubled over the last 10 years. So you have to expend CapEx to build the capacity you need just to run the business
day-to-day here.
On the SmartPost side, we're well along. We haven't integrated all the facilities yet, and that's largely due to the fact
that the growth in that service has been such that we've been a little bit constrained by Ground capacity and being able
to move more volume into the network. But the two big IT events; the first occurred in January, which has allowed us
to begin manually matching addresses on packages, and moving them into the Ground network for final delivery, and
then the next big event will come next summer where virtually we can have the system match addresses and move
them. And as I've explained in the past, you move a SmartPost package into the ground network, you can deliver that
incremental package for roughly 25% of the postage as opposed to tendering it to the USPS. So we're pretty excited
about that, and we're looking forward to getting this thing behind us.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Nate Brochmann with William Blair.
<Q - Nate J. Brochmann>: Good evening, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask a little bit more
on the TNT, and this a little bit longer term, but obviously you spend a lot of time on your people and your leadership
teams. How do you manage that and kind of integrate those teams together and take the best in breed, and strategically
make sure that nothing gets kind of lost throughout this whole integration, particularly on the customer and the service
side?
<A - David J. Bronczek>: That was a great question, and I just came back from Amsterdam, and I can tell you that
we've already announced to our team at FedEx Express and the TNT folks as well, we have announced several Senior
Vice Presidents in our new organization that came from TNT. The head of customer service for all of our organization
came from TNT. Some of their leaders in sales as it will be our new team, are from TNT, integrated with our folks.
Their culture is very, very similar to ours. I can tell you that they're excited about joining our team and our culture,
however, because we're more global than them, of course.
So I think you're already seeing – and I was told first-hand by all the people that I met with over there which was
thousands of people, how thankful they were that we were integrating their people with our people. It should be also
said that that is the history of FedEx across the board. We've done it in every acquisition. We did it at Flying Tigers,
Caliber and on and on. So they already kind of knew that, but now they know it for sure.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Dave, for you and Mike Glynn. How quickly will the TNT name go away so the
entire international parcel and freight network is branded as FedEx? That's from David Ross at Stifel.
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: Let me take a shot at that first. This is Mike Glynn. I want to remind everybody that when
we acquired Caliber Systems, we actually operated RPS as RPS for about 18 months to 2 years. We did that because
we wanted to make sure that the service that we were providing and the level of integration was consistent with the
FedEx brand.
We've got a very detailed brand plan that is part of our integration efforts with TNT. There are certain countries where
the TNT brand is quite strong and actually has a higher level of awareness than the FedEx brand. There are other
countries where the FedEx brand is stronger. There are countries where they're approximately the same. And we have a
brand transition scenario for all three of those. So it will take us some time, but we're going to follow what we know
works and that is be patient to make sure that we make these changes at the right time because candidly we want to

leverage the strength of the TNT brand during the integration.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: And, Mike, as long as we've got you at the mic, David Ross also wants to know
besides FedEx Office locations, is FedEx expanding its pick-up, drop-off presence in the United States; and if so, how?
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: The answer to the question is yes, we continue to expand our FedEx Office locations through
hotel and convention service opportunities, site-specific logistics opportunities. We also are expanding through our
FedEx authorized ship center network. In addition to that, we leverage third-party opportunities such as office
superstores. So we're continuing to focus on that as we know that's going to be a critical part of e-commerce going
forward.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Here's a question, which issues most concern FedEx in the coming election?
I would say we would have a hard time putting up a list of the things that don't concern us, giving the two candidates'
position. But obviously, we're concerned about the anti-trade rhetoric, a lot of the anti-business positions and it's very
worrisome. But hopefully, after the election, cooler heads will prevail. There are a lot of things that need to be
addressed. We've talked about it many times. I mean, China has been quite mercantilist in its trade policies. But the
way to deal with that is to negotiate with China and not to threaten them or take all of the huge benefits of trade and
throw them away.
We have thousands and tens of thousands of highly compensated people working for FedEx in the United States that
are involved in trade; pilots, mechanics, customs clearance people, pick-up and delivery personnel. That's the story that
never gets told when the tragedy of a local plant closing gets put on the TV. So I'd be happy to debate the mass benefits
of global trade with anybody that wants to do it. But we're very concerned about the positions of both parties and trade
in particular.
Operator
Would you like to take a question from the phone?
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Yes.
Operator
Okay. Thank you. Our next question is from Helane Becker with Cowen. And, Helane, if you could please check your
mute function. It looks like Helane must have stepped away. So next we have David Ross with Stifel Nicolaus.
<Q - David Ross>: Yes. Good afternoon, everyone. This question is for Mike Ducker. On the LTL side, I wanted to
know why yield and revenue per shipment on the Economy shipments are 27% higher than those on Priority
shipments? One would think that the Priority would be a more expensive or higher revenue than the Economy?
<A - Michael L. Ducker>: David, this should be the last quarter that you have to deal with that. Frankly, that is a
change in reporting that we made when we took spot shipments out of Priority and put them into the Economy bucket
and that should normalize next quarter. So that was done last June.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: I have an Internet question from Ravi Shanker about LTL, would throw in here as
long as Mike is answering questions. How would you characterize the LTL environment especially in terms of pricing
and competitive actions?
<A - Michael L. Ducker>: Right now, I don't think it's any secret, we're not trading in a very robust market. Industry
shipments have been somewhat sluggish this year. However, I would characterize it as very competitive market, but
rational and that's how I would characterize it.

<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: And from Kevin Sterling with BB&T, what benefit are you seeing in LTL from the
48-inch odd freight surcharge?
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: This is Mike Glenn. As you know we just implemented that change June 1, so we're only a
few weeks into that. It's premature to comment on any potential benefits and in fact we actually don't expect to see a lot
of benefits. We expect those shipments with those characteristics to continue to move, primarily in the Ground network
although there could be a few that move over to LTL.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: And, Mike, Kevin also wants to know about Walmart now offering a two-day
subscription service for free shipping similar to Amazon Prime. Walmart is going to use more regional carriers for last
mile delivery. If other retailers follow suit to keep up with Amazon, how will this impact FedEx?
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: Well, first, let me say Walmart has been a long time and growing customer. We've been
business partners with Walmart for many, many years and named Carrier of the Year on a consistent basis and I think
they clearly value the service that we provide. And so I expect those trends to continue in terms of our growth with
Walmart going forward. Regarding regional carriers, I mean the fact of the matter is regional carriers simply don't have
the scope and the scale to be able to compete with the networks that make up 95% of the e-commerce shipments in the
U.S. And as I said before that would be FedEx, UPS and the United States Postal Service. So certainly, there's a role for
regional carriers, but they cannot compete, in our opinion, with FedEx over the long haul.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: There's a question from Helane Becker who wasn't on the phone but he's here in
spirit with her Internet question. Helane is an old friend and I hope she's out having a Cabernet or something, but she
asked an important question. Is cost of converting options to firm orders for the six 767 freighters announced recently
including in CapEx guidance?
It is and I think it's important because there have been several things that have been printed about this which indicate a
lack of clarity out there about this. When Dave and his team did the deal with the Boeing on the 767s, it called for 10
firm airplanes per year over a number of years to a total of 50. And then there were options with given dates and these
six aircraft were the first options that became due and they are for delivery in fiscal year 2019 and 2020. The next
options are not due until June of calendar year 2018 when Express will decide whether it wants to exercise a tranche of
six and then the next one after that is June 19 with a tranche of six. But the basic deal is, we have 10 firm airplanes per
year and the ability to go up to 16 airplanes. Now, it's a little more complicated than that in the out years, but Dave do
you want to add anything on this?
<A - David J. Bronczek>: No, that's exactly right, Fred. The only thing I'd add is that we're not adding capacity. And I
think that's an important point. We're replacing the older planes that have less fuel efficiency and higher maintenance
costs with these new, more modern, better planes. So they're not adding any capacity, just replacing.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: There is a question that's an important issue, also from Ravi Shanker of Morgan
Stanley, which Henry or Mike should answer. Oversize packages. Last quarter, you noted that the oversize packages
are hurting your margins and you've been able to raise prices to offset productivity loss. How have your customers
reacted to your adjustments to handling surcharge policy since June 1?
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: This is Mike Glenn. We've made a number of pricing changes targeting this specific area,
starting with the change in unauthorized package charge, which is packages that are oversize, and outside the
characteristics of the Ground network and which we can handle at our discretion, we increased the surcharge there. We
actually increased the surcharge on oversize packages.
As noted, effective June 1, we increased surcharge on additional handling packages, additional handling surcharge
changing the dimensions – the length dimension, from 60 inches to 48 inches, and we're considering other options that
would be appropriate for that space. Having said that, that business continues to be robust and a growing business, and
an important part of the e-commerce growth going forward. There are plenty of stories of companies out there that are
being successful in non-traditional e-commerce retail segments, which would be packages that are typically larger, like
mattresses and other things like that. And so we're happy to handle that, but we expect to be compensated for the
service that we provide.

<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Question from Bascome Majors of Susquehanna. Long question, but to net it down,
do you think it's feasible for someone to build an efficient, national parcel network that combines in-house, air and
truck linehaul between regions, but outsources the costly last mile delivery to either the U.S. Postal Service or the
low-cost regional local carriers? Is that a competitive threat that concerns you?
The answer to that is no, and the reason for that is that the upstream infrastructure to do that is enormous. I wish I could
have a film or something to show you these facilities. Henry has got how many hubs with the new opening this year,
Henry, 30?
<A - Henry J. Maier>: Yeah. [indiscernible] (1:06:04)
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Yeah, but total. What does that give you?
<A - Henry J. Maier>: 37.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: 37 hubs. I mean, the size of these things are 250 acres to 300 acres. They handle tens
of thousands of packages. The miles driven by FedEx Ground per year is 1.2 billion miles and Freight is in the same
capacity level. So these upstream motes are very substantial, and actually the last mile is the easiest thing to do if you
don't have any upstream infrastructure. The problem there is that you cut yourself off from the tens of millions or
billions of potential other shippers from every other part of the world that can be co-mingled to lower stop costs by
having more stops per hour, or more deliveries per stop. And that's the thing that we've been consistently saying. I used
the word fantastical, if you'll recall, because all of these analyses are either unmindful of that, or they make
assumptions that are erroneous when you actually understand what the real world numbers are.
Let me just give you one statistic. I don't mean to impeach any one entity, but there have been several analyst reports
that have come out and said, well, 767 airplanes can carry 120,000 pounds, and so the calculations are done on that.
The maximum cubic revenue payload of a 767, and we're pretty damn good at this, is far less than 120,000 pounds.
And if you load it up with just pallets, you're probably talking about two-thirds of that, if that. The airport locations to
process these things and the containers, they're more difficult than the airplanes by far. So I use this opportunity –
thanks for the question, Bascome – but, again, to point out some of the analyses that's being done that's not in
accordance with the facts on the ground, literally and figuratively.

Would you like to take a question from the phone?
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Yeah.
Operator
All right. We have a question from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.
<Q - Daniel Hultberg>: Good afternoon. This is Daniel Hultberg on for Scott. Thanks for the time. Could you discuss
the operating efficiencies in Freight in the quarter? Elaborate on that and what you expect going forward?
<A - Michael L. Ducker>: Sorry. Yes. Frankly, earnings stayed flat. We had good revenue growth, but we were
impacted from a well-deserved pay increase and also some benefits from last year. Our expectation is double-digit
margins at the Freight company going forward. We will achieve that through balanced yields and volume growth as
well as adding technology into our network for the future.

Thank you.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: We have a couple of questions. We have a live one here? Go ahead.
Operator
Yes, thank you. Our next question comes from Kelly Dougherty with Macquarie.
<Q - Kelly Dougherty>: Hey. Thanks for taking the question. I just want a one quick clarification on TNT and then a
question on capital intensity. And sorry to keep beating a dead horse here, but after your roll in the revenue and
expected profitability from TNT offset that with the integration costs plus any financing, TNT net is likely to be
modestly dilutive in 2017 and then accretive in 2018. Is that kind of the bottom line way to think about all of those
different moving parts?
<A - Alan B. Graf , Jr.>: We haven't told you about 2017, Kelly. Nice try. I said I would come back in September and
it will be accretive in 2018.
Operator
Thank you. We have a question from Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Kenneth Scott Hoexter>: Great. Good evening. Just on the Ground side, are we seeing a swap from the deferred
at Express over to Ground? And can you talk – if we're seeing that double-digit growth, can you talk about the
opportunity for additional cost efficiencies at Ground to improve the margins there?
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: Yeah, this is Mike Glenn. Let me comment on the Express deferred numbers. What we saw
during the quarter was a shift in mix from deferred actually to overnight from a couple of large customers and we also
had a couple of releases last year which impacted the quarter. So the numbers were skewed a bit. It's not an issue where
we're seeing Express business trade down to Ground.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.
<Q - Brandon Oglenski>: Yeah, thank you for taking my question here. So, Alan, you talked about TSR and I think a
lot of people on this call are very interested in keeping FedEx TSR high going forward, but CapEx, cash flow returns
are all interlinked here. I guess, as we look forward in e-commerce world, is it just that the value proposition for
package delivery keeps this business in a low teens margin environment with a lot of capital intensity or now that
you're closer to $60 billion global organization, you're one of the largest transportation companies in the world. Is there
a significant ability looking forward that you can really leverage the capital base to generate more consistent free cash
flow and really get an equity valuation that the market would be willing to mark much closer to some of the quality
industrial stocks that are out there that are similar size?
<A - Alan B. Graf , Jr.>: You mean do better than the [ph] $5 billion and $15 billion (1:12:11) numbers I just gave
you which are already pretty good. We make these capital investments for the long-term. And I think our cash flow and
EBITDA are fabulous and they're growing great and they're going to continue to grow great, but we are aggressive. I
mean, when you buy TNT and you spend $5 billion capital in the same year and you buy back a bunch of stock that's
aggressive. So the confidence that we have in the markets going forward and our ability to continue to improve our
margins I'm not concerned about being stagnant or just staying in low numbers. We want to exceed those and give
Express a couple more years with TNT under their belt and stand back.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Hartford with Baird
<Q - Ben J. Hartford>: Yeah, thanks. I guess, Alan, to that point, on the dividend, obviously, a big hike recently. Is
this now roughly 1% annual yield, is this representative – is this a representative target for you and the company? Or do
you still intend to move that dividend yield higher over time?
<A - Alan B. Graf , Jr.>: Well, that would be my preference, but I have a Board of Directors who has got a lot of
things to balance and decisions to make but we've been very consistent over the last number of years in our June
meeting of raising our dividend. And so I would expect you could see us continuing to do that. I can't tell you exactly
how much, but it'll be the objective. And, again, with the reduced number of shares since we bought so many back,
when the scheme of our cash flows, the dividend actually is kind of, on page three in terms of its impact to our overall
cash flows and spending.
Operator
And that does conclude our question and answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Foster
for closing remarks.
Mickey Foster
Thank you for your participation in our conference call today. Feel free to call anyone on the Investor Relations team if
