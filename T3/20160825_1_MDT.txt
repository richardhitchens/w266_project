MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Jackie and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome
everyone to the Medtronic First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now
like to turn the conference over to Ryan Weispfenning. Please go ahead.
Ryan Weispfenning
Great. Thank you, Jackie. Good morning, and welcome to Medtronic's First Quarter Conference Call and Webcast.
During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic
Chief Financial Officer, will provide comments on the results of our fiscal year 2017 first quarter, which ended on July
29, 2016. After our prepared remarks, we will be happy to take your questions.
First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning we issued a press release containing our financial statements and
a revenue-by-division summary. We also issued an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our
performance and outlook. You should note that many of the statements made during this call may be considered
forward-looking statements and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking
statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our
periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC, and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking
statement.
In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available our website,
investorrelations.medtronic.com. Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are
in comparison to the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, and all year-over-year growth ranges are given on a constant

currency and constant weeks basis which adjusts for the negative effective of foreign currency translation and the extra
week that was in our prior year first quarter.
As previously disclosed, we estimate the extra week had an approximate $450 million impact on revenue and $0.08 to
$0.10 impact to earnings per share. The extra week impact for each business or region was estimated by adjusting Q1
FY 2016 revenue by the prorated total company impact. The constant currency adjustment details can be found in the
reconciliation tables included with our earnings press release.
With that, I am now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak.
Omar S. Ishrak
Good morning, and thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone for joining us. This morning we reported first quarter
revenue of $7.2 billion and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.03, representing another quarter of strong top
and bottom line growth. All our business groups and regions delivered strong growth resulting in company-wide
revenue growth over 5%. In addition, our continued focus on both the operating and financial leverage drove solid
double digit EPS growth and strong cash flow generation as we continue to strategically deploy our capital against our
priorities of reinvesting with discipline in M&A and R&D, returning substantial cash to our shareholders, and
deleveraging our balance sheet. We feel very good about our momentum to start our fiscal year and we are confident in
our ability to sustain this performance over the coming quarters.
Now let's turn to the drivers of our revenue growth. We have three specific growth priorities stemming from our overall
strategies: new therapies, emerging markets, and services and solutions, with quantified growth expectations for each.
In new therapies we delivered results at the upper end of our goal in Q1, contributing over 300 basis points to our total
company growth.
In our Cardiac and Vascular Group, which grew in the mid single digits, we continue to complement our steady
cadence of differentiated products with market-leading breadth, scale and technology innovation. In CRHF, our AF
Solutions and diagnostic businesses again delivered impressive growth. AF Solutions grew in the mid-30s, well above
market growth on the strength of Arctic Front Advance cryoballoon and our recent FIRE AND ICE clinical data.
In diagnostics, which grew in the low double digits, market acceptance of our Reveal LINQ insertable loop recorder
had strong momentum resulting in increased pacemaker pull through. In our core CRHF and particles business,
revenues were flat in a global market that in our estimation was down in the low single digits. In the U.S., low single
digit growth in initial implants as well as our share gains in high-power implants offset mid single digit declines in
device replacements.
We continue to take share in the U.S. with MRI safe systems and our recently launched Visia AF ICD. In Q1, we
started shipments for our Micra transcatheter pacing system, the world's smallest pacemaker at one-tenth the size of a
traditional device. Concurrently, we initiated physician training in the U.S. and we look forward to obtaining a national
coverage decision from CMS for this transformative therapy by the end of the fiscal year.
We also look forward to a number of new product launch catalysts over the balance of the fiscal year, including Claria
MRI CRT-D system with effective CRT pacing in the U.S. and Japan; Visia AF in Japan; Reveal LINQ in Japan; and
our CRT-P quadrupolar pacing system in Europe. We closed our acquisition of HeartWare earlier this week, a leading
innovator of miniaturized circulatory support technologies for the treatment of advanced heart failure. We are pleased
to now significantly broaden our range of therapeutic options for heart failure patients with the addition of HeartWare,
and we expect it to add meaningful revenue growth to CVG throughout the balance of the fiscal year and beyond.
Not only do we have complementary technologies and service capabilities, including infection control, physiological
sensors and algorithms, remote patient monitoring and patient management and integrated diagnostics, but we also
have experience with rechargeable battery technology and implantable controllers that can accelerate the development
of a reliable, fully-implantable LVAD systems.

In CSH, our Resolute Onyx DES and Euphora balloons are driving solid mid single digit international growth in our
coronary business, but we experienced declines in the U.S. from competitive product launches. We anticipate FDA
approval and market release of Resolute Onyx in the U.S. around the end of FY 2017. In structural heart, the global
TAVR market is robust, growing 40%. We continue to gain share in international markets with our CoreValve and
CoreValve Evolut R valves. However, the lack of a large size Evolut R is limiting our share in the U.S. market. We
expect approval of our Evolut R XL valve early in the calendar year 2017.
Earlier this month, Evolut R was the first system to be granted CE mark for intermediate risk patients and we are on
track to submit our SURTAVI data for U.S. intermediate risk indication expansion approval in Q4 this fiscal year.
In APV, we had strong high single digit growth in our aortic business with Endurant IIs aortic-stent stent graft, Heli-FX
EndoAnchor System and Valiant Captivia thoracic stent graft technologies all fueling growth. In our peripheral
business, growth was driven by IN.PACT Admiral DCB, which continues to outpace and lead the fast-growing
drug-coated balloon market on the strength of its handling characteristics and differentiated clinical data.
Our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group grew in the mid single digits, with consistent quarterly performance
stemming from five key growth drivers: open to minimally invasive surgery or MIS, gastrointestinal diseases, lung
cancer, end stage renal disease and respiratory compromise. Open to MIS grew in the high single digits in Q1, driven
by the recent product introductions in our advanced energy portfolio like the Valleylab FT10 energy platform, as well
as the continued adoption of Endo GIA reloads with tri-staple technology portfolio, specifically the Endo GIA
reinforced reloads.
GI diseases and lung cancer also grew in the high single digits, with solid growth in our GI solutions business, resulting
from the continued launch of the Barrx 360 Express RF ablation balloon catheter. Our focus on end-stage renal disease
is benefiting from the fiscal Q4 acquisition of Belco, a pioneer in hemodialysis treatment solutions. Respiratory
compromise grew in the low double digits. We were pleased to return both the Puritan Bennett 980 Ventilator and the
Capnostream 20-patient monitor to customers and patients following ship holds that were put in place last fiscal year.
We continue to supplement MITG with tuck-in acquisitions. Earlier this month, we closed on the acquisition of Smith
& Nephew's fast-growing gynecology business, a good complement to our existing global GYN product line. We also
closed on our agreement to acquire a majority ownership position in the Netherlands obesity clinic, or NOK, which I
will cover in more detail later.
Across MITG, we're developing solutions to expand the entire care continuum, aspiring to enable earlier diagnosis,
better treatment, faster complication-free recovery and enhanced patient outcomes through less invasive solutions.
In our Restorative Therapies Group, we are reinvigorating therapy innovation across all five disease-focused
businesses, delivering a consistent cadence of solutions across the patient care continuum, resulting in mid single digit
growth this quarter. In Spine, we grew in line with the market with mid single growth in the U.S., offsetting an
international decline. Outside the U.S., we were mainly affected by the macroeconomic challenges in the Middle East,
where we have strong market share and where the continued ship hold on BMP in Europe, which we believe should be
resolved by the end of the fiscal year.
In the U.S., we continue on an upward trajectory, delivering another quarter of sequential improvement in our growth
rate. Our speed-to-scale strategy is producing tangible results as we launch a steady cadence of procedural innovation
like our OLIF procedure and new products including the SOLERA, VOYAGER, Elevate and PTC Interbodys for
key-lift and mid-lift procedures.
Last month we obtained two-level FDA approval for our Prestige LP, which we expect will help drive adoption of
cervical disc autoplasty procedures in the U.S. In addition to speed-to-scale our focus in surgical synergy, which
combines enabling technology with our spine implants to deliver integrated procedural solutions is starting to show
results. In fact, the combined growth of our spine business and our spine imaging and navigation capital equipment in
our neurosurgery business was in the high single digits in the U.S. in Q1.

We believe this is an indication of our overall growth in spine procedures and a more relevant comparison of our spine
results against several of our competitors. We're also excited about our partnership with Mazor Robotics, which is
generating significant surgeon interest. And together, we are set to introduce the Mazor X at mass later this year.
All our businesses in our Brain Therapies division delivered a strong quarter. In neurovascular, our Solitaire FR
mechanical thrombectomy device is delivering strong results, even after the anniversary of The New England Journal
of Medicine articles last year, solidifying our leadership position in a rapidly expanding ischemic stroke market. In
brain modulation, our DBS products had a solid quarter and we just received CE mark for SureTune2, which provides
patient-specific visualization to aid in DBS programming. In neurosurgery, we saw robust sales of the recently
launched O-arm O2 surgical imaging system, as well the StealthStation S7 surgical navigation system.
While our Pain Therapies division declined in the low single digits to continued competitive pressure in our spinal cord
simulation products, our drug pumps grew in the mid single digits. Our interventional business showed continued
strength, growing in the low single digits with our OsteoCool RF spinal tumor ablation system, driving solid growth
and generating pull through off our balloon kyphoplasty products. And all of our business in our Specialty Therapies
division, ENT, pelvic health and advanced energy collectively grew in the low double digits.
Turning now to our Diabetes Group. We delivered high single digit growth in the quarter with a solid growth in our
intensive insulin management division, driven by strong adoption of our MiniMed 640G system outside the U.S. While
the U.S. market remains competitive, we were pleased to receive FDA approval for our MiniMed 630G earlier this
month and we expect to see strong U.S. growth with this platform, just like we've seen with the 640G outside the U.S.
The 630G features a new contemporary pump hardware platform, including a waterproof case, HD full-color stream,
and remote bolus capability directly from the meter, along with several enhancements to our Enlite sensor. The new
platform also integrates continuous glucose monitoring with SmartGuard technology, which is the only technology
available in the U.S. that not only takes specific action against loads, but also reduces the frequency of nighttime low
episodes by a third.
In addition to our current offerings, we submitted the PMA for our hybrid close loop system with the Enlite 3 CGM
sensor to the FDA in June of this year. In our Non-Intensive Diabetes Therapy division, we saw another quarter of very
strong growth as we continue to promote our iPro 2 Professional CGM system to Type 2 patients being cared for by
primary care physicians through our partnership with Henry Schein. Our NDT pipeline is centered on a steady cadence
of product applications and informatics innovation to enable primary care physicians and patients to make better, more
informed choices in the management of Type 2 diabetes.
In our Diabetes Services and Solutions division, we saw solid growth from both our Consumables business and from
Diabeter, which I will cover in a moment. We are excited about the recent CE mark approval for our Guardian Connect
standalone CGM system with our current enhanced Enlite sensor, and expect initial product availability in fiscal Q3.
In the U.S., we have submitted our PMA application to the FDA earlier this year and expect to launch Guardian
Connect together with the next-generation sensor in the second half of this fiscal year. Guardian Connect allows us to
provide both Type 1 and Type 2 patients multiple daily injections with a standalone real-time glucose monitoring
solution. We also continue to make strong progress with our partnership with IBM and remain on track to launch our
SUGAR.IQ personal diabetes assistant powered by Watson in the next few months. When you combine our diabetes
devices with our applications in cognitive computing capabilities that we will bring to our partnership with IBM, we
expect to provide both Type 1 and Type 2 patients with not just a sensor but a comprehensive diabetes management
solution.
Across all four or five groups, CVG, MITG, RTG and Diabetes, our new product pipeline is robust and we are
confident we can drive sustainable growth for or our new therapy's growth factor within a 200-basis-point to
350-basis-point goal.
Next let's turn to emerging markets, which delivered double digit growth contributing over 150 basis points to our total
company growth, in line with our expectations. We continued to execute against our strategies of channel optimization,
government agreements and private partnerships. We feel that these initiatives have the ability to accelerate growth and

lead to sustained market outperformance.
In Q1, our businesses in South Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe and China all grew in the mid-teens or higher. In
China, our largest emerging market, we continued to outperform the overall market with our unit growth rates from all
four of our business groups growing in the mid-teens. Latin America also had strong, broad-based growth across our
major markets: Brazil, Columbia, Mexico, Chile and Argentina. Brazil was particularly strong from both recent
distributor conversions and solid product growth in MITG. In South Asia, of which India is the largest market, we
achieved low 20%s growth with all of our groups delivering double digit growth.
We won important tenders in several product categories and are engaged in multiple private – public partnership
opportunities across India. The only region with pressure in emerging markets in Q1 was the Middle East and Africa,
where we had declines in Saudi Arabia as a result of the macroeconomic environment in that country that is causing
government budget controls, product license delays and tender delays. Overall, however, the consistency of our
emerging market performance benefits strongly from increased geographic diversification, reducing dependence on any
single market. We continue to believe strongly that the penetration of existing therapies into emerging markets
represents the single largest opportunity in Med Tech over the long term.
Turning now to our services and solutions growth factor, which contributed approximately 30 basis points to Medtronic
growth. While this overall result was below our goal of 40 basis points to 60 basis points, services and solutions
continues to achieve strong revenue growth, mostly from CVG-related offerings. We expect to further improve our
growth contribution as this model has expanded across all our business groups. We continue to see success in our
Hospital Solutions business, through which we provide expertise and operational efficiency as well as daily
administrative management of hospital cath labs and operating room.
In Q1, our service revenue growth from hospital solutions was in the mid-40%s. We have now completed a total of 97
long-term managed service agreements with hospital systems, representing more than $2.1 billion in contracted service
and product revenue over an average span of six years. While the majority of our activity is in Europe, we continue to
expand into other regions, including Latin America and the Middle East and Africa.
Our Tier Management Services business, which is primarily focused on remote monitoring of high-cost and chronic
disease patients with co-morbidities, grew in the high single digits in Q1, driven by strong interest and growth from
pairs, as well as providers moving towards value-based care models. Care management services represents an
important platform for us, especially as post-acute care services become even more critical in bundled payment models
for different interventions.
We are now also managing chronic conditions in diabetes and obesity through our acquisition of Diabeter and majority
stake in NOK. Diabeter, our holistic diabetes care management organization that is currently operating four centers in
the Netherlands delivered revenue growth over 50% in Q1 and we are now treating over 1,700 patients. We are
currently developing plans to expand the Diabeter model into other countries.
NOK, the chain of clinics in the Netherlands for morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery offering an
integrated Comprehensive Care model including extensive screening, pre-care program, bariatric surgery, post-surgery
program and long-term follow-up. We plan to gain critical insights from NOK's methodology and expand into more
countries providing broader patient access to their multidisciplinary teams of specialists, thereby improving patient
outcomes. We expect all of these new businesses will start to contribute significantly to the services and solutions
growth factor, moving it to our expected range over the next few quarters.
Turning now to our Q1 P&L. We grew revenue more than 5% and non-GAAP diluted EPS approximately 14% to 16%,
which resulted in EPS leverage of approximately 1,000 basis points. Our strong revenue growth and high profitability
is generating significant accessible free cash flow and we remain committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our
adjusted free cash flow through dividends and share repurchases.
Before turning the call over to Karen, I'd like to note that we continue to refine our thinking on value-based healthcare
solutions. As you know, CMS in the U.S. is shifting payments for certain episodes of care for fee-for-service to bundle
payments over a longer time horizon. Our recently formed Orthopedic Solutions business continues to refine together

with our surgeon partners, our compelling comprehensive solution for CMS's first episodic bundle in joint replacement.
Last month, CMS announced their plans to expand bundle payments beyond hips and knees to MI and established
procedures where we have significant market presence and clinical expertise. We are analyzing the details of these
proposed bundles and intend to submit our comments to CMS as we move toward the expected finalization of these
payment models.
While we are still early in the journey to value-based healthcare, we remain focused and fully understanding in leading
the shift to healthcare systems that reward value and patient outcomes over volume. And we continue to develop
partnerships and insights into how we can utilize our expertise to play a role in this evolution. We feel the appropriate
application of medical technology can help address inefficiencies and improve outcomes in healthcare delivery, driving
new forms of value creation for both our customers and our shareholders.
With that, I will now turn the call over to our new CFO, Karen Parkhill, who I'm pleased to welcome to Medtronic.
And she will take you through a more detailed look at our first quarter financial results. Karen?
Karen L. Parkhill
Thank you, Omar. Our first quarter revenue of $7.166 billion decreased 1% as reported or increased over 5% on a
constant currency, constant week basis. Foreign currency had a negative $7 million impact on first quarter revenue and
acquisitions and divestitures contributed approximately a net 70 basis points to revenue growth. GAAP diluted earnings
per share were $0.66, non-GAAP was $1.03.
After adjusting for the $0.04 impact from foreign currency translation and the $0.08 to $0.10 estimated impact from the
extra week last fiscal year, non-GAAP diluted EPS grew approximately 14% to 16%. EPS came in slightly above our
expectations due to a $0.01 to $0.02 tax benefit.
In addition to the $376 million after-tax adjustment for amortization expense, non-GAAP adjustments to earnings on an
after-tax basis were a $79 million net restructuring charge and a $39 million charge for acquisition-related items, both
stemming mostly from our continued integration of Covidien. A $52 million litigation charge and a $31 million net
benefit related to the resolution of several tax matters with the IRS including a benefit from our Tyco tax issue and a
charge for a proposed agreement resolving matters stemming from several acquisitions. The net tax benefit does not
include any impact related to our Puerto Rico royalty rate dispute with the IRS which has not yet been resolved.
[audio gap] (24:38) with 27.4% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for the extra week, the operating margin
showed an approximate 100 basis point improvement over the prior year. Our operating margin included a gross
margin of 68.9%, SG&A of 34% and R&D of 7.8%, all on a constant currency basis. While our gross margin was down
slightly mainly due to revenue mix, we drove improvement in SG&A, largely a result of execution on our Covidien
synergies.
We are pleased with the smooth completion of our SAP implementation in Europe in the first quarter and will continue
with implementations across other regions over the next several quarters. Separately and collectively, these conversions
help drive future synergies. We remain on track to deliver $225 million to $250 million of synergy savings this fiscal
year and expect to deliver on our commitment of $850 million of savings by the end of fiscal year 2018. Our efforts to
realize the Covidien synergies are also serving as enablers to catalyze other leverage programs designed to deliver
additional long-term margin expansion.
Looking ahead at our operating margin, keep in mind that recent acquisitions including HeartWare, while not expected
to be dilutive to EPS on a net basis, could impact the operating margin percentage by an estimated 25 basis points in
the second quarter and 35 basis points for the full year. However, we remain committed to our plans to generate 130 to
210 basis points of improvement in our operating margin this fiscal year as outlined at our Investor Day.
When we take into account currency, it is also worth noting that net other expense of $39 million, which is included in
the operating margin, reflects about $55 million in reduced foreign exchange gains versus the prior year. However, the
elimination of the U.S. medical device tax offset that by an almost equal amount within net other expense. While we

hedge the majority of our operating results in developed market currencies to reduce earnings volatility from foreign
exchange, a growing portion of our profits are unhedged, especially emerging market currencies. As we have said
before, that can create modest volatility in our margins.
Below the operating profit line, net interest expense was $179 million. At the end of the first quarter, we had $32.1
billion in debt and $12.8 billion in cash and investments, of which approximately $5 billion was trapped. Our debt did
increase by just under $1 billion as we issued short-term debt to manage minor timing differences between sources and
uses of cash.
Our non-GAAP nominal tax rate on a cash basis was 15.7%. This was an improvement to our forecast as it included the
benefit from several operational tax adjustments for the quarter.
Free cash flow was $1.2 billion. We are deploying our capital strategically, consistently and with discipline, with a
balanced focus on reinvestment, debt reduction and return to our shareholders. We paid $599 million in dividends and
repurchased a net $1.5 billion worth of ordinary shares in the first quarter. At quarter end, we had remaining
authorization to repurchase approximately 51 million shares. First quarter average daily shares outstanding on a diluted
basis were 1,407,000,000 shares. We remain committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our adjusted free cash flow
to shareholders and deleveraging our balance sheet.
As an S&P dividend aristocrat, we expect to deliver dependable long-term dividend growth. In June, our board
approved another double digit increase to our dividend, which brings our payout ratio to 40%. With regard to
reinvestment, our investments, particularly M&A, must not only meet high financial return hurdles with minimal
shareholder dilution, but also provide a line of sight to improving outcomes and allow for Medtronic to add value.
Before turning the call back to Omar, let me conclude by reiterating our outlook. Our revenue outlook and EPS
guidance for fiscal year 2017 has not changed. We continue to expect revenue growth to be in the upper half of the mid
single digit range at 5% to 6% on a constant currency, constant weeks basis, which excludes the estimated negative
$450 million impact from the extra selling week we had in the first quarter of last fiscal year. While the impact from
currency is fluid and therefore not something we predict, if current exchange rates, which include a $1.13 euro and
¥100, remains stable for the remainder of the fiscal year, our full year revenue would be positively affected by
approximately $275 million to $325 million.
With respect to earnings, we expect fiscal year 2017 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to grow 12% to 16% after
adjusting for the estimated $0.08 to $0.10 impact from the extra week last fiscal year, as well as a negative foreign
currency impact of $0.20 to $0.25. This EPS growth implies non-GAAP diluted EPS of $4.60 to $4.70. All of this is in
line with prior guidance.
Looking at the second quarter only, we expect our revenue growth to be within our full year growth range of 5% to 6%
and our EPS growth to be in the lower half of our full year growth range of 12% to 16%, both on a constant currency
basis. Again, while currency impact is not something we predict, if exchange rates remain stable, we estimate our
second quarter revenue would be positively affected by $25 million to $75 million. Other than as noted, our EPS
guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be recorded as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during
the fiscal year.
We feel good about the performance of our operations, the overall state of our markets, the diversification of our
portfolio and geographies, and our ability to execute, all of which give us confidence in our ability to deliver on our
annual and long-term commitments. As you know, our focus is to consistently deliver revenue growth in the mid single
digits and EPS growth in the double digits on a constant currency basis. Our guidance for this fiscal year remains
consistent with that long-term focus. Omar?

Operator, first question, please?
Q&A
Operator
Our first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking the question. Just maybe, Omar, I wanted to
start with HeartWare, which you have closed. Could you just spend a minute on why now on HeartWare? I think that
was the biggest question people had is people understand the franchise, but why did you do the transaction today? And
then second, there's obviously some dilution that comes with buying HeartWare given the burr at the company. How
did you offset that?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Okay. Why now, well when you do deals, there are opportunistic elements which kind of come
through. So that was clearly one. The other is we really felt that we were in a position where heart, we were getting
critical mass around our expertise in heart failure and where HeartWare was positioned as a company, we felt that we
could add immediate value, and through that combination drive up significant revenue, not only in the first year but in
the next couple of years through real sort of milestones that the company can meet such as definitely reaching the
approval for destination therapy and other new products. So that was, we felt, a good timing for us.
And besides, you can't plan acquisitions to the month here. It depends on a variety of circumstances and things just fell
into place. We felt we had the management bandwidth to do this, the team was well prepared, had the right capabilities
and we had additional synergies that we could add in many different ways, so we felt this was absolutely the right time.
And in terms of the dilution that obviously comes along with an acquisition this size, there are offsets that the Cardiac
and Vascular Group made, and I'll let Mike kind of comment on the whole thing on that.
<A - Michael J. Coyle>: Sure, Mike. Obviously, we had a number of investments internally going on and R&D
programs directed specifically at heart failure, including diagnostic programs and services, as well as enhancements to
our CRT product lines, and we basically are reallocating resources and people to support the activities within
HeartWare and backing off on some of those because we actually think that the HeartWare return on investment will be
even better.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Great. And if I could just ask two quick follow-ups. Mike, this was a tougher quarter for
the traditional ICD business for the high power business, could you just comment on that? And I was wondering if
Hooman could comment on 670G timing in light of the 630G approval. Thanks.
<A - Michael J. Coyle>: Sure. As it relate to ICDs, I think probably the thing that is impacting the overall market is
U.S. replacements and that we saw a pretty stable low single digit growth in initial implants for ICDs. But we're now
getting to a point where year-over-year comparisons on replacements are down in sort of the low double digit kind of
range, which is obviously a function of what happened to initial implants five years to eight years ago depending on
when you talked about CRT to standard ICDs. So that's obviously putting some strain on the overall market group. But
we actually took share in the ICD market as we continue to get the benefit of the MRI safe technologies rolling it to not
just the standard ICDs but now also into CRT-D.
And that's something that we think will continue. We think we're very much on the front end of basically mix shift
towards use of MRI in standard high power and in the CRT-D. And we also obviously have a very robust set of new

products that are just hitting the market and will be added to over the course of the next several quarters, including the
Visia AF and the single chamber segment as well as the Clarion CRT-D device which adds the effective CRT
algorithm to our overall set of offerings. So we think obviously the market is going to provide a bit of a headwind
because of the replacements, but we think we're in a good position to continue to take share and mitigate some of that.
And it was particularly encouraging to me that we could get to that mid single digit growth when we're seeing that kind
of stress, not just in the ICD market but obviously when we're in a little bit of an off segment on our DES market as
well and yet are able to still get into mid single digit growth. So we think it speaks to the importance and value of the
breadth of the portfolio.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Hooman, on the 670G?
<A - Hooman C. Hakami>: Yeah. Yeah, with respect to the 670G, Mike, the PMA is with the FDA. It's really hard to
predict when they're going to approve it. Obviously it's in their hands now. We're working actively with them to answer
the questions that they have regarding our submission. But as you know and as Omar talked about in the commentary,
in the meantime we launched the 630G. We received approval and have launched the 630G, and we're excited about
this. This is going to address some of the biggest requests we've seen from patients, a color screen, waterproof, remote
bolus capability. And so it's a chance for us to really bring additional enhancements to our patients while the 670G
process goes on. So we're excited about the new product that we have. And in the meantime, we're working actively
with the FDA on the 670G.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Understood. I'll let someone else jump in. Thanks.
<A - Ryan Weispfenning>: Thanks.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Thanks, Mike.

Operator
Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David Ryan Lewis>: Good morning. Just a couple of questions here. Omar, the last four quarters, as you know,
organic growth has been extremely stable within Medtronic. This quarter, there were a couple of areas, Mike mentioned
one of them, but the stent franchise, U.S. geography broadly and a little bit the emerging market geography. I wonder if
you could sort of address those few areas and maybe a couple of different people, but just more specifically after that
four quarters of significant stability of organic growth. Can that organic growth number get better here over the next
several quarters? And I have a quick follow-up after that.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Well, look, we've always said that one of our main strengths is the diversity of not only our
portfolio but our geographic presence, as well as the nature of the sources of revenue that we have from emerging
markets, from services, solutions and from new therapies. And that, by definition, means that there will be areas which
are strong one quarter and weak in others. But overall, we're pretty confident – very confident that we can maintain
even just organically the mid single digit range, within the full range of the mid single digit. We expect acquisitions to
supplement that and give us more confidence in holding that range. But our new product introduction and so on, as well
as our geographic expansion should enable us to do that.
Now specifically to your question, look, we were really in a bit of a down product cycle, if you like, in the U.S. where
we most find new products have the biggest impact. We think we'll get a bolus of new products in the coming quarters
and that'll pick it up again, but the slight drop in U.S. revenue from our – typically we'd be doing about four to about
three this quarter is primarily that. We think in many areas we continue to show strength, particularly in surgical
procedures and within the MITG portfolio, and that really hasn't changed. And like Mike pointed out a little earlier,
we're in a down product cycle, actually both in cardiac and in diabetes, which we think will come back in the next few
quarters. So that's the dynamics in the U.S. market and new therapies.

And also, the other thing that I'd like to point out is RTG, our Restorative Therapies growth led by spine, which we're
watching carefully. We are encouraged to see good strength there or early strength. I mean, it's – we've got to
demonstrate sustained capability of mid single digit growth there, but we're pleased to see the way that RTG is moving
now. And offsetting pressures even in that portfolio would strengthen other areas. And in emerging markets, actually,
again we are quite pleased. China went through all kinds of gyrations in the last two years, if you like. And through
that, we've maintained either double digit growth, plus or minus a little bit in that geography.
And then the other geographies have balanced each other out. I mean, Middle East and Africa has been a very strong
contributor of emerging market growth over the last several quarters. This quarter, there were conditions there but then
other geographies such as Latin America, has showed considerable strength, and China for that matter, to offset that. So
we're very confident that the projection that we made of sort of low- to mid-teens double digit growth in the emerging
markets is something that is quite sustainable despite macroeconomic challenges that may come about. I think I
covered your points, David.
<Q - David Ryan Lewis>: You did, Omar. Thank you. And just a quick follow-up on earnings and margins broadly for
Karen and the broader team. So just to avoid any confusion we've had the last couple of quarters, your commentary,
Karen, picky about consensus in the second quarter earnings number, we kind of come around a kind of a $1.15
number, plus or minus $0.01. I wonder if you could just comment about your comfortability within that consensus or
that number.
And then just broadly, if you take a step back from the Analyst Day, margins were the real focus. And I wonder, you're
giving us 12% to 16% for this year, but your confidence that we continue to see the durability of that 12% to 16% or
sort of mid-teens earnings growth, and of all those plans and restructuring plans you referred to, when does the investor
really start to see the inflection in these plans where they could really get this sense of the sustainability of this
long-term double digit teens profile? Thank you.
<A - Karen L. Parkhill>: Thanks, David. I don't comment specifically on consensus numbers, but happy for any of
you to follow up with Ryan to go through your models at any point in time. In terms of our confidence in delivering our
long-term bottom-line EPS growth, I think this company has a very strong ability and we are very confident in our
ability to deliver our commitment. Not only do we have significant growth on the top line, particularly from emerging
markets, as Omar noted, but we have been driving strong synergies from the Covidien acquisition and we are focused
on delivering additional leverage beyond the Covidien acquisition through a significant focus on managing our costs
efficiently, and I feel very confident in our ability to do just that.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: I think – maybe if I can just add to that, your question about when to watch for inflection
points. Well, listen like we've said before, the Covidien synergies, if we hit our $850 million projection, that alone
takes us through the double digit EPS sort of projection, I mean, by definition, in FY 2017 and mostly in FY 2018.
Now, as we transition beyond that, we are, like I've mentioned in the Investor Day, working on other efficiency
programs in operations and in functions and many other areas, which will then sustain that level. So those programs
that we worked on right now, but clearly, the real results will prove themselves beyond FY 2017.
<Q - David Ryan Lewis>: Great. Thank you very much.

Our next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.
<Q - Bob Hopkins>: Well, thanks, and good morning.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Hi.
<Q - Bob Hopkins>: So just two quick questions. One is just a clarifying question on the revenue growth guidance for
2017. Given that now you've closed HeartWare, I hear you specifically on the upper end of the mid single digit range,
but I'm just curious. Does M&A add about a point to growth for 2017 given all the deals that have happened?

<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Well, yeah, I mean, if you add the deals up, it's something like that, probably a little less than
that. But the main point though here is that the range that we projected really balances out issues that may arise, market
issues and other issues that arise in our business. We feel confident that even organically that we will be in the mid
single digit range and then the whole range. And we feel that acquisitions give us increased confidence that we will hit
that and then probably in the higher end of that range. I mean, certainly this year with HeartWare, we've got increased
confidence for that. But that's the way in which we're looking at this.
It's probably, if you want a direct answer to your question, it's probably slightly under a point that the acquisitions are
adding, but that's – things roll off, other things come in. It's just a pretty dynamic picture. And believe it or not, there
are some divestitures as well, like the drug business and other things that go out of our portfolio. So net-net, it's
probably a little less than a full point.
<A - Karen L. Parkhill>: And Bob, we did say that this quarter net M&A added about 70 basis points this quarter.
<Q - Bob Hopkins>: Great. Thank you. No, I understand the philosophy around the guidance, I just wanted to make
sure I had a good understanding of all the moving parts. And then for a second question, just on the product side, I was
wondering if Mike could talk a little bit about the upcoming MRI safe competition? We've started to see a little bit of
that roll in. Just, Mike, your confidence in mid single digit growth now that we're about to see a steady cadence of MRI
safe competition? And then quickly on the Diabetes side, I heard the timelines for 670G, but I just wanted to make sure
there's no change in timelines on 670G from your perspective.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Mike, you want to go first? And then we'll give Hooman.
<A - Michael J. Coyle>: Sure. So first, on MRI, we obviously think this should become standard of care, and right
now we would – if you just look at the most mature products we have in that segment are in the dual chamber pacing
area, and there the mix is still in the U.S., which is the most developed market in the sense – are still only 70% of our
business is actually MRI safe. And recognizing that we're just a little bit over half the pacing business, that means that
less than half of the patients who are getting pacemakers in the United States are getting MRI-safe devices. And as you
go into the other product lines, in ICDs it's more like a 50% penetration rate for us. And when you get to CRT-D, it's
more like a 30% penetration rate for us, so – or mix for us. So these penetration rates are very low and so we still think
there's plenty of upside to go in those spaces.
But as competitors catch up to this, which still – with that it's only happening on the Brady side right now and is
expected to take still several quarters into next calendar year before we see ICD competition, CRT-D competition in
those areas. We are continuing to advance the ball. I mean, obviously on the pacing side, it's Micra, right, where we
basically have an opportunity to significantly shift to very much value-added product in the single-chamber segment as
we get our reimbursement in place for that, which is going to happen before the end of the fiscal year. In the standard
ICD segment for single chamber, the addition of Visia AF is being very well received in the marketplace. It is the only
single-chamber device that could actually do monitoring of atrial fibrillation without having a lead. So it gives a very
significant benefit beyond simply the MRI-safe characteristics of the products.
And then in the CRT-D side, we're obviously adding significant therapeutic value with things like AdaptivCRT and
effective CRT, which basically improve response rates in CRT. And because our hardware platforms, Amplia in
particular, are basically positioned to be able to do multi-point pacing, we're going to add multi-point pacing capability
to that Amplia product with software downloads before the end of the fiscal year. So we continue to advance the
offerings that we have beyond MRI as competitors catch up in MRI.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: And in terms of diabetes, the 670G is on track, but Hooman, you want to say a couple of
words on that?
<A - Hooman C. Hakami>: Sure. There is absolutely no change or any indication that things are going to push out on
the 670G. And maybe, Bob, just an additional point of clarification, we didn't launch the 630G because we thought
there was a risk to the 670G timeline. So the 670G is, as I said, we're working very, very closely with the FDA. The
relationship is outstanding and we're actively engaged with them. We launched the 630G, not due to anything related to

the 670G, but because of two things. One, it gives our patients the request that they have asked for, and I touched on
what some of those were, from waterproof to color screen. And at the same time, what it does is it refreshes our product
line in the U.S.
The 530G was launched in September of 2013. That's three years ago. And we've held our own with this product even
as it's long anniversaried, but if you take a look at how well the 640G has done outside the United States, we felt that
by bringing these patient-centric features and a new hardware platform into the U.S. now, we could really refresh our
product line and really drive growth in the U.S. while we wait for the 670G.

Our next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Kristen Stewart>: Good morning. Hope you guys are all doing well.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Good morning. Yeah. We're very well.
<Q - Kristen Stewart>: Good. Hey, Karen. Welcome, I guess, to the team and to the earnings calls.
<A - Karen L. Parkhill>: Thanks.
<Q - Kristen Stewart>: I was wondering if you could just, I guess, take a step back and I guess since this is your first
call just refresh us on I guess your thoughts on joining Medtronic. And I know as mentioned before on the call, the
operating margins had been a real big goal for Medtronic. I was wondering if you could just refresh us on the overall
thoughts there and just again, Medtronic from a broader sense on your enthusiasm on joining the team.
<A - Karen L. Parkhill>: Thank you, Kristen. Happy to answer that. I am thrilled to be a part of this great team.
Medtronic is an amazing company with a very strong mission that clearly spoke to me personally. I think we are a
leader in the industry from a vision perspective, and I'm excited to be at a company that is leading not just the medical
device industry but the healthcare industry in general. And I'm thrilled to be at a team where we're focused on growth
and efficiency. In terms specifically of the operating margin, as you know, our focus is to drive a stronger growth in our
bottom line than we have in our top line, and the only way you do that is through efficiency in our margins. We are
very focused on that.
We talked about driving the Covidien synergies through to completion and ultimately achieving the $850 million
commitment that we have put out there. And then on top of that, as we said, we are focused on driving efficiencies
throughout the company, looking at all of our processing, bringing in Lean Six Sigma to make us better and more
efficient, centralizing resources where we can, and ultimately driving double digit bottom line growth, which is much
stronger than a very impressive mid single digit top line growth.
<Q - Kristen Stewart>: Okay. And then just I guess from your perspective of where do you think that you're going to
add the most value for Medtronic, and can you just give us your thoughts on capital deployment and how you look at
the lens of with M&A?
<A - Karen L. Parkhill>: Sure. I'm happy to talk about those. I'm excited to step into the very big shoes of Gary, and I
intend to steer the ship very much in the same direction that he has. I do come from a financial industry background.
Most recently, though, I have had experience in many industries within financial services. Obviously, one of the key
things that we had been doing in a ultra-low rate environment was focused on efficiency and driving strong bottom line.
And so that's exactly what we'll be doing here.
In terms of capital deployment, I think the highest and best use of our capital is to grow the intrinsic value of the
company through reinvestment, first and foremost. But beyond that, I think it's very important to have a dividend that is

strong and that does steadily grow with earnings.
And then on top of that, where we can, have meaningful payback to our shareholders through share repurchases, and
that's exactly what we're doing with our commitment to deliver a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to our
shareholders in the form of share repurchase. In addition to the ability of us untrapping more cash, we have an
additional $5 billion commitment over a three-year period from fiscal 2016 to 2018. So obviously, I firmly believe in
all that we are doing with the company and hope that helps.

Our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Larry Biegelsen>: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Omar, I wanted to start with a big picture
question for you. In calendar Q1 2016, it was generally a strong quarter for the large cap med tech companies, and we
actually saw an acceleration in the weighted average organic growth for the large cap, meaning it's about 5% to 6%
depending on whether you include Edwards and Intuitive. So the question I have for you is what do you think is driving
improvement in the industry growth? How sustainable is it? Could you actually see growth improve for the industry
from here or do you think 5% to 6% is the new norm? And I had a follow-up.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Well look, the industry's very broad. So it's tough to be specific about this stuff, but just a few
reflections on this. First of all, if you're in healthcare, your entitlement is growth because the opportunities in healthcare
are limitless. If you look at it both from a clinical innovation perspective, the number of problems that have to be
solved that patients will value that create a real difference in people's lives, driving equity in healthcare around the
world, the opportunities there are, again, limitless. I mean, we're just scratching the surface. And then on top of that,
like we've talked about the challenge of addressing wastage in healthcare where we're literally wasting across the world
hundreds of billions of dollars in total healthcare spend, of which there's inefficiency in delivery, primarily because of
payment models and so on around the world.
So if you look at all that collectively, the fact that the healthcare industry is growing is really not a surprise. In many
ways, it's an entitlement that the healthcare industry should have. And I think the fact that there was momentum this
last quarter and the last couple of quarters, I mean it's too tough to call on something with that short a timeline. But I
have every expectation that all stakeholders in healthcare, if they get their heads around these opportunities, will drive a
steady increase in the growth profile in healthcare. I think that's our entitlement.
I think that's the only real comment I can make. I think all the companies that you listed are good companies with
innovation, driving and creating new markets. We expect to be an equal player in many of those areas, but there are lots
of people out there with great sense of purpose and inventiveness in driving these solutions. So again, I just put it in the
perspective of overall healthcare. This is not one that should ever be a down market if we, as players and stakeholders
in the healthcare market, kind of get our heads around this.
<Q - Larry Biegelsen>: Thanks, Omar. And then...
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: I hope that helped. Go ahead.

<Q - Larry Biegelsen>: That's very helpful. Thank you. And Mike, the intermediate risk indication for CoreValve and
its CE mark approval came a bit earlier than people expected. What do you think the implications are for the market
and for CoreValve for that intermediate risk indication? And just Karen, the net other expense or income through the
remainder of the year is a little bit lower in this quarter than we expected and the tax rate as well. Could you comment
on that, please? Thanks a lot.
<A - Michael J. Coyle>: Well, as it relates to intermediate risk, we were certainly expecting these developments both
in terms of the [audio gap] (58:39) Edwards approval in the United States. We reflected that in our estimates for the
overall market, which we showed at the Analyst Meeting. So I wouldn't necessarily change what we said at that time
other than to say it's obviously good to see these developments tending to happen sooner rather than later in terms of
regulatory organizations looking at these compelling data and basically making sure these technologies are available to
patients in the Intermediate Risk Group, and so we look forward to obviously finishing the SURTAVI study, working
with the FDA to get labeling indications for that in the United States and we think the growth profile of the overall
TAVI market, which was very robust in Q1, is going to continue to be a very impressive driver of growth for us and for
med tech in general.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Karen?
<A - Karen L. Parkhill>: Yes. On net other expense, we did mention the fact that our medical device tax does flow
through that line item, and obviously that was down year-over-year, about $55 million. We did have currency gains that
run through that line item as well. Those were down year-over-year, too. In terms of our tax rate, we did have several
discrete tax benefits in the quarter that did push our overall tax rate down to 15.7%. For the year, we still do expect our
tax rate to be within the range that we talked about before of 16.5% to 17.5%.

<Q - Bruce M. Nudell>: Good morning. Could you hear me okay?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Yes, we can hear you fine. Good morning.
<Q - Bruce M. Nudell>: Oh. Good morning. Omar, we recently revisited the surgical practice patterns in orthopedics
and some things don't seem to change. There seem to be just some [audio gap] (60:24) for the status quo, and some of
the intricacies of gain sharing in terms of rebasing of internal savings pose another impediment to change. Should we
be thinking about Medtronic's orthopedic initiative principally on the basis of broad solutions including management of
patients in post-acute care? Or is really the implant side of the business really seminal to your thinking?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: No, I think it's the former. It is the broad solution that is necessary. And we feel that there's a
lot of cost. I mean, the majority of cost in that overall episode is actually in the post-acute space and so we think we can
make a considerable difference, but let's not just put that in a single bucket, because in overall process includes proper
risk stratification of the patients. And that risk stratification drives a very specific care pathway to which adherence
must be made. And then following that, a clear hand-off to post-acute care in the most efficient manner possible. And
finally, a clear measurement and accountability for the outcome of the patient. Those four things that I've just outlined
are not things that today are looked at holistically.
And I think in each one of those areas there's considerable inefficiency, and we believe that putting technology and
using technology will not only create an inflection point in the short term but will actually create long-term
sustainability of savings in that process. Because as you improve outcomes, you improve your cohort selection and risk
stratification, your care pathways improve. And then through all of that, implants will play a role. In terms of providing

the most effective implant at the appropriate cost. And when there's innovation in those areas, we'd use them to drive
up outcomes. So that's the way we look at it, but you have to start with a holistic view, and implant is only a portion of
that and that's our view. Geoff, you want to add anything to that? Anything that I missed?
<A - Geoffrey S. Martha>: No. No. No, I think you're right. And we look at this holistic view, we look at it in several
areas like the segmentation of the patients and the risk analytics, the pre-procedure patient engagement and education,
the inter-operative technologies, not just the implants but different surgical tools that can be used that can lower the
procedure cost during the hospital stay or downstream. And then the post-acute remote patient monitoring, and then
finally the patient reported outcomes, the data collection reporting on that. And look, we're seeing examples of, for
example I was just with our Advanced Energy business yesterday in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and they have a
technology that actually adds almost $500 to the cost of the procedure.
And when they, over the last year, with the advent of knowing that CGR was coming, they really had to – they
revamped their go-to-market strategy, did that patient segmentation that Omar's talking about, was very clear to their
surgeon partners in the health systems they're selling into, what patient cohort this hemostasis technology, what patient
cohorts that added value to downstream and what it did not. So they did that patient segmentation, they published some
papers on the value of the technology downstream for those cohorts of patients, both clinically and economically, and
they've seen a big boost in their business.
So we're seeing the impact when you look at it holistically and you can document it, and I think it's a matter of time.
You'll see certain technologies separate themselves that way, both good and bad, up and down. And so I think your
point on the, I guess, what did you call it, the built-in forces that are keeping things stable, but I think over time as
hospitals and health systems and payers become more sophisticated in looking at this holistic approach and looking at
the clinical and economic impact across the 90-day period in this case, I think you're going to see separation. I just don't
think people have fully grasped it yet.
<Q - Bruce M. Nudell>: Thank you. And just a follow-up for Mike. Mike, there were reports of vascular injuries with
CoreValve. I'm presuming that was mainly a training issue, not a class effect related to the longer size of the
self-expanding kind of devices. And the second follow-up, I'm presuming you pulled the trigger on HeartWare being
pretty comfortable with HVAD, it's going to be competitive until the pipeline evolves. And just any thoughts you might
have on the pipeline.
<A - Michael J. Coyle>: Sure. So on the field action we took, obviously we monitor all the patients that are being
treated with our products. And in that particular case, we saw some overlap between specific anatomic issues and an
increase in vascular trauma. So it was, in fact, only about training that this field action was done. It was to improve
sensitivity to those particular aspects when screening patients and making sure that care is taken in terms of the
delivery of the device. I would point out that our incidence of vascular injury is actually below what is in the TDD
registry. So we have a very low threshold for identifying these issues. And when we think we can help improve
outcomes, we obviously take action to do it. So there is no change to the product and we have no issues with
manufacturing. It basically was a training issue.
On HeartWare, obviously we are very bullish on the HVAD system as it is. We think that device, it performed very
well. We were obviously able to see details of the clinical evidence that they've generated in support of their U.S.
approval in advance of making the decision to acquire the company. And I think you've seen, especially in their most
recent quarterly earnings results, that in Europe there is beginning to see after the initial trialing a nice bounce back in
terms of overall share, which obviously is consistent with our view that this product with its smaller size and this
performance characteristics should be able to – could be very effectively in that space.
We continue to look at the MVAD device and decide how aggressively we want to pursue that and we're working
closely with the leadership team there. Very impressed with the people who are doing that work and we look forward to
being a leader in this space for decades to come.
<Q - Bruce M. Nudell>: Thanks so much.
<A - Ryan Weispfenning>: We'll take time for one more question here.

Our final question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.
<Q - Vijay Kumar>: Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. So maybe, one, I had a guidance clarification question if
you will, and one follow-up. I guess when you look at sequentially 1Q versus 2Q, right, 1Q we came in at the high-end
on a constant currency, constant week EPS growth. 2Q, we're sort of looking at the bottom end of the 4% to 14% range.
So can you just talk to sort of what changed in 1Q or 2Q? And then when I look at the annual guidance rate, 1Q of
revenues came in 200 basis points above internal plans. If we're looking at low half of the annual sort of 5% to 6%
where we came in north of 5%, and so revenues came in better in 1Q but I'm just curious why – how EPS we sort of
re-created on the EPS guidance.
<A - Karen L. Parkhill>: Sure. Happy to answer that, Vijay. In terms of first quarter versus second quarter, yes, our
first quarter we did come in at the high-end of that 12% to 16% growth range and we did give guidance that we expect
second quarter to be at the low end of that 12% to 16% range. The key reason is the tax rate. We expect our tax rate
from second quarter last year to second quarter this year to be about 50 basis points higher. And in terms of revenue
growth rate, obviously we do expect our second quarter to be in the same line as our overall annual growth rate of 5%
to 6%. Clearly, we've got the HeartWare acquisition closing that gives us confidence around that range.
<Q - Vijay Kumar>: Great. And then maybe one follow-up on, I guess, TAVR, a lot of questions have been asked, but
I'm just curious, maybe Mike can answer this. Have you had conversations with the FDA on whether they would accept
a one-year data for CoreValve given we have notion, we have subgroup analysis of high risk and your peer Comcare
just got approval based on one-year data? And if you had those conversations, what's been the response? Thank you.
<A - Michael J. Coyle>: Well, obviously, it's always a very fluid discussion with FDA and I have been very impressed
with the way they have adapted their views in the TAVR space to the quality of the clinical evidence and have been
flexible in terms of timing on approvals in the space generally. I think we saw that again here with the Edwards
approval. And so this group, I think, is extremely effective at balancing the therapeutic benefit of products with their
risk and trying to get good new therapies to the market as quickly as they can. So we will, as you point out, continue to
basically look at one-year and two-year cuts on the data. With the large number of patients that we have, we've
obviously completed enrollment. As we've said, we expect around ACC to be reviewing those data publicly. And
obviously, we'll continue to work with the FDA and they will ultimately be the ones who decide when the product is
approved.
Omar S. Ishrak
Okay? Okay. Thanks to all of you for your questions. And in conclusion, let me just reiterate that we're focused in
consistently delivering on our pre-commitments, mid single digit constant currency revenue growth, double digit
constant currency EPS growth, and returning a minimum of 50% of our adjusted free cash flow to our shareholders.
And as I noted earlier, we feel that the appropriate application of medical technology that can help address
inefficiencies and improve outcomes in healthcare delivery, driving new forms of value creation. With our
differentiated growth platforms and leadership in these strong end markets, we believe that we're well positioned to
capture this to ultimately create long-term dependable value for our shareholders.
With that and on behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank you again for your continued support and
interest in Medtronic. We look forward to updating you on our progress on our Q2 call, which we currently anticipate
holding on Tuesday, November 22. Thank you all, and have a great day.
