Robert J. Hugin
Thank you, Patrick, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning.
We look forward to providing you our perspectives on the outstanding results achieved in the fourth quarter and
throughout the past year. These results and the strong operating momentum produced by all of our functions and
geographies position us for sustained industry-leading growth in 2015 and well beyond. Peter, Jackie, Scott, and Mark
will review the numerous accomplishments that have contributed to our exceptional financial and operating
performance. They will also highlight the many significant milestones that reflect the extraordinary promise of 2015.
Though we have limited time to review the extensive progress advancing our increasingly broad and deep
high-potential pipeline, we are just beginning to see the substantial benefits of our focused commitment to our internal
and collaborative research efforts. In 2015 we plan to initiate eight new Phase I programs, reflecting the significant
long-term growth potential of our pipeline, in addition to the numerous near and medium-term opportunities that will
be discussed today.
We are energized by the promise of 2015, and we'll provide additional insights and perspectives on our outlook for the
year and on our 2020 targets. I should note that early first quarter trends are providing a very strong start to the year.
We are strategically well positioned and committed to fully capitalizing on the many opportunities to turn this great
potential into demonstrated results.
Let me now turn the call over to Peter.
Peter N. Kellogg
Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everyone on the call.
2014 was a great year for Celgene, both in terms of the financial results and equally importantly from a strategic
perspective. Now Jackie, Scott, and Mark will cover our various strategic achievements and objectives in a minute, and
I'd like to now cover the excellent performance of 2014. In summary, Celgene delivered robust growth and better than
expected results.
Product sales grew 19% year over year compared to our original guidance of 16%. And adjusted EPS grew 24% year
over year compared to our original guidance of 19%. Now this strong performance was driven by a combination of
significant growth across the product portfolio and substantial leverage in the P&L that resulted in a 220 basis point
improvement in the adjusted operating margin.
Our focus on operational excellence extends beyond delivering near-term financial performance. It also includes
making the appropriate investments to optimize the commercial communities of our in-line products, investing wisely
to advance our pipeline with leading technologies, and enhancing our internal programs and capabilities through

collaborations with the best biotech partners in the industry. This last point is critical. Our top strategic priority is to
both deliver on our current potential, while at the same time building a world-class sustainable growth engine that will
propel our performance beyond 2020.
Now let's discuss the financial results for the quarter and the year. Our fourth quarter total net sales grew 19%
compared to prior year, and we are especially proud to have exceeded $2 billion in quarterly net sales for the first time
in Q4. For the full year, total net product sales also grew 19% and accelerated compared to prior year-over-year
comparisons.
We had a diverse set of drivers that supported this exceptional performance, including the global rollout of
POMALYST/IMNOVID for myeloma and ABRAXANE for pancreatic cancer, the U.S. launch of OTEZLA for
psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis, and overall strong sales for REVLIMID, driven by extended duration of treatment in
both the U.S. and Europe.
Our evolving product portfolio enjoyed broad-based success in Q4 and really throughout 2014. Beginning with our
flagship product, REVLIMID, full-year net product sales grew over 16% and approached $5 billion. Three of our
products, ABRAXANE, POMALYST/IMNOVID, and OTEZLA, combined for full-year net product sales of
approximately $1.6 billion, reflecting a 67% year-over-year increase. Growth was primarily volume-driven, as we
continued to launch these products globally. Collectively, these three products contributed almost half of the
incremental increase in net product sales for the year. In the fourth quarter, net product sales growth was indeed
primarily driven by volume.
The volatility in the foreign exchange markets toward the end of the year drove approximately a $25 million Q4
unfavorable impact to total net product sales, resulting in a negative 1.4 percentage point impact to growth. For the full
year, ForEx really had a negligible impact on net product sales growth.
Volume accounted for 15.7 percentage points of the 18.9 percentage point year-over-year growth, while price added a
3.4 percentage point benefit. So it's worth noting that for both Q4 and full year, pricing was a relatively minor driver of
revenue growth across our products.
Adjusted earnings per share growth accelerated in both the fourth quarter and full year compared to 2013. We continue
to drive a leveraged P&L, as earnings growth outpaced revenue growth. Even with this strong P&L management, as I
mentioned earlier, we made significant investments throughout the year. These investments led to an approximately
$400 million increase in combined R&D and SG&A expense in 2014, which is a 13% year-over-year growth. Included
in the R&D are investments in new clinical programs and medical affairs initiatives in addition to the expansion of our
early research and drug development – discovery capabilities.
Beyond our internal programs, during the fourth quarter we paid $21 million in milestone and extension payments to
partners for advancing our external programs. This compares to $52 million during the same period in 2013. We are
pleased with the early success of our partner programs and the potential contribution they could have on our
longer-term outlook.
On the SG&A line, we are seeing considerable leverage on G&A expenses that are offset by meaningful investments in
our global commercial capabilities; for example, building out our global commercial I&I franchise and supporting the
global launches in our hematology and oncology franchises. We expect these commercial investments to be leveraged
going forward, as ABRAXANE, POMALYST/IMNOVID, and OTEZLA sales continue to ramp up globally.
Finally, the effective tax rate improved by 80 basis points for the full year, mostly due to favorable geographic mix. In
addition, during the fourth quarter we realized the retroactive reinstatement of the U.S. R&D tax credit.
In the fourth quarter, earnings growth was largely driven by operating income, with a modest benefit from a lower tax
rate and share count. Full year, our earnings growth was also high quality, based largely on operating income, which
accounted for $0.71 of the $0.73 per share increase year over year. The gains from the improved tax rate and the
favorable cumulative impact of our share repurchase program were offset by increased financial expenses associated
with our May 2014 $2.5 billion debt offering and our hedging program.

Our global business is dynamic and generated operating cash flow of $2.8 billion, a 26% increase over prior year. The
strength of our cash flow generation provides significant financial flexibility. Throughout the course of last year, we
completed our strategic acquisition of GED-0301. Additionally, we invested $454 million in upfront payments for new
collaborations and expansion of existing collaborations. And finally, we optimized our capital structure with a strong
share repurchase of over $2.9 billion.
So to complete the picture of our financial performance, we assess return on invested capital both including and
excluding cash in the capital base. The overall trend is favorable, with improving returns realized during the 2008 to
2014 timeframe.
Now earlier this month, we provided 2015 guidance, and we provided a new perspective on our long-term financial
targets, this time through 2020. This outlook continues the very strong top line and leveraged bottom line outlook for
Celgene. It is based on the outstanding strength of our flagship commercial products, the emerging potential of their
broadened indications, and our high-potential pipeline of new products.
Focusing on 2015, we expect total net product sales between $9 billion to $9.5 billion, a 22% year-over-year increase
based on the midpoint of that range. Our guidance is based on ForEx rates established over a one-week period last
December and includes an expected negative currency impact approaching $100 million for the year. We have a
diverse product portfolio with multiple drivers for the top line. And the table attached to this presentation summarizes
the other key elements of our expected 2015 P&L.
Finally, I would like to convey a few thoughts on the quarterly progression of the annual guidance. As you know,
during Q1 we typically have a higher gross to net adjustment with REVLIMID and POMALYST due to early Medicare
donut hole and other ACA payments, and we expect the same pattern in 2015. Accordingly, we expect Q1 earnings to
be about 21% to 22% of the full-year guidance.
Now the operational and financial achievements we had in 2014 in addition to the momentum we're seeing in the early
part of 2015 has enabled us to provide a longer-term outlook to 2020. Our presentation of these targets earlier this
month was careful and detailed the drivers of our performance through 2017 and 2020 for each franchise, and it noted
the potential drivers that are not included in these targets. This presentation is available on our website under the IR
section.
We currently forecast over $20 billion in net product sales, reflecting an 18% compound annual growth rate.
Importantly, 15 percentage points of this growth, or $17 billion of 2020 sales, is from existing products and drivers that
are already understood, such as the newly diagnosed multiple myeloma opportunity with REVLIMID, the continued
global rollout of POMALYST/IMNOVID, OTEZLA, and ABRAXANE. The remaining three points of growth include
the risk-adjusted investment of what we will achieve separately from eight label expansions and six new product
introductions. Now this target does not assume that each of these programs needs to be successful in order for the $3
billion target to be achieved.
Finally and importantly, across our portfolio of pipeline and partner assets, there is an additional level of optionality, as
there are at least 17 identified opportunities that are possible in this timeframe and would provide upside to our $20
billion target.
Our adjusted EPS target is to achieve over $12.50 per share, which represents a 23% compound annual growth rate
from 2014 to 2020. Please think of this earnings growth as primarily operationally driven. For example, as we prepared
this outlook, we assumed as a planning convention a constant share count, a constant effective tax rate, and that our
other income and expense line will evolve from a net expense currently to a net income benefit by 2020. Now of
course, the actual capital structure, tax planning, and other corporate decisions that we make could well be different.
So to summarize, 2014 was really a phenomenal year that set up our potential, both in terms of financial and strategic
opportunities. We are off to a strong start in 2015. We are well positioned to capitalize on the numerous immediate
opportunities before us, to drive towards our 2020 financial targets, and to continue building our pipeline and additional
growth drivers for the years beyond 2020.

Thank you, and now I'll turn the call over to my colleague, Jackie.
Jacqualyn A. Fouse
Thank you, Peter. Good morning, everyone.
Our hematology/oncology teams around the world are delivering strong near-term commercial results while advancing
the regulatory, clinical, and medical affairs programs and strategies that lay the foundation for our sustained long-term
growth.
In 2014, franchise revenues grew 18% year over year, and the 3% sequential growth we produced in Q4 gave us a
strong finish to the year and great momentum moving into 2015. As you heard from Peter, all of our major brands
contributed to this growth, as did all of our major geographies. The demographics for our target therapeutic categories
are highly supportive of sustainable long-term growth, as we leverage our global infrastructure with new regulatory
approvals for products and indications around the world.
The outstanding performance of our clinical, medical affairs, and regulatory teams produced major submissions and
approvals for new indications across our in-line products, significant progress on our development pipeline, and a
constant stream of important new scientific data and publications in major medical journals. The results of these efforts
will drive not only our short-term growth trajectory, but they also position us extremely well to sustain that growth, one
reason we feel highly confident in our vision out to 2020. I will speak more about some of our nearer-term catalysts in
a moment.
Our teams took important steps to advance key programs that will contribute to establishing new treatment paradigms
for patients and drive our growth for the long term. These include our efforts in lymphoma, where a number of our
trials are now in Phase III, with several having completed enrollment; and in the immuno-oncology arena, where our
unique position gives us near, medium, and long-term opportunities.
REVLIMID's position in the market has never been stronger. The product grew 16% year over year and now has an
annual revenue base of just under $5 billion. Our growth was once again broad-based across geographies, with market
share and duration gains driving higher volumes. Quarterly revenues exited the year at a run rate of over $1.32 billion,
and we enter 2015 with excellent momentum as we look forward to approvals for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma
in the U.S., Europe, and Japan, as well as our ongoing geographic expansion in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma,
MDS, and mantle cell lymphoma.
As a quick update on our geographic expansion, I can now tell that you we have received reimbursement approval in
Russia, and we'll participate in our first tender there later this year. We anticipate imminent pricing approval in Mexico,
and we'll launch in relapsed refractory myeloma there this year. And finally, we're making good progress in Brazil, and
I look forward to telling you more about that market relatively soon.
We see ongoing support for sustained increases in duration of therapy in myeloma from the positive clinical readouts
for the triplet regimens that include REVLIMID as backbone therapy. We should see more of those triplet data readouts
over the course of this year.
We are making good progress with our REVLIMID lymphoma program. We now have five Phase III trials underway
in both follicular and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. We anticipate seeing data from these trials over the coming 18 to
24 months.
To wrap up on REVLIMID, we expect a steady stream of new data this year across multiple indications, and we will
update you about that on an ongoing basis.
Today, I just wanted to mention a couple of things we believe will come at ASCO, where we expect updated MMO-20
survival data as well as the detailed results of the FLASH meta-analysis in follicular lymphoma. It will be another
exciting year for new data for REVLIMID.

POMALYST/IMNOVID is on its way to becoming a blockbuster product, and we are extremely pleased with its
performance in 2014, as we continued the product's geographic expansion with our launch starting across the EU this
past year. We grew globally at 123% year over year and posted 12% sequential growth in Q4. The launch in Europe is
ongoing, and we now anticipate an approval in Japan during the first half of this year and launch in that market in the
second half of the year. With those major geographies in launch mode and others like Australia and Canada coming
along, POMALYST/IMNOVID has a very long growth trajectory still ahead of it.
A steady stream of new data is lending further support to the product's market position. These data, which were
recently presented at ASH, include subset data for patients with renal impairments and data for
POMALYST/IMNOVID in combination regimens. The market dynamic for POMALYST/IMNOVID in the third-line
and greater myeloma patient segments will be further enhanced as other therapies, including REVLIMID, continue to
move up to earlier treatment lines. For all of these reasons, we are highly confident that POMALYST/IMNOVID will
become a multibillion-dollar product, and we're very happy with the strategic role the product is playing within our
myeloma portfolio.
The ABRAXANE team produced outstanding results across the board during 2014, and delivered not only excellent
operating performance and 31% year-over-year growth, but also several key milestones that pave the way for strong
growth to come. Our team has grown ABRAXANE from just over $300 million of annual revenues with one indication
at the time of our acquisition of Abraxis in 2010 to almost $850 million of revenues in 2014, with now three global
indications. The product is well positioned for many more years of global growth and success.
During 2014, we continued ABRAXANE's global launch in pancreatic cancer, making significant progress in Europe
and preparing for launches in Canada, Australia, and other markets. In addition, our partner, Taiho, recently obtained
approval for this indication in Japan. The product has quickly become the new standard of care in metastatic pancreatic
cancer, and we are making excellent progress with our Phase III adjuvant and Phase II locally advanced pancreatic
cancer trials. We have received a positive opinion from the CHMP in Europe for non-small-cell lung cancer and look
forward to adding that indication to our European label this year.
Our abound program of four trials across various segments of non-small cell lung cancer continues to make progress,
and trials are initiating to study ABRAXANE in combination with novel agents in non-small-cell lung cancer. New
data in breast cancer in the neo-adjuvant setting was presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in
December by the German Breast Group. This new data from the GeparSepto trials further supports the value
proposition for ABRAXANE in breast cancer.
Now with three indications and labels across the globe and with an ongoing stream of new data consistently reinforcing
ABRAXANE's clinical differentiation, the product is evolving as the chemotherapy of choice for possible combination
regimens across multiple tumor types. We are working to make the most of this opportunity, and our strategy includes
studying ABRAXANE in combination with novel immuno-oncology agents, where trials with PD-1 and PD-L1
checkpoint inhibitors are already underway. And we are working with several potential collaboration partners on other
combination opportunities. The future for ABRAXANE is bright indeed.
To summarize, our hematology/oncology global franchise team produced stellar results in 2014 across all of our
commercial, clinical, regulatory, and medical affairs activities. This was evident in our operating performance, in our
clinical and regulatory achievements, and in our new data generation and publication success. At both ASCO and ASH
in 2014, the Celgene presence was stronger and deeper than ever.
The successes of 2014 lay the foundation for our confidence in both our 2015 and longer-term growth projections. I
highlighted a number of catalysts that will drive our growth this year. With these, we expect to deliver REVLIMID
sales of $5.6 billion to $5.7 billion, including the impact of negative foreign exchange, or growth of 13.5% year over
year. Growth is about 15% excluding foreign exchange and is volume driven.
We expect ABRAXANE sales to exceed $1 billion for the first time in the product's history and anticipate coming in
within a range of $1 billion to $1.25 billion for this year, growth of 33%, in a range consistent with the long-term target
we gave you several years ago. We also see strong growth ahead for POMALYST/IMNOVID and ongoing growth

outside the U.S. for VIDAZA.
We look forward to further updating you on our pipeline progress as we advance our key programs, including our plans
for moving ahead with our pivotal trials for AG-221 in AML and sotatercept or luspatercept in beta-thalassemia and
MDS. We're very excited about these programs and the potential they hold for our evolving MDS/AML franchise, as
we believe this business has the potential to go from around $1 billion of annual sales today to $3 billion-plus over the
next several years. We're also excited about these, as they represent concrete successes coming from our collaboration
portfolio and our unique research and development model. And I will take this opportunity to thank our partners, Agios
and Acceleron, for their outstanding execution and successes.
Let me close by thanking all of my franchise colleagues in hematology and oncology around the world for a fantastic
2014 and for what I know will be a tremendous year in 2015.
Thank you and let me now turn the call over to Scott.
Scott Andrew Smith
Thank you, Jackie, and welcome, everybody on the call.
Q4 was a quarter full of advancement and accomplishment within the I&I franchise. During this quarter, we launched a
psoriasis indication for OTEZLA in the U.S. and saw significant acceleration of prescriptions and revenue. We also
advanced important life cycle programs for OTEZLA in a variety of different indications. We received both a positive
opinion and a strong broad label recommendation from the CHMP for PsA in psoriasis. Striking Phase II data for
GED-0301 was presented at a major medical meeting, and we received important regulatory feedback for our proposed
GED-0301 clinical development plan.
Now let's turn to the OTEZLA launch. In the U.S., OTEZLA prescriptions accelerated significantly in Q4 following the
psoriasis approval, and with continued strong progress on the PsA launch. OTEZLA has obtained the highest initial
weekly Rx volume of any launch in the I&I space in recent years. It is important to know that the vast majority of
prescriptions in both PsA and psoriasis are for patients who are coming off non-biologic therapies. As of December,
approximately 80% of patients who were initiating OTEZLA therapy were pre-biologic, and only 20% were coming to
OTEZLA from a biologic therapy.
Now looking specifically at the U.S. psoriasis launch, we are very encouraged by the initial data. Since the approval for
psoriasis on September 23, we have seen a quadrupling in the number of dermatology prescribers of OTEZLA in just
three months. We saw broad utilization across all sectors of dermatology, including those who prescribe biologics,
those who prescribe oral systemics, those who prescribe mostly topicals, and we are particularly pleased with the
OTEZLA uptake by the top decile psoriasis prescribers in the market. Not only did prescriptions accelerate in Q4, we
also saw significant acceleration in net product sales, which were $47 million in Q4 and $70 million for 2014, the first
partial year of launch. Overall, we are very happy with the early launch success of OTEZLA in the United States.
As mentioned earlier, we received a positive CHMP opinion in Q4, and we received a formal approval earlier this
month for both PsA and psoriasis indications. We will be launching OTEZLA in the UK, Germany, and Nordic
countries in February, and expect a series of further launches in Europe throughout 2015. We also look forward to
launching in Japan and other major geographies in 2016 and beyond.
Turning our attention now to GED-0301, we are currently initiating the early stages of the registration program. This
registration program will consist of three main components that will run in staggered parallel fashion. The first step is a
registration enabling endoscopy study, which is initiating currently. There will also be two large 52-week treat-through
pivotal trials, which have clinical remission, defined by CDAI as the primary endpoint and key secondary endpoints
looking at endoscopic changes and patient reported outcomes, specifically PRO2. We will also be working on initiating
an adolescent Crohn's registration trial in 2015. Data from this program is expected to be available beginning in 2017.

As I stated earlier, 2014 was a year of significant advancement and accomplishment for Celgene I&I. 2015 should be
another year full of major milestones and accomplishments for the I&I franchise. We are focused on expanding the
OTEZLA presence in the U.S., the launch of OTEZLA in multiple indications in key geographies outside of the United
States, including the EU, Switzerland, and Australia, and completing enrollment of two Phase II trials of OTEZLA in
atopic dermatitis and possibly ulcerative colitis.
We are also advancing the development of GED-0301, including: the publication of the [ph] IDENT-1 (29:05) Phase II
trial in Crohn's disease in a major medical journal; initiating all components of the GED-0301 registration program for
Crohn's disease; and exploring the clinical development for GED-0301 in ulcerative colitis. Finally, we plan on moving
forward other key clinical programs such as CC-220 and sotatercept forward through significant milestones in 2015.
We are very excited about the momentum that has been created over the last year. We are looking forward to further
accelerating all key aspects of the I&I franchise as we move into 2015.
Thank you all for your attention, and I'd like to turn the call over to Mark.
Mark J. Alles
Thank you, Scott. Thanks, Jackie and Peter, and good morning, everyone.
2014 was truly an outstanding year for Celgene. The momentum from our core businesses positions us for another year
of strong growth and excellent results. Let me briefly add my perspective to close the call.
At Celgene, everything flows from our mission to help people with serious diseases, and everything we do is aligned
with our five strategic imperatives: deliver operating excellence; capitalize on our global leadership in hematology;
expand our oncology franchise; build our immune/inflammatory franchise; and accelerate the pace of disruptive
innovation. Our mission drives us to set ambitious targets, and our strategic imperatives help us realize the enormous
potential for scientific breakthroughs and sustained long-term growth.
Our business model is working well. We enter 2015 with excellent momentum and clarity on the significant
opportunities before us. Our teams are energized and confident. Supported by the compelling value proposition of our
therapies, we expect market share gains, longer duration of therapy, launches of new indications, new treatment
strategies, and the continuous flow of new clinical data to combine to deliver robust year-on-year sales growth and
operating leverage.
This slide summarizes our major milestones for the year. More than that, it represents the opportunities we have to fully
capitalize on the potential of our broad and deep hematology pipeline and to optimize the value of ABRAXANE in
multiple solid tumor indications and novel immuno-oncology treatment strategies. This slide also reflects our
determination and ambition to build Celgene's I&I franchise into a premier developer of innovative therapies for
serious immune and inflammatory diseases and a significant contributor to our success.
We are confident that the key growth drivers are in place to meet or exceed our 2015 and longer-term financial targets.
Label expansions, new products, and our ability to execute provide great clarity on our opportunities from now and
through the next several years.
Under the leadership of Tom Daniel, our early drug development and research teams and partner companies are
creating significant future opportunities by advancing high-potential molecules through our dedicated protein
homeostasis, epigenetics, and immuno-oncology centers of excellence. Our integrated and distributed R&D model is
productive and working well, and it is just one of the many reasons why we believe the promise and potential of
Celgene is greater than ever.
Thank you very much. Operator, please open the call for questions.

Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matt Roden of UBS. Your line is now
open.
<Q - Matthew M. Roden>: Great, good morning. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the progress here. So
lots of chatter from the PBMs and in the market as well about value for medicines. It seems to me that REVLIMID is in
a good spot here given the lack of therapeutic equivalents. But as a bellwether in space, I wonder if you could make a
general comment on what you're seeing across geographies on pricing and maybe specifically what impact, if any,
you're seeing on your product lines. It doesn't seem like you're seeing much from the waterfall plots that, Peter, you
showed, but any commentary would be helpful along those lines. Thanks a lot.
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: Before maybe Jackie gives a little bit more color on REVLIMID specifically or others, I think
you know, Matt. Our strategy for many years now has been that pharmacoeconomics, health technology assessment,
the whole value proposition has to be core to everything we do, whether that's clinical development, early development,
regulatory, commercial operations, et cetera, and that hasn't changed in any way, shape, or form. We're committed to
ensuring that our products have the value proposition that supports their access to patients, to physicians, the
availability of physicians to prescribe them. So we feel very good about where we are, and there isn't anything
fundamentally changed. I think our results indicate the success of really making sure that our products' value
proposition is solid in geographies all around the world.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: I would just maybe add a little bit that when you start with differentiated science, you
produce differentiated outcomes. And then you have the right teams working on reimbursement and market access
issues with specific country expertise around the world, and you build those relationships with the authorities. You put
yourself in a very good position to have an objective discussion about the value proposition. I think you've seen that
with respect to how we have dealt with the pricing issues over the last two or three years. And if you go back and look
at the impact on the company, I think it becomes pretty clear that we've got a differentiated proposition. We're not
naive about it, but we've got teams that are very focused on that, and we'll continue to do so.
<Q - Matthew M. Roden>: Thanks very much.
<A - Peter N. Kellogg>: Good morning, Matt, and I'll just add. The only point is that as we build out our projections
into the future, as Jackie said, we do use all the experience we have in these markets to have a very realistic view of
pricing, so it's all part of equation we think about. And as we develop drugs, as we're developing target product
profiles, we are very conscious of this, and I think it's become a standard in the industry. You really have to think about
how differentiated and how much value-add you're bringing so you can assure yourself, even as you're designing your
trials that you've got the data to support your position.
<Q - Matthew M. Roden>: Understood, thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Thanks for taking my question. I was just curious. From the psoriasis market standpoint,
when do you think we could start seeing the first step edits to use your product ahead of biologics?
And then the second question on that point is there are several other oral pills that look safe that are being developed,
so the landscape could change. When you were developing the drug knowing that you could you have competition
down the line, how were you thinking about how quickly you have to get OTEZLA entrenched in the market to
compete with these products? Thanks.
<A - Scott Andrew Smith>: Thank you very much, Robyn. I think we've already seen some plans taking the decision
to put OTEZLA ahead of biologic therapy. It's not a large part of the market at this point in time. But we're seeing some

plans starting to take those decisions, particularly as we guide into late 2014 and early 2015, and we hope to continue to
work on that throughout 2015 and beyond. It's a very important principle. We've seen some and we hope to see more.
In terms of other products, I think what we see when we take a look at our products with OTEZLA is we see continuing
strong efficacy over time. In both indications, we see long-term safety, which is creating a different benefit/risk type
profile than we see in the market today. So we feel very confident about the profile that's emerging for OTEZLA. And
our belief around other orals in development is we've got a significant runway here to really dominate and entrench in
the marketplace until they come.
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Can I ask one follow-up just on that? When you think about 2017 and the hockey stick that
has to happen for OTEZLA in your guidance, can you give us a sense, even qualitatively or quantitatively? What
percentage of plans have to have those step edits in place, do you think, for you to hit the guidance for OTEZLA?
<A - Scott Andrew Smith>: Thanks, Robyn. I think it's much more multi-factorial than that. If you take a look, we just
have one quarter of psoriasis launch. This will be the first full year of psoriasis and PsA launch in the U.S. We'll be
bringing Europe on board, and there will be reimbursement and launches happening throughout the course of the year.
You get into 2016 and you really see the geographic spread and the impact from both indications in the U.S. and
beyond. That to me is the main driver of those forecasts in the future.
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Okay, thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham of Barclays. Your line is now open.
<Q - Geoffrey C. Meacham>: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question, a quick one on ABRAXANE.
When you guys look at the three indications in the U.S., clearly pancreatic has been a driver and been a successful
launch. But looking forward though, what do you guys see as a gating factor for broader adoption in pancreatic? And
when you look at breast and lung, are those indications – should we assume that those indications are fairly mature?
And this is obviously prior to having any additional data, and you guys are obviously studying ABRAXANE in
multiple combinations in those indications. I was just thinking in the nearer term, say in the next one- to two-year
timeframe. Thank you.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Thanks, so a couple of things. With respect to pancreas, what we've seen in the U.S.,
where we've been out the longest, the ABRAXANE/gemcitabine combination is quickly becoming a standard of care.
As we launch in other markets around the world, we would expect to see that same type of ramp-up. So that should be a
nice driver for that indication, the geographic expansion, on an ongoing basis.
When we then look on to lung and breast, I think the lung indication is particularly exciting for a lot of reasons. We
never included in any of our models previously an approval for lung in Europe. We now have that positive CHMP
opinion in hand. And we are seeing a significant amount of interest to study ABRAXANE in combination with novel
agents, particularly in non-small-cell lung cancer, but in other tumor types as well. But given where some of those
novel agents are in their development, lung may be the nearer-term opportunity with some of those combination
studies. So you're going to hear more about that over time.
And I think it's important to just keep in mind that the global approvals for ABRAXANE across these indications put
the product in a great place with respect to these combination studies and the potential for interest to continue to pursue
those, as they will be able to be global studies.
Lastly in breast, you saw the GeparSepto data presented back in December in San Antonio. That's been very positive
new data for us. So we're out there making sure that that has broad dissemination in the medical community. We think
that is going to be positive for breast. And we've got some other things like that coming along this year. We've got an
Italian cooperative group trial that could read out in 2015 that would further enhance the new breast data for
ABRAXANE. So all of those things put us in a great place.

And just a quick note on the long-term targets; we have not included anything in those yet for the potential coming out
of our immuno-oncology efforts with these combination therapies for ABRAXANE or any of the other compounds that
we have in our portfolio that we might study in combination for various tumor types. So that's a upside potential that
we have, and you'll hear more about that as those play out.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges of Bernstein. Your line is now open.
<Q - Geoffrey Craig Porges>: Thanks very much for the question; one for Scott, one for Jackie, if I may. Scott, could
you just give us some more information about retreatment for GED-0301. With the 52-week data, is there any
retreatment in that, or how are you going to approach that?
And then, Jackie, just on REVLIMID, looking ahead at your guidance, it looks as though you've got a steady slowdown
in your growth. You were 16%, then 15% adjusted for currency, now it looks as though it's 12% – 12.5% going
forward to 2017. And given that you have lymphoma/CLL in front of you and you also have the front-line approval in
the U.S. and Europe, to what extent is that conservative given those opportunities? Thanks.
<A - Scott Andrew Smith>: Just on GED-0301, the overall structure of the treat-through, the two major treat-through
52-week trials will be initiating midyear. They will have an induction component, 12-week induction component, and
then a longer-term maintenance component, but they won't be separate studies. It will be treating through the whole
way. There is no design idea right now that there would be randomized withdrawal and retreatment within that
particular study. So those would be two 52-week treat-through, three-arm studies; approximately in those two, 2,000
patients required for the safety database.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: And just on the REVLIMID growth, so the guidance that we have given at the midpoint of
the range has the growth, including the negative currency impact, at 13.5%. If you exclude that currency impact for
2015, the growth rate globally would be 15%.
A couple of things with respect to that; in terms of the European contribution from newly diagnosed because we have
to go through the reimbursement discussions country by country, we have made some assumptions about what that will
look like, and you would see a significant acceleration from the European contribution to growth in 2016 and beyond,
with some contribution already in 2015. Whether we've been a little bit conservative about how quickly we ramp in
Europe or not, I don't know, but we probably have been a bit conservative in those assumptions.
The other thing that we have been conservative regarding would be the evolution of treatments with the readouts of the
triplet regimens. And we probably have not fully baked in the potential impact on duration coming from that ongoing
readout of data from the triplet regimens.
We've also taken into consideration some potential for a price erosion, notably in Europe, and that would be something
that we'll see how that plays out for the last one, two, three years. We found that we've been a bit conservative with
respect to what we've assumed might happen with price erosion outside of the U.S. So we'll see how that goes.

Thank you. Our question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
<Q - Cory W. Kasimov>: Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my question. I wanted to go back to OTEZLA. I'm
wondering if you can comment on what you're seeing with the conversion rate from the initial titration in starter packs
to revenue-generating scripts. And also, anything you can say on the persistency or dropout trends at this early stage
and how this may or may not be different between psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis? Thanks.
<A - Scott Andrew Smith>: Thanks. The vast majority of the patients, I don't have an exact number. It's variable
month by month. But the vast majority of patients who are going on titration and bridging are ultimately ending up on

commercial packs. It's more a matter of the length of time that that is taking. The average is approximately 28 days
once a patient starts initiation to getting on. We're not losing a lot of patients in that time.
Relative to persistency, I'm a little reluctant until you get a year's worth of data to really make anything solid around
persistency. But I can say what we're seeing is at or above what our expectations were. It looks like what we saw in the
clinical trial program, where it was very good persistency at one year and two years. So I don't want to be too definitive
on it because you definitely need some period of time. But overall persistency is trending I think quite well and a little
bit ahead of where we expected it.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.
<Q - Eric Thomas Schmidt>: Maybe another question for Scott on the GED-0301 program. It doesn't look like the
endoscopy study is on ClinicalTrials.gov, so we don't really know much about the design there. But do you need to
complete part of that study before you kick off the two next trials? And it looks like on the slides that the induction
studies have a four-week primary endpoint. Is that all that you'll require for FDA approval? And lastly, what's the
dosing regimen in the induction studies, how frequent?
<A - Scott Andrew Smith>: So they're not induction studies. It's a treat-through overall protocol. So just to go through
the various components there, what we're doing, after regulatory advice, the startup time for studies is usually six to
eight months. We are in that phase now for the two large treat-through studies. In the meantime, we're initiating and are
initiating right now the endoscopic study. The purpose of that endoscopic study is to match up clinical symptom
resolution with positive histologic changes, and also further explore durability from the initial induction and how long
those effects are durable.
Because of the timing of it, we have an interim analysis planned. We should be able to cut that, and that can inform the
two larger treat-through studies, but we are not waiting for that data. It should come in a way in which we could do
some adaptation of the longer-term studies if we needed to. So we're going quickly but thoughtfully I think with the
feedback that we receive from regulatory authorities.
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: Dosing.
<A - Scott Andrew Smith>: And in terms of dosing, we will be looking at one induction regimen in the treat-through
and then different maintenance regimens as we go through. We're finalizing that based on some final back-and-forth
from regulatory authorities. But it will be one dose for a period of time during the 12-week induction period, primary
endpoint of four weeks. And then we would have three separate different varied maintenance regimens that would look
at durability through 52 weeks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
<Q - Mark Schoenebaum>: Hey, guys. Thanks, I really appreciate it. First of all, congrats, Scott, on the total. I think
the numbers are looking better than a lot of us armchair observers thought they might, so well done on that. And just to
follow up on Eric's question, the endoscopy data that you guys will have in-house next year, do you plan on releasing
that to the Street? Yes or no, and if so, when?
And then my second was just on REVLIMID and lymphoma. If the FDA agrees that durable complete response is
indeed a reliable surrogate for survival, when would that enable you to file for approval of REVLIMID in NHL? Thank
you – in follicular NHL?
<A - Scott Andrew Smith>: The data from endoscopy study will be an interim look. It won't be full data, so there
won't be a lot of external visibility around that. Also, this data is probably likely to be an important part of the

regulatory package, and so we need to consider how that fits into the overall regulatory filing and when we can get that
data out. As soon as we can get that data out in the appropriate form, we'll make sure we get it. It's a 52-week study as
well, but we're just going to take an earlier cut and an interim look. So it will be some time until that data is available,
but we're looking forward to getting that out.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: And just on the REVLIMID follicular filing, so if we take – a few months ago, the
RELEVANCE trial was fully enrolled. If we can use that 30-month endpoint to go out and you get to a readout in, call
it, early 2017, and filing sometime in the middle to second half of 2017, then that would be two to three years earlier
than if you don't use that surrogate endpoint. And we have not assumed that we would have that earlier path in our
financial model for now.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber of Citi. Your line is now open.
<Q - Yaron B. Werber>: Great, thanks so much. I have a couple of questions, if you don't mind, one on ABRAXANE
and for Jackie. The GeparSepto data was pretty interesting and it sounds like you're alluding that there might be an
additional Italian study. It wasn't clear whether that's neo-adjuvant too. I was wondering. Can you file on that?
And then secondly, the tnAcity study, that's the triple-negative first-line. It's a Phase II/III with a lead-in into a Phase
III; might have data late this year or early next year. So I'm trying to figure out. Is that fileable?
And then three, if you don't mind, I notice with Acceleron, it sounds like there is no mention on starting Phase III in
MDS this year. Is that getting pushed out to early next year? Thank you.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Thanks, Yaron. Real quick just on the Acceleron, I actually in my comments did say that
we will be making a decision on sotatercept or luspatercept for advancing in both beta-thalassemia and MDS this year.
So that is on track for this year. You will hear more about that relatively soon, so that's completely on track.
With respect to the GeparSepto and other data, the team some years ago put together a nice strategy for running these,
working with cooperative groups on these different trials. The ETNA Italian group trial is also in neo-adjuvant, the trial
designed slightly different than GeparSepto, but it's the same patient group. And we are now looking at what the
different approaches to registration would be with those, the GeparSepto data and potentially with the Italian data as
well. So we're working through that right now with the German Breast Group, and you'll hear more about what we
think about that.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
<Q - Terence C. Flynn>: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. The first one for me is I noticed in your release you
talked about initiating a Phase III trial of REVLIMID maintenance in newly diagnosed patients post-transplant that are
minimal residual disease positive. I'm just wondering if you can provide some thoughts there in terms of the design, the
rationale behind that study.
And then the second question I had was, Jackie, at ASH you talked about a $3 billion figure for your AML/MDS
franchise. Longer term, I'm just wondering if you can give us any more insight in the drivers there. Thank you.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Let me take the second part of the question first. When you look across the development
portfolio now in AG-221, sotatercept or luspatercept in MDS and how those things and the trials that we have ongoing
with our internal compounds, the QUASAR program layer across the different patient segments in MDS and AML, you
start to see a very nice picture emerging of the potential for those trials to give us data that would allow us to file for
different patient subsets within those indications and cover a broader group of patients across MDS and AML than
what we have today. That's in addition to the positive trial readout that we already have for REVLIMID in the

non-deletion of 5q population, which opens that one up significantly in terms of the numbers of patients that we can
access.
So when we look out at that franchise and the unmet medical need there, we see significant potential for that franchise
to grow over the next few years from a very good base today, but with many more products and across many more
indications and covering a broader set of those patients. So that's why we're so optimistic about that and then the unique
profile of products like AG-221, which are somewhat more targeted therapies.
Just on your other question, which is the MRD positive trial, we know that this finding, this marker or way of looking
at things is something that could apply not only to myeloma, but we think it's particularly important in myeloma. And
we and others have been exploring this approach with the regulators and the medical community. We have support for
looking at that. And as we're ready to disclose a little bit more some of the details about that trial and its design, which
we're working on now, we're fully supportive of the concept and think that we would be leaders in this area. You'll hear
a bit more from us about that over the course of the year, but we have made the decision to move forward with that
trial.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Mehrotra of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
<Q - Ravi Mehrotra>: Thanks for taking my question. For Scott, on GED-0301, I noticed your comments about the
additional use, the indication. Can you give us any color firstly on any additional formulation production work you may
need for UC? And secondly, any color on the development program; are we right in assuming you'll need some sort of
Phase II study before going to Phase III? Thank you.
<A - Scott Andrew Smith>: We're ongoing synographic work right now with the current formulation to see exactly
where it's released throughout the GI system to make sure we've got delivery to the appropriate parts of the GI system.
If not, there can be some tweaks made to the pH-dependent release system on the coating. So that work should finish
up very quickly, and we can then make a determination on whether the drug is being released appropriately and where.
And then at that point, depending on how we see it, then we would move either into a Phase II proof-of-concept
moving to Phase III, but that needs to be decided. Right now we're focused on that synographic work. But we think,
given what we've seen in Crohn's disease, there's a tremendous opportunity in ulcerative colitis for this product as well.
And it looks like we might have a good chance that the current formulation will be fine. If not, we believe it will only
be a minor tweak to the existing formulation.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Birchenough of BMO. Your line is now open.
<Q - Nicholas Abbott>: Good morning, it's Nick in for Jim this morning. Thanks for taking my question, a two-part if
I may. Yaron asked the question on tnAcity, but it was not answered, so I can ask it as well I guess. We know it's as a
Phase II/III study. On ClinicalTrials.gov, you have Phase II data at the end of the year. Can you let us know a little bit
about the design of this study, how many patients are in Phase II versus Phase III?
And then in terms of one of your new compounds that has gone into the clinic, CC-90002, the anti-CD47, can you
summarize perhaps what the properties of the antibody are and some of the challenges that you face in terms of
protecting healthy cells, red blood cells, as opposed to obviously targeting tumor cells for that pathway? Thanks.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: So yes, I'm glad you reminded me about – I was sitting here thinking I didn't answer
Yaron's question on tnAcity. So it is a Phase II/III design. We should have the Phase II data later this year. We'll be
making the decision on how we move into Phase III. The Phase II patient numbers, if I'm not mistaken, are around 240
or so. And the Phase III would be randomized and the Phase III would be about 550.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya of Nomura Securities. Your line is now open.
<Q - M. Ian Somaiya>: Thank you. I wanted to follow up on maybe comments you made on REVLIMID pricing and
then on long-term guidance. On REVLIMID pricing, just how should we think about the label expansion that's
upcoming and how that could play into pricing? Should we assume a price cut at that time point? And in terms of
long-term guidance, specifically 2020, can you just help us further tease out pipeline contribution, specifically partner
drugs, which are included in the three percentage point contribution that you spoke to?
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Yes, thanks. So with respect to the pricing discussions, it will be a country-by-country
discussion, as I think everybody is familiar with. There are some countries that will have early access, Germany,
Austria, Netherlands, those typical countries. It will be quite early. Just because REVLIMID was approved before [ph]
AMNOT [1:01:12], we've had this question a few times. We don't have to go through or won't have an [ph] AMNOT
[1:01:16] review later for that because REVLIMID was approved before that process. So Germany is definitely an early
access country. And then again, we've got people in the countries that are on top of this, ready to go have those
discussions as soon as we get the EMEA ratification of the CHMP approval or positive recommendation. So we're
ready to go, but it will be a staged process, which is why we have regularly talked about the fact that we'll get some
contribution from this in Europe during 2015, but it will really start to ramp up and contribute more significantly in
2016 and beyond.
<A - Peter N. Kellogg>: Thank you, Jackie. This is Peter. On the question of the long-term guidance to 2020, as we've
discussed, I think the deck that we originally presented at the conference earlier this month broke this out nicely, so I'd
encourage you to refer to that because we actually highlight some of the things that are in, if you will, the base
assumptions through 2017 and then relevant to your question, what do we think about relative to what might contribute
by 2020, and then what things did we not include. I think that's an important distinction because we had to go through
and think about the timelines of our partnered assets and so forth. But in each franchise we thought about that. And I
wouldn't read too much into exactly how we placed things because we were just using a scenario to build it out. And as
I highlighted, the scenarios can be different.
Clearly, the 15 points of growth is coming from the existing products we have today and the indications that we really
have good information about. Beyond that, we're looking at products such as the Acceleron assets or the Agios assets
that could come into play to contribute that additional three points. Quite frankly, in addition to that, things like
REVLIMID in lymphoma really is a whole area that we have I think a lot of potential on, but that's also in that three
points of growth. So really as Jackie has highlighted, that could be a very big opportunity and maybe we've
underestimated that; we'll see.
Furthermore, as you get into oncology, we're thinking about things like ABRAXANE in triple-negative adjuvant
pancreatic cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer in Europe and so forth. So I think in I&I as well, I don't know if this is
exactly what you're referring to, but clearly we had GED-0301 in that space. It's a little hard to measure exactly what
the timeline and contribution will be in its first year or two based until we really see all the final data. And then of
course, there's OTEZLA in additional indications that might come along. And then finally, sotatercept could be a
player.
I think one of the things that's probably key is not to be too precise in saying exactly what do we assume is in there or
not in there because we have so much optionality that's positive. We have quite a few assets that could be contributing
to the 3% of growth. And then quite frankly, we've got a number of other assets that we haven't even included that
could as we go through time come into the timeframe and be contributors that we may incorporate in the future. So
overall, it's a very broad portfolio, and we feel very good about the guidance.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.

<Q - Michael J. Yee>: Hi, thanks, two quick ones. One is can you remind us about OTEZLA pricing in Europe, how
we should be thinking about that, but also the rate of adoption, utilization of a new oral player versus say the U.S., what
should we be thinking about?
And the second question was to follow up on the last comment on long-term guidance, specifically for I&I, where you
have that $700 million [ph] payable (1:03:22) expansion, new products bucket. Is it safe to say the vast majority of that
is GED? And what type of assumptions did you make in the vast majority of that [ph] $700 million? Thank you.
(1:03:34)
<A - Scott Andrew Smith>: Pricing in Europe, we're going to take the same strategy as we have in the United States,
where we're going to be at a meaningful discount to average biologic price. It helps force or helps encourage the
pre-biologic utilization of the drug, and we see that be the majority of the utilization in the U.S., so we're going to go
with a similar strategy. Biologic price points are variable by country in Europe, but they are generally lower than we
see in the U.S. But we will have the same kind of strategy, a significant discount to the average biologic price.
Rate of uptake in Europe, it gets blended. It's difficult to make a blanket conclusion because you have some early
adoption countries and you've got some countries which are slower to adopt. I think some of the early adoption
countries will have a higher initial rate of utilization than you see in the U.S., and some of the ones without
reimbursement will be slower. So it's a blended picture. But we think it's similar to what we see in the U.S. that there's
a really tremendous opportunity for an oral product with a differentiated benefit/risk profile, and the right kind of
pricing strategy and the right kind of evidence around value. We think there's a tremendous opportunity in Europe for
OTEZLA.
<A - Peter N. Kellogg>: And the for 2020, on the incremental $750 million, I would say there are multiple parts. Scott,
I don't know if you want to comment on how we thought about it for GED-0301. But in general, it's comprised of both
GED-0301 but also CC-220, sotatercept, and OTEZLA in additional indications. Any comment that you would add?
<A - Scott Andrew Smith>: Yes, those are all included in that 2020, at this point heavily risk adjusted because they
are programs which we don't have registration evidence on. They're risk adjusted appropriately for their stage in
development. But you'll start to see major impact of those molecules as you get out to the 2019, 2020, 2021 timeframe.
<A - Peter N. Kellogg>: Great. So, operator, given the time, we'll take two more questions.

Perfect, our next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond of Robert Baird. Your line is now open.
<Q - Christopher J. Raymond>: Hey, thanks for letting me ask a question, so just a question back on ABRAXANE. I
think, Jackie, you alluded in the Q3 call to competitive pressure, and it looks like you've been able to deal with that
fairly effectively with the bounce back in Q4. But I guess looking forward, especially in the context of the guidance,
having continued growth here, can you maybe talk about – there's another drug very similar to ABRAXANE in
development, the Sorrento drug. How should we think about that just given its similarity in mechanism? And also some
of the data that they've shown recently, if you could put that into context for us, that would be great. Thanks.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Thanks, so a couple things. Just specifically with ABRAXANE, what we have seen is,
with the trials that we have talked about, the cooperative groups, and then the things that we're doing ourselves, where
you might imagine that when we make decisions to continue to invest in these different patient segment trials that we
see something that gives us optimism or confidence in our ability to continue to expand the label for ABRAXANE.
And as you saw the GeparSepto readout and as you'll see other things, I think you're starting to see clear evidence of
that. So we feel great about the product's differentiated position in the marketplace.
With respect to the potential competitor product, it is a different technology, so it can't make some of the same claims
around the NAB technology. It is different. I would also just say you'll have to watch for this as it plays out over time.
We have a strong belief that pharmacokinetic data in the plasma readouts is not necessarily telling you what's

happening at the level of the tumor with respect to activity for the product. So we do think that we've got a nice body of
clinical data, including trials, where we showed differentiated outcomes in the indications with the clinical trials, the
full-blown clinical trials for those, and that we've got a very strong case to make medically for ABRAXANE
differentiation.
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: Just because I think we're going to go with one more question, Peter, I'm struck by the
conversation this morning in that when we think about where Celgene is today and this notion of value proposition and
how we're evolving along with how the macro environment around the world is evolving, payers, governments, et
cetera, you can think of the Celgene portfolio today and as it's evolving through our R&D effort where we're redefining
clinical endpoints with regulators. So the notion of minimal residual disease, pathologically complete response, these
are surrogates for patient outcomes, where because blood cancer patients are living 10-plus years now, we have to
redefine these endpoints for drug development and for differentiated outcomes.
Think of our original targeted population with REVLIMID of deletion 5q MDS. So we've been in this space a long
time. The triple-negative discussion is interesting because it is the highest unmet medical need in the curative setting
and the metastatic setting for breast cancer. And we find ourselves right at the apex of what's happening to try to
discover new ways to treat those patients.
I think the IO market that is emerging and one could say really is now established in the form of multiple PD-1, PD-L1
approaches, we find ourselves in a position with ABRAXANE where we synergize with those antibodies, and it's
steroid-free. So some simple things build our confidence again about our portfolio and our R&D approach. And this all
lines up with great differentiated patient outcome and we think sustainable value propositions with payers.

And our last question comes from the line of Salveen Richter of SunTrust. Your line is now open.
<Q - Salveen Kaur Richter>: Thanks for taking my question. Jackie, just wondering if you could help us with the
outlook with the longer-term guidance that you provided, how we should think about assumptions for REVLIMID
expansion into indications such as follicular lymphoma, whether the FLASH study could enable earlier data – or the
FLASH data could enable earlier registration here and then for CLL as well. Thank you.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Yes, I think – so we have in the long-term guidance not assumed accelerated pathways.
We've assumed standard pathways. I think in response to another question, we talked about how if the durable CR
endpoint is accepted, it could be a two to three-year earlier readout on that particular trial. So the contribution from
REVLIMID in the lymphomas is out in that period beyond 2017, and it would be ramping up beyond that, so we think
there's a lot of potential there. We haven't included anything. We have not included anything in the model for CLL, just
to be clear about that, as we don't have that data in hand and it's a very competitive space. So I think we've got nice
optionality in the lymphoma program for the longer term.
Robert J. Hugin
Jackie, thank you very much, and thanks, everybody on the call, for staying with us a little bit longer today. A few folks
probably didn't get their questions asked or if there are other questions you want to ask, our IR team is available. I'm
available. So we will be happy to take calls in our IR office as we go through the rest of the day.
Again, just to recap, we're very excited about the performance of 2014 obviously, but more importantly, what it says
about our strategic opportunities going forward. And I think as Mark commented, we're in a very exciting space. We've
got a lot of great data coming our way. We have nice long-lived assets. We've given long-term guidance to give you a
feel for how we see things could evolve very clearly, and we are going to be working very hard on building and
continuing to build the pipeline and the potential growth drivers that will even push us past those goals. So thank you
very much. It's an exciting start to 2015, and we'll talk to you soon.
