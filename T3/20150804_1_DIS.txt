Thanks, Lowell, and good afternoon, everyone. Before we begin, I'd like to welcome our new CFO, Christine
McCarthy. Christine has done a great job as the company's Treasurer over the past 15 years. She's highly respected in
the financial community, and her strong leadership and keen financial acumen make her ideal for the role of CFO. I'm
sure you'll all have the opportunity to get to know her, and you'll be hearing from her a little later.
Now turning to the quarter, we were very pleased with our performance in Q3 with record net income and earnings per
share. Diluted EPS increased 13% to $1.45, and revenue was up 5% to more than $13 billion with strong results across
the board. Since our last earnings call, we had the pleasure of unveiling the exciting details of Shanghai Disneyland,
and with a 60-year history of relentless innovation, fantastic storytelling, and extraordinary experiences, we're creating
a truly one-of-a-kind world-class destination. Shanghai Disneyland will have six theme lands featuring the best of what
everyone knows and loves about Disney Parks as well as a number of amazing original attractions created specifically
for Shanghai, resulting in an authentically Disney and distinctly Chinese Disneyland.
I'm happy to say that since we unveiled the details, the response in China has been tremendous with nearly 150 million
people expressing their excitement on the country's top social media platforms. This investment represents one of the
biggest creative endeavors undertaken by the company. And with an opening planned for spring of 2016, we're truly
excited by the potential in the world's most populous market. For those of you have haven't seen the great images and
details of Shanghai Disneyland, you can view them online at shanghaidisneyresort.com, and I think you'll be
impressed.
Before Tom takes you through the highlights of our businesses, I'd like to address an issue that has been receiving a fair
amount of interest and attention these days, and that's the rapidly changing media landscape, especially as it relates to
ESPN.
We're realists about the business and about the impact technology has had on how product is distributed, marketed, and
consumed. We're also quite mindful of potential trends among younger audiences in particular, many of whom
consume television in very different ways than the generations before them. Economics have also played a part in
change, and both cost and value are under a consumer microscope. All of this has and will continue to put pressure on
the multi-channel ecosystem, which has seen a decline in overall households as well as growth in so-called skinny or
cable-light packages. ESPN has experienced some modest sub losses, although those have been less than reported by
one of the prominent research firms. And the vast majority of them, 80%, were due to decreases in multi-channel
households with only a small percentage due to skinny packages.
Overall, though, we believe the expanded basic package will remain the dominant package of choice for some years to
come because of the quality and variety it represents for a price that is generally considered fair and appropriate. We
also see the continued development of new platforms with smaller channel offerings, which we see as a positive trend
for us, since ESPN is a must-have brand as part of the initial service offering for these new packages. And we all know
why this is.
ESPN is the number one brand in sports media and one of the most valuable brands in all of sports, and among the most
popular, respected, and valuable brands in media by consumers, advertisers, and distributors. This is supported by the
fact that in the first calendar quarter of this year alone, 83% of all multi-channel households turned to ESPN at some
point. ESPN has the most significant collection of sports program packages in the industry, and its license agreements
for these sports typically run into the next decade, including the NFL, the NBA, and Major League Baseball. Its
coverage of college sports is unparalleled, particularly football and basketball, and the first year of the college football
playoff and national championship was an enormous success. ESPN's rights to this fantastic package have 11 years to
run.
And we all know how valuable live programming has become, and ESPN is the leader in live programming. 96% of all
sports programming is watched live, and this is particularly valuable in today's rapidly changing advertising
marketplace. This year's upfront provided ample proof. ESPN enjoyed both increased demand and sell-through rates as
well as pricing increases.

And ESPN has embraced technology better than anyone in traditional media, reaching its fans and engaging with them
in more meaningful ways online and on mobile devices with its linear channels as well as with an array of additional
programming, sports information, commentary, conversation, and very rich social media features. All of this adds up to
a very strong hand and gives us enormous confidence in ESPN's future, no matter how technology disrupts the media
business.
And now, I'll turn it over to Tom to take you through the highlights across the rest of our businesses. Tom?
Thomas O. Staggs
Thank you, Bob. Good afternoon, everyone. The core part of our strategy and a key source of sustained advantage for
Disney is developing and leveraging our powerful brands and franchises across our many lines of business and
distribution channels. Our investments in Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm underscore and dramatically enhance that
advantage.
The benefit of our strategy is evident in this quarter's results as our branded content led to healthy increases in
operating income at our Parks and Resorts, Studio Entertainment, and Consumer Products segment. Parks and Resorts
had their highest quarter ever in Q3 in terms of both revenue and operating income. We've seen remarkable excitement
for Disneyland's 60th Anniversary Diamond Celebration which features a new fireworks show, an electrifying
nighttime parade and a reimagined World of Color spectacular, resulting in the highest attendance and profit for any
quarter in the Resort's history.
At Walt Disney World, attendance hit a record level for Q3 while also delivering the highest profit for any previous
quarter for that location. The Studio continues to execute extremely well in our branded tentpole strategy by delivering
high quality, immensely creative, and broadly appealing theatrical entertainment. Three of the top six films in the U.S.
this year are from Disney – Cinderella, Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron, and DisneyPixar's Inside Out. And all three
helped drive our strong results in the quarter.
Inside Out has grossed $330 million in the U.S. and more than $600 million worldwide with more overseas markets yet
to open. Avengers: Age of Ultron is now the sixth highest grossing film of all-time with $1.4 billion at the box office.
Ant-Man, the newest character to join the Marvel cinematic universe, spent its first two weekends at number one and
has already grossed nearly $300 million worldwide with multiple overseas markets yet to open.
And we're extremely pleased with another great original DisneyPixar film, The Good Dinosaur, coming this
Thanksgiving. Of course, we're all counting the days until December 18, when Star Wars: The Force Awakens makes
its much anticipated debut, that's just about 135 days and 10 hours from now, in case you're wondering. To give you a
sense of the excitement for this film, a single Star Wars panel at Comic-Con this year drove 1.6 billion social and
editorial impressions. Following The Force Awakens, we'll release the first standalone Star Wars film, Rogue One,
which is currently in production and will be released December 16, 2016. It will be followed by Episode VIII, the Star
Wars saga in May of 2017. We'll come back in 2018 with a standalone film about young Han Solo, and then Episode
IX will hit theaters in 2019. And that's just the theatrical lineup.
On August 30, we'll launch the Star Wars themed Disney Infinity 3.0 Edition, followed by an unprecedented Consumer
Products global event called Force Friday on September 4. Stores around the world will open their doors at 12:01 A.M.
to unveil an amazing array of merchandise inspired by Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Of course, Star Wars is already
a strong contributor among our broad array of powerful franchises for our Consumer Products business, where profits
were up substantially in the quarter led by the collective strength of Frozen, Avengers and Star Wars.
Our Cable Networks benefited from strong original programming at the Disney Channels and ABC Family, with both
contributed nicely to Cable operating income growth in the quarter. In Broadcasting, ABC was the only TV network
with year-to-year primetime ratings growth this past season, thanks to the success of our lineup of returning and new hit
shows, including Scandal, How to Get Away with Murder, black-ish, and Fresh Off the Boat. ABC also received the
most Emmy nominations of any broadcast network this year, 42 in all, including 10 for the critically acclaimed series,

American Crime. Looking ahead, we're optimistic about ABC's fall lineup, whose advertisers have responded by
agreeing to give ABC industry-leading pricing gains in our just completed upfront.
As Bob said, we're pleased with our results in Q3. We remain confident in our ability to create significant value for our
shareholders. We've a lot to look forward to across all of our businesses in both the near-term and the years ahead.
With that, I'm extremely pleased to welcome Christine to her new role and turn the call over to her to take you through
additional details for the quarter.
Christine M. McCarthy
Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. It's a pleasure to be here on my first earnings call, and I look forward to
working with many of you more closely in the near future. With three quarters of the fiscal year behind us, we are very
pleased with how the year is progressing. Third quarter earnings per share increased 13% to a record $1.45, driven by
strength across our businesses.
At Media Networks, growth in operating income was due to higher results at Cable, partially offset by lower results at
Broadcasting. Cable operating income was higher in the third quarter due to growth at Disney Channels, ABC Family,
and ESPN. Disney Channels and ABC Family results benefited from program sales and higher affiliate revenue, while
growth at ESPN was driven by higher affiliate revenue partially offset by a 3% decline in advertising revenue. The
decrease in ad revenue at ESPN was due to a difficult comparison with the men's World Cup in Q3 last year, which
more than offset the benefit of an additional game of the NBA Finals in Q3 this year. We estimate that ESPN's ad
revenue was up a little over 5% when you exclude the impact of these events. So far this quarter, ESPN ad sales are
pacing up compared to prior year
Programming and production costs at Cable were relatively flat in the quarter, consistent with our expectations, and we
still expect these costs to be up low-teen percentage points for the full year. Domestic Cable affiliate revenue was up
mid-single digits in the quarter as a result of contractual rate increases and the addition of the SEC Network, which
launched in August of last year. These increases were partially offset by lower deferred revenue recognition at ESPN. If
you recall, ESPN recognized $176 million in previously deferred revenue during Q3 last year, and there was no
deferred revenue recognized in the third quarter this year. Excluding the effect of the deferred revenue recognition last
year, domestic Cable affiliate revenue was up 12%.
Broadcasting operating income was lower in the third quarter, as higher programming costs and lower advertising
revenue more than offset increases in affiliate revenue and higher program sales. The growth in affiliate revenue was
due to new contracts and higher contractual rates. Program sales were up in the quarter driven by the sale of a number
of shows including Grey's Anatomy, America's Funniest Home Videos and Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Ad
revenue at the ABC Network was down low single-digits, as lower news and daytime ratings were partially offset by
higher rates. Quarter-to-date, scatter pricing at the network is pacing modestly above upfront levels.
At Parks and Resorts, growth in operating income was driven by higher results at our domestic operations which saw
gains in both attendance and guest spending, partially offset by lower results at our international operations. Margins
were up 100 basis points to over 22%.
Attendance at our domestic Parks was up 4%, and per capita spending was up 2% in the third quarter due to increased
spending on food and beverage, and merchandise. Occupancy at our domestic resorts was up five percentage points to
87%, and per room spending was up 4%. So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations, excluding the 53rd week, are
pacing up 4% compared to prior year levels while booked rates are up 6%.
International operations were lower in the third quarter due to a decline in attendance in occupied room nights at Hong
Kong Disneyland and higher pre-opening spending at Shanghai Disney Resort. Results at Disneyland Paris were
comparable to prior year. The weakness of the euro compared to prior year resulted in about a $100 million adverse
impact to Disneyland Paris' revenue. However, there was a corresponding benefit to expenses of roughly the same
amount.

At Studio Entertainment, we delivered another strong quarter with operating income up 15% over prior year, driven by
increases in theatrical distributions, reflecting the strong performance of Avengers: Age of Ultron, Cinderella, and
Inside Out, partially offset by the performance of Tomorrowland. Studio results also benefited from higher revenue
share from Consumer Products and growth in international television distribution.
Home entertainment results were lower in the quarter as a result of a difficult comparison with the performance of
Frozen in the prior year. Our Consumer Products business continues to benefit from the depth and breadth of our
licensing portfolio. Segment operating income was up 27% on revenue growth of 6%, and margins were up over 600
basis points. Growth in operating income in the quarter was due to higher results in merchandise licensing, which was
driven by Frozen, The Avengers, and Star Wars. On a comparable basis, earned licensing revenue in the third quarter
was up 20% over last year. At Interactive, results reflected lower performance of Disney Infinity, partially offset by
higher results from our mobile games business.
We feel great about our third quarter results, and with the end of fiscal 2015 less than two months away, I now want to
take a moment to give you an early look into fiscal 2016. As we look ahead to 2016, there are two items I want to
address. First, the strength of the U.S. dollar versus a number of key foreign currencies is expected to adversely impact
our operating income in 2016 by approximately $500 million. Second, in April of last year, we told you that we
expected to grow both domestic Cable affiliate revenue and Cable operating income by high-single-digits on a
compounded annual basis between fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2016.
Due to the lower subscriber levels Bob discussed earlier, we now expect domestic cable affiliate revenue to fall a bit
short of our previous expectation, though, still in the high-single-digit range. We now expect this lower affiliate
revenue and the multi-year impact of foreign exchange rates to moderate our Cable operating income growth to
mid-single-digits during the fiscal 2013 to 2016 period.
We are disciplined in our capital allocation strategy and continue to take a balanced approach between investing in
existing businesses, making strategic acquisitions, and returning capital to shareholders. Our financial results over the
past several years, including a record quarter we just reported, are evidence our capital allocation strategy has delivered
and continues to deliver tangible results. Returning capital to our shareholders continues to be a key component of our
capital allocation strategy. Last month, the board declared a dividend of $0.66 for the first half of this fiscal year, which
represents an increase of 15% on an annualized basis. Going forward, we expect to pay dividends on a semi-annual
basis.
During the third quarter, we repurchased 9.4 million shares for $1 billion. Fiscal year-to-date, we've repurchased 32.4
million shares for $3.2 billion, which coupled with $3.1 billion in dividends paid this year represents approximately
$6.3 billion in capital returned to our shareholders so far in fiscal 2015. And given our outlook for next year, we
currently expect to increase our level of share repurchase to between $6 billion and $8 billion in fiscal 2016.
Before I turn the call back over to Lowell for Q&A, I want to take a moment to say how honored I am to be the CFO of
this company, and I look forward to continue working with so many great colleagues here at Disney as well as many of
you in the near future.

<Q - Michael B. Nathanson>: Thanks. I have one for Christine and one for Bob. Christine, following up on the
guidance you just gave on foreign exchange, can you talk a bit about how Disney hedges, and why aren't we seeing
more foreign exchange impact in this fiscal year given the movement in dollar a year ago versus being felt in 2016? So
talk a bit about the timing of that impact.
<A - Christine M. McCarthy>: Okay. Thank you, Michael. That's a great question. The way we hedge foreign
exchange is on a multi-year basis. So it does have the benefit of mitigating the full impact of changes in currency rates
on operating income. So let me just give you some perspective which I think will explain the year-over-year change.
Back in the summer of 2014 when the U.S. dollar started strengthening, we were mostly hedged for fiscal 2015. With
the continued dollar strength that we saw in this current year, 2015, as we layered into additional hedges for fiscal
2016, they were at less favorable rates. Hence, the year-over-year 2015 to 2016 impact is currently estimated to be
around that $500 million.
<Q - Michael B. Nathanson>: Okay. Thanks. And then, Bob, something you said at the beginning, it's a question that I
know all of us get and Lowell gets, too. It's about the right number of subscriber losses at ESPN. And all of us track
Nielsen. You put it in your 10-K in terms of the quarterly – yearly change in ESPN subscribers. What's the right level
of subscriber growth? And when you think about your current guidance, what is the right level of future near-term
subscriber losses, do you think, for ESPN and maybe for the big basic bundle in total?
<A - Robert A. Iger>: Well, first of all, Michael, we report in our filings Nielsen's numbers. But they don't necessarily
track the number of subs that we get paid on. And in fact, the numbers that have recently been in the press, which were
Nielsen numbers, were higher in terms of sub losses than those that we're seeing. But we are not, at this point, ready to
give specifics in terms of what those numbers are. Does that answer that question?
<Q - Michael B. Nathanson>: Okay.
<A - Robert A. Iger>: It answers it partially.
<Q - Michael B. Nathanson>: Okay. And then you're changing guidance is because, I mean, have you taken a more
conservative view of the next year in subscriber revenue, or is it based on where you were...?
<A - Robert A. Iger>: Well, on the revenue side, Christine said we're sticking to the high-single-digits. On the OI side,
the combination of slightly less subscribers than we predicted at the time with foreign exchange rate changes leads to
us taking the OI guidance down from the high-single-digits to the mid-single-digits. That's – but on the revenue side,
we're maintaining the high-single-digit outlook.
<Q - Michael B. Nathanson>: Okay. Thanks, Bob.
<A - Lowell Singer>: Okay, Michael. Thank you. Operator, next question, please.
Operator
Of course. Our next question here comes from Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Alexia S. Quadrani>: Hi. Thank you. I guess, Bob, just sort of staying on that same topic about the outlook for
ESPN and subs, how do you balance sort of maintaining the current ecosystem and helping sustain traditional subs with
sort of new opportunities that over-the-top can present themselves? And I guess ultimately on that same point, as
over-the-top platforms expand, do you think it's just a share shift from linear TV or do you think it actually can expand
the reach of the market for ESPN?
<A - Robert A. Iger>: Well, I think you can look at this in many different ways. One, you can look at it in terms of the
overall television landscape and the linear MVPD expanded basic business versus the growth in so-called over-the-top
businesses. Or you can look at it specifically with regard to ESPN. I guess I'll take the broader sort of market look first.
First of all, I think while there has been a lot said about what's going on in the multi-channel universe, and as I said in

my comments, it's still a dominant form of television viewing, and it is the dominant form clearly for sports viewing as
well. And we mentioned an 83% statistic, 83% of all U.S. households watched ESPN – U.S. multi-channel households
watched ESPN in the first quarter. So you're still looking at a significant amount of consumption through the
multi-channel universe.
We also look at that business, and we look at it as a consumer offering, and we see a huge variety of programming, a
lot of live or kind of topical programming that's on, meaning you don't have to wait a year to watch library, as in for
instance. I mentioned a significant amount of variety and quality, obviously, for a price that's generally considered
reasonable and a price that's often bundled with broadband and in some cases with telephony. So when we look at that
universe, we don't really see dramatic declines over the next, say, five years or so. And therefore we're not taking, what
I'll call, radical steps to move our product into over-the-top businesses to disrupt that business because we don't think
right now that it's necessarily the greatest opportunity, and we just don't think it's necessary.
That said, there are new platforms that are launching, some multi-channel and some other types of platforms, that on
the multi-channel front, they all want our programming. They want ABC. They want Disney Channel. They want
ESPN. There isn't one that has talked about launching without coming to us suggesting a desire to have us. And we're
going to obviously – because we believe that it's in our best interest, we're going to take advantage of those
opportunities and at the right price under the right circumstances license our linear channels to those platforms.
In addition to that, you have the growth of platforms like Netflix or SVOD. That's interesting as well. Because while
one could argue that for all the right reasons that's starting to incentivize or maybe incentivizing people including
Millennials to cord cut, it's also providing us opportunities because Netflix has become a really important partner to us
in buying our off-network product, buying original programming for us – the Marvel deal is a good example – and then
our film library kicks in, the output deal for the 2016 slate kicks in.
So we look at Netflix actually right now as more friend than foe because they've become an aggressive customer of
ours. I also think that products like Netflix are pretty attractive because they offer a very user-friendly, efficient, and
oftentimes much less expensive way for people to watch television. I'm going to say one more thing. I realize I'm
getting wordy, but the average American's watching about 5.5 hours of TV a day, and we see that going up to about 6
hours. The reason they're watching 5.5 hours of TV a day is because of just what I described, this huge value in the
multi-channel product for customers, and it's popular. And the reason we believe it's going to increase from 5.5 hours to
6 is because of the advent of new technology-driven platforms, whether they're over-the-top, whether it's SVOD,
whether it's new, smaller services.
So it's a long way around my saying that we actually believe that with Disney, ABC, ESPN, our other products, we're
really well positioned. We've been among the first, if not the first, to offer our product on new platforms even if it's
somewhat disruptive. We still believe in the expanded basic service for years to come, but we're going to take
advantage of opportunities. And it's just hard to say when something either feels too disruptive, too fast or not. But
when we see it, we'll tell you about it.
<Q - Alexia S. Quadrani>: All right. Thank you very much.
<A - Lowell Singer>: Thank you, Alexia. Operator, next question, please.
Operator
Of course. Our next question comes from Todd Juenger from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead, sir.
<Q - Todd Juenger>: Hey. Thank you. Guess what I want to talk about, too, is just the multi-channel universe and pay
TV subscribers. Let me take a shot at this and see what you're willing to engage in. I'd love to hear, as you construct
your traditional distribution arrangements, especially for ESPN but your general Cable Networks, would you be willing
to talk about what type of protections or options you generally might look for in the case that subscriber losses
accelerate or are more than you expected? Are there minimums? Are there pricing resets? Are there opportunities to
protect yourself? I'm sure there are in the downside. Would love to hear those, thanks.

<A - Robert A. Iger>: Todd, we cannot get specific about it. I can tell you that our distribution agreements do address
the number of subs that are being delivered or that were being paid for. And there are facets of those agreements that
enable us to amend the business relationship with a contractual relationship that we have with these distributors should
subs go below a certain number. When I say amend, I'm not going to get specific about how we would go about that or
what the specific mechanisms are in the contracts for that, because frankly, it's confidential.
Going – since you, I guess, asked a little bit about maybe the future and new deals, I can only say – and you know a lot
of these deals run for multiple years, but I can only say that when we enter new deals, we will probably take an even
longer-term view about what threats and what opportunities exist for us in the marketplace, so that we are both
protected against the threats and we are given full opportunity to take advantage of changes in the marketplace that
could strengthen our business, like going direct to consumers should we conclude that that becomes the more attractive
alternative to us.
<Q - Todd Juenger>: Fair enough. And then one follow-up, if you don't mind. I'll make it quick and somebody has got
to ask. Just anything that you care to say about the status of your relations with Verizon and what's going on there?
Thanks.
<A - Robert A. Iger>: No, we're not commenting on that except to say that we've had ongoing discussions with them. I
think they clearly recognize that the channels and the product that we offer have great value to them in their current
services and in new services that they're contemplating launching.
<Q - Todd Juenger>: All right. Fair enough. Thank you.
<A - Lowell Singer>: Thank you, Todd. Operator, next question, please.

Of course. Our next question comes from Jessica Reif Cohen from BoA. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jessica J. Reif Cohen>: Okay. It's BAML, but okay. I have two topics. One is film and one is theme parks, and a
couple of small questions. On film, can you clarify was any shortfall in Tomorrowland's fully in the third fiscal quarter?
And Bob, just following up on the comment you made about television viewing and your view that viewing will
actually go up because there's more ways to see including Netflix, do you have a point of view on films, like, both film
distribution change or film viewing change because of technology? And then, I guess I'll come back with the theme
park questions.
<A - Thomas O. Staggs>: Well, just very briefly – Jessica, this is Tom. On Tomorrowland, we did see an impact of
Tomorrowland in the quarter. Obviously, that was more than offset by the success of the other titles. But, yeah, the
underperformance there did show up.
<A - Robert A. Iger>: On the motion pictures side, we see global motion picture consumption actually growing. A lot
of that is obviously due to the number one growth market in the world in terms of grosses, and that's China, where
we've seen just massive increase in movie-going over the last two – even two to three years. I know a lot's been said
about the window and whether technology and the opportunity to view under higher quality circumstances in the home
is going to compress the theatrical window. For the kind of movies that we make, which are largely, what I'll call,
tentpole films, we actually believe the theatrical window is incredibly important to us, and at the moment, we don't
really see any need to aggressively compress it.
We time our, I'll call it, the home video product that goes into the marketplace very carefully, mostly to track the retail
opportunities that we have as a company, retail opportunities to both sell the movie into that window, and retail
opportunities to take advantage of the consumer product sales that we generally get at retail from a lot of the movies
that we make.

So we think that generally motion picture consumption is increasing in the world. It's been relatively flat in the United
States by the way. I don't think that's going to change. And for at least us, we don't really see taking steps to decrease
the theatrical window because frankly it's working for us.
<Q - Jessica J. Reif Cohen>: And then on theme parks, just a couple really quick ones. But you mentioned the
currency impact you expected in fiscal 2016 overall. But is there any – are you seeing an impact from international
visitors, both stronger dollar and international visitors? Second, the 60th anniversary, is there any way you can frame
the impact of that for Disneyland? And then finally, sorry about that, but finally there's been expectation that you guys
have gotten approval. I mean I think you've gotten some approvals in California, so there's speculation that you're
building a new land. Any comment on Star Wars Land or something like that?
<A - Thomas O. Staggs>: Okay, Jessica. It's Tom. First of all, on the foreign exchange, Christine talked about that
overall impact for next year. But in terms of looking at international attendance right now, the – overall, we haven't
seen a dramatic impact on the currency rate in terms of the total attendance. Now, if we look at it, the correlation with
where the economies around the world are weakest, we also see that in the attendance.
So, for example, the U.K. was relatively strong this past quarter; Brazil was a bit lower. And so that economic status
coupled probably with some change in the exchange rate does have an impact. But if you look at international
attendance for Q3, as an example, Q3 by the way is perennially the lower of the quarters in terms of international
attendance percentage-wise, it was in the range that we normally experience. So we don't discern a very big impact
there.
With regard to the 60th, there's no question that people have responded well to the 60th, and there's obviously a lot of
attachment to Disneyland and that has led to what we talked about, which is the best quarter ever at Disneyland Resort
in terms of attendance and profitability. And so, I would say that the 60th is one of the key drivers there. But it's really
the new content and the product that we put in around the 60th that drives it. So Disneyland, we expect to continue to
do well going forward.
And then with regard to Star Wars, as we said, we're excited about Star Wars across the company, and Parks is no
exception. So I would say stay tuned for more specifics about our plans there.
<Q - Jessica J. Reif Cohen>: Thank you.
<A - Lowell Singer>: Thank you, Jessica. Operator, next question, please.

Our next question here comes from David Bank from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - David Bank>: Okay. Thank you very much. I will not ask about ESPN and the evolving ecosystem. You guys
have two incredibly seminal events that are going to occur over the next 12 months in the relaunch of Star Wars and the
opening of Shanghai, and we're really close to the eve of those events at this point, and I think for many of us, I know
the questions I get is we still have a pretty hard time putting our arms around the incremental income statement impact
from those two incredibly seminal events in 2016 and beyond. And so I guess I'm hoping for a little more color as we
sit on the eve. I think we have a framework for the box office, but is there any sense of sort of incremental order of
magnitude you could talk to us about aside from the Force Friday impact on Consumer Products? Like, what is the
order of magnitude on the income statement?
And for Shanghai, can you give us kind of a basic sense of impact on that first 12 months? Is it kind of break-even? Is it
earnings drag? Is it earnings lift? Anything – any incremental color on those two events in the income statement would
be really, really helpful. Thanks.
<A - Robert A. Iger>: On the Star Wars front, David, we know that there is just incredible interest in this film. We've
put two teaser trailers out, and the response has been enormous. Anything that moves gets a lot of attention, and
anticipation is obviously huge. And we've seen some examples already of Star Wars product going to the marketplace

on the Consumer Products front, including in markets like China that are very, very encouraging. That said, as
enthusiastic as we are for what we know of the film, we've not seen a Star Wars film, any original one, since 2005, and
there are markets around the world that are less familiar with Star Wars than, say, the United States, for instance.
So while the enthusiasm is, I think, rather apparent, we just want to be careful that the world doesn't get ahead of us too
much in terms of the estimates, and we've seen them as well. We're making, at this point, no estimates whatsoever in
terms of what we believe the film will do. We know we have probably the most valuable film franchise that ever
existed. We know we have the ability as a company to leverage it in very, very compelling ways, whether it's in Disney
Infinity, whether it's at Parks, Tom cited, whether it's on the Consumer Products front or on the TV front. And we fully
expect that the success of this film will reverberate throughout the company not only in 2016 but in the years beyond,
because we obviously have a rich slate of Star Wars films coming. So we just want to be careful here that the market
doesn't get too far ahead of us or ahead of itself even on this. Let's all continue to anticipate the movie and be optimistic
about it. But we have to take a wait and see approach in terms of what it will do.
On the Shanghai front, I'm going to let Tom talk about the economic impact in 2016. But, you know, there too like Star
Wars in many ways, there's huge anticipation. And as I mentioned in my comments, the reaction to what we revealed a
couple of weeks ago in Shanghai was extraordinary, not just in terms of the level of interest but the level of enthusiasm
and the positive reaction to the fact that we're building a Park that was of such a scale and was so unique in many ways,
particularly in its blend of, what I'll call, traditional Disney theme park experiences and a lot of things that are both
original and very, very specifically tailored for the Chinese market.
<A - Thomas O. Staggs>: And I think the real, the headline for 2016, and as we get closer to the opening, we'll do
more to help you understand how to look down the road with Shanghai. But for right now, it's really about the
pre-opening expenses. So in 2014, we started to incur some opening expenses of size that were noticeable. That
number, of course, has gone up in 2015, which is part of what you see in the international theme park results. And then
that will ramp even further in 2016. And you should anticipate that roughly half of the total pre-opening expenses for
the project we'll see in 2016. And so the net result of that is Shanghai won't contribute to profitability in 2016 based on
our best assumption right now. But then in future years, you'll see the real impact and the financial returns, which we
continue to believe, will be quite attractive.
<Q - David Bank>: Terrific. Thank you very much.
<A - Lowell Singer>: Thanks, David. Operator, next question, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente from Nomura. Please go ahead.
<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Thanks a lot. I have two questions, one for Christine and one for Bob. Christine, just
given the clarification to the ESPN guidance, I wanted to just follow up on that. Maybe I'm getting ahead of myself, but
as we look even further beyond that guidance window, you don't have any big sports rights step-ups in fiscal 2016, but
in first quarter 2017, you have the NBA rights fee step-up, which is a big step-up. So what are the things that you're
doing or plan to do in order to make room for that in the budget at ESPN for the increase in the NBA rights fee at that
time?
And then secondly for Bob, you talked about China – we're talking about Shanghai and the Park. I want to just talk
about the media market or get your thoughts. I mean, the theatrical market is obviously huge and massively growing.
Your release slate will presumably help you with share gain there. But what about the home entertainment market? You
recently partnered with Youku for exclusive local marketing of Marvel films. I know there's a lot of piracy there, but
also presumably a massive opportunity. What is the strategy for home video distribution in China? Thanks.
<A - Christine M. McCarthy>: Okay. Anthony, your question about ESPN, the new NBA deal will occur in 2017,
and we still believe that ESPN has plenty of room for growth.

<A - Robert A. Iger>: On the question about China, the announcement that was made about a deal with Youku, I think
you mentioned, was not correct. We've not entered into a partnership arrangement with them. The home video market
in China is obviously challenged by the fact that it's a market that's been, as you know, rife with piracy. And so, there
wasn't – a legitimate home video market never quite developed there.
That said, there are a number of new platforms that have launched or that are expected to launch, and we're in a number
of conversations, none that we can discuss because we're not ready to announce it, with some of them about output
deals for our films. And we feel good about essentially digital delivery of these films into a window that's likely to be
lucrative for us over a long period of time and essentially enable us to put legitimate product into the marketplace
swiftly to hopefully counter what we've encountered in a lot of Asian markets, which is piracy.
<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Thanks a lot.
<A - Lowell Singer>: Okay, Anthony, thanks. Operator, next question, please.
Operator
Of course. Our next question here comes from Doug Mitchelson from UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Doug Mitchelson>: Thanks so much. Let me add my welcome to Christine. Bob, I think we've gotten what we
can from you on ESPN, so I'm going to turn to Tom and Christine. Tom, I just wanted to make sure you could give us a
sense about the benefits of the domestic Park investment cycle, MyMagic+ in particular, relative to the 2% per cap rate
for the quarter. Was that just a tough comp, or are we starting to see any kind of wind down in the benefits of prior
investments at the U.S. Parks?
And for Christine, the comment on the $500 million of FX and the fact that you hedge over multi-year periods suggests
there could be some lag in fiscal 2017 or beyond above the $500 million relative to the current interest rate levels. Is
that right? Is there further impact if you mark-to-market everything to current exchange rates?
And lastly, I guess, also for Christine, maybe I missed it, but the moderating EBIT growth for Cable Networks from
fiscal 2013 to 2016, is some of that currency as well as the subscriber growth that we've all been talking about? Or is it
just ESPN subscriber growth? Thank you very much.
<A - Thomas O. Staggs>: So, Doug, let me start at the first question. The Parks per cap, the growth of 2% that you
saw, the real driver there really was the attendance mix where we saw very strong demand at the local level, especially
in the annual pass. And that then shows up on the attendance per cap. Food and beverage and merchandise were in line
with what we've been seeing in prior quarters, so that really is guest mix. But the major new initiatives, we continue to
be very pleased with them broadly and with MyMagic+ in particular. It's been broadly available for about a year now.
We've actually had about 13 million folks use the MagicBands and they've overwhelmingly called it an excellent
experience.
So we're very pleased there. The intent to return all those metrics that we look at are pointed in the right direction. And
MyMagic+ actually was a contributor to the results positively in the quarter. So, and also, you continue to see the
strength of things like the relaunch of California Adventure driving the gains at Disneyland. So, we feel very good
about both that set of initiatives and their continued ability to drive our results.
<Q - Doug Mitchelson>: Thanks, Tom.
<A - Christine M. McCarthy>: Okay. Doug, on the $500 million, that's another good question regarding foreign
exchange. It's not the simplest subject. But if we had not hedged at all, the FX impact would have been more significant
in fiscal 2015. But the reason I say that is, we don't know what rates are going to do in fiscal 2016. But right now for
fiscal 2016, we are expecting that $500 million adverse impact. And the hedge ratios that we have in place are actually
more favorable than current levels. So, if there were changes in different directions during the year, we would continue
layering in during 2016 for 2017. But right now, the hedges that we have in place for 2017, albeit more modest than
where we are for 2016, they're with – right now, they look like they would benefit us in a strong dollar market.

ESPN in particular, the FX issue there is separate and distinct from the $500 million that we talked about. The foreign
exchange impact for ESPN is over that three-year period. And when we talked back in 2014 at the Investor Day for that
outlook, right at that point in time, the U.S. dollar had not started its significant strengthening. That was in the summer
of 2014. So during that period, the dollar has significantly strengthened across a number of key currencies for our cable
nets, including the yen, the euro, the pound, as well as the Brazilian real. So that FX impact is part of that outlook
guidance that we gave.
<Q - Doug Mitchelson>: Okay. And just to be clear, the lowering from the high single-digit to mid-single digit was a
mix of currency and domestic subscribers or just domestic subscriber shortfalls?
<A - Christine M. McCarthy>: It's a combination – it's not – it's both the adverse impact of lower expected sub levels
and the adverse impact of the stronger dollar.
<Q - Doug Mitchelson>: Okay, great. And there's no way you can give us the breakdown of those two, by chance?
<A - Christine M. McCarthy>: No. I think just the way we've explained it is what we can do.
<Q - Doug Mitchelson>: All right. Thank you so much.
<A - Lowell Singer>: Okay. Thanks, Doug. Operator, next question, please.

Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Thank you. I have a question for Bob and then for Christine. First, Bob, you've been
very vocal about the shift of advertising from TV to digital. Can you just help us think about how you think about
ESPN, ABC ad sales going forward? Do you expect those businesses to grow over time and do you expect the industry
to grow when you look out over sort of a multi-year forecast?
<A - Robert A. Iger>: We're seeing real growth, but it's still relatively small in terms of total dollars versus what we
see on the traditional platforms. In ESPN's case, as we've said before, they package their ad sales across all of their
platforms – basically their linear more analog platforms as well as all their digital platforms – and platforms like radio
and even their magazine. But we think that there's going to be tremendous growth from a percentage basis of digital,
and we are going to continue to work with advertisers and with the research firms that are out there, to work to not only
get more creative but to provide more details, essentially more consumption research, so that we can grow the business
even more.
The demand is clearly there. What you see in the advertising community, not only do you see a much more opportunity
for, what I'll call, addressable advertising, but you see a huge demand from the advertising community as well.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Great.
<A - Robert A. Iger>: By the way, while we're on the subject of ESPN because we've been on it a lot so why not, I
want to make one other point about it. First of all, we've said a number of times, when you think ESPN, you have to
think about the NFL, the NBA, Major League Baseball, the best package available in college football, college football
championships, college basketball, events like Wimbledon, U.S. Open, et cetera.
The other thing you have to consider is that in many of these cases we're only at the beginning or in some cases not
even at the beginning, like the NBA, of new deals that kick in. Those new deals all provide for more programming,
more opportunity for content on digital platforms, which will enable us to increase consumption on digital platforms
and grow that business even more, and generally more flexibility in terms of how we distribute this product.
So the NBA is a great example. You're going to have a huge increase in essentially inventory on ESPN across its
platforms. So while there is definitely increase in cost, there's huge increase in terms of opportunity as well to reach

more people, to serve advertisers more effectively, and to grow our digital platforms.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Thank you. Christine, just on the 53rd week, any way to think about the impact, the
benefit in Q4? You mentioned ESPN was pacing up in the quarter. I didn't know if that was both including and
excluding the 53rd week impact. And then any way to think about the 53rd week impact in 2016 where you're going to
comp the 2015 benefit? Thanks.
<A - Christine M. McCarthy>: Thanks, Ben. You can think about the 53rd week in terms of it being an additional
week of operations, so it's relatively proportional in the year. So that would be a benefit here in fiscal 2015, and it
would have the reverse effect in fiscal 2016.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Lowell Singer>: Okay. Thanks, Ben. Operator, we have time for one more question.
Operator
And thank you. Our last question here comes from Spencer Hill – I'm sorry – our next question here comes from Jason
Bazinet from Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jason B. Bazinet>: Maybe a quick question for Ms. McCarthy. Regarding leverage, the gross leverage has come
down very gradually over the last decade to below one time. The cost of debt is quite low obviously in the markets.
Your ROICs, even if I include goodwill in all divisions, seems to be in the low double-digit range. So why is this the
right level of leverage for a firm like yours?
<A - Christine M. McCarthy>: Thanks, Jason. You're absolutely correct. Our leverage has reduced as the company
has continued to perform. We generate cash flow that we deploy to returning to shareholders as well as investing in
businesses, doing strategic acquisitions. So when we look at our leverage, the number that you quote is actually a gross
number, and we do look at our leverage in terms of the way the rating agencies look at it. So they will make some
adjustments to that for things like pension obligations. So it's actually a little bit higher from a rating agency
perspective.
That being said, we do enjoy a mid-A credit rating. We also are a tier one commercial paper issuer. So as it currently
stands, we feel like we are returning capital to shareholders as well as investing in businesses, doing acquisitions, and,
at the same time, we're maintaining financial strength and flexibility.
<Q - Jason B. Bazinet>: Okay. Thank you very much.
