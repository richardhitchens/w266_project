MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Raytheon Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. My
name is Tawanda and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later,
we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being
recorded for replay purposes.
I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Todd Ernst, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.
Todd Ernst
Thank you, Tawanda. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today on our second quarter conference call.
The results that we announced this morning, the audio feed of this call and the slides that we'll reference are available
on our website at raytheon.com. Following this morning's call, an archive of both the audio replay and a printable
version of the slides will be available in the Investor Relations section of our website.
With me today are Tom Kennedy, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Toby O'Brien, our Chief Financial
Officer. We'll start with some brief remarks by Tom and Toby and then we'll move on to questions.
Before I turn the call over to Tom, I'd like to caution you regarding our forward-looking statements. Any matters
discussed today that are not historical facts, particularly comments regarding the company's future plans, objectives and

expected performance, constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on a wide range of
assumptions that the company believes are reasonable, but are subject to a range of uncertainties and risks that are
summarized at the end of our earnings release and are discussed in detail in our SEC filings.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. Tom?
Thomas A. Kennedy
Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased with Raytheon's strong second quarter performance. Our
global growth strategy continues to drive our results, our second quarter revenue up 3%. Our operating performance in
the quarter was solid, with a strong increase in sequential margins. And cash flow generation in the second quarter was
well above our expectations.
Given our performance in 2016 to-date, and how we are seeing the balance of the year playing out, we are raising our
EPS and cash flow guidance for the year. Further, based on strong demand that we are seeing from our global
customers, we also have raised our outlook for bookings. Toby will walk you through the details in a few minutes.
During the second quarter, I visited a number of country leaders in the Asia-Pacific region. And earlier this month, we
hosted several hundred customer meetings at the Farnborough Airshow. There was a remarkable level of consistency
among these conversations. That is, customers are interested in capabilities to address two key missions. One, support
global counterterrorism campaigns; and two, maintain deterrence in a charged geopolitical environment. More
specifically, we continue to see strong demand for our integrated air missile defense solutions, precision munitions and
C5ISR capabilities. This demand has been broad-based across the European, MENA and Asia-Pacific regions.
Further, this year, there's been an added sense of urgency. I can't think of a time when our international pipeline of
opportunities was more robust than it is today. Our international model, which looks at countries as markets, is paying
off. Let me just give you a few examples.
One of our larger international opportunities over the next several months is the Qatar upgraded Early Warning Radar.
This radar will significantly improve Qatar's long-range situational awareness capabilities and represents a $1 billion
opportunity for the company. This follows on the country's previous order for 10 Patriot fire units and an air defense
operating center.
We also see further opportunity in country for TPY-2 radar as part of a THAAD system later in 2017 or 2018. This is
consistent with how we have been thinking about the progression of opportunities in the country for some time.
Another large upcoming opportunity for the company is Poland Patriot, which is also progressing well.
Government-to-government negotiations are ongoing. We have achieved key milestones with Polish industry on work
share including signing a letter of intent to work with Poland's largest defense contractor, PGC.
We anticipate that this multi-billion dollar opportunity will be awarded sometime in 2017. We also see additional
opportunities in Poland, including short range air defense systems related to our NASAMS product line.
Looking at second quarter, our bookings were strong, with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.18. Strength in the quarter was
driven by the $1 billion Next Generation Jammer booking at the beginning of the quarter, a nearly $500 million
upgrade to Kuwait's six Patriot fire units as well as several notable missile bookings for AIM-9X, Paveway and SM-3.
You may recall that we also had strong bookings in the first quarter, which together with our Q2 results drove a
year-to-date book-to-bill ratio of 1.13. This strength in bookings lays the foundation for future growth and bolsters our
confidence in our outlook.
In the second quarter, International represented 31% of total company bookings. I would also point out that with the
Kuwait Patriot booking, this is a second consecutive quarter where we have had a significant award from the MENA
region.

At the end of the second quarter, 42% of our total backlog was from international customers. Our sales growth in the
second quarter was ahead of our expectations. Domestic sales increased slightly, while international increased
approximately 8% in the quarter, showing that our global growth strategy remains on track.
Overall, international represented 32% of total sales in the quarter. As we look at future growth drivers for the
company, I would like to take a minute to highlight a couple of our many examples. In the second quarter, we delivered
the first air and missile defense radar to the U.S. Navy's Pacific Missile Range Facility, ahead of schedule. AMDR is
the next-generation integrated air and ballistic missile defense radar for the U.S. Navy's DDG-51 Flight III destroyers
and fills a critical capability gap for the surface fleet.
This delivery is the latest in a series of milestones achieved for AMDR. As it advances through the engineering and
manufacturing development phase, which is now close to 80% complete. AMDR will soon transition to low rate initial
production and remains on track for initial delivery in 2019.
Another example of a future growth driver for the company is Small Diameter Bomb II, which we continue to test with
the U.S. Air Force. Small Diameter Bomb II features a highly advanced tri-mode seeker, which includes infrared
imaging, millimeter wave radar and laser guidance to find and attack targets from rages that can exceed 40 Miles.
Testing will continue this summer as the program moves through low rate initial production. Small Diameter Bomb II
represents a $4 billion opportunity over the lifetime of this franchise program.
Before closing, I'd like to take a moment to briefly touch on the fiscal year's 2017 defense budget. As most of you
know, both the House and the Senate have marked up their respective bills and there are significant differences
between them. These differences will need to be reconciled before the budget is finalized.
Given this, and the fact that it is an election year, we are anticipating that there will be another Continuing Resolution,
which will probably extend beyond the election in November. This assumption is considered within our financial
guidance range.
Overall, I'm very pleased with the team's performance in the second quarter. Simply put, we had outstanding results, a
solid growth and strong execution. I want to thank the team for all its efforts, which continued to deliver for our
company and global customers.
With that, let me turn it over to Toby.
Anthony F. O'Brien
Okay. Thanks, Tom. I have a few opening remarks, starting with the second quarter highlights and then we'll move on
to questions. During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning; if everyone
would please turn to page three.
We are pleased with the strong performance the team delivered in the second quarter, with bookings, sales, EPS and
operating cash flow all better than our expectations. We had strong bookings in the second quarter of $7.1 billion,
resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.18.
Sales were $6 billion in the quarter, up 3%, led by our Space and Airborne Systems and Missiles businesses. Our EPS
from continuing operations was $2.38, which I'll give a little more color on in a few minutes. We generated strong
operating cash flow of $746 million in the second quarter, which was better than our prior guidance, primarily driven
by it the timing of collections. Second quarter 2016 operating cash flow was higher than last year's second quarter,
primarily due to the timing of payments and cash taxes as well as lower required pension contributions.
During the quarter, the company repurchased 1.6 million shares of common stock for $202 million, bringing the
year-to-date share repurchase to 4.8 million shares for $602 million.

I want to spend a minute talking about the recent ThalesRaytheonSystems transaction that was concluded at the end of
June. Raytheon and Thales concluded an agreement to transition the stakeholder positions each company held in the
TRS joint venture structure, with Raytheon acquiring 100% of the TRS U.S. operations and Thales acquiring 100% of
the French operations.
As a result of the transaction, Raytheon made a net cash payment to Thales in the amount of $90 million and recorded a
tax-free gain of $158 million at IDS or $0.53 per diluted share in our second quarter financial results. It's important to
note that we had previously forecast this to occur in the third quarter of this year at about $150 million.
I also want to point out that we're raising the EPS and operating cash flow guidance that we provided in April,
reflecting our strong performance to-date. I'll discuss guidance further in just a few minutes.
Turning now to page four, let me start by providing some detail on our second quarter results. Company bookings for
the second quarter were $7.1 billion and on a year-to-date basis were $13.3 billion, an increase of approximately $1.3
billion over the same period last year. Worth noting that on a trailing four quarter basis, our book-to-bill ratio was 1.11.
For the quarter, international was 31% of our total company bookings, and on a year-to-date basis, was 29%. For the
year, we expect International to be about 35% of total bookings.
As Tom just mentioned, we booked several significant awards in the second quarter, including about $1 billion for the
Next Generation Jammer program for the U.S. Navy, $574 million on domestic and foreign training programs in
support of Warfighter FOCUS activities, $487 million to provide advanced Patriot air and missile defense capabilities
for Kuwait, and approximately $300 million apiece on both AIM-9X Sidewinder short-range, air-to-air missiles and
Paveway. Backlog at the end of the second quarter was $35.3 billion and on a funded basis was $26.1 billion, both up
approximately $800 million compared to last year's second quarter.
If you'd now move to page five, as I mentioned earlier, for the second quarter 2016, sales exceeded the high end of
guidance we set in April, primarily due to the timing within the year and better than expected performance across
several of the businesses. For the second quarter, our international sales were approximately 32% of total sales.
Looking now at sales by business, IDS had second quarter 2016 net sales of $1.4 billion. As expected, the change in net
sales for the quarter was primarily driven by the recognition of a previously deferred pre-contract cost on an
international Patriot program in the second quarter 2015.
In the second quarter 2016, IIS had net sales of $1.6 billion, up 3% compared with the same quarter last year. The
increase was primarily due to our cybersecurity and special mission programs.
Missile Systems had second quarter 2016 net sales of $1.7 billion. The 6% increase from the second quarter 2015 was
primarily due to the Paveway program. SAS had net sales of $1.5 billion. The 9% increase versus last year was driven
by higher sales on classified programs. And for Forcepoint, the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of
Websense, which we completed at the end of May 2015.
Moving ahead to page six, overall, the company continues to perform well. Our operating margin was 15.9% for the
total company and 14.8% on a business segment basis. Worth noting that the impact of the TRS gain, that I discussed
earlier, was essentially in line with our prior expectation and was worth $158 million or about 260 basis points at the
company level for the second quarter of 2016.
So looking now at the business margins, the increase in margin at IDS included the results of the TRS transaction.
Without the transaction, the IDS margin in the second quarter would've been 15.5%, reflecting their strong operating
performance.
IIS operating margin was in line with last year's second quarter. Missile's margin was up 170 basis points in the quarter
compared with the same period last year, primarily driven by higher net program efficiencies and a favorable change in
program mix in the second quarter of 2016.

The decrease in margin at SAS in the quarter appeared with the same period last year, was primarily driven by a change
in program mix. And at Forcepoint, the second quarter 2016 operating margin was higher than last year's comparable
quarter, primarily due to the acquisition of Websense. Forcepoint's Q2 margin improved from Q2 2015 and, as
expected, was impacted by integration and transition costs.
As we've discussed on past calls, we remain focused on margin improvement going forward. We are continuously
looking for ways to lower our cost, enhance our competitiveness and improve affordability for our customers. In the
second quarter, one of the key drivers of our margin improvement was the payoff from our investment in factory
automation and equipment upgrades and we also saw productivity gains from increased operating leverage.
Turning now to page 7, second quarter 2016 EPS was $2.38, better than expected, primarily driven by higher sales and
productivity as well as from the timing of the TRS transaction, which, as mentioned earlier, was previously forecast to
occur in the third quarter.
As expected, second quarter 2016 also included the tax benefit associated with the new accounting standard for stock
compensation, which we previously adopted in the first quarter, worth about $0.10. Of note, second quarter 2015
included a favorable $0.29 non-cash tax settlement.
On page eight, as I mentioned earlier, we are updating the company's financial outlook for 2016 to reflect our improved
operating performance to-date compared to our prior guidance. We still expect our full year 2016 net sales to be in the
range of between $24 billion and $24.5 billion, up 3% to 5% from 2015. The increase is driven by growth in both our
domestic and international business.
We've increased our full-year 2016 EPS by $0.20 from our prior guidance and now expect it to be in the range of $7.13
to $7.33. The increase is driven by our improved performance in the first half of the year as well as a slight
improvement to the effective tax rate and slightly lower interest expense.
Turning to our share repurchase, through the end of the second quarter, we repurchased 4.8 million shares of common
stock for just over $600 million and continue to see our diluted share count in the range of between 296 million and 298
million shares for 2016, a 3% reduction at the midpoint of the range. Also, based on our strong performance to-date, we
have increased the range for our 2016 operating cash flow guidance by $100 million and now see it between $2.8
billion and $3.1 billion.
And as you can see on page nine, we've included guidance by business. We left the sales unchanged from prior outlook.
Looking at margins, we've increased the margin guidance range for the company and now see operating margin to be in
a range of 13.2% to 13.4% for the full year, up 20 basis points from our prior guidance. At the business segment level,
we now see the operating margin in a range of 12.6% to 12.8% for the full year, driven by higher expected operating
margin at IDS and SAS.
Before moving on to page 10, given our year-to-date bookings strength and our expectation for a strong back half of the
year, we are now raising our full-year 2016 bookings outlook to $26 billion, plus or minus $500 million. This $500
million increase to the prior range is driven by strong demand from our global customers.
On page 10, we have provided guidance on how we currently see the third quarter for sales, earnings per share and
operating cash flow from continuing operations. We still expect third quarter sales to be in a range of just under $6
billion to $6.1 billion, consistent with our prior guidance. EPS from continuing operations is now expected to be in a
range of $1.57 to $1 62, lower than our prior guidance due to the timing of the TRS transaction, which we had
previously forecast in the third quarter. Some of this impact has been offset by the timing of performance
improvements previously expected in the fourth quarter.
Before concluding, as we have discussed on past earnings calls, with regard to our capital deployment strategy, we
expect to continue to generate strong free cash flow to maintain a solid balance sheet at our current credit rating going
forward.
We remain focused on deploying capital to create value for our shareholders and customers. This includes internal
investments to support our growth plans and productivity improvements as well as returning capital to shareholders

through share buybacks and dividends. Making small targeted acquisitions that our technology and global growth
needs, and from time-to-time, making discretionary contributions to our pension plans.
In summary, if you stand back and look at the quarter, we had strong performance. Our bookings, sales, EPS, and
operating cash flow from continuing operations were all higher than expected. Based on this performance and our
near-term expectations, we increased our 2016 guidance for EPS, operating margin and operating cash flow.
With that, Tom and I will open up the call for questions.
Q&A

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen &
Company. Please proceed.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Yes, congratulations on good quarter.
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Thank you, Cai.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Given the strength in the quarter really across the board and the good cash flow, how come
you cut back on your share repurchase from the first quarter and what's your thinking going forward regarding cash
deployment?
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Yeah. Hi, Cai. It's Toby. Let me address that one. So we had planned and we front-loaded
the share repurchase based upon the timing of our cash flows, okay. And we always had Q1 in excess of the balance of
the year. We're more than halfway through what we had targeted at the beginning of the year.
That said, related to the repurchase, we still continue to see value in our stock. At our last call, we indicated a target of
80% to 90% of free cash flow going back to shareholders.
Right now, we probably see it maybe at the bottom of that range, pending market conditions. And if we continue to see
strong movement in the stock, we're not going to chase the stock price. Share repurchase will still continue to be a core
part of our capital deployment strategy, with the stated goal of reducing the diluted share count over time. And that
hasn't changed, but we will continue to be disciplined when it comes to the allocation of our capital.

Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays. Please proceed.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Hey, good morning, gentlemen
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Hey, Carter.
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Good morning, Carter.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Just a quick clarification for you, Toby, and a question, Tom; Toby, on the TRS transaction,
is there equity income to consider that will be missing going forward? I just was unsure the accounting implications
there, but wanted to make sure we all got it modeled correctly.
And then, for Tom, just on the Forcepoint competitive landscape, I noted during the quarter, obviously, the purchase of
Blue Coat by Symantec. I wondered if you could talk to what implications that has for that marketplace and how you
think about the landscape post that announcement.
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Yeah, sure. I'll address, Carter, the TRS one. There are a few moving pieces with the
remaining venture going forward that impact both IDS operating income and at the Raytheon level, net income, but

they essentially offset each other and are not significant to our results. So we shouldn't see an impact one way or the
other going forward.
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: And on the Forcepoint, you are absolutely correct, Carter. Commercial cyber is a
dynamic and rapidly evolving environment. And you did mention competitive landscape and it's going to continue to
shift. Raytheon continues to invest in R&D to ensure that we have the best product and capabilities for our customers
and that's where we're getting feedback from our customers on.
I would add one thing is that you probably saw that the multiples in valuations for Blue Coat acquisition do reflect the
premium value and growth potential that this commercial cyber market currently has.
Just a quick status on Forcepoint, we have integrated Websense in with our Raytheon Cyber Products Group. That's
substantially complete. It was a seamless transition to the new organization and now we are working to complete the
transition of the Stonesoft acquisition into the overall company. And we see considerable upside potential as we move
forward based on this business we have put together.

Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Please proceed.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Hey, Jason.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Tom and Toby, I was just wondering if you could just walk us through what you think these
bookings that you've been getting here over the last year or so tell us about the cadence of revenues over the next
several years. This is going to be linear growth or do you have some visibility on when all of these bookings are going
to actually convert into some revenue streams?
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Well, Jason, you know the nature of our business. The majority of these big awards have
about a three-year or five-year cycle, in that range. So traditionally, I mean, we lighten up the first year. If it's a
three-year, we lighten up the first year a little bit, lighten up the last year and the middle year is the main. But normally
it's about a three-year duration in terms of revenue generation out of the majority of the bookings.
IIS does have some quick term one year type turn business. But majority of the business and majority of these major
awards that we brought in are three to five-year type revenue generators.
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: And I would just add, obviously, we're not giving guidance for 2017, but when you
convert that strong pipeline to a financial perspective, the backlog we had entering the year on the heels of a 1.09
book-to-bill, strong book-to-bill through the first six months, strong four quarter trailing book-to-bill. As Tom
mentioned in his comment, a pipeline that we haven't seen of this magnitude for quite some time. We expect to
continue to grow that top line taking all that into account into 2017 and drive margin expansion as well.

mix and do you see the growth trajectory in Missiles as a secular one or are we seeing kind of a temporary jump up on
things like Paveway that we may not see continued growth there in the same way we have?
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Let me hit that, Doug, real quick. It breaks into three buckets; the first bucket I actually
mentioned in my prior comments was the counterterrorism and that's driving the sales on the precision weapons across
the board at Missiles. The other bucket is deterrence and that's essentially driving a lot of the work relative to our
Patriot missiles, and our Patriot systems, and then the last large bucket is, I would call it, I use the word the third offset
strategy or the future in terms of upgrades to new missiles and capabilities. In the middle bucket on these deterrence
there's a large one. You saw that in terms of awards on our standard missile product line.
The bottom line is, is that Missile company is getting significant uptick in each of those three major areas, and we
should see that going on for a sustained period of time, at least over the next five years.
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: And, Doug, I would just, a little bit more nearer-term, if I take that [ph] op tempo (29:55)
bucket around our consumables, and then the rest of the business that the other two buckets that Tom described, think
of it this way. The growth this year is split roughly half and half between – driven by the [ph] op tempo (30:09) and
consumables and the other half through the rest of the business, and, as Tom said, based upon the demand we're seeing
across the board there, we'd expect all aspects of the Missiles business to contribute to growth over the next 12 to 18
months.

<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Good morning.
<Q - Samuel J. Pearlstein>: I was wondering if you could talk about the $500 million increase you had in the
bookings. Is that any one program or is that across the board? And I guess somewhat related is I know there's been an
RFI out for the new increment of the Next Generation Jammer and wondering if winning on the first one positions you
well for the next one or if it's kind of starting over from the drawing board?
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Well, let me address the $500 million. The $500 million is multiple opportunities for
bookings through the rest of the year. So we're not just hanging our hat on one big award to be able to bring that on
board.
Relative to Next Generation Jammer, that program is moving ahead excellently. It's on schedule. And we're very happy
about the performance of that program. Obviously, our customer, the Navy, is also very happy with the performance.
We are working with the Navy in terms of the next, I call it, Next Generation Jammer II or another implementation of a
Next Generation Jammer, and we are well on our track, I believe, to have a solid offering for the Navy on that program.
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: And I think, just to add to Tom's point about the $500 million increase, Sam, across
multiple programs, as Tom said, a lot of the, you know, bookings, the favorable bookings, we've seen so far is timing,
but within SAS is where we see a lot of those opportunities playing out. They've had a real strong first half of the year
between the international classified booking in Q1, JPSS and Next Gen Jammer that we mentioned, so across multiple
opportunities, but the growth would mostly be in the SAS business.

<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Yes. I was wondering, Toby, if you could kind of give us what the discount rate impact
would be on FAS/CAS if we drew the line today, like we've heard from other companies?
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Yeah. George, so at this point, it is too soon to predict where we think things will go
between now and the end of the year. You know, we will give everyone an updated outlook, as we typically do, on the
third quarter call. That said, let me give you a little bit of insight to a few things. Year-to-date, our asset return is about
4.5% and due to asset smoothing, any type of actual return would have to be significantly different than expected at
year-end in order to have a meaningful impact on 2017 FAS/CAS and/or net cash.
That said, assuming all other assumptions remain the same, every 25 basis points change in our discount rate has about
an $80 million impact on 2017 FAS/CAS and net cash would be unchanged because it continues to be based upon a
25-year average discount rate. So a few variables there that you all can use and model, but, again, with half the year left
to go, a little too early to predict what exactly next year may look like. And we'll update you here at the end of October
on our third quarter call.

<Q - Hunter K. Keay>: Hi, good morning. Thank you.
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Morning, Hunter
<Q - Hunter K. Keay>: Morning. Hey, Tom, you talked about the $4 billion opportunity for SDB II. I'd kind of like to
talk about that program for a minute. I think there is still, I believe, some unknowns around which planes and maybe
which specifically, which variants of planes are going to be equipped with that in the future and maybe to that extent,
which countries have interest depending on cost and other things like test results. So can you share with us some of the
assumptions that are behind maybe the install base and adoption that got you to this $4 billion number? And would you
categorize that as either conservative or aggressive as we sit here or is there maybe upside to that and when you'll hit it?
Thank you.
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: So first of all, the Small Diameter Bomb II, it's definitely going on the F-35. All the
F-35's, both the domestic and international, have an opportunity to be able to use that very sophisticated precision
weapon. So I think that's the main aircraft now. It also goes on F-15's and F-16s and it's a pretty simple system to
integrate onto an aircraft. So we will be working to put that on any aircraft that we're allowed to go put it on, but the
bottom line is, is that that forecast assumes just the F-35, F-16s and F-15s, majority of it being domestic. So we have
still significant upside from that number on the international marketplace.

maybe you could talk about where you are in terms of improving some of the risk management in achieving some of
the milestones, because it looks like those were factors in the results. If you could be a little program-specific, that
would be helpful.

<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Yeah. So let me take that and then, if Tom wants to add any color, he can. And I'll start,
Howard, with IDS, right. So we've been talking about IDS for a while, but we obviously continue to see opportunities
to expand margin further in the second half of the year. We did raise our margin guidance, based upon the results
through the first half of the year, by about 40 basis points. Half of that was because of a little bit higher of gain on the
TRS transaction and the other half was from productivity we are seeing, because of the leverage of the volume going
through our factory, the investments in factory automation, equipment upgrades, as we mentioned before.
And I talked about our third quarter guidance and how it was, from a timing point of view impacted by TRS moving
into Q2. That was worth about $0.50. We did offset about $0.12 of that, primarily driven by further opportunities for
net program efficiencies to drive more margin. Those are moving in from Q4 to Q3, not just at IDS, but at other
businesses. So we feel real good about where we are headed going forward from a margin perspective. We would
expect to continue, as we've been saying, both at the company level and, specifically, at IDS to continue to expand
margins going forward beyond 2016 into 2017 as well.
From an IIS perspective on the sales, they had a good quarter. Their sales were up the 3%, driven by cybersecurity and
special mission programs. For the second half, we see their sales in line with last year's second half, despite having four
fewer workdays. And we still expect growth for the year at IIS in the low single digits.
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: And I'll just cap that off, Howard, with the fact that both our Andover plant at IDS and
also our Tucson plant – and on the Tucson plant, with tripled production on several of the missiles there without having
a significant need for capital expenditures to be able to do that – and then also at the IDS plant, because I know you've
been out before, the parking lot is overflowing, which means there's – and that's not just one shift. That's on multiple
shifts. So both of those factories are chugging along at very high capacity rates. That obviously gives a strong signal
and strong support for high margins moving forward.

Your next question comes from the line of Richard Safran with Buckingham Research. Please proceed.
<Q - Richard T. Safran>: Thank you. Hey, good morning.
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Morning.
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Morning.
<Q - Richard T. Safran>: I heard the comments at the outset of the call on international in the quarter. I also know
you're not giving out a 2017 guide, but I wanted to know if you could talk on maybe expectations or maybe comment
directionally on international demand for next year, given the strong bookings you're seeing. And as a second part,
earlier this year, there were concerns about oil prices, Brexit, things like that, that might do to international demand for
defense equipment. Could you maybe comment about those concerns and tell us geographically where you're maybe
seeing changes in demand and for what types of systems?
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Well, let me hit on the international side right off the bat here. We have 17 – I did
mention the Poland Patriot opportunity and we also have the THAAD TPY-2 radar opportunity in 2017 also, 2017,
2018. So that's kind of two big ones for 2017. There are a also a significant number of orders for precision munitions
that will be coming in in 2017 and some other areas in terms of missionized aircraft that we believe will be coming in
2017 also, so we believe bottom-line, a strong pipeline of international awards in the 2017 timeframe.
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: And I think you mentioned Brexit, and I'll make more of a general comment, rather than
specific, to your question about international. We don't see any significant impact at all from Brexit. Just to put it in
perspective, the British pound is the functional currency for only about 2% of our sales, so not a major impact at all to
the company and to the business.
And I think on the Middle East, we mentioned the order for Kuwait Patriot upgrade for about a $0.5 billion here in the
quarter. I think Tom also mentioned in one of his prior comments back in Q1, we had another significant order for

Your next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Hi, good morning, everyone.
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Morning,
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Good morning, Noah.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Hey, I wondered if you could dive a little deeper into what's driving the booking strength at
SAS. It looks like that's been actually the strongest book-to-bill in the first half. And I know there's some nice
exposures in there between space and intel and unmanned and some other growth areas, but if you could get a little
specific there.
And then related, it looks like the guidance for revenue for the segment implies revenue would decline a little bit in the
second half, despite those very good bookings and the trend you're on in the first half, if you could sort of explain that,
that would be helpful.
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Noah, we'll split the question here. As we talked about earlier, we had a major award in
the first quarter. And that was at SAS for an international product, which set them up for a good year in terms of
conversion of that revenue in essentially 2016, 2017 and 2018. They've also done quite well in the classified domain in
terms of new awards and converting those new awards into revenue.
They also are working and completing up on the Next Generation Jammer EMD program, which is in full swing,
another significant revenue generator for the overall business. And I can tell you they're operating on all cylinders
relative to all the other programs that they have in there. And it's a good healthy mix of, I would call it, new programs
coming on board, programs that are, I would call it, in their mature state, and then programs that are starting to fall off.
So they have a very good, I would call it, a very healthy mix of programs that should be good revenue generators here
for the next five years.
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Yeah, and as far as your question on the sales in back half of the year, so sales were up
9% in the quarter, 8% year-to-date, driven by classified programs at SAS. The second half will be driven by both
domestic and international classified programs. Obviously, they're off to a good start and we see ourselves ending the
year closer to the higher end of their sales range.
What may be distorting it a little bit here for you is, you know, we give it to you in one of the attachments, our
workdays are a little different this year, where the back half of the year, and Q4, in particular, has four fewer workdays
than we saw in 2015. If you normalize for that, they would be showing some growth in the low single digits in the
second half.

<Q - David E. Strauss>: A question on cash, Toby, maybe if you can just touch on the major components, specifically
contracts in process continues to build. When does that growth slow or level off? And then cash taxes, whether there's
been any improvement there in terms of what you're looking for? And then the potential to maybe smooth the pension
cash hit that you've talked about in 2017? Thanks.
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Sure. So let me start with the CIP. You're right. We have seen a buildup in our CIP
balance. This increase was inline with what we were expecting. It was primarily driven by our sales growth, along with
the timing of program milestones and collections, including the ramp-up on some of the more recent awards that we've
had last year and into the early part of this year.
It's also important and I would note that our expected cadence is similar this year to prior years, with a buildup of CIP
in the first half and then a decrease in the second half, really driven primarily by the timing of certain milestones and
collections.
If you look forward to the end of the year, and I think we talked about this back in Q1, we would expect our CIP
balance to be up compared to 2015, but more in line with what our balance was at the end of Q1 of 2016. And this is
aligned with our growth profile and, again, driven by the timing of program milestones.
As we move to the back half of 2016 and into 2017, we will continue to focus on driving working capital improvements
and cash flow generation across the business. You know, we obviously saw strong cash flow here in the quarter. Some
of it was timing, David, right, but some of it was permanent improvement for the year, which is why we raised the
outlook for the year by $100 million to the new range of $2.8 billion to $3.1 billion.
As far as cash taxes go, I think that was your second question, no change from a total year point of view from what we
were previously expecting there. We still think cash taxes will be paid a little bit over $900 million for the year, the net
of refunds a little over $750 million for the year as well.
I think your third question was around the cash impact in 2017 from the required funding of the pension. So, look, as
we've said previously there, when we hold all the assumptions constant, we see our CAS increasing going from 2016 to
2017 as we transition fully to harmonization and then remaining relatively flat beyond that.
In 2016, the pension cash flow is a bit of an anomaly. It's up from 2015, but then again after 2016, the cash flow from
pension, it's still expected to be positive, but more, as we've said, at a normalized rate, plus or minus $700 million net
positive.
We do see improved cash flow in our business as programs continue to progress through their life cycles and achieve
significant program milestones that will improve the cash position and our continued focus on working capital,
including cycle time and payment term reductions with our customers, will also drive some cash flow, which could and
will offset part of that increase.
You know, as a reminder, that increase is really driven by the plans coming out of full funding from a PPA point of
view, and, again, primarily having to fund the annual service cost.
As we always do, kind of last point here, you know, we'll continue to monitor all aspects of the pension. And if it
makes economic sense to the company, to the shareholders, we'll consider making discretionary contributions before
the year's over that could potentially have a further impact on the cash flow profile in 2017 and beyond.

<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: I guess I missed it the first time, but I was on another call. I wanted to ask for a
clarification on Poland, Tom, and then another question, but is this still, this Polish competition, is this for a full-up
system or is it a shorter range, smaller system?
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: That's an excellent question. There's actually two pursuits or two programs that Poland is
pursuing. One is a system that the Patriot system satisfies. And as you probably have seen in the press, the Minister of
Defense is moving forward with the Poland acquisition and so working government-to-government and also Raytheon
is heavily involved in that procurement.
Then there's another program which is being competed and it's a shorter range system that ties directly in with the
capabilities of our NASAMS system, the system that protects our nation's capital.
It's also the system that we sold to Oman and about four other countries outside the United States. So the two, we are
obviously in a good position on Poland Patriot, and we are working to make sure that we're in a good position on the
short range system, too.

Your next question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Please proceed.
<Q - Joseph DeNardi>: Yes, thanks very much. Toby, just on the IDS guidance, seems like the revenue is ramping up
in the back half of the year, but margins are coming down a little bit, so can you just talk about some of the puts and
takes there and whether the exit rate on the revenue side is a good way to think about IDS growth in 2017?
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Yeah. So from a revenue point of view, for the total year, we see IDS sales, you know
roughly in line with 2015, with, as you said, the cadence improving as we move through Q3 and Q4. That's due
primarily to the start-up of some new awards this year, as well as the continued ramp-up on some of our international
Patriot programs as they move through their normal lifecycle.
You know, from a margin point of view, as I said earlier, we still see opportunities for margin expansion. We were
pleased with the results in the second quarter, the margin, the 15.5% margin that IDS delivered, excluding the TRS
gain. As I mentioned, part of that was from accelerating net program efficiencies, profit improvements from the back
half of the year into the second quarter.
We see a little bit more of that in the third quarter. We upped the margin guidance by the 40 basis points, half of which
was attributable to operating performance, the other half to the gain. And we would expect to continue to see margin
improvement at IDS beyond 2016's rate normalized; for the TRS gain, we'd expect to see improvement continuing into
2017.

Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please proceed.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Yes, Toby, I just want some clarification. The $0.20 increase in earnings, the way I look at
it, maybe $0.03 from the little higher gain in IDS, $0.05 from taxes, so $0.12 from operations, even though operations,
you said, were $0.20 better in the quarter, so just looking for some reconciliation?
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Yeah. So the $0.20 and maybe it's just the definition of the buckets here, so you got the
$0.03, right, on the gain, right. That's about $0.03 higher, $0.05 on tax, about $0.09 from the business operating
margins, okay. And then I mentioned interest was a little better. That's about $0.01. And then we had some corporate
operating items that was another $0.02. So you can bucket it a lot of ways, but around $0.12 out of that $0.20 from
operations and about $0.08 from non-operating items.

<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Morning. Hey, I was wondering if you could touch on couple of competitions. One
is the T-X and your T-100 offering there with Alenia, and kind of the progress you're seeing and the type of
relationship you're having, where it seems like a relatively low investment, but a good way to kind of enter adjacent
markets.
And then, the GBSD program, is that kind of gets into gear over the next few years, how your go-to-market strategy is
in the context of that as well. Thanks.
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Myles, what was the second program you're asking about?
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent.
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Okay. Let me hit the first one here on the T-X competition, and a little bit about our
approach to the competition. We're treating the program as more than just an airplane, flying an airplane. It's really
about preparing the pilots for the mission's success in advance. And we're looking at it for their ability to deal with
multi-faceted and increasingly complex battle space.
And so what we're bringing to the table is our industry-leading capabilities and training and also next-generation
mission systems. And we believe we're well-positioned to provide the Air Force a comprehensive solution to their
training needs here. Our offering is the Alenia M-346 end configuration and it's already training fourth and fifth
generation pilots from Israel, Singapore, Italy, and Poland. It is a complete system, from the classroom, the simulators,
to the aircraft. It is operationally-proven. It does provide high degrees of confidence in both schedules, cost and
performance, based on its proven capability. Our T-100 solution incorporates also our team's expertise in live virtual
instructive training, [ph] I think it's enough (56:29) to drive efficiency and enhance affordability.
In terms of timing, it is our understanding that the Air Force does plan to release an RFP by the end of this year and to
award a contract by the end of next year, so we are working this very heavily. It's an important program to Raytheon.
It's also an important program to the Air Force. And we believe we have the best solution on that.
