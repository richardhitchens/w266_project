Thomas P. Joyce
Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. We were pleased by our solid start to 2015. The team executed well in a
changing and challenging macro environment, using the Danaher Business System to drive strong organic revenue
growth and expand core margins in the quarter.
DBS continues to enhance our competitive position and drive share gains across the portfolio by helping us identify,
direct and execute on high-impact investments in product innovation and sales and marketing. As a result, seven of our
nine strategic platforms grew at a mid-single-digit rate or better in the quarter, including Test & Measurement
Instruments, Water Quality, Gilbarco Veeder-Root, Diagnostics/Life Sciences, Product ID and Automation.
We were also encouraged by the noticeable impact DBS has already made on many of our recent acquisitions,
including Nobel Biocare, Devicor and Aguasin, that further boosted our performance.
This is another record first quarter for Danaher. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share was $0.93, including a negative
$0.02 impact from the strengthening U.S. dollar versus our previously communicated guidance in January.
Revenues for the quarter grew 4.5% to $4.9 billion, with core revenues up 5% due in part to extra selling days in the
quarter. This growth exceeded our expectations and marks our best quarterly core growth performance since 2011.
Acquisitions contributed 6% to revenues while currency translation negatively impacted revenues by 6.5%.
Geographically, the high-growth markets grew mid-single digit but performance was mixed as strength in China and
India was offset by weakness in Russia and Latin America. In China, sales increased nearly 10%, led by our Dental,
Diagnostics and Gilbarco Veeder-Root platforms.
The developed markets also grew at a mid-single digit rate, with both the U.S. and Europe up mid-single digit. In
Japan, as expected, sales declined double-digits due to a difficult prior-year comparison in which customers accelerated
purchases ahead of the VAT increase on April 1, 2014.
Gross margin increased 80 basis points to 53.4%, marking the first time our gross margins have exceeded 53%. Core
operating margin expanded 25 basis points, or approximately 60 basis points excluding the impact of foreign currency,
with three of our five segments improving more than 110 basis points. Our reported operating margin was 15.9%.
On the capital allocation front, M&A remains our primary focus. We deployed approximately $500 million on three
bolt-on acquisitions in the first quarter, including the acquisition of the Siemens microbiology business. These
acquisitions strengthened our market positions in our Dental, Diagnostics, and Product ID platforms.

In February, we also increased our annual dividend by 35% to $0.54 per share, and we expect further increases over
time. Our tremendous balance sheet and active acquisition funnel, combined with recent volatility in the global equity
markets, uniquely positions us to deploy our substantial M&A capacity.
Turning to our five operating segments, Test & Measurement revenues declined 1.5%, with core revenues up 2.5%.
Reported operating margin decreased 220 basis points, and core operating margin declined 225 basis points, largely due
to lower sales in our higher gross margin Communications platform.
Core revenues in our Instruments platform grew mid-single digits for the second consecutive quarter, led by the
developed markets and China. Fluke core revenues were up high-single digits, as its biomedical and thermography
product lines each increased double-digits.
Strength in thermography was augmented by the launch of the TiX560 and TiX520 series of thermal imaging cameras
during the quarter. This expert series combines an articulating lens, on-camera analytics, and the industry's largest
responsive LCD touchscreen, allowing mechanical engineers to navigate over, under, and around objects to quickly
capture process, and process the highest quality infrared images on the spot.
At Tektronix, our core revenues increased at a mid-single digit rate for the second consecutive quarter. Healthy demand
for military and government customers in North America was coupled with strength in the semiconductor segment in
China.
During the quarter, Tektronix introduced the new high-performance ATI oscilloscope, the DPO70000SX. The DPO
offers the most accurate real-time performance and highest analog bandwidth on the market. It combines patented
signal capturing technology, compact design, and highly scalable architecture to help reduce noise and distortion so
electrical engineers can better understand and solve their most complex problems.
Core revenues from our Communications platform decreased at a double-digit rate. Double-digit growth in security
solutions and high-single-digit growth at Fluke Networks was more than offset by a decline in network management
solutions. Platform orders grew over 20% in the quarter, which gives us confidence that we'll achieve positive core
growth in 2015.
We continue to expect the combination of our Communications business with NetScout to close in mid-2015, and this
morning we announced that NetScout has received clearance from the U.S. Department of Justice with respect to the
proposed transaction. Close is subject to approval by NetScout's shareholders and other customary closing conditions.
Moving to our Environmental segment, revenues increased 7%, with core revenues up 8.5%. Core operating margin
expanded 175 basis points, while reported operating margin was up 60 basis points to 19.5%.
Our Water Quality platform's core revenues grew approximately 10%, with robust growth in our analytical
instrumentation, chemical treatment, and ultraviolet treatment businesses.
Hach had an outstanding quarter, with growth across most major product lines. Sales in the U.S. and Europe grew
double-digits, as the team's application of DBS growth tools, such as funnel management and transformative
marketing, continue to drive share gains.
We built on this momentum by launching our breakthrough water quality testing system, the SL1000 Portable Parallel
Analyzer, or PPA, in over 40 countries. Notably, the PPA's ease-of-use has already started to change the way our
customers perform critical water quality tests, making it one of the most important new products in the market.
At ChemTreat, we saw robust demand for our chemical treatment solutions and services in both North America and
Latin America. ChemTreat's consistently strong performance is a direct result of its targeted investments in
feet-on-the-street and development of its best-in-class sales force. The ChemTreat team has done a fantastic job
implementing this approach in Latin America with its most recent acquisition, Aguasin, which grew more than 20% in
the quarter.

Gilbarco Veeder-Root core revenues grew mid-single digits, driven by strength in China and the U.S. In the U.S.,
upcoming EMV regulation changes drove over 20% growth in point-of-sale solutions and dispensers. We're pleased
that customers have continued to make Gilbarco their supplier of choice when implementing these necessary payment
system upgrades.
Turning now to Life Sciences & Diagnostics, revenues grew 2%, with core revenues up 5%. Core operating margin
expanded 115 basis points and reported operating margin was 12.7%, which was negatively impacted by one-time,
non-cash charges related to the recently-closed acquisitions of Devicor and the Siemens microbiology business, which
is now known as Beckman Coulter MicroScan.
Core revenues in our Diagnostics platform grew at a mid-single-digit rate. At Beckman Coulter Diagnostics, core sales
were up mid-single digits, led by double-digit growth in our immunoassay and urinalysis product lines.
In the U.S., increasing customer utilization and higher win and retention rates helped drive mid-single-digit growth for
the third consecutive quarter. This improvement in win and retention rate is an example of the team's persistent focus
on product innovation and enhancing the customer experience over the past three-plus years.
Beckman Coulter is a fantastic example of how thoughtful application of DBS growth, Lean and leadership tools can
make a good company even better. We hope you'll join us in Brea, California at our Investor and Analyst Event in June
to hear more of this terrific story.
In January, Beckman closed the previously-announced acquisition of MicroScan. MicroScan expands our
well-established footprint in hospitals and reference labs with a suite of highly accurate, automated instruments and
consumables that help identify infection-causing bacteria and determine appropriate antibiotic treatments.
Radiometer's core sales increased high-single digits, its 13th consecutive quarter of high-single digit growth or better.
Demand was solid across all product lines, led by double-digit growth in blood gas and AQT consumables.
During the quarter, we expanded our AQT testing menu in Europe with the launch of the procalcitonin assay, or PCT.
PCT detects life-threatening sepsis infections on-site in operating rooms and other critical care centers, enabling
doctors to provide timely antibiotic treatments and ultimately save more lives.
Sales at Leica Biosystems were up high-single digits, led by advanced staining, which grew over 20% in the quarter.
We posted double-digit growth in the U.S., where the stabilizing reimbursement environment resulted in improved
capital spending. We were also encouraged by a strong start of Devicor, an acquisition we closed last December, where
a reinvigorated product portfolio and implementation of DBS tools helped to drive approximately 10% growth in the
quarter.
Core sales in our Life Science platform increased mid-single digit, with solid performance in the U.S. and Europe.
Notably, we saw China sales return to growth in the quarter. SCIEX core sales grew double-digits, led by strength in
clinical and applied end markets. Strong commercial execution and investments in new products have resulted in
meaningful share gains over the past several quarters.
Leica Microsystems' core sales declined mid-single digits due in part to a difficult comparison in Japan, where we saw
record shipments ahead of last year's VAT increase. Despite the sales decline, we're confident in Leica's steady stream
of new product innovation, including the DMi8 inverted microscope platform that launched during the quarter. The
DMi8 improve customer work flow for industrial applications by enabling users to prepare and change samples more
quickly than with traditional microscopes. It also features a configurable design, providing one solution for both basic
and advanced industrial users.
Turning to Dental, our Dental revenue increased 30%, with core revenues down slightly due in part to lower volumes
related to inventory destocking within our U.S. distribution channels. This occurred across many of our higher-margin
product lines and, combined with our continued investments in sales and marketing and product development, resulted
in a 385 basis point core operating margin decline.

Robust demand in high growth markets and strength in our orthodontic and value implant solutions were more than
offset by the previously mentioned inventory destocking. That said, we're encouraged by the improving sell out data
we're seeing in the U.S. market and believe the business will show improving growth trends throughout the course of
the year.
Nobel Biocare completed its first full quarter with Danaher, and we've made great progress so far. Whilst still early, we
were encouraged by Nobel's mid-single-digit average daily sales growth for the quarter.
One of Danaher's core values, Innovation Defines Our Future, certainly rang true at the bi-annual International Dental
Show in March, where [ph] KaVo Care Group (17:24) and Nobel Biocare launched more than 35 new or updated
products. The innovations unveiled ran the full spectrum of dental care, from digital imaging to treatment units to
consumables. Notably, attendees were able to preview our first integrated chairside CAD/CAM solution which will
allow dentists to design and manufacture custom prosthetics quickly and easily in their offices.
In Industrial Technologies, revenues declined 2.5% with core revenues up 7%. Our core operating margin expanded
185 basis points while reported operating margin increased 210 basis points to 24.6%. Automation core revenues
increased mid-single digits as continued growth in our Industrial Automation North American distribution and medical
end markets was partially offset by weakness in agriculture. This represents the platform's best quarterly performance
since early 2011.
Product Identification core revenues increased high-single digits, with robust demand for our marking and coding,
color management and software solutions.
Videojet had a solid start to the year, delivering high-single-digit growth as our substantial and growing installed base
continues to drive broad share gains. The team delivered mid-single-digit growth or better in all major geographies,
with particular strength in Western Europe, China and India.
During the quarter, Videojet launched its 1620 and 1650 High Resolution Micro Printers that enable fast, high-quality
printing on very small surfaces. This technology is essential in such industries as electronics and personal care, where
legibility and clarity are critical to consumer safety and industry regulations.
In March, Esko acquired MediaBeacon, a leader in digital asset management software. MediaBeacon saves our
customers' time and money by allowing them to store, repurpose and share their digital media efficiently across
projects, departments and channels.
Bringing together these specialized companies equips us better to serve our global network of customers and meet a
growing industry demand for more integrated packaging and artwork management tools.
So to wrap up, we had a very good start to 2015, delivering our highest quarter of core revenue growth since 2011. The
team's solid execution using the Danaher Business System continued to drive relative outperformance and enhance our
competitive position.
We remain cognizant of a strengthening U.S. dollar and a changing macro environment. However, we're confident that
our focus on optimizing our portfolio and seizing high-impact growth opportunities will help us build a better, stronger
Danaher in 2015 and the years to come.
We're initiating second quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance of $1.01 to $1.05, which assumes core
revenue growth of 3% to 4%. We are also updating our full year 2015 adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance
to the range of $4.23 to $4.33. We expect the strengthening of the U.S. dollar since our fourth quarter earnings release
in January to reduce 2015 earnings by approximately $0.07 per share. We continue to expect core revenue growth
between 3% and 4% for the full year 2015.

Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal remarks. Lisa, we're now ready for questions.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operation Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Scott Davis with Barclays.
<A - Thomas P. Joyce>: Good morning, Scott.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: [ph] I'd ask (22:15) a little bit about FX, and I think we understand the impact of translation.
I think most people do, at least for the group overall. But what does FX really mean for you guys as it relates to global
competition? Does it change how you think about where you produce and where you ship out of? Does it change or
impact the price dynamic at all, or is it really not much of an impact?
<A - Thomas P. Joyce>: Well, Scott, I guess we first start and think about FX from a competitive perspective. And it's
hard not to think that the competitive dynamics shift a little bit in certain markets where the U.S. dollar has
strengthened against that local currency. That being said, let's take Europe for example, we continue to perform
exceptionally well there. We have during the entire shift of the currency. We've seen solid mid-single digit growth in
that market. We know that market generally across a number of our businesses is probably more of a low-single-digit
market on a core growth basis. And so, we're continuing to perform exceptionally well and taking share there.
You can look at Japan as another example where those shifts have happened, and certainly there's been some modest
shifts in the competitive dynamics there. But again, our businesses generally, in spite of a very challenging
environment there overall, we haven't seen really any meaningful shifts in the competitive dynamics and we're
continuing to perform well. So, we start there and think about competitiveness.
Relative to the overall operational footprint, we're going to see currencies move up and we're going to see currencies
move down. It takes quite a while to shift your manufacturing footprint. The day you think you've got that right is the
day a currency might turn against you and you end up in a very different place than you had hoped.
So in general, over a long period of time, we've had a balanced footprint that has provided a certain level of natural
hedge for us. Obviously, the shifts here have been far more dramatic and, therefore, the impacts [ph] have read through
through (24:29) the P&L. So, we continue to put ourselves in the best position possible from an operational footprint,
putting manufacturing operations in the best cost positions that we can with the best logistics and supply chains. But
these shifts do not cause any knee-jerk reactions on our part in terms of a repositioning.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: Okay, that's helpful. And then just as a follow-up on Dental, I guess I don't remember a time
where you had, kind of, call it, flattish core growth, where you saw – it looks like on the slides, core margin is down
385 bps. Is that just a mix impact of the higher-margin stuff being destocked or is there some other stuff in there, like
restructuring or anything else?
<A - Thomas P. Joyce>: It really starts with the volume itself, and that volume being slightly up in one side of the
business, slightly down in another side of the business. But generally, it starts with that volume position. And then, the
destocking, yes, in fact, was a primary driver relative to the higher-margin products being the areas where we very
cooperatively, and teaming with our distribution channels, made very conscious decisions about what we needed to do
in the channel from an inventory perspective.
I think what's really important to recognize about that situation is that we track sellout very closely with those
distribution partners, and we're very encouraged by what we see from a sellout perspective. So, we're confident in our
competitive positions. We understand that we're performing well, that those distribution partnerships are working very
effectively. This has been going on for a period of time now. We think we're getting towards the end of that. Q2 was
probably more of a transition quarter, and we're optimistic that we'll see better growth going forward.
But back to your question around the margins, it's really that combination of volume and negative mix. Now, one last
point there. Because we're confident in our competitive position, because, in a number of areas, particularly outside the

U.S., the Dental platform is performing extremely well, driving anywhere from mid- single-digit to, in certain markets
like China, growing double-digits, we continue to invest in that business. Investing in new products, you heard me talk
about the 35 new products across the platform; investing in sales and marketing. So while we've got some headwind
there in terms of doing the right things relative to the channel, we're confident that those investments are going to pay
off as time goes on.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: Okay. Great answer. Thanks, guys. I'll pass it on.
<A - Thomas P. Joyce>: Thanks, Scott.
Operator
And we'll go next to Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Hey, good morning.
<A - Thomas P. Joyce>: Good morning, Steve.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Hey, can we get more to the specs of the [ph] TBX (27:27) thermal imaging camera for
a second?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: I love the high hard ones.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: On the R&D and SG&A, both up in the quarter, was there a little bit of a discretionary
loading as you saw the organic growth come through there, or is that just kind of normal course?
<A - Thomas P. Joyce>: Steve, I would say that we set a course to continue to invest in the highest impact
opportunities that we saw from a product development standpoint, as well as from a go-to-market standpoint. So, we
set that course quite a while ago. We had terrific reviews last fall in our strategic plan review. I think we got a good
sense of where those opportunities were. And I think, on a discretionary basis, we made the call in a number of places
where we knew we were doing well. We knew that, as things got choppy, continuing to invest and stay the course
would ultimately prove to our benefit on a long-term basis.
I think one of the areas I'd point to specifically to that, staying that course, would be in Europe, again, where we've seen
this lower growth environment and where we've continued to perform above market rates in most of our businesses,
and that's largely a function of staying the course from an investment standpoint. It's true today also in our high-growth
markets, where we've seen a few of our markets – I'd cite specifically Latin America, specifically Brazil and Mexico,
where we've got some challenges there, but we're continuing to stay the course from an investment standpoint. But also
making some thoughtful decisions about shifting investment carefully where there's higher growth opportunities, and
there's some countries right now in Latin America where the teams are doing a terrific job shifting that investment.
Staying the course in China right now as well, staying the course in India from an investment standpoint, both of those
countries paying off very well for us across a number of the platforms. So staying the course, making some
discretionary choices even when the temptation is to pull back hard, to make sure we take advantage of what's a choppy
environment.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: And so I guess on that, I'm getting to something in the range of a 25% to 30% core
incremental for the quarter, which I usually think of you guys as more like 35% to 40%. Should that migrate higher
over the course of a year? Are we in this trade-off now where organic growth is going to be higher, but maybe we
should expect a little bit lower incremental?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Steve, I think there are a couple of things going on, some of which Tom alluded to. Where
we're confident we're taking share, we want to sustain those investments. I think the second element is, we're having
pretty high fall-through on the FX hit. The fall-through on FX has been closer to 22%, 23%, so we're feeling some
impact on that.

So, I think it's a combination. But as we went through the quarter and saw the strength, we saw some opportunity to
step up some of the investments. We'll navigate that carefully. But if we're in this mode of outperforming vis-à-vis
competition, we're probably going to take a little more latitude on investments.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Okay. And days sales impact on the quarter, that's my final one? Thanks.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: I think the five is probably closer to a four when you look at days adjusted which, again,
would be consistent with what we put up in Q4.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Okay, thanks a lot.
<A - Thomas P. Joyce>: Thanks, Steve.
Operator
And we'll go next to Steven Winoker with Bernstein.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Hey, thanks and good morning, all.
<A - Thomas P. Joyce>: Good morning, Steve.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Yeah, I have no thermal camera imaging questions, can't top that. So, let's see. Just I
think from a high level here, stepping back for a second, this is another quarter of solid core growth. You guys have
been [ph] pulling this off (31:24) and talking about gaining share quarter-after-quarter for a long period of time now.
And I'm just trying to get a sense going forward of the business model and the extent to which that and these higher
gross margins you think are sustainable or a function more of some of the cyclical markets, think you're in a new norm
at this point? How are you looking at that, Tom and Dan?
<A - Thomas P. Joyce>: Well, Steve, I think we do think that the trajectory that we're on is sustainable. Clearly, we're
in some challenging macroeconomic times here. But again, we feel like the investments that we're making in the right
places are driving core growth in a number of our businesses and translating into those share gains.
And those are also businesses where we do have good gross margins, and we always look at those gross margins and
the improvement of those gross margins as indicative of higher value propositions that's we're delivering to our
customers. Those are sometimes value propositions associated with new product innovations. Sometimes, they're
associated with improvements in our technical service and support, our ability to get price across a number of our
markets. So, this is the model of the Danaher that we are working on building quarter-after-quarter and year-after-year.
So, that's the way we tend to think about it.
And I will extend that, by the way, to the way we think about capital allocation, is looking at businesses and
opportunities in the market that represent those same characteristics; good growth opportunities across global markets,
high brand preference to professional end users, representing solid gross margins and the ability to build sustainable
business models with strong consumable streams that really speak to a level of resilience and ultimately competitive
advantage. So, that's the playbook.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay. And then, let me ask the obligatory M&A question following your capital
deployment point, which is – it's a little bit different though this time, right? We're hearing commentary from other
CEOs on how pricey they view the current environment. So, how are you thinking about that? How's your outlook
changing, if at all?
<A - Thomas P. Joyce>: I don't know that our outlook has changed very much, Steve, over the last couple of quarters.
Clearly, outstanding businesses with a number of the characteristics that I mentioned just a few minutes ago. Our assets
are well valued in the marketplace. And those assets, while highly valued, tend to be outstanding businesses with great
long-term opportunities for growth. So, I'm not sure we've seen much change in that. But we continue to be very
encouraged by the conversations we're having and the funnels that we have across the businesses. We're making

And we'll go next to Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Yeah, thanks. Good morning.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Good morning, Nigel.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Yes, I just want to come back to the Dental destock. Inventory movements is something we've heard
from others companies. It doesn't feel like it was elsewhere, but did you see any of that dynamic elsewhere across the
portfolio?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Nigel, I can't think of – not to suggest there couldn't be a pocket here or there. But in general,
anything material across any of the other segments, I would say no, we're not hearing much, if anything, in that regard.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. And then, I just wanted to pick up on Steve's – well, Steve's point on capital allocation rather
than thermal imaging. You mentioned in the prepared remarks the ambition to keep raising dividends, and is that an
ambition to raise the dividend payout ratio or dividend in line with earnings?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Nigel, I think the expectation that we would, in the intermediate term, continue to raise it
faster than overall earnings and cash flow growth. But that's not with an expectation of sort of getting to a market yield
but getting to a more meaningful yield.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. And do you have a target payout ratio over time?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Well, I mean, if you think of the market, 2%, 2.5%, maybe if we were half of that in time, out
three years to five years, that might not be a bad place to be.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay, great. And just finally, congratulations on the news on the NetScout transaction this morning.
Is the impact of that transaction built into – I know it's not built into organic growth guidance, but is it baked into your
EPS outlook? And how do you expect the EPS impact of that transaction to play out?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Nigel, yeah, first of all, very good news. I mean, that really is the long pole in the tent to get
to closing. Still some other – a few other things we need to get through, but much more confident today that we get to a
close here early in the summer.
It is not factored in. A lot of that will depend ultimately whether we do a spin or a split. Based on where their stock is
trading today, if we did a split, on an annual basis it would approximately wash. So the earnings we would give up
there would reduce our share count and would be roughly in a equal offset. Now that may impact first half, second half,
but on an annual basis it will be roughly a full offset.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: And core growth accretive by about 50 bps in the second half of the year roughly?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Well, as we mentioned, orders were very good in the Communications business in the first
quarter. The last couple of quarters, orders were up 20%. So, I don't think it necessarily will be accretive to revenue
growth in the back half. It would be accretive in the first half on a pro forma basis, but I wouldn't expect that to impact
the second half because that business is definitely building.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay, very good. Thanks, guys.

And we'll go next to Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Thomas P. Joyce>: Hi, Shannon.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Hey. Could you talk a little bit more about what you're seeing in the mix between
equipment and consumable growth? And then on the equipment side specifically, you talked about the product
innovation, sales and marketing. Clearly, you're getting share in some places. But seems like other guys are also
struggling just with customers' willingness to spend right now, and it seems like you're overcoming that. Could you just
maybe give a little sense of what you're hearing from customers as you're having more success getting them to step up
and buy?
<A - Thomas P. Joyce>: Shannon, we're very encouraged by what we see in the balance of growth both in the
equipment and the consumable side, both sides of the house posting good growth. That obviously bodes well for
continued performance because as we build that installed base across a number of the businesses, those annuity streams
that accrue to the consumables business obviously are very important to the resiliency of the business model and also to
margins.
Relative to your question about customers willing to spend in CapEx, I'd say we have a number of examples where
even in challenging markets our teams are performing quite well and seeing great penetration in terms of the installed
base. I'd point to the Videojet business and the performance there, the continued growth of that installed base and the
consumables stream. Clearly, what we've seen on the Diagnostics side, a little bit more favorable environment in terms
of diagnostic utilization. The macro indicators around the healthcare market are improving marginally
quarter-over-quarter, so we're seeing a little bit of loosening in capital spend in the hospital environment.
As I mentioned, we saw the first quarter returning to growth in Life Science in China, which is also encouraging. That's
more of an equipment market than a consumables market. So, I think there's a number of places we'd point to where
we're seeing our teams execute extremely well and gaining share, driving that installed base without necessarily strong
tailwinds from market perspectives.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: And, Shannon, in the quarter, equipment, we were up mid-single-digit, which was the best
quarter we've had in equipment, probably have to go back till maybe almost 2011.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Interesting. All right, thanks. And then maybe just a follow-up on PID. So Videojet,
clearly still gaining some share. But overall, that market actually just seems like one of the better places to be right
now. Are there certain verticals that are particularly good there or favorable things you're seeing in the overall market?
<A - Thomas P. Joyce>: I think Videojet has performed pretty well across a number of their verticals. I mean when
you look at food market, when you look at the beverage market, broadly defined packaging overall, clearly a very
competitive market but one where the Videojet team, both through a combination of product innovation and a number
of improvements using DBS growth tools, have driven an enhanced go-to-market model.
They're clearly gaining share, and they have over an extended period of time. If we look back really through the cycle,
VJ has continued to perform above the market growth rates on a consistent basis. And again, a combination of product
innovation and go-to-market execution really has contributed there. But, yes, I think to the vertical end markets, they
are good, steady verticals, and VJ has taken advantage of those.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Great. Thanks a lot, guys.

<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Hi. Thank you.
<A - Thomas P. Joyce>: Hi, Julian.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Hi. I just wanted to follow up on your comments at the beginning around the changing
macro environment. Because your tone across the businesses sounds pretty good. So I just wondered if you're seeing
that changing macro play into your own orders today in parts of T&M or Industrial Tech, and maybe just any color on
how sort of in recent months you've seen the short-cycle Industrial demand moving.
<A - Thomas P. Joyce>: Sure. I think when we talk about the macro, it's probably easiest to articulate that, Julian, on a
geographic basis. And some of the changes that we've seen have clearly been in Latin America, for one, where we've
seen some significant weakening in that market. Clearly, Russia, again, a much smaller position fortunately for us but a
challenging market there. China, while still a very good market, we're performing quite well in that market, you've
obviously read the headlines about a little bit of softening there from GDP growth rates of the past. So, we see those
shifts.
On the other side, we've seen some geographic markets improve. India being one. Again, the teams' performing quite
well there. So, I think that's one way to look at it. Europe is steady. But again, we think we're outperforming in that
market. So, I think those would be a few of the things that we would point to.
On the short-cycle Industrial side, really Dan Daniel's teams in a number of those businesses, Automation we talked to
a little while ago, really are performing very well. And that's really just a function, again, of I think, a combination of
new product innovation in a number of places, as well as good day-to-day go-to-market execution.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: And Julian, I would add, just you asked about very recently, I think similar to some other
companies, we did see in some pockets in March, in the U.S., particularly in the U.S. in the equipment, a little bit of
softness. It's hard to tell if it's any trend. Through the first half of April, we're pretty much in line here. But if there's any
slight shift here in the last four weeks to six weeks, I would say the U.S. equipment piece is slightly weaker.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Great. And then, just my second question around the sort of relative appeal of valuations
for acquisition in the healthcare and sort of non-healthcare sides of the business, particularly I guess with regards to
Industrial Tech, where certainly on organic growth, you seem on a much stronger footing today. How are you seeing
evaluations in that arena, and is that area somewhat more attractive now because you've got the core really firing again?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Julian, it's overall pretty balanced, as Tom alluded to. Nothing's inexpensive right now. But
there are some good assets out there, both on the healthcare and the industrial side, that we're active around. So, I
wouldn't put up a highlight more to one space versus the other.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Great. Thank you.

We'll go next to Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.
<Q - Richard Eastman>: Yes, good morning.
<A - Thomas P. Joyce>: Hey, Rich.
<Q - Richard Eastman>: Tom, could you just double-back for a second on the Dental business. I'm curious, within
North America, with the destocking phenomena that you saw here in the quarter, given consumer income is up and
disposable personal income is up and spending is up, I'm curious, is there anything structural in North America on the
Dental side of your business that's creating the destock? And maybe you could share with us just what the sell-through
stats are that you were watching?

Page 12 of 15
<A - Thomas P. Joyce>: Rich, I would not say there's anything structural about our business or our position relative to
the North American market. We would agree that the market is improving marginally, based on a couple of the things
you mentioned around consumer spending and discretionary income and so on. This is more a cooperative agreement
with our distribution partners, where we're working with them to ensure that the channels are right-sized from an
inventory perspective.
From a sell-through perspective, we see mid-single-digit – or moving from low-single-digit to the lower end of
mid-single-digit kinds of sell-through coming out of the channels to the end user, and we know that based on how our
products are performing specifically, as well as how the categories are improving. So, that reinforces our belief that
we're well-positioned and that there's nothing structurally going against us in terms of our position in the market.
<Q - Richard Eastman>: Okay. And then, just a quick question for Dan as a follow-up. It appears to me, we do some
just kind of basic math against the TekComm's NetScout transaction as it's pending, and given NetScout's stock price
and maybe TekComm's EBIT as it finished the year in 2014, is there a scenario where this plays out that that
transaction and the buyback, given NetScout's valuation here, that buyback of Danaher shares, that that's actually
accretive to EPS? Because it looks like you could do some math that would show maybe $0.10 accretion from that
transaction.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Rick, if you look backwards, so if we were to close the deal given where their respective
stock prices are today and we did a split, looking backwards, it would be accretive. But because of the building backlog
and order book, if I look over the next 12 months, it would be about a wash.
<Q - Richard Eastman>: Okay.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: We were down double-digit Q4, down double-digit Q1, we expect better performance,
probably getting to around flat here in the second quarter. But given what we're seeing in the order book and the
backlog, we expect growth in the back half here. When you factor that in, it changes the economics in the buyback a
little bit.
<Q - Richard Eastman>: I see. Okay, all right. Well, thank you.
<A - Thomas P. Joyce>: Thanks, Rich.
Operator
And we'll go next to Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Isaac Ro>: Good morning, guys. Thank you. A question about Europe. I think you guys said that it had
mid-single growth in that region and it slightly outpaced the end-market growth like-for-like. So, I was curious if you
could maybe give us a little color as to where you think the implied share gains are happening?
<A - Thomas P. Joyce>: Thanks, Isaac. They're coming in a number of places. Clearly, in our Environmental segment,
performance at Hach would be one of the places that we would point to that's done an excellent job. Again, a continued
focus on investment in that market, both in terms of new products as well as in terms of feet on the street. I think a
good example there also of approaching those investments across multiple verticals or end markets, so strengthened
both the municipal side and, interestingly, particularly on the Industrial side. So, I think good performance there.
The PID business, particularly Videojet, I think continuing to perform well there. So, it's fairly broad-based.
<Q - Isaac Ro>: Got it. Okay. And then just maybe a bit more of an open-ended question on capital allocation, and just
sort of curious if you could talk to the extent that your deal funnel has evolved since you took over last fall, any themes
you could highlight to help us appreciate how you're looking at acquisitions going forward, just general themes that
might help us appreciate what you're doing.

<A - Thomas P. Joyce>: Sure. I think what we're really trying to do, Isaac, as we look at markets and companies in
those markets platform by platform is ensure that we are looking for the best opportunities to strengthen our existing
platforms strategically.
I mentioned when we were together in December that we're much more focused on the existing five segments and nine
strategic platforms as they exist today and going deeper into those individual segments, strengthening each of them in
terms of their competitive positions, as opposed to going wider to the right or to the left. So, I think that's probably the
primary focus that we have across each of the platforms, looking for the best opportunities to strengthen our positions
in the markets in which we participate today.
<Q - Isaac Ro>: Got it. Appreciate...
<A - Thomas P. Joyce>: And as you can see – you see a couple of examples there recently, right? You look at
Siemens micro, how that strengthened our position at Beckman; you look at Devicor and how that strengthened our
position in the work flow of anatomical pathology, most recently MediaBeacon in our PID platform and the way that
strengthened the value proposition of managing digital assets to brand owners, all good examples of strengthening a
competitive position in the places we play today.
<Q - Isaac Ro>: Got it. Thanks a bunch.

And we'll go next to Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Yes. Good morning, guys.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Good morning, Andrew.
<A - Thomas P. Joyce>: Andrew.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Just a question on Environmental. Could you just talk in a little bit more detail, core growth was
just really strong, how much of it was end market dynamics and how much of it was you guys just taking market share
or putting new products into the market?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Well, particularly in Water Quality where we're up almost double-digits, it's very hard to
think the market is growing more than 3% to 5%. As Tom alluded to, we were exceptionally strong in Europe, up over
double-digit. Again, at least for the quarter, that would be at least probably 2x what market grew in the quarter.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Got you. And as I look at Life science and Diagnostics, once again core growth just seems to
accelerate. Can you talk about the momentum into the second quarter and second half of the year? Particularly, it seems
U.S. consumer is improving with lower energy prices or at least it should improve. Why would core growth slow down
into the second half given those fundamentals and given that Beckman Coulter has very nice momentum at this point?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Andrew, I'm not sure we're suggesting much of a slowdown. We were a little over 5%. And
as we said, in December and January, if we're 3% to 4% for the year, that segment could be more in that 4% to 5%
range.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Got you. But what I'm saying is why – sorry, just to rephrase. It just seems that 5% could be
sustainable or better given the consumer trend and given Beckman Coulter finally executing quite well. That's what...
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Sure. Well, we're certainly on a good trajectory there. It is also probably important just to
note quickly that there was an impact of days here in the first quarter. We have a high proportion of – certainly the
Diagnostics business is represented on the consumables side of the house, and the consumable side of the house is
where you get a little bit more of the bump on a days' basis. So, there's a little bit of a factor there, Andrew, as well.

And it appears we have time for one more question. We'll go to our last question from Brandon Couillard with
Jefferies.
<Q - S. Brandon Couillard>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Hey, Brandon.
<A - Thomas P. Joyce>: Brandon.
<Q - S. Brandon Couillard>: Tom, with respect to the Life Science business in China, could you quantify the growth
in the period and perhaps peel back the onion in terms of where you saw the strength? And do you feel like the research
budgets, particularly around the high-end instrumentation are maybe starting to loosen up a little bit?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Thanks, Brandon. We saw mid-single-digit growth in China in Life Science. Again, the first
really good signs of life there in terms of growth in the last few quarters. So, we're encouraged by that. I think we've
reached the point of probably stability there. A lot of what the government has done relative to the scrutiny that they've
applied around tenders, we think has sort of now reached kind of a level set or a steady state in the market.
There is, we believe, a little bit of a lift in spending overall as well. We're in the last year of the 12, 5th-Year Plan [12th
Five-Year Plan] and usually you get a little bit of a bump from a spending standpoint in that regard.
And in general, as we've said for a long time now, we really believe quite strongly in the structural drivers of that
market, that there will be continued investment over time in the Chinese market in Life Sciences. And we've seen a
number of examples of where the government maintains a consistent outlook that that's an important segment for
investment.
As are a number of other segments where we're well-positioned, like in Environmental, like in different segments of
healthcare, in Diagnostics as well as in Dental, so we think if we were to choose some segments in China where
government spending is likely to continue to be a focus, we think we've chosen those are that are probably best
positioned.
