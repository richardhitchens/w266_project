MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AT&T fourth quarter 2016 earnings results call.
[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Michael Viola, Senior Vice President,
Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael J. Viola
Okay, well thank you, Kathy, and good afternoon everyone. Welcome to the fourth quarter conference call. It's good to
have everybody with us. Joining me on the call today is Randall Stephenson, AT&T's chairman and CEO, and John
Stephens, AT&T's Chief Financial Officer. John is going to cover our operational results along with a 2017 outlook and
Randall will follow that with an overall business update, and then we'll follow that with Q&A.
As always, our earnings material is available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website, and that includes
our newly redesigned investor briefing which you'll want to take a look at. You can find them at
att.com/investor.relations. I need to call your attention to the Safe Harbor statement on page 3. It says that some of our
comments today may be forward looking, subject to risks and uncertainties. Results may differ materially and
additional information is available in AT&T and Time Warner's SEC filings and on the Investor Relations page of each
company's respective websites.
We're also in the quiet period for the FCC spectrum auction, so we can't address any questions about spectrum today.
And I will also turn your attention to page 4, which is information regarding the SEC filing specifically, the recently
filed Form S-4. Again, that's on slide four.
And now I'll turn the call over to AT&T's CFO, John Stephens.

Thanks, Mike, and hello everyone, and thanks for being on the call today. Before I turn over to Randall for a strategic
view of our company, I'd like to provide a brief overview of our fourth quarter and full year operational results that are
on slide five. Our team has executed very well in 2016. We grew revenues and on an adjusted basis, we expanded
operating margins and increased earnings as we had projected. And free cash flow came in at the high end of
expectations, even with strong capital investment.
On top of that, we made significant progress with our integration of DIRECTV, hitting our cost synergy target and
launching our first over-the-top video service nationwide. For the fourth quarter, consolidated revenues were down
slightly due to fewer upgrade sales and some pressure on our legacy services, with strong customer gains and growth in
video and IP-based services, mostly offset these declines. At the same time, we continued to see adjusted consolidated
margin expansion even as we invested in customer growth opportunities in mobility, video and Mexico.
For the fourth quarter, our adjusted EPS was $0.66, or up nearly 5%. This includes adjustments for amortization, our
annual mark-to-market pension plan adjustment, merger integration related items and a one-time tax gain that was
excluded.
During the quarter, we aligned our depreciation schedules with our updated business cases and engineering studies for
certain of our network assets. This lowered depreciation expense on a sequential and year over year basis. This impact
was offset by investments in strong wireless customer growth in both the US and Mexico and the development, launch
and promotion of DIRECTV NOW. And while we expect those depreciation benefits to continue in 2017, they are
expected to be offset by other non-cash items, such as reductions in capitalized interest, benefit plan expense and taxes.
Earnings in the fourth quarter were impacted by revenue pressure in our legacy wireline services as a result a lack of
fixed business investment as well as competition in small business.
Moving to cash flows, we had more than $39 billion in cash from operations for the full year. That's a record for us.
This allowed us to return substantial value to the shareholders through dividends while also investing more in capital
than we ever had before. Capital investment was a $22.9 billion for the year. That includes taking advantage of pricing
and financing terms from our vendors that made good business sense for us, particularly with bonus depreciation still
intact. Our investments are growth focused. For example, we're ahead of plan with our fiber-to-the-home build. Today
we market to nearly 4 million consumer customer locations. Free cash flow was strong, coming in at $3.7 billion for the
quarter and nearly $17 billion for the year. That gives us a dividend payout ratio of 70% for the full year. Our net debt
to adjusted EBITDA ratio came in at 2.26 times.
Let's now take a look at our operations where you see a consistent story of investment and the subscriber growth it
generated. Those details are on slide six.
Let's start with wireless, which had a terrific quarter. As a reminder, the company is providing supplemental
information for its total US wireless operations. In a traditionally very busy quarter, we had strong subscriber growth,
lower postpaid churn, and record margins. EBITDA service margin was the highest ever for both the full year and the
quarter. And we also turned in record full-year operating income margins. We did this even while investing in growth
of our smartphone subscribers with offers such as an unlimited wireless with video and a buy one get one free BOGO
offer. This helped grow our branded smartphone base by nearly 1.1 million when you include customer upgrades.
Churn was a solid story all year and didn't disappoint in the fourth quarter. Postpaid phone churn was a record fourth
quarter low of 0.98% and overall postpaid churn improved year over year in part due to the increasing number of
wireless and video bundles. And those numbers include churn pressure from our 2G network shutdown. We had strong
sales even with the higher margins and 2G shutdown. We added 1.5 million total subscribers with more than 0.5
million postpaid net adds. Branded phone subscribers also continued to grow. We added about 340,000 branded phones
in the quarter.
We did lose postpaid feature phones in the quarter. However, if you back out our forced turnover caused by 2G
network shutdown, our postpaid phone base was essentially flat. The 2G shutdown impacted net adds for about 22 basis
points of pressure to our total churn. You see it most in our reseller and connected device numbers. But the team
executed well and the network shutdown is now complete. It's a competitive market in a busy quarter, but our wireless

team turned in another solid performance.
It was also a big quarter for our Entertainment Group. The launch of DIRECTV NOW got most of the headlines. This
robust over-the-top offering started strong, adding more than 200,000 paid subscribers in its first month. This gave us a
solid video sub growth in the quarter and we're pleased with the initial results from DIRECTV NOW but we're going to
be careful with our expectations. Special promotions and launch pricing helped drive strong growth and it's still early.
We're learning more about the subscriber base and the platform while we're working through the expected challenges
that come with launching a new innovative service of this magnitude. Early sub demographics tend to be more urban,
younger, and apartment dwellers than a typical linear customer.
Entertainment Group revenues grew with gains in video and IP services. Legacy services are less than 10% of total
revenues but still represent about a 250 basis point drag on the group's growth rate. AdWorks continues to add scale as
well. It was a $1.5 billion business in 2016 with revenues growing at double-digit rates. Fourth quarter margins were
down year over year because we didn't hesitate to invest in growth opportunities. That includes startup and launch costs
for DTV NOW and increased promotional efforts to new and existing customers across our entire product set. There
were additional margin pressures as our customer rate increases were less than the content rate increases. This supports
our thesis for acquiring Time Warner and strengthening our position in content.
In broadband, overall subscribers were relatively stable in the quarter while our fiber buildout continues to be a great
story. Our penetration of broadband is a full nine percentage points higher in those markets compared with our
non-fiber footprint. After we launch our 100% fiber network in a new market, we are seeing about half of the new
broadband customers buying speeds of 100 megabits per second or higher, with 30% of the customers taking one gig.
And the real kicker is that the vast majority of recent sales in those markets are taking multiple services from us. So as
our fiber deployment accelerates, we're excited about this growth opportunity.
Now let's look at Business Solutions on slide seven. Our business segment continues to perform well even as it feels the
impact of a lagging economy and the lack of business fixed investment. Wireless growth was solid but not enough to
overcome the pressures of legacy services decline. The drop-off in business wireline spending was felt in all our
business segments. Enterprise is maintaining a leading share position in a tough environment but comparisons were
impacted by the second quarter 2016 sale of some of our hosting operations. Small business is seeing the impact of
competition.
Strategic business services growth helped offset some of the decline in Business Solutions. It was up $230 million or
8.3% year over year. These services now represent 38% of wireline revenues and an annualized revenue stream of
around $12 billion. Margins expanded as EBITDA grew by more than $50 million as efficient cost management helped
to offset the impact of a slow economy. We're also seeing continued progress on our network virtualization and our
software defined network-enabled services. Our virtualization plan is ahead of schedule with 34% of our network
virtualized at the end of the year and NetBond continues to be well received with 19 of the leading cloud service
providers now making it available.
Moving to our International operations, Mexico continues to be an investment story while our DIRECTV Latin
America operations continues to manage profitability in a very difficult environment. Mexico has been a remarkable
success story. In a little more than a year, we deployed 4G LTE to 78 million people in more than 160 markets,
rebranded our services and stores and became the fastest-growing wireless company in the country. Customer growth
was strong. We added 1.3 million new wireless subscribers in the fourth quarter and over three million customers for
the full year. This strong investment obviously pressures margins, but as you can see in several parts of our business,
we are clearly willing to invest in growth. In our Latin America video business, revenues grew and operating income
increased. And the business continued to generate positive free cash flow despite their challenged environment.
Let's now review our full-year results, see how they stack up with the guidance we gave you last January. That's on
slide eight. The teams did a good job of hitting the targets we set out a year ago. Revenue growth hit our double-digit
growth projection thanks to our DTV acquisition and gains in IP services and video. Adjusted earnings came in the
middle of our mid single digit EPS growth target. Adjusted operating margins actually expanded by 60 basis points as
efficiencies and cost cutting overcame investment pressure in Mexico and other growth related expenses.

Capital investment was at the high end of what we expected. We took advantage of vendor offers and bonus
depreciation when it made business sense. Free cash flow came in at the high end of expectations and we accomplished
this even after making $750 million in payments to our pension and benefit plans this year. This includes $350 million
in payments into our pension plan as part of our agreement with the Department of Labor from our prior Mobility
funding. These payments now fulfill our obligation under that agreement a full year ahead of schedule.
We have also voluntarily made another $400 million deposit to our employee medical fund. These payments make our
benefit plans even stronger. In fact, we do not expect any funding this coming year. This strong cash generation
allowed us to easily hit our annual dividend payout ratio in the 70s. And if you adjust for the voluntary pension benefit
payment, that percentage dips to the high 60s.
We also did a nice job hitting our operational targets. I already mentioned hitting our virtualization goal on our fiber
build. We also made significant progress with our 5G trials including a millimeter wave trial underway in Austin, and
our network team accomplished all of this while they had expenses that were down year over year. When you look at
everything we are doing with the combination of spectrum, fiber, software, new technologies, you can see why we are
confident in our ability to lead in connectivity.
Now let's take a look at our outlook for 2017 on slide nine. Our business always has had a lot of moving pieces, but
with a new administration taking office, there is even more to think about this year. It's just too early to call the impact
of several issues. Tax reform has been a hot button and it makes sense that a company our size with the taxes we pay
would clearly have an opportunity to benefit from a change in tax rate. We're also staring at the potentially better
regulatory environment. Positive change in both of these areas would help us deliver faster on plans to innovate and
grow our business. Some are speculating that the economy might grow faster and there will be an uptick in business
fixed investment. That would definitely be good for us. And we're waiting to hear for the final outcome of the FirstNet
process.
You know that we are an approved bidder and we're optimistic about our opportunity, but we don't know the answer to
that yet. We're also in the process of closing our Time Warner transaction. We remain confident that the deal will be
approved later this year. These are all potentially very good things for AT&T, but these items are not included in our
2017 guidance. Our outlook is based on what we know today and here is what you can expect from us in 2017. First,
we see revenue growth in the low single digits. Growth in IP services and video is expected to offset competitive
pressures, soft business investment and declines in legacy services. We expect adjusted earnings growth to continue in
the mid single digit range.
We also expect continued consolidated operating margin expansion. CapEx is expected in the $22 billion range, similar
to last year and we expect to see continued free cash flow growth with free cash flow in the $18 billion range and
continuing our drive towards $20 billion.
And we'll continue to move forward on all the operational initiatives that we have underway with our network. We'll
sharpen our outlook as the year unfolds, but that's a broad view of what to expect from us in 2017.
With that, I'll turn it over to Randall for a strategic business update. Randall?
Randall L. Stephenson
Okay thanks, John, appreciate it. We have a new President and FCC Chairman, both, so I know everybody's talking
about tax and regulatory reform, and you're going to have a lot of questions for us about that. But before we get to your
questions, I do just want to take a brief moment and offer some perspective on how AT&T is now positioned in
converging telecom media and the technology space.
We've spent the last few years in a very heavy investment cycle. It's no secret. We've been getting ready for a world
where mobile technology and premium video content would intersect. And we've been convinced for a long time that
this intersection was inevitable. And when it happened, we wanted to have the foundation laid to make the intersection

a very different experience for our customers. And that foundation in our mind begins with a network that's engineered
and designed for the special requirements of video. It has to have deep capacity and it has to have broad distribution.
And if you would look at slide 11, you can see that this is exactly the foundation we've built. Our high-speed network is
engineered and it's built for video. It's an LTE network that covers nearly 400 million people in the US and Mexico.
There's nobody else that's even close. We're building out fiber to 12.5 million locations. This network is software
defined, and that gives us unique scalability at the lowest cost per megabyte around. It's a network with an elegant path
to gigabit speeds and 5G.
And in terms of capacity, we are really in a unique position here. We've invested $27 billion in spectrum over the past
five years, and as a result, we have the premier spectrum position in the industry, 40 megahertz of fallow spectrum.
And as John referenced, if we're successful with our FirstNet bid, we get access to another 20 megahertz of prime
nationwide spectrum for public safety and secondary use.
And as you also heard John say earlier, our 2G network has now been shut down. And that spectrum is being reformed
for future use as well. And then if you look at our points of distribution, they're second to none, 147 million mobile
customers across North America, and that includes a leading IoT business. We have 46 million pay-TV subscribers in
the US and Latin America, 16 million broadband subscribers, and we have an OTT platform, DIRECTV NOW, that's
off to a really fast start.
And so that's our foundation, and it's an indication of what's to come. We think this is a very strong foundation. And so
given that, it seemed only logical for us to assume an ownership position in the critical application that's going to ride
on this foundation. And that's premium entertainment content, and that's exactly what we're doing with the acquisition
of Time Warner.
And if you look at slide 12, our technology and distribution, we think are a perfect fit for the best premium content
creator and distributor on the planet. In the telecom, media and technology space, we're building a global leader. Now
we've been pursuing a strategy to become the premier integrated communications company in the world, and
DIRECTV really catalyzed that strategy. And you saw us execute on that last year with our new TV Everywhere
application and Data Free TV and DIRECTV NOW. And that integrated experience helped drive our best-ever fourth
quarter churn for our US postpaid Mobility business.
Now bringing Warner Bros., HBO and all the Turner networks under the AT&T umbrella is going to allow us to
expand this strategy beyond just simple connectivity to deep integration of premium content for our customers. And so
if you look ahead, the strategy's expanded to create the best entertainment and communications experiences in the
world. And I am very convinced that this foundation has been laid for us to deliver exactly that.
And so with that, what I want to do is turn it over to Mike and I'd be glad to take your questions on the quarter or
anything else you'd like to talk about. So, Mike?
Michael J. Viola
Okay, Kathy, we're ready to take the Q&As and so why don't you queue up the first question.
Q&A
Operator
Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead, sir.
<Q - John Christopher Hodulik>: Okay, great. Thanks. Randall, you brought up two important topics in your
prepared remarks, the tax reform and regulatory changes that we're seeing in Washington. Maybe first from a tax
reform standpoint, what's your view on how this unfolds and what it could mean, maybe especially related to guidance

for AT&T in 2017 and beyond? And then obviously new leadership at the FCC with Ajit Pai, just initial views on what
that could mean for telecom regulation in the US? Thanks.
<A - Randall L. Stephenson>: Okay. Thank you, John. I had the opportunity to meet with what was then the
President-elect a couple of weeks ago. And I got to tell you, I was impressed. I was meeting with a CEO. It was
obvious. And the President had a very specific agenda in terms of what he thought was critical, and that was tax reform
and regulatory reform. And we spoke at length about each of those. And I would tell you that the man, the President is
focused on these. And so I left with a degree of optimism that this could actually be pulled off this year.
Now what does that look like? We've seen the president's proposal. We've seen Paul Ryan's proposal. Both of them, I
think, trigger the impact that I have been talking about for quite some time, and that is if we want to get off this 1% to
2% growth plane, there is nothing that will trigger that like tax reform. I mean, everybody knows the numbers. We have
the most uncompetitive tax structure in the United States. It's the highest tax rate in the developed world in the United
States. And to bring that into competitive levels, and you pick your number, what tax rate you think that is, will have a
stimulative effect. We're convinced. In fact, we know at AT&T if you saw tax rates move to 20%, 25%, we know what
we would do. We would step up our investment levels, and there are things we would like to accelerate if we had a
more favorable tax environment.
So, John, my guess in terms of where this lands is probably no better than yours. But I do think a lower corporate tax
rate is likely. I think it's more than possible; I think it's likely. I think there will be some things that will be done to help
pay for that, and there is discussion about whether there would be denial of deductibility of interest costs, for example.
But they're also talking about immediate expensing of capital. So you have to factor a timing issue with a permit issue.
And then obviously, what nobody really has a good handle on is what happens in the way of trade. A border adjustment
tax and so forth and how that plays into this.
So it's really up in the air in terms of what this will look like, but I would tell you, I'm optimistic something would
happen. And as John pointed out, none of that has been factored into our numbers in the guidance that we have given
you. If tax reform does happen this year, the biggest payoff to AT&T, more than just the tax rates, is what happens on
the business side. I mean an extra 1% growth in GDP over the next couple of years is rather significant for AT&T. And
if a tax rate cut caused all businesses to think about investment the way AT&T is thinking about it, and all businesses
begin to invest, that has nothing but a stimulative effect to our customer base. We have a very large enterprise business
customer base.
And so we think this is nothing but positive. In fact I told some people last week in Europe that back in July, we had a
board meeting, and after we concluded our long-range plan, the board asked us to lay out for them what a recessionary
environment in 2017 would look like. Fast forward to December, and the board wanted to talk about what an upside
scenario in the economy would look like. And nothing happened between those two except an election and a President
who is talking about corporate tax reform. So I think this is very significant and very, very important.
In terms of regulatory, in terms of what to expect, all I can base my thoughts on, John, are Ajit Pai's writings and his
comments. Any he obviously was not a fan of the Title II regulation that was imposed on the industry. He felt like it
had gone entirely too far. We obviously tend to agree with him on that. We happen to be advocates of net neutrality,
just the concept of net neutrality. But placing utility style regulation on our Mobility and internet businesses, there is no
way anybody could argue that that is not suppressive to investment. And so we are hopeful that Chairman Pai will
come in and begin to address some of these issues that are suppressing capital investment.
We are also optimistic that he would begin to rationalize some of the regulatory oversight, areas where like on privacy,
we have two layers of regulation on privacy in this industry. And in a world where we're moving into media and
entertainment and content, the ability to have predictability and understand who oversees the privacy rules and who sets
those rules, and so bring some clarity to that. It's just, this will be very, very helpful to clear the underbrush of
regulation, bring clarity and some level of predictability to the regulatory environment. So we're optimistic in terms of
what a Chairman Pai would bring to the industry.
<Q - John Christopher Hodulik>: Great. Thanks for your help.

<A - Randall L. Stephenson>: Thank you, John.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Go ahead, please.
<Q - Philip A. Cusick>: Talk for me, can you talk for me about the success so far in cross-selling broadband and
wireless into DIRECTV homes? We haven't really seen the pickup yet of broadband the way we'd expected with
DIRECTV coming in, and how's that been going into wireless as you discount across those businesses? Has it been
more existing customers that are tying things together or are you really starting to see a cross-selling effect? Thanks,
Randall.
<A - Randall L. Stephenson>: I'll tee it up and then, John, I'll let you follow up my comments. But as we told you,
coming into the year, it was going to take time to get the cross-selling, just the plumbing and the mechanics, in place to
be aggressive on cross-selling. And we are at a place now where the last three quarters, we have seen multi-product
sales just continue to escalate. And they're a little bit behind our plan, but I would tell you the last two quarters are
starting to catch up to plan. So cross-selling on each sale is really getting to levels that we're feeling more and more
comfortable with and better about, so I think it's really good.
Early on, you hit the nail on the head. It has been our existing customers that are attaching the services to each other,
and so DIRECTV customers who are attaching unlimited wireless with their DIRECTV bundles. But we are seeing
some migration of wireless to the DIRECTV products sets as well, and I think the best place that this is manifesting
itself, Phil, is we were probably not the most promotional in the industry in the fourth quarter. And we set a record low
churn rate in the fourth quarter. And it's getting to a point where we're beginning to be able to attach cause and effect to
a lot of the integrated solutions and in the integrated offerings including unlimited data, Data Free TV and so forth.
So we're early in the game. The plumbing is now getting put in place and the billing is getting refined. We're still not
completely there on the plumbing and we're investing a lot of money to make that happen, but early indications, we're
feeling pretty good. They're starting to take hold.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Yeah, and the only thing I'd add, Phil, is if you look at the churn characteristics and the really
strong performance on the Mobility side, we attribute some of that to this video bundle with the wireless property. We
have about eight million customers now on that unlimited video bundle, and we believe that that's providing real cross,
if you will, product improvements. By the way, if we look at where we're going with the fiber-to-the-prem and the four
million homes we're selling into, the vast majority of those high-speed broadband sales are taking multiple products
with us. So that continues to go well, taking not only the broadband but the video and also the wireless. So that
continues to go well.
And then lastly, the attach rates that we're having, both the video and the, excuse me, the broadband and the video
product, continue to improve throughout the year. And so the effort that Randall talked about in training, getting the
plumbing right and training the call center people and training the techs and so forth, is paying off. We remain
optimistic about it. We're going to be cautious and make sure that we prove it out, but it is going well. And as I say, the
strongest point might be the 8 million customers who quickly bundled their video and their wireless offering, and you
see it in quite frankly in the churn results we have. It's really very good.
<Q - Philip A. Cusick>: If I can follow up, how do the sales of paying DIRECTV NOW customers line up to either
your wireless or fixed businesses?
<A - John J. Stephens>: I think what we'll tell you is that we're still going through all that details, and you've got to
remember that the DIRECTV NOW customer sales are much different with regard to the necessity. When you're
paying with a credit card online, the information you have with regard to physical location and so forth is different. But
what we are finding is they, as we mentioned, they're more urban. They're younger and they're apartment dwellers. And
so they're giving us an opportunity, we believe, to penetrate a market in wireless and other products where we don't,
where we're not as effective as we are in some of the other markets. So we think it's a real opportunity. So far, it is

lining up I think as expected in that urban, that multi-dwelling unit, that young marketplace, and in a marketplace that if
you will, we have an opportunity to grow share to get to some of the same levels as we have of share in some of the
more established markets.
<Q - Philip A. Cusick>: Thanks very much.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Sure.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from David Barden with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - David William Barden>: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess if I could, two. The first one for
you, Randall, just in terms of Pai's pretty clearly stated positions on the open internet order and price regulation, and
even things like zero rating, could you kind of map out a game plan that AT&T would have for taking advantage of
that? And what kind of appetite do you see in Silicon Valley in the content community for trying to take advantage of
some of the zero rating offerings that AT&T has?
And then second, if I could for you, John, on the guide. If you could, maybe unpack the revenue growth outlook a little
bit as to what the biggest moving parts are. And if I annualize the depreciation benefit you got quarter over quarter, it
looks like there's about $1.8 billion of lower depreciation incrementally in 2017 that would otherwise help earnings. I
think you said it was going to go away to other non-cash items. If you could kind of lay out what those are, that would
be great. Thanks.
<A - Randall L. Stephenson>: Hi, David. As it relates to our plans on zero rating under a Pai chairmanship, I tell you,
you shouldn't expect that they will change. We were going hard, and we had worked very diligently to put in place a
mechanism that makes this capability available to all comers. Anybody who wanted to take advantage of zero rating,
they can come in and take advantage of the lowest wholesale rate we offer, and they can do the exact same thing. And
so we put this in place in a very thoughtful fashion, in a fashion that is consistent with many, many years, in fact
decades of precedent in terms of how we implement something like this. And so we actually were quite confident that
zero rating as we were implementing it was fine under a Pai chairmanship or anybody else's chairmanship.
Now the FCC obviously issued a letter the last week of the prior chairman's tenure, and the letter was critical of it, but
we think the letter is without basis, without any legal basis. And so you should expect to see us go hard. We're having
some really good success in the marketplace with this. This is a value proposition that our customers are loving.
200,000 DIRECTV NOW subscribers are on it. They are taking advantage of it. It is a very elegant experience, if
you're a customer that you're watching AT&T content and it's not counting against your data buckets. That's a big deal.
And it's proving to be very advantageous in the marketplace for our customers. So you should expect to see us continue
that and continue to push aggressively on this.
In fact I'll tell you, if you want a perspective on 200,000 subscribers and how attractive this was in the marketplace at
$35 price point. We launched U-verse back in 2007. It took us a year and a half to get to 200,000 subscribers on
U-verse. So that's the elegance of this platform and the attractiveness of it to our customers. So we're pretty excited
about it.
<A - John J. Stephens>: David, with regard to the kind of giving a little, some additional insight into the guidance, I'll
go about it this way. On the Mobility side, we've seen the penetration of Mobile Share value plans, unlimited plans and
these bundled plans increase dramatically over the last three years. So we're substantially through that migration. And
we believe that with that, we have this opportunity to not only retain customers and continue to show good subscriber
mechanisms, or results. But also have an opportunity on the revenue side to prove that out. We're not giving specific
guidance on individual items.
Secondly, with regard to the handset business, we did see a year over year slowdown in handset upgrades, even in the
fourth quarter, even with the launch of a new device, an iconic new device. So we are learning about what the

customers want. We've given them their choice; they've showed up with more BYOD. They have chosen to hold their
devices longer and pay off their equipment installment plans in full. And that's all been good for us. It's been good for
our retention, for our customer counts, for our churn. But quite frankly, it will impact, depending upon how popular
sales are, how many upgrades we have, the revenues going forward from the equipment sales. I'll point out this year we
had gross adds that grew year over year. We had upgrades that were down significantly year over year. And so we are
sharing in the new competitive market, but our customers that are staying with us because our low churn are choosing
to hold their devices or bring their own devices to us.
On the business side, continue to have good penetration, good success with wireless, internet of things, connected
devices, all the capabilities there. And our outlook is still optimistic about that. The challenges with regard to the
traditional legacy business revolve around the economy. We continue to see good success in strategic services, but once
again, the best answer for that might be tax reform from a perspective of, as Randall mentioned, if people think
similarly to us and take those savings and invest and build their businesses, it'll be the best way for us to grow our top
line, which will be good for our customers, good for our shareholders, good, quite frankly, good for jobs. So that's that
aspect of it.
On the Entertainment side, we're seeing good growth in the speeds that customers are taking on broadband and good
response with the ARPUs associated with that. So we remain optimistic and we're significantly almost completely
through the migration to higher speeds. That'll continue on, but we're on the IP broadband platforms. If you look at the
video business, we'll continue to see that video business grow and continue to see, we'll learn about what happens with
regard to our over-the-top product.
Lastly, we have the challenges there of the legacy services that we'll continue to work hard to retain and to migrate into
other services, but that's the challenge. That's how we unbundle it. That's how we look at it.
The last piece I'll tell you is Mexico or International, Mexico continues to be a tremendous story of customer growth,
which could give us the opportunity for revenue increases. The challenges there are, quite frankly, foreign exchange
and what happens with the peso so that we will see constant currency revenue growth. We're confident of that. The
challenge will be what happens with foreign exchange rates, and we haven't assumed any improvement in our base
case. And then DIRECTV Latin America is just continuing to perform really well from a management perspective in
what continues to be a difficult, tough economy.
With regard to the depreciation initiative, let me pose it this way. I'm not sure where the number came from with regard
to the $1.8 billion, but I'd suggest to you this. The depreciation benefit year over year were right around $400 million
down on a sequential basis this year, and that's in this year's numbers. So that in and of itself goes to the comparison of
next year. But secondly, with regard to that depreciation, there's also other noncash items, things like capitalization of
interest with regard to spectrum and as you know, we're putting more and more spectrum to use. Changes in our benefit
plans and benefit expense, those things will continue to impact it, amortization of customer installation costs, quite
frankly, income tax accruals. All of those matters kind of go to offset the depreciation. I would suggest you're saying
we're near the number you quoted, but the depreciation aspect of year over year.
What I'll really point you out to though, is really the acid test for me and is the fact that we're going to – we have given
guidance that we will have free cash flow in the $18 billion range. And you can do the math on that. That free cash
flow is consistent if not higher than our guidance with regard to earnings. So we feel real good about our earnings and
particularly feel really good about our cash flows going forward.
<Q - David William Barden>: That's awesome. Thanks, John. Thanks, Randall.

<Q - Mike L. McCormack>: Hey, guys. Thanks. Randall, maybe just a quick comment on the overall competitive
landscape in wireless. We saw a lot of different happenings this year and you guys obviously doing some bundling,
T-Mobile getting aggressive, at least initially that free iPhone deal back in September. Just getting a sense for how
would you characterize the industry, and how do you think that changes as we look into 2017? And then maybe just
one for John on the economics as you think about U-verse subscribers moving off of the U-verse platform onto
DIRECTV proper. What's the sort of economic trade-off there? Thanks.
<A - Randall L. Stephenson>: Yeah hi, Mike. Competitive landscape, it's really competitive. And in terms of what we
think it looks like this coming year, we think it's really competitive this coming year. And it was, fourth quarter was
just a very promotional quarter. All the competitors got very, very promotional and free devices and buy one get one
free type stuff. We were probably less promotional than most, and doing that while maintaining what was for us a
record low churn rate, we felt really good about.
Our intention as we move forward is the same as it was the last quarter and that is, we're going to compete with
differentiated solutions, and this integrated solutions for us is really, really important. And as we pointed out and as
Phil was probing on, we're starting to get real traction in the marketplace of integrating our products and solutions and
our churn rate goes down so precipitously when we got more than one product bundled together. And particularly as we
begin to do some creative things like DIRECTV NOW and the TV Everywhere app on DIRECTV is proving to be
incredibly powerful.
This thing, the last numbers I looked at and John Stephens, you can correct me if you have more recent information.
But the volumes were growing like 40% month over month, I mean sequentially, and that's the amount of consumption
that people are using on their iPads and their smartphones of streaming video from DIRECTV on their devices, and
that's why the free data TV is so important and just such an important variable for our customers.
And so that is how you should expect we will compete again in 2017. We're getting better and better at putting these
packages together for our customers and the customer adoption rates continue to go up. So I think the next year is going
to continue to be very promotional, it's going to be probably, time will tell what happens on pricing, but I think you
should expect the promotional activity to continue. We'll compete with bundling and integrated solutions.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Mike, on the U-verse to DTV platform, I think it's pretty straightforward. One is, we still
have some content cost differentiation in some package capabilities that are important and we can achieve those.
Secondly, it frees up the data capacity on the wired networks, allows us to then provide broadband speeds that are
quicker and quite frankly alleviates some of the CapEx in the back office, so to speak, or back into the network, and
that's a positive thing. [ph] Current (45:52) it's going to eventually lead us to the ability to use one graphic user
interface, support cost on product support costs, and one standard, if you will, face to the customer, and those are all
important.
The other opportunity though is to just give us the opportunity to go to the customer and visit with the customer and
make sure we've maximized all the products and services we can sell to them, including not only the broadband, not
only the video, but wireless and others. So that's how we think about it. We certainly are committed to continuing to
provide a quality video product in either case, and we are continuing now to, if you will, provide an over-the-top that
allows us to do it whether we utilize either a wired or our satellite network. So we're trying to cover all bases and look
at all opportunities.
<A - Randall L. Stephenson>: And, Mike, I don't want to bounce around on you, but I want to follow up though on
the competitive environment because, all I spoke of was the consumer side of the market. And I wanted to make sure
that we didn't leave out the lion's share of our wireless business is the business side. And we're continuing to grow there
very nicely, our wireless business to business customers. And that again, like the consumer side, but we're way, we're
much further down the path on integrated solutions in wireless.
Because you think about where this has gone and where we are having our greatest success is our customers, getting
them from the mobile device on a secure network, VPN connection, into the cloud using NetBond and back out without
ever touching the public internet. This is proving to be a very powerful capability for our business customers, and then

we are having incredible success bringing IoT solutions to bear along with this. And we think we're leading the
industry in the Internet of Things capabilities that are integrated. Our VPN and in our mobile business together, it's
proving to be a really powerful combination for our customers as well.
And so bottom line, the growth of wireless from our B2B side of the house, our business customers, is continuing to be
fairly robust and it's a terrific business. And that is kind of the big proof point when if you can truly bring integrated
solutions to bear, the significance it has in the market and you compete at a different level, not just on promotions and
price.
<Q - Mike L. McCormack>: Right, great. Thanks, guys.
<A - Randall L. Stephenson>: Thank you, Mike.
Operator
Thank you. We now have a question from Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Amir Rozwadowski>: Thanks very much and good afternoon, folks.
<A - Randall L. Stephenson>: Hi, Amir.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Good afternoon.
<Q - Amir Rozwadowski>: I was wondering if we could touch back on your guidance for 2017. Your guidance calls
for adjusted operating margin expansion. How should we think about the trajectory of your wireless business within
this context against a backdrop of what you mentioned will likely be a continued healthy pricing environment for
wireless?
And then in terms of your guidance for free cash flow, you are pointing to $18 billion in 2017. Previously you had
suggested that cash flow could reach about $20 billion by 2020 plus. Based on this current trajectory, it seems that that
target could be pulled forward excluding Time Warner as well as any tax legislation changes. Is that a fair assumption?
And what are the operational puts and takes that could get you there?
<A - John J. Stephens>: Great. Thanks, Amir. Let me take a shot at this. First of all, with regard to the margins, as you
might expect, we're not going to give individual guidance on margins. But I would point out something that I think is
straightforward. And that is we have gotten 78 million 4G LTE PoPs built in Mexico. We've got 160 plus markets that
we've got distribution, brand knowledge, sales opportunities, and if you will, effective markets. And we have grown the
base of customers to 12 million. So we expect improvement in Latin America. You guys can see the numbers are,
clearly just in Mexico, particularly you can see they're clearly [ph] just display (49:58) what we did in Mexico. So that
will in and of itself give us a tailwind to improving margins. That's the first point.
Second point, we clearly have momentum in our wireless business on improving margins. The team has shown that
every quarter this year going back to last year. Challenges there are the point of when we decide to, as they did in some
cases in the fourth quarter, decide to invest in growth. And we'll continue to do that on a very diligent and thoughtful
manner. It was very effective in the fourth quarter. The team still came with great record margins. But I want to, I don't
want to go to specific segment guidance on margins, because we want to make sure the business units have those tools
at their disposal when they're performing at this level to invest in growth and get good customers.
So summarize it really, if you look first at the opportunities to get there, it's everything, The network operation is doing,
the fact that year over year our, if you will, back office, our network, our [ph] AT&O (51:02) costs are down. If you see
the heavy lifting work; if you see what's going on in the sales teams and the business unit operations and their
tremendous performance on management expenses, those all give us momentum. You see what's happening in Mexico
in the sense that we've now built that platform out significantly and are ready to start operationalizing that, that will
give you that confidence. I feel really good about that opportunity.

<A - Randall L. Stephenson>: Amir, to John's comment, he's made it twice and it bears repeating and maybe
emphasizing. And that is there's a lot going on inside this business right now. And by virtue of the software defined
networking implementation and a lot of the automation that has gone on in our network and IT organizations, that big
cost structure, the network, the big iron network, and all of our IT costs, year over year they are actually down and not
inconsequentially. They're down. This cost curve is actually on the run. And I've never seen this in my – I've been
doing this 35 years – and I have never seen anything like this.
In 2017, we're forecasting the exact same thing and feeling really good about our ability to execute on keeping that cost
curve moving down. It's providing a lot of support in a world of aggressive pricing and so forth to allow us to be
competitive in the marketplace. So that's a really important variable to take note of.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Amir, with regard your comments, we are guiding to $18 billion in free cash flow. We feel
good about that. It comes from all the activities that the entire team has pushed forward with this year, really strong
cash flow management, everything from our supply chain, our working capital up and down our management team.
Our sales guys help us with it. Everybody up and down the line, the network construction guys managing their
inventories and managing everything that's in the flow. All of that we feel good, feel confident about getting to that $18
billion level.
We're not going to guide past next year. But yes, that march or that drive or that progress towards $20 billion is really
occurring and we feel good about the progress we're making. I don't believe we've given any target of a year to get to
any specific level outside of next year, but with that being said, we expect to get to the $18 billion range next year and
we feel really good about the cash generation opportunity for this business.
What Randall just said is just an easy way to give that credibility when the hard costs of this business are going down
year over year, when the management teams perform at that level, you get momentum. When you get software network
function virtualization up to 34% and have a track now to 75%. Now when you see those kinds of things happening, it
gives us confidence that we can continue to grow the cash of this business, which is really an underlying support for the
overall profitability. It's really the proof of the overall profitability of our business.
<Q - Amir Rozwadowski>: Thanks for the color.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question is from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, please.
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Great. Thank you very much. John, I know we've talked a lot about taxes already, but can you
just give us a sense of what your cash tax rate is likely to be relative to your booked tax rate this year assuming no
changes? And then, Randall, we talked about the economy a couple of times, but you usually give a broader view of
what you're hearing from CIOs and CEOs and others in terms of the environment. I thought there were a couple of
comments in the Business Solutions about some pressure in some of the legacy products. Is there any change there or is
that sort of business as usual? Thanks.
<A - John J. Stephens>: So, Simon, I will take a stab at the cash tax question. I'll say at this point, we're not going to
give specific guidance on cash taxes. It's clearly included in our overall cash guidance. But I would suggest to you that
the depreciation rules, the bonus depreciation rules which give a lot benefit to companies that invest as much in
America as we do are still in place. There's no significant law changes in our assumptions. And so I can't point to
anything that I would imply would significantly change, that could point to an easy significant change in a year over
year basis. Specifically, we're talking about a $22 billion CapEx range which is similar to what we spent last year and
as I think we, on an every year basis, we're very, very diligent about managing our cash from the tax side and there's no
reason to expect that to change. With that, I'll leave it at that and hand it off to Randall.

<A - Randall L. Stephenson>: On the economy, Simon, we have assumed for 2017 a steady as she goes economic
growth rate, GDP growth rate. It's actually a sub 2% is what we have built into our plan, and what's built into these
numbers that you're looking at here. I would tell you my sentiment I don't think is unique among the CEO community,
and that is that I am optimistic as I look forward and I'm optimistic that if we get line of sight to real meaningful tax
reform, if we get line of sight to it – it won't be when it passes – when we get line of sight, we'll begin to think
differently about areas we're investing in. I don't think I'm unique in that regard.
Conversations I'm having with CEOs as we get line of sight to this, I think you're going to see people begin to open up
the purse book and begin to invest at a higher level. And so once that happens, there's no driver to economic growth
like investment. I happen to be a supply-side guy. I think the math and the science is with me on that. And as
investments ticks up, economic activity ticks up, hiring ticks up. As hiring ticks up, spending ticks up. And so I'm
actually of a mindset that if we get a tax reform, we could exit this year doing something better than what is in this
plan. And so call me optimistic and if we get tax reform, I do think that there is upside to these economic forecasts, and
if we get tax reform, I would suggest there may be upside to this guidance that we're giving you. But it's wait and see.
And I will also say that it's not an inconsequential attitude, if you will, among the CEO community about the potential
in terms of what could happen with regulation. And nobody thinks that regulation should go away. We all believe that
the customer still needs protection and safety and all that is so critical. But we've had regulation that has been just
unpredictable. It's interfering with how you think about designing products. It's interfering with how you think about
entering new markets. And if you really begin to get confident the regulatory burden is rationalized somewhat, that in
and of itself is going to free up investment.
And so I think, as you know, GDP and economic growth is as much a function of attitude and in confidence as anything
else. And I would tell you a lot of people are feeling confident that there's going to be meaningful tax reform that's
going to have its effect. But too early to tell right now, We're kind of, our guidance is premised on a steady as she goes,
but I think there's some potential for upside on the economy if we get tax reform.
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Randall L. Stephenson>: Thank you.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Thanks, Simon.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brett Feldman>: Thanks. And I'm actually just going to follow up on that because, Randall, you said you see the
opportunity to invest more if there was tax reform, and it sounds like part of that is simply supporting your customers
who would probably have more investment needs and more growth. But are there certain business cases that you guys
have been looking at where if there's tax reform, all of a sudden the math changes a lot? And I'll just make something
up, for example, instead of stopping at 12.5 million fiber homes, you would go much beyond that. I'm just trying to
think about opportunities that are unique to your business where you might accelerate capital if the reforms go the way
you hoped they would.
<A - Randall L. Stephenson>: Yeah, so you touched on one. Would we go beyond 12.5 million? I don't know, but
would we accelerate to 12.5 million? I think we'd have to look at whether we could bring some of those forward. We
are in the process of deploying 40 megahertz of spectrum. Are there some things we would do to bring forward some of
the wireless build and bring our speeds and our mobile speeds up considerably? And let's assume, and by the way this
is unknown, but if we were to win the FirstNet bid, would we want to go faster on the deployment of FirstNet with tax
reform? I mean, there's just a long list of things that the business cases were really good, where you could accelerate
some of your build requirements and accelerate the business cases on many of these.

<A - John J. Stephens>: And, Brett, I'd offer that this is exactly what happened this year with our fiber-to-the-prem
build. The team hit this year's goal and hit this year's CapEx budget, so to speak, prior to year-end, and they came back
and said we can keep going and we can get more done efficiently and effectively, but you've got to give us some more
money. And we did just that. With bonus depreciation in place this year, it gave us that opportunity to justify the
business case and move it ahead. That's one of the variances, if you will, in our CapEx spending, but it's exactly the
situation you're talking about.
<Q - Brett Feldman>: Okay. Great. Thanks for that.
Randall L. Stephenson
Thank you. With that, I believe that'll be the last question. And I appreciate everybody participating in this. I've got to
tell you, we're feeling really good about what we have built here. And as we look forward to bringing Time Warner into
the fold and doing some very unique things with media and entertainment and content and this foundation of networks,
we're feeling really, really positive and excited about bringing that together. So thank you for your attention, and we
will talk to you next time. Thank you very much.
Michael J. Viola
Thanks, everybody. And on your way home tonight, please remember no text is worth a life. It can wait. Thanks and
take care.
