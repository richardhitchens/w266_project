Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rick.
Richard A. Gonzalez
Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, I'll briefly discuss our
fourth quarter performance and our 2016 operational highlights. Mike will then provide updates on recent
advancements across our R&D efforts, and Bill will discuss the quarter and our 2017 guidance in more detail. As
always, following our remarks, we'll have an opportunity to take your questions. We delivered another strong quarter
where the adjusted earnings per share coming in at the upper end of our guidance range despite an unexpected negative
impact of foreign exchange, demonstrating the strength of our overall business.
Our adjusted earnings per share of $1.20 represented growth of 6.2% versus the fourth quarter of 2015. Our
performance in the quarter caps off another excellent year for AbbVie. For the full year, we delivered more than 13%
global operational sales growth, and we increased our ongoing earnings per share by more than 12%. In 2016, we grow
strong commercial, operational, and R&D execution, resulting in industry leading performance on both the top and
bottom lines.
AbbVie's EPS growth for 2016 ranks us among the top growth companies within our industry. We saw exceptional
growth from HUMIRA, which drove 16% global operational growth in the year, including U.S. growth of 24% and
international operational growth of 4.3%. Despite increasing competition from new classes of drugs and indirect
biosimilar competition in international markets, HUMIRA remains the clear market leader and continues to perform
very well across the rheumatology, dermatology and GI markets.
We also saw a strong momentum in growth through IMBRUVICA with full year 2016 sales in excess of $1.8 billion, a
67% increase over the prior year. We're continuing to drive strong uptake in CLL, a market segment that represents the
largest revenue contributor to IMBRUVICA's growth over our long-range plan and a major growth opportunity for the
company.
We also continue to advance our clinical development efforts in other blood cancers, supporting robust, long-term
growth of the brand. Further expansion into NHL and other indications represents another major growth driver for
IMBRUVICA. We continue to remain excited about the vast potential for this unique asset.
Global Viekira performance, which was below our original expectations, generated over $1.5 billion in the year and we
had continued strong performance from other products within our portfolio. Over the past year, we've seen significant
pipeline advancement and achieved a number of important development and regulatory milestones.
We received approvals for several assets, IMBRUVICA in first line CLL, including a label with overall survival data,
Venclexta and relapsed/refractory CLL with patients with 17p deletion, ZINBRYTA for relapsing-remitting multiple
sclerosis, and HUMIRA for uveitis, our 10th HUMIRA indication in the U.S.
We successfully completed registrational studies and submitted regulatory applications for a number of key pipeline
assets, including our pan-genotypic, next-generation HCV therapy, and IMBRUVICA in marginal zone lymphoma,
which received FDA approval last week.
We also reported compelling data from several mid- and late-stage development programs that Mike is going to discuss
in just a few moments. The progress we've made with our pipeline, including the data we share over the past year, has
further increased our level of confidence and de-risked many of our key R&D programs. Numerous assets in our late
stage pipeline have the opportunity to generate multi-billion-dollar peak year sales and represent an opportunity for
meaningful revenue growth in the years to come. We expect to see a significant number of regulatory and clinical
milestones for these assets in 2017, which, again, Mike will discuss in more detail.
In 2016, we also augmented our portfolio and our pipeline through strategic licensing and acquisition activity. In June,
we completed our acquisition of Stemcentrx, providing AbbVie an exciting late stage asset in Rova-T, as well as a
highly attractive discovery and early development platform. Rova-T represents a significant market opportunity as we

advance in the first-line small-cell lung cancer and other indications.
In addition to Rova-T, the acquisition of Stemcentrx also brought with it a pipeline of additional clinical development
programs, including four additional novel compounds currently in human trials, covering solid tumors from small-cell
lung cancer to ovarian cancer and colorectal cancer among others. We announced the collaboration with Boehringer
Ingelheim to develop and commercialize risankizumab, an anti-IL23 monoclonal antibody that has the potential to be a
transformative therapy in a number of immune-mediated diseases.
We've entered 2017 with strong momentum and we're committed to delivering strong results. Our full-year 2017
adjusted earnings per share guidance of $5.44 to $5.54 positions AbbVie to be among the industry leaders for EPS
growth once again this year.
We also continue to track towards delivering on our long-term objectives, which will generate double-digit EPS growth
on average through 2020, putting AbbVie in the very top of our peer group.
So in summary, we're pleased with our execution and performance, and we've delivered an outstanding return for our
shareholders. We've also demonstrated a strong track record of managing and overcoming challenges, while still
delivering on our expectations. We've established sustainable leadership positions in some of the largest and most
attractive market segments, and we built a compelling de-risk pipeline within these areas, which is poised to fuel
long-term growth.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike?
Michael E. Severino
Thank you, Rick. In 2016, we've significantly advanced and de-risked our pipeline, and achieved a number of
important regulatory milestones. And we expect 2017 to be a very productive year as well, with the potential for
several regulatory submissions and approvals, key data readouts, and important phase transitions.
Today, I'll highlight recent pipeline updates and discuss some of the milestones we anticipate in the year to come. I'll
start with oncology, an area where we are advancing our pipeline in both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors.
In the area of hematologic oncology, we continue to make significant progress with both IMBRUVICA and Venclexta.
Since our last earnings call at the end of October, we, along with our partner, Janssen, received approval for the use of
IMBRUVICA as a chemotherapy-free option for patients with marginal zone lymphoma who have failed prior
therapies, with the approval coming two months ahead of the PDUFA date.
This marks the seventh FDA approval and fifth major indication for IMBRUVICA. Currently, there are no other
approved therapies specifically indicated for MZL, making IMBRUVICA the first FDA approved treatment for this
disease. We also received conditional approval of Venclexta in Europe for the treatment of CLL patients with the 17p
deletion or TP53 mutation, as well as in CLL patients who have failed both chemotherapy and a B-cell receptor
pathway inhibitor regardless of their mutational status.
We, along with our partner, Roche/Genentech, are pleased to be able to bring this new treatment option to patients in
more countries around the world. At the recent ASH meeting, we presented data from 25 abstracts evaluating use of our
portfolio blood cancer medicines. This included results from several studies evaluating IMBRUVICA across a number
of hematologic malignancies, including long-term data in patients with CLL showing that nearly 9 out of 10 patients
achieved complete or partial response at the five-year mark. These data demonstrate the promise that IMBRUVICA
holds as a CLL treatment that can offer long-term, progression-free, and overall survival.
In addition, we presented favorable efficacy and safety data in two common types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, diffuse
large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma, as well as new Phase 2 data in marginal zone lymphoma,
demonstrating that nearly half of patients with relapsed/refractory MZL responded treatment with IMBRUVICA. And
we also presented data in chronic graft-versus-host-disease demonstrating complete or partial response in two-thirds of
patients.

For Venclexta, we presented data in a range of tumor types, including Phase 1 safety and efficacy data in both AML
and multiple myeloma, as well as results from mid stage studies in follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma. This coming year, there will be several key data readouts from our hematologic oncology portfolio that
could enable registration of both IMBRUVICA and Venclexta in new indications.
For IMBRUVICA, we anticipate data from an interim analysis in front-line mantle cell lymphoma later this year, as
well as additional potential interim analyses in other forms of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Later this quarter, we expect
to submit our U.S. regulatory application for the use of IMBRUVICA in patients with chronic graft-versus-host
disease, who failed prior systemic therapy.
Chronic GVHD is a serious and debilitating complication of stem cell or bone marrow transplantation. And, with no
approved therapies for the disease, there is a significant unmet medical need. We are also making progress in a number
of important studies evaluating IMBRUVICA monotherapy and combination therapy versus regimen such as BR and
FCR, often considered the gold standards in the treatment of CLL.
In addition, studies are being run in different patient segments, including young and fit patients and the watch-and-wait
population. The results of these studies will add significantly to the breadth of data supporting IMBRUVICA, providing
physicians more evidence of its compelling clinical benefits in the front-line setting.
For Venclexta, we're expecting data from the MURANO study later this year, which we believe will support a broader
label in relapsed/refractory CLL. Last year, we received approval for Venclexta's first indication as monotherapy and
patients with relapsed/refractory CLL and the 17p deletion mutation, a small but medically important segment of the
CLL market and an important first step for this exciting new treatment.
Also last year, Venclexta received its third Breakthrough Therapy Designation for use in untreated AML patients who
are ineligible to receive standard induction with high dose chemotherapy. And we recently began our Phase 3 program
in AML. We look forward to additional data readouts and regulatory approvals for Venclexta in the coming years.
I'll now turn to our solid tumor programs where we continue to make good progress with our late-stage programs for
Rova-T, veliparib, and ABT-414, as well as with our early stage oncology pipeline. In the Rova-T program, we expect
to report data from the TRINITY study in the second half of the year with regulatory submission following soon
thereafter. Additionally, in the latter part of the year, there is the potential for initial data from our basket study where
we are evaluating Rova-T in a number of neuroendocrine tumors. We're also making good progress advancing new
Stemcentrx assets into the clinic as we expect to see up to four additional novel assets enter the clinic this year, adding
to our portfolio a five-clinical stage Stemcentrx programs already underway.
We've also continue to make progress with our other pipeline assets targeting solid tumors including PARP inhibitor,
Veliparib, and ABT-414, an antibody drug conjugate for glioblastoma multiforme.
In 2017, we're expecting to see data from three Phase 3 studies of Veliparib conducted in neoadjuvant breast cancer and
both the squamous and non-squamous forms of non-small-cell lung cancer. We are also expecting to see data in the
second half of this year for ABT-414 in second-line glioblastoma multiforme, the most common and most aggressive
type of malignant primary brain tumor. These trial results, if positive, would support regulatory submissions.
In our early stage oncology pipeline, we are continuing to explore new technologies that will extend our reach into the
solid tumor market. For example, our next generation immuno-oncology programs are designed to broaden and deepen
responses beyond what has been seen with the first wave of I-O therapies.
We're using novel approaches, including our bispecific technology to elicit T-cell activation in close proximity to tumor
cells. Over the next 12 months, we expect to have as many as five next-generation immuno-oncology assets in the
clinic, which adds to our growing oncology pipeline of more than 35 late preclinical or clinical stage assets.
Moving now to our immunology programs, where we continue to make great progress with our two late stage assets,
risankizumab and ABT-494, both of which are tracking ahead of our initial development timelines. Risankizumab, our
anti-IL-23 monoclonal antibody, licensed from Boehringer Ingelheim, has the potential to be a transformative therapy

in a number of immune-mediated diseases by providing best-in-category efficacy, an increased dosing convenience
with quarterly administration. Risankizumab is currently in Phase 3 development for psoriasis, with mid-stage trials
ongoing in both Crohn's disease and psoriatic arthritis.
The Risankizumab Phase 3 program in psoriasis continues to progress well and we expect to see data from three of the
pivotal studies later this year, with commercialization expected in 2019. This year, we'll also see a number of additional
data readouts and important phase transitions for risankizumab, including Phase 2 data in Crohn's disease, which, if
successful, would trigger the start of a Phase 3 program later this year, as well as Phase 2 data in psoriatic arthritis, with
Phase 3 studies expected to begin in the first half of 2018.
Additionally, we are expecting to begin a Phase 2 study for risankizumab in ulcerative colitis in the second half of the
year. Our selective JAK1 inhibitor, ABT-494, is currently in Phase 3 development for RA and has the potential to be
best-in-class, with what we believe will be an optimized benefit risk profile. This program is progressing ahead of
schedule and we'll begin to see some data from the Phase 3 RA program later in the year.
We are particularly excited about this asset's potential in the difficult-to-treat, anti-TNF inadequate responder
population, a growing segment of the RA market, representing roughly 35% of the biologic treated patient population.
The development program for ABT-494 in gastrointestinal disorders is also progressing well, with a Phase 2 study in
Crohn's disease ongoing and a Phase 2 study in ulcerative colitis getting underway in the third quarter. Data from the
Crohn's study should be available in the first half of 2017, with Phase 3 Crohn's study starting later in the year.
We also recently began a Phase 2 study to evaluate our oral selective JAK1 inhibitor in atopic dermatitis patients, with
data expected later in the year. We continue to advance our early stage immunology pipeline as well with clinical
programs recently initiated or expected to begin very soon for several key early stage assets, including our
RORgammaT inverse agonist, our anti-TNF-steroid ADC, our CD40 antagonist, and our JAK-BTK inhibitor
combination.
Moving now to virology, where our emphasis is on addressing the remaining unmet medical need for our
pan-genotypic, next-generation HCV regimen. We believe this objective can be accomplished with our once-daily oral
combination of two novel antivirals that has demonstrated cure rates approaching 100% across genotypes, with just
eight weeks of therapy for the majority of patients.
Last month, we filed our regulatory submissions in both the U.S. and Europe. Our U.S. application was submitted
under Breakthrough Designation (sic) [Breakthrough Therapy Designation] and the EU submission was granted
accelerated assessment. We are on track to launch this new regimen in both the U.S. and EU later in the year. And we
are also on track to submit our regulatory application in Japan later this quarter.
In the area of women's health, we are nearing completion of our Phase 3 program for Elagolix in endometriosis. Later
in the year, we expect full data from both Phase 3 endometriosis studies, including extension data and also plan to
submit our U.S. Regulatory application in the third quarter.
We remain excited about this potential new medicine for women with this highly prevailing condition, where there are
a few effective treatment options. In addition to the endometriosis program, we have Phase 3 studies underway in
uterine fibroids, and we anticipate beginning to see data from that program towards the end of this year.
And lastly, in the area of neuroscience where we are focused on developing disease modifying therapies to treatment of
regenerative conditions, we recently began Phase 2 studies in Alzheimer's disease and PSP with our anti-tau antibody.
We see significant potential in tau-based approaches for delaying the progression of neurodegenerative diseases and
look forward to one day being able to bring new treatment options to patients with these stability and conditions.
So in summary, we continue to see significant evolution of our mid and late stage pipeline programs over the past year
and 2017 promises to be another very productive year.
With that, I will turn the call over to Bill for additional comments on our fourth quarter and full year performance. Bill?

William J. Chase
Thanks, Mike. This morning, I'll review the highlights of our full year 2016 performance, provide an overview of our
fourth quarter and then walk through our outlook for 2017.
We had another year of outstanding performance delivering top and bottom line growth in 2016, that is among the
highest in our industry. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $4.82, up more than 12% compared to 2015. For the
full year, adjusted net revenues were $25.6 billion.
As you're aware, in November, we saw strengthening of the dollar, which drove higher than expected negative foreign
exchange in the quarter. Additionally, continued competitive dynamics in the HCV market had an impact on Viekira
sales. As a result, sales for the year and the quarter came in at the lower end of our expected range. Despite these
dynamics, full year sales growth was 13.3% on an operational basis, and we exceeded our EPS guidance for the year.
Total adjusted net revenues for the fourth quarter were $6.8 billion, up 6.9% operationally, excluding the negative
impact of foreign exchange. HUMIRA delivered another quarter of strong growth with global sales of $4.3 billion, up
16.2% operationally. In the U.S., HUMIRA sales increased 23.5% compared to the prior year, driven by volume
growth of roughly 14% plus price. Wholesaler inventories remain below half a month in the quarter. International
HUMIRA sales were more than $1.4 billion in the quarter, up 4.1% on an operational basis and in line with our
expectations.
For the full year 2016, global HUMIRA sales were $16.1 billion, reflecting incremental sales of more than $2 billion.
Full year sales of HUMIRA in the U.S. grew more than 24%, with mid-teens prescription growth and a contribution
from price in the high single-digits. International HUMIRA operational sales growth for the full year was 4.3%,
consistent with our expectations of mid single-digit growth. Excluding the impact of conditions in Venezuela,
operational sales growth for the full year was approximately 7%. We continue to see good growth despite the entry of
indirect biosimilar competition in the international markets.
This exceptional performance was driven by HUMIRA's overall level of efficacy and safety, long physician experience,
and continued biologic penetration across disease categories. Its unique product profile and AbbVie's strong
commercial execution has made HUMIRA the number one prescribed biologic and it remains the undisputed market
leader despite competition.
Global IMBRUVICA net revenues in the fourth quarter were $511 million, up 49% over the fourth quarter of last year
driven by strong prescription growth trends. For the full year, IMBRUVICA sales exceeded $1.8 billion in line with our
previously communicated guidance.
Global Viekira sales in the fourth quarter were $311 million, down versus the prior year and below our expectations.
As we previously communicated, we have seen market share loss and price erosion due to competitive dynamics within
the HCV market.
Global sales of Duodopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease, grew 26.7% on an operational basis in the
quarter. And we also saw strong operational sales growth in the quarter from CREON, which was up nearly 15%.
Turning to the P&L profile for the quarter, adjusted gross margin was 81% of sales. On a comparative year-over-year
basis, this ratio reflects an adverse impact from foreign exchange of roughly 150 basis points. In addition, adjusted
gross margin reflects 50 basis points of unfavorable impact related to partnership accounting. Equalizing for these
impacts, the gross margin profile improved by approximately 250 basis points versus the prior year.
Adjusted R&D was 17.3% of sales in support of ongoing programs in oncology, immunology, HCV and other areas.
Adjusted SG&A was 23.9% of sales in the fourth quarter. And operating margin profile was impacted by R&D
investment related to Stemcentrx and risankizumab, as well as the adverse impact of foreign currency. Equalizing for
these impacts, adjusted operating margin profile improved by 250 basis points versus the prior year.
Adjusted net interest expense was $251 million and the adjusted tax rate was 20.2% in the quarter. Fourth quarter
adjusted earnings per share, excluding non-cash intangible amortization expense and other specified items, was $1.20,

up 6.2% year-over-year. As we look ahead to 2017, we expect full year adjusted EPS of $5.44 to $5.54 reflecting
growth of 13.9% at the midpoint. This guidance excludes $0.89 per share of non-cash amortization and other specified
items.
On the top line, we expect revenue growth of approximately 10% on an operational basis. Holding exchange rates
constant at current levels, we would expect foreign currency to have a 1% unfavorable impact on reported sales growth.
Included in our top line guidance are assumptions for our key products as follows. In 2017, we expect HUMIRA to
once again be an important contributor to our performance with mid-to-high teens growth expected in the U.S.
Internationally, we are forecasting mid single-digit operational growth. If currencies hold constant with current rates,
reported growth would be in the low single-digits.
For IMBRUVICA, we expect global revenues to AbbVie of greater than $2.4 billion, with sales in the U.S. of more
than $2 billion. We anticipate global Viekira sales of approximately $1 billion in 2017. While we are on track to launch
our next generation HCV therapy later this year, based on the timing of managed care contracting cycles, we don't
expect to see meaningful sales contributions until 2018.
Regarding AndroGel, we're forecasting 2017 sales of roughly $500 million. For CREON, we expect mid to high
single-digit sales growth. For Venclexta, we expect sales of approximately $125 million in 2017. As we've previously
communicated, our initial indication for Venclexta relapsed/refractory CLL patients with a 17p deletion, addresses a
$300 million market, where IMBRUVICA currently holds more than 50% of the market share. Between both assets, we
will hold a strong market leadership position in this segment. For Lupron, Synagis and Synthroid, we expect sales to be
roughly flat year-over-year.
Regarding the P&L for 2017, we're forecasting an adjusted gross margin ratio roughly flat to 2016 inclusive of the
dilutive impact of our partnered products on gross margin. We expect 2017 to be a year of significant R&D investment
as we provide the appropriate level of funding across our pipeline in order to fuel our future growth. This includes the
incremental funding and budget annualization associated with the Stemcentrx and risankizumab programs. As a result,
we are forecasting adjusted R&D expense of approximately 17% of sales. We expect adjusted SG&A to approach 21%
of sales reflecting the benefit of sales leverage.
In 2017, we are forecasting an adjusted operating margin profile of approximately 43% inclusive of the annualization
of Stem and BI transactions. We remain committed to achieving the operating margin profile improvements that we
have communicated in our long range guidance. We are forecasting adjusted net interest expense of approximately $1
billion for the full year. And we expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 19.5 to 20% into 2017.
Regarding our first quarter outlook, we expect adjusted earnings per share between $1.24 and $1.26. Our first quarter
adjusted EPS guidance excludes roughly $0.23 of non-cash amortization and other specified items. We are forecasting
revenue growth in the first quarter to approach 10% operationally. Holding exchange rates constant at current levels,
we would expect foreign exchange to have an unfavorable impact on reported sales growth of approximately 1%.
For U.S. HUMIRA, we expect sales growth in the first quarter to exceed 20% over the prior year. And we expect U.S.
IMBRUVICA sales in the first quarter to grow in the high single-digits sequentially over the fourth quarter.
In closing, we are very pleased with AbbVie's strong performance in the quarter and the full year. We've driven strong
top-tier revenue and EPS growth, while also advancing our strategic priorities and our pipeline and we're well
positioned for strong growth again in 2017.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. Our first question is from Jami Rubin of Goldman Sachs. Your line now is open.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you. I guess my first question is for you, Bill. On operating margins, we didn't see leverage
this year in large part, because of R&D expenses and when we think about 2017 continued pressure on R&D, as you're
making significant investments and from the partnership programs. But I think that the company gave long-term
guidance of operating margins approaching 50%. I'm looking at other companies that have a similar mix as you do, like
Amgen. They have over 50% operating margins. You are well below that.
Can you talk about how we should think about the evolution of operating margins going forward, because the
partnership, IMBRUVICA will continue to put pressure on gross margins, how we think about that? And R&D as a
percentage of sales, should that stay in the 17% sales range and how should we think about you guys getting to a 50%
operating margin, because that's a long ways away from where we are right now?
And then, I have a follow-up question for you, Rick. Just if you could comment on FDA's interchangeability guidance,
anything that surprised you, anything that gives you pause in terms of timing and in terms of impact to the HUMIRA
franchise once biosimilars come to the market? Thanks.
<A - William J. Chase>: Hi, Jami. It's Bill. So, on your operating margin questions. First of all, I think we've made
enormous progress on operating margin. If you look at where we've come since spinoff and we certainly did last year in
the third quarter – I'm sorry, 2015 in the third quarter, communicate our intent to hit 50% by 2020. Everything as we
look at it right now is still on that plan. Obviously, we're in the process of pulling the other new LRP, and we're going
to look at it again, but that's our goal as a management team, and we certainly are constructing a path to get there.
If you look at 2017 relative to 2016, we are showing improvement. We had said in our long-range guidance that we
would anticipate 100 basis to 200 basis improvements per year. It is true in 2017, we're coming up a little short of that,
but you have to recognize that the annualization of Stem and BI, as well as the required investment on those programs
has pretty much added about 120 basis points of dilution.
So if you back that out, we would be back within that range of what we communicated back at the end of 2015, before
we did Stem and BI. So we think the base business is showing the right level of performance, and obviously, we're
having the opportunity to invest in those two very important programs, and still deliver operating margin expansion, so
we're quite pleased with the number in 2017.
In terms of how we get to 2020's target of 50%, you have to recognize that we first and foremost have the royalty stack
on HUMIRA rolling off that will have impacts on the P&L in 2018 and 2019. Just as we've communicated before, but
to remind you, that royalty stack is 5% to 6% of global HUMIRA sales. Two, one-third of the stack disappears at the
end of 2017 with P&L benefit in 2018, two-thirds at the end of 2018 P&L benefit in 2019. So that will give you some
idea of that flows in.
And then, we are always committed to driving more efficient supply chain, we are enjoying those benefits right now,
and we have enjoyed them since spin, as well as other cost containment programs. We have pretty, I'd say, strong
targets internally to deliver on those. And then, finally, you can't overlook the importance of sales leverage across this
P&L, most notably 2018 and beyond as we start launching new products and we start getting the full indication [ph]
lead of (35:30) Venclexta. And again, obviously, HUMIRA in the U.S. we anticipate growth throughout that period.
So, when you add all of those things up, even despite partnership accounting, which we think will present about 200
basis points of drag, we feel that we've got enough positives in the mix to drive to that operating margin profile goal.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Good morning, Jami, it's Rick. So, on interchangeability, I think as we all know the FDA
has communicated for some time that they were going to come out with this guidance by the end of 2016. So, I think

the timing of that was as expected. We got a chance to go through it. I think it clearly reflects that interchangeability is
a higher standard than biosimilarity. It describes that biosimilars will have to do a three way switching study between
the biosimilar and the innovator. And it strongly suggests that those studies be done with U.S. reference product as the
comparator.
I'd also say that FDA devoted a considerable amount of time in the guidance to packaging and the delivery system or
the device differences. And potentially depending upon what those differences are, it could require human factor
studies in order to demonstrate that there is no significant difference between the biosimilar and the innovator's
product.
So, I think as we step back and we're continuing to obviously analyze this when direct biosimilar is coming to the
marketplace, we've said that our strategy will be a strategy that's designed to maintain market share, while maximizing
the profitability of the brand. That remains the same. And I think unlike small molecules, where the erosion curve is
really driven by retail pharmacy substitution, which is what makes this so challenging, on a small molecule, very little
or almost none of biologics go through retail pharmacy, they go through and are dispensed through specialty
pharmacies, where your formulary position is really what dictates what product is dispensed, not the individual
pharmacy. So I don't think it fundamentally changes that part of the strategy.
As far as the competitive dynamics, I think it's too early, I mean we don't believe based on what we know that any of
the single switch studies that are being done now would meet this standard, but we'll have to see how the competitive
dynamics play out as people look at this and start to design programs in order to try to achieve interchangeability. And
so, I think we'll need to see how that plays out over time.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Can you just, Rick, throw out a guesstimate as to when you would expect an interchangeable
biosimilar to be introduced to the market?
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Well, that's probably not something I just want to guess on. Obviously, there are
significant issues that play through your question. First and foremost, it's [ph] when are there (38:43) biosimilars on the
market to begin with from the standpoint of our IP protection. And we remain committed to the position that we took
back in 2015 that we believe our portfolio of IP will protect HUMIRA within the U.S. until 2022. And so, beyond that
it's difficult for me to project based on where we are today because I don't know – I'm not aware of anyone doing a
study that would be compliant with what's described here. That doesn't mean it's not happening, it just means I'm not
aware of it.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Elizabeth Shea>: Thanks, Jami. Operator, we'll take the next question.
Operator
Thank you. Next question is from Jeffrey Holford of Jefferies. Your line now is open.
<Q - Jeffrey Holford>: Thanks very much. Good morning, everybody. So, Rick, I wonder if you could just comment
with your thoughts around pricing exposure for your company. With regard to every single time we get a tweet or a
comment out of the new government here, the new President, your stock does seem to get impacted the most of those
amongst your peer group. Can you just talk about what you see as some of the biggest potential issues that could get
discussed, whether it's dual eligibles or direct price negotiation and just how exposed you think your company is
relative to others?
The second question is on IMBRUVICA. Just Q4, just seemed a little light in the U.S., just against the volume trend.
Can you just let us know if there's any factor that like destocking that impacted it in the quarter at all? And then just
lastly, we're all expecting HUMIRA biosimilars in 2018. October 2018, I think, is the data that we're mostly are looking
at. But you only give us HUMIRA numbers ex U.S. So can you just help us a little geographically, what's the mix of
exposure in the territories from 2018 October, and what you would expect biosimilars to be in the market ex U.S.? And

what percentage you wouldn't? Thank you.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: All right. So, Jeff, maybe let me talk a little bit about pricing or reforms in the Affordable
Care Act. There obviously are a lot of things out in the environments, swirling around, but there's not a lot of
specificity yet. So it's probably, one, difficult then, two, inappropriate for me to try to speculate on what some of those
changes might be. I think as we look at our business and the mix of our business, certainly, we're being conscious of
pricing our products in a way that is responsible. I think you've seen that.
I think what's important for all of us in the innovative pharmaceutical space is to continue to demonstrate the value of
the medicines that we have and in many cases as you know, these medicines actually reduce overall healthcare cost and
pharmaceuticals are still a relatively small percentage of the overall spend within the healthcare system, the Medicare
system.
Specifically when we look at our business, I think most of our medicines are underpinned by strong evidence base that
they are not only clinically very important and very effective but also provide a good economic value proposition for
the system itself and we see that in the usage that we get in fully socialize systems where they can determine what
products are used and to the extent that they use those systems. You see products like HUMIRA do extremely well in
those markets.
Additionally, if you look at our business overall, it's not heavily weighted towards Medicare. In fact, only about 12% of
our total revenues go into Medicare so we're not overly, heavily weighted within that sector. But I'd say what our goal
will be is to continue to advocate for access to innovative medicines for all patients across all of the channels and I
would hope that one of the things that as we look at reforming the Affordable Care Act that we could deal with is the
burden that the donor whole and co-pays put on seniors in a Medicare program because I think that creates a lot of the
challenge that we see. So, we'll have to see how it plays out. I mean, I think some of the effort in this area, I think we'll
benefit over the long-haul but we have to see some more of the details.
So on IMBRUVICA, if you actually look at IMBRUVICA, it continues to perform extremely well and global sales
were $511 million in the quarter. The U.S. was $434 million, that's up about 47% year-over-year. Full year, we were
above the guidance that we gave, slightly above the guidance we gave of $1.8 billion, that represents 67% growth.
If you look at the IMS prescription growth, it's up about 38% in the quarter versus the prior year and if you look quarter
to quarter, it's up about 6%, which we think is more indicative of the growth of the brand. If you look at just pure
revenue in the two quarters, there was about $15 million or $20 million worth of channel or inventory that occurred in
the third quarter, that depressed revenues in the fourth quarter. So that's essentially what you see when you look at the
sequential growth quarter-to-quarter.
As we look at fourth quarter, as Bill mentioned in his comments, we're forecasting sequential growth in the high
single-digit range – I'm sorry in the first quarter in the high single-digit range. But I'd say overall, we're very pleased
with how IMBRUVICA is going. It continues to track where we had hoped or slightly ahead. So we're very
comfortable with IMBRUVICA.
And then your last question is on the mix of biosimilar impact outside the U.S. I'd say for the vast majority of our
countries, the fourth quarter of 2018 is the time that we expect biosimilars will be able to enter the marketplace. And as
far as the geographic mix, that will be driven by the competitors how they launch and when they get access.
Maybe one of the things that would be indicative or at least directionally helpful is to look at the biosimilars that are in
the marketplace today. So if you look at the Remicade biosimilar, I think they're in about 66 countries today. At least
50 countries have reimbursement or pricing for those biosimilars. They have about just under 5% of the overall market,
and they have about just under 25% of the molecular share, after being on the market for several years.
If we look at the Enbrel biosimilar, which has only been in the market for a shorter period of time, today, they're
approved in about 34 countries. They have pricing in 19 countries – pricing reimbursement in 19 countries. The latest
data says that they have just over 3% share of the overall category and about 14% or 15% share of the molecule.

So I think directionally that gives you a feel for how it will probably rollout. That's consistent with what we assumed
when we provided guidance back in 2015 when we described to you what we thought the erosion curve would look
like. We continue to monitor this and we feel comfortable with what that erosion curve continues to look like.
<Q - Jeffrey Holford>: That's very helpful. Thank you.
<A - Elizabeth Shea>: Thanks, Jeff. Operator, we'll take the next question.
Operator
Thank you. Next question is from Chris Schott of JPMorgan. Your line now is open.
<A - Christopher Schott>: Great. Thanks very much for the question, just had two here. First, can you elaborate on
your HUMIRA volume expectations in the U.S. for 2017? It looks like another there are very strong year of growth
again, so can you talk a little bit about price versus volume mix? And then, which indications in particular are driving
the growth for this year?
My second question was a higher level one on immunology, you obviously have a very significant position with
HUMIRA, you got two important late-stage assets with the JAK and IL-23, but it does seem like the competitive
pressures in the space are growing. We've got new mechanisms, got biosimilars ex-U.S., we've got what seems like
increased payer focus on the category. So, how do you see that all playing out going forward? And do you view there is
any risk that we see something similar happens here, that's happened to diabetes where we get more restrictive
formularies, where we used to get more intense competition among the various players? So, just some high level
thoughts on how you see that space playing out. Thank you.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Okay. So, maybe I'll cover most of this and then, Bill, you can talk a little bit about the
mix.
<A - William J. Chase>: Sure.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: So, I mean, if you look at HUMIRA maybe first from the competitive standpoint, this has
been a highly competitive category for quite some time. I mean, I think there were something like 14 different
mechanisms, there were 10 or so for the last four or five years. It's really driven by – the growth in this category is
really driven by the performance of the brand, the breadth of the brand, the safety and efficacy of the brand. And the
overall growth in biologic penetration that the underlying market continues to grow. I don't see those dynamics
changing.
Certainly, there's been a lot of discussion around the competitive nature of this market. We certainly operate in a
competitive environment. We work very closely with the payers to ensure that we're striking the right balance. We've
obviously negotiated all of our Managed Care contracts for 2017 and many of them for 2018 as well. So, I don't see
anything on the horizon today that would give me pause as to the fundamental trajectory of HUMIRA.
And then if I step back the U.S. where we probably have the best market share data, if you look at our market share
overall, it's increased slightly. Rheumatology has increased the most and it's the largest category. We're up about a 0.5
point overall in rheumatology, we're roughly flat in derm and GI. One of the most important leading indicators for your
growth is what your first-line share is doing.
So, if you look at RA, our first-line share is about 40%. If you look at psoriasis as an example, our first-line share if you
include Otezla, it's just under 40% and if you exclude Otezla, which really competes in the mild-to-moderate not where
we compete then it's just under 60%. So, very significant first-line share. And then if you look at GI between Crohn's
and UC, our first-line share is about 55%.
And so, we continue to see very strong performance based on both our execution and obviously the performance of the
brand. So, I'd say we have a high level of confidence in how HUMIRA is going to perform going forward. Bill,
anything you want to add?

<A - William J. Chase>: Yeah. So Chris, picking up from there, obviously, our guidance on HUMIRA in the U.S. is
mid-to-high teens. I think the way you want to think about that is continued volume in low double-digits; price,
single-digits. Price will have more of an impact earlier in the year, that's why we are guiding first quarter above 20%.
But we expect that volume to remain low double digits throughout the year.
<A - Christopher Schott>: Great. Thanks very much.
<A - Elizabeth Shea>: Thanks, Chris. Operator, we'll take the next question.
Operator
Your next question is from Marc Goodman of UBS. Your line now is open.
<Q - Marc Goodman>: Good morning. In the past you've talked about the amount of SG&A spend you've done on
HUMIRA. Can you just give us an update on where that is for 2016? And then second for M&A, Stemcentrx was a
platform deal. Are you looking for more platform type deals or should we be expecting more of these BI one-off type
of product deals, as you look at M&A this year? Thanks.
<A - William J. Chase>: So Marc, I'll pick up SG&A on HUMIRA. There's really been nothing about that business
that has been negative and would lead us to pull back on SG&A. Now obviously, we're thoughtful. When we had the
discussion about SG&A on HUMIRA, we said that largely the required base was in place. Obviously though, we do
have things like merit, inflation, those sorts of things and we are always looking for ways to make our spend more
efficient, but there's been nothing about the performance of the brand would have has pulled back on SG&A.
Yeah, I think it's also important to recognize that we have a pretty sophisticated, rigorous process of evaluating ROI on
everyone of our SG&A programs. And certainly, if you look at the growth that HUMIRA has contributed in the quarter
and the year and forecasted in 2017, you can see why we would be confident that that ROI is still holding up and that
that investment is wise.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: And as far as transactions or acquisitions or licensing opportunities, I mean, we continue
to be active, but as we said when we did this Stem transaction for the next year and a half, from that point we said, we
wouldn't be looking for any kind of a platform, kind of a transaction. It would be more individual products. I mean,
what really drives our efforts here is the strategy we have within each one of the verticals.
We have a very specific set of criteria within each one of those verticals of assets that we're looking for and as we find
those kinds of opportunities then, obviously, we pursue those opportunities. But I'd say today, we don't view that we
need any kind of a platform play or technology within any of those verticals, and so I think you can assume more
individual products, whether they be a straight out acquisition or structure that is more similar to the IL-23 transaction
that we did. I think that's what you should expect.
<A - Elizabeth Shea>: Thanks, Mark. Operator, we'll take the next question.
Operator
Next question is from Gregg Gilbert of Deutsche Bank. Your line now is open.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Good morning. Thanks for the questions. Rick, back on the subject of price, just hoping to
clarify whether you're pledged to stick to single-digit price increases also means just one per year? And do you agree
with some of your peers' beliefs that the U.S. system is broken as it relates to the subject of list price versus actual net
price growth? And shifting over the Mike, I was hoping you could share a little bit more color about your Phase 2
Alzheimer's compound? I realized it's early, but when will you learn something more meaningful that would inform
your willingness to move it ahead as its final Phase 2 data or are there other sort of key breakpoints within that we
could hear about in the next year or two? Thanks.

<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Yeah. So, on price, as I communicated in our talk at JPMorgan's convention, we will
only do one price per year and all brands will be under double-digits. So, all increases will be single-digits. And so, we
will only do one. So, we've obviously done one already on most assets, and that will be it for the reminder of the year.
On the system being broken, if you look at this, I don't know that the system is broken. I think the perception that list
price increases are what the – look at past along to the patient and the way of cost, I mean clearly that is not the case.
Very little of our revenue goes at less price, I mean, it's a tiny, tiny percentage. But there are other people along the
value chain, who obviously participate in the overall cost of the system and so the fall through of any increase is
usually much lower than the overall increase.
And so, I think it is a misconception that many people take when they look at list price increases, whether it's ours or
anybody else's that those are reflective of what the brand is actually being able to achieve in the marketplace. So I think
that's just the reality of the system.
<A - Michael E. Severino>: Okay. So this is Mike. With respect to our Phase 2 asset in Alzheimer's disease, we're
very excited about this program. This is our anti-tau antibody and tau is a protein that is very tightly correlated to
dysfunction and Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. And our antibody is thought to block the
spreading of this pathology through the brand and so we think it holds great promise as a potential treatment for
Alzheimer's disease.
We just started Phase 2 right now basically. And so it's going to take a bit of time before we get to meaningful data
readouts. I think that the way we've designed the study, there are a number of opportunities for us to see data along the
way. So, we can learn meaningful things certainly before we get to the end of a large Phase 2 study. But I think it's too
early today to predict when along the course of that study that might be. Obviously, it's a program that we're going to
be focused on and we're going to drive as quickly as possible.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Thank you.
<A - Elizabeth Shea>: Thanks, Gregg. Operator, we'll take the next question.

Next question is from Geoff Meacham of Barclays. Your line now is open.
<Q - Geoffrey Christopher Meacham>: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Sticking with the
pipeline, Mike, just had a few for you. Can you give us some perspective on Elagolix? Just based on the extension
study, what do you think the real world duration of therapy may be? And then, just back to the tau program, I saw on
the trial design and there's a screen for beta-amyloid by PET scan. Are you guys also looking at tau imaging in that
study? Does that have much value in your view? And then, you mentioned tau being the marker of disease progression,
I wanted to get your perspective on kind of looking at tau as the marker versus beta-amyloid. And some would argue
that by the time patient sees tau accumulation, it may be – they may be too far gone, but I wanted to kind of get your
thoughts on that? Thanks.
<A - Michael E. Severino>: Okay. With respect to Elagolix, the ultimate duration of therapy is going to be part of the
regulatory discussion and labeling discussion around that molecule. So, I think it's early to predict an exact duration.
But we have an extensive clinical trials program, one that included both extension studies for a longer duration of
therapy and off-treatment period. So, we believe that we'll have the dataset to optimally support a strong duration of
therapy at the time of launch. And we're also pursuing post-launch Phase 3b programs to further extend both that
dataset and ultimately to extend duration of therapy we believe through approaches such as our add-back program. So, I
think it's early today to give you a concrete answer, but I think we're going to have the data to support the duration of
therapy.
Turning to the tau study, the A-beta imaging in that protocol is necessary to ensure that the patients who are enrolled in
the studies do in fact have Alzheimer's disease. And we know that if one doesn't take that measure that there are other

forms of dementia that look clinically similar to Alzheimer's disease that could be enrolled essentially in error. Those
patients wouldn't be expected to benefit from a therapy aimed at Alzheimer's pathology.
And so, that's the role there. It's a little bit different than the response biomarkers that are being incorporated in our trial
and in many others in the Alzheimer's field. We have a range of biomarkers in our program and a range of clinical
measures that we think will allow us to interrogate this and those include imaging markers. And we think we are going
to have the dataset to make a decision out of this trial.
With respect to the correlation of tau with neuronal dysfunction, what we know about A-beta and tau is that the pattern
of the pathology is different between the two. A-beta pathology peaks very early and is essentially stable at the time
that disease progression occurs. It also doesn't correlate particularly well with the area of the brain that exhibits
dysfunction. What we know about tau is that the rise in tau pathology tracks much more closely with both neuronal
dysfunction and clinical symptoms making it very tightly linked in time to the progression of Alzheimer's disease. It's
also very tightly linked in space with respect to the progression of Alzheimer's disease, so there are these regional
variants where you have different regions of the brain that are primarily affected. And if you look at A-beta in those
patients, the distribution of A-beta is essentially unchanged across them.
But if you look at tau, tau pathology is most prominent in the areas where there is neuronal dysfunction. So, we think
that those data would indicate a strong role for tau and a strong role for our mechanism. Ultimately, of course, the
Phase 2 study and downstream studies will answer those questions definitively.
<Q - Geoffrey Christopher Meacham>: Got you. That's helpful. Thanks.
<A - Elizabeth Shea>: Thanks, Geoff. Operator, we'll take the next question.
Operator
Next question is from Mark Schoenebaum of Evercore ISI. Your line now is open.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Hey, thanks for taking my question. First, big thanks to Liz and the team for all the
help she gave, in my absence, to my team, really appreciate that Liz.
My question, and I apologize if I missed this in the prepared remarks, but just for the rest-of-world HUMIRA, would it
be possible for you to just give us very clearly the quarter-on-quarter that is sequential volume change as well as the
quarter-on-quarter that is sequential 3Q versus 4Q change in price?
And then, this has sort of covered in the last, in some ways, in the last questions, but on the U.S. side, you've obviously,
as you've said earlier as response to a question, you've committed to limiting gross price increases for HUMIRA. I'm
wondering how, in a general sense, we should think about trends for the gross to net that is the discounting that occurs.
Would that be expected to rise, fall, stay the same? Maybe help us think through that over the next couple of years in
this new pricing environment; and if you're willing to, can you give us the average gross to net for 2016? Thank you –
in the U.S.
<A - William J. Chase>: So, Mark, it's Bill Chase. I'll start with the sequential questions on HUMIRA. Price was
pretty flat sequentially, rest-of-world. Volume was up about 2%, rest-of-world. So, the numbers look pretty good.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Excellent.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Yeah. I think, on gross-to-net, I mean, we've never communicated the gross-to-net
before. And for competitive reasons, we just don't think that's something that is appropriate for us to communicate,
Mark. As far as trends are concerned, as we indicated, I think it was in the third quarter call that we have negotiated all
of our managed care contracts for 2017, and there was not a significant change, or I would say very little change in the
gross-to-net between those two. So – and some of those are both 2017 and 2018 and some are just 2017. So, I'd say
there is relative stability in gross-to-net going forward, at least for the next year and a half, two years let's say.
Obviously, the environment can change but that's the view of it right now.

I think, if you go back to the OUS, as you look at it sequentially – I think we had this discussion maybe a year or so
ago, I remember – outside of the U.S., because there are tenders in certain places, the quarters can jump around quite a
bit. And so, a sequential growth quarter-to-quarter sometimes is not a very good indicator of the overall growth of the
brand in time. So, that's the only caution I'd have. If you're trying to understand, okay, how is that actually performing
in the backdrop of the biosimilars, which maybe what you're trying to understand, I essentially gave to an earlier
question some of the latest biosimilar data, the latest data that we have of the three-month market share for the
biosimilars. They've had a very modest impact thus far, and we would expect that to continue going forward.
If you look at our international HUMIRA business in 2016, and you adjust out the one-time impact for Venezuela, for
the devaluation Venezuela, as Bill said in his comments, the brand's growing from a revenue standpoint about 7%. If
you actually look at volume, it's probably two points higher than that; so, high single-digit volume growth. And that's
indicative of what we're seeing across most major markets where we operate, in the backdrop of having Remicade and
Enbrel biosimilars in many of those markets.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Thank you so much.
<A - Elizabeth Shea>: Thanks, Mark. Operator, we'll take the next question, please?

Next question is from Geoffrey Porges of Leerink Partners. Your line now is open.
<Q - Geoffrey C. Porges>: Thanks very much and I really appreciate all the color that you're providing. Bill, could
you just give us a sense of your current cash position and the U.S., OUS cash? And then, in the light of the [ph] current
(65:44) suggestions about tax and that sort of thing, [ph] have you have (65:48) flexibility to move manufacturing or
any of your assets back to the U.S. and is that something that you've contemplated as you're sort of going through the
proposals? Thanks.
<A - William J. Chase>: Sure. So, at the end of the quarter, we had about $8 billion of cash. And I think it's always a
safe to assume the vast majority of that is overseas given that to hold cash in the U.S. under the current tax paradigm is
somewhat uneconomical to us. So, we try to keep that cash offshore. In terms of our ability to manufacture in the event
that there is a tax paradigm that favors U.S. manufacturing – look, if you look at our manufacturing assets, mostly
around HUMIRA which is the main point of, I believe, your question; we've got manufacturing facilities in the U.S.
The original plant that HUMIRA was manufactured is out in Massachusetts. We also have manufacturing facilities in
Puerto Rico. So, obviously, we'd have to look closely to whether Puerto Rico is considered part of the U.S., which we
obviously think it should be. But if that was the case, then there would really be no requirement to move our supply
chain around drastically.
<Q - Geoffrey C. Porges>: Right. Thanks very much.
<A - Elizabeth Shea>: Thanks, Geoff. Operator, we'll take the next question.

Next question is from David Risinger of Morgan Stanley. Your line now is open.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Great. Thanks very much. So, I have a couple of questions. Some of these topics were
discussed. But first, Rick, I was hoping that you could just paint a picture for us for HUMIRA patent litigation to watch
ahead and how we should think about it and just what some of the key inflection points sort of to watch? And I'm
talking about litigation here, not the IPRs. I think everybody is pretty clear on the IPR actions that are forthcoming in
late spring, early summer.

Second, with respect to the tau antibody, I believe that the Phase 2 that you have discussed, as having just started,
completes in 2020; that it's scheduled to complete in 2020. I just wanted to confirm that. And I think you mentioned
that there could be an interim assessment, but wanted to confirm the timing for that Phase 2 conclusion?
And then, finally, with respect to venetoclax, could you just provide the fourth quarter sales? Thank you.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Sure. So, David, this is Rick. Because we're in the active phase of litigation now,
obviously I can't provide you a lot of color on how that will proceed. I mean obviously, we're actively involved with
Amgen. On that litigation, you see now publicly when the trial date is scheduled for, which was consistent with the
timeline that I think we discussed when we provided the longer term guidance. And so, I think it's tracking on a path
that ultimately is consistent with what our expectations were. Obviously, as others file, we will be going through a
process with them, which will be somewhat similar to the Amgen process and we'll have to see as that plays out, but
nothing that I can give you color on.
On the IPRs, although you said excluding the IPRs, I guess the one thing I would point out on the IPRs is just it's
another form of this. As we've had two IPRs now on some of our formulations patents, broad formulation patents, we
were successful and prevail on those. We have two more that are coming up now on method-of-use patents in the RA
area. Some of our method-of-use patents in RA are being challenged.
I think one thing that's important for investors to understand, the strategy that we have in place is not one that hinges on
one or two patents. I mean, at the end of the day, we have a portfolio of patents now. I think it's 110. And it is that
portfolio of patents that provides us confidence that ultimately we can protect the position which HUMIRA, based on
all the innovation that we've done and the investment we've made in HUMIRA, that's a very broad portfolio of IP that
protects it.
And so, regardless of which way the IPRs go, this strategy is not hinged on one or two patents. So, that will play out
over the course of this year and the rest of the litigation will continue to play out, but I think that's important
perspective for investors to have.
<A - Michael E. Severino>: With respect to the Phase 2 study for tau antibody program, the completion data that
would be listed on Clinicaltrials.Gov is the date in which the study would conclude, if it went out to the final analysis.
With the Phase 2 study such as this one, there are opportunities to learn along the way, as I've mentioned a bit earlier.
There are planned interim assessments. It's too early today to predict the exact timing of those assessments. But there
will be opportunities along the way between today and that 2020-2022 timeframe for us to learn a lot more about the
tau program. And obviously, as we learn more, we'll communicate that.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Okay. On venetoclax, I think, it's probably more indicative to look at the overall revenue
so far in 2016 and it was roughly $20 million, so relatively modest. And I think there are a couple of factors that you
have to think through here. As Bill mentioned in his comments, this is a – 17p deletions are relatively small market, it's
about $300 million. Today, IMBRUVICA has between 50% and 60% of that market. So, our other asset has a very
significant share position.
In addition, when you start patients up, because you step them up in dose, the initial month or so of therapy is at a
reduced cost because of the way the product is priced; because it's priced on a milligram basis and so essentially, you
step the patients through. So when you're in the early phase of starting patients up, you generate less revenue because
you're taking them through the start-up phase. If you look at where we are right now, our exit share was about a little
lower to 20% or so. 20%, 22%. So, the combined share between IMBRUVICA and venetoclax is significant,
obviously, in this segment. And, we're starting 80, 90 patients a month on average, roughly.
<A - Elizabeth Shea>: Thanks, David.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Thank you.
<A - Elizabeth Shea>: Operator, we have time for one final question.

Thank you. Your last question is from Chris Raymond of Raymond James. Your line now is open.
<Q - Christopher Joseph Raymond>: Hey, thanks for taking the question. So, just another pipeline question, maybe
for Mike on Veliparib; so, just curious, the literature paints maybe a less certain role for PARP inhibition in indications
like lung and, say, ovarian cancer. And this year, I think your first pivotal data is likely in lung. You've got squamous
and non-squamous trials in a reading out. I wonder if you could maybe sort of comment on that and maybe health
expectations as these readouts happen.
And then, maybe a companion question to that, the preclinical potency data seems to suggest that other PARPs are
more – maybe more potent than your molecule. And I think I've detected a decent amount of sort of discount assigned
to Veliparib by investors because of that. What if you could maybe sort of comment on that dynamic as well? Thanks.
<A - Michael E. Severino>: Okay. So, with respect to Veliparib, as you point out, the role for PARP inhibition in
germline carriers of BRCA mutations with either breast cancer or ovarian cancer is really quite clear. And of course,
Veliparib is registered based on single-arm studies in BRCA germline carriers. We had chosen to follow a different
development path, specifically because we didn't think it made a lot of sense for us to take our PARP and try to follow
others into relatively a small, although medically important indications like those BRCA germline carriers. That need
had already been met in our view.
So, we are testing a different hypothesis. We're testing the hypothesis that that first hit doesn't have to come from a
germline mutation that in the setting of DNA-damaging chemotherapy, particularly platinum-based therapy, the role of
DNA repair mechanisms becomes more important and that PARP inhibition may have an effect.
Now, there is good preclinical rational for this. The Phase 2 data were supportive of it, but it really is a Phase 3
question to answer. And so, we have a broad Phase 3 program that'll begin to readout over the course of this year. And
the readouts this year will be in a couple of areas, neoadjuvant breast cancer as well as in two non-small-cell lung
cancer studies. So, we'll start to see, over the course of this year, whether that broader hypothesis is going to play out.
We do also have a study in ovarian cancer. That study is just not as advanced as the non-small-cell lung cancer study.
With respective potency, I think it's very hard to determine whether preclinical potency assays, such as the ones that
have been used for PARPs, are going to translate into the clinic. Potency can vary based on assay conditions and a
number of other factors. And we believe the clinical activity is ultimately what it – what will define the role of these
PARP inhibitors. And in our early phase studies, we saw a good single-agent activity in line with the degree of PARP
inhibition that we would have hoped to have achieved.
<Q - Christopher Joseph Raymond>: Thank you.
<A - Elizabeth Shea>: Thanks, Chris.
