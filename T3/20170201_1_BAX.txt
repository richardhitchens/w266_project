With that, let me start our prepared remarks by reminding everyone that this presentation, including comments
regarding our financial outlook, new product developments, and regulatory matters contain forward-looking statements
that involve risks and uncertainties. And, of course, our actual results could differ materially from our current
expectations. Please refer to today's press release and our SEC filings for more details concerning factors that could
cause actual results to differ materially.
In addition, on today's call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Baxter's ongoing
business performance. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures being discussed today to the comparable
GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release issued this morning and available on our website.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Joe.
José E. Almeida
Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I will start today with some comments on our fourth quarter
performance and I will also share some perspective update on the year, on how we build on our momentum in 2017 and
beyond. Jay will then take a closer look at our financials and outlook for 2017, and I will close with the Q&A.
As you saw in this morning's press release, Baxter finished the year with another strong quarter. We delivered fourth
quarter sales growth of 2% in both constant currency and reported basis. Adjusting for generic competition for
cyclophosphamide in the U.S., sales increased 3% in the quarter. Key drivers include a stronger performance in U.S.,
Fluid Systems and anesthesia along with continued momentum in peritoneal dialysis and acute renal care. Globally,
[ph] products contributed (3:05) approximately 1 percentage point to growth in the quarter.
On the bottom line, adjusted earnings were $0.57 per diluted share, an increase of more than 30% versus the prior year.
Growth in the quarter reflects solid sales, improved the gross margin, and the benefit of our ongoing business
transformation efforts.
Now, we'll discuss performance by business and franchise on a constant currency basis to provide a clearer look at
underlying operational performance. In the quarter, Hospital Products sales totaled $1.6 billion globally, increasing 1%.
Adjusting for cyclophosphamide, sales improved 2% globally, in line with our expectations.
Taking a closer look at fourth quarter performance by franchise, our sales in Fluid Systems were $614 million, up 8%.
Performance was driven by favorable pricing and volume for IV solutions in the U.S. along with incremental
placements of the SIGMA SPECTRUM infusion system and the related [ph] pull through of axis test (4:17). Fluid
Systems sales growth in the quarter was negatively impacted by one percentage point of the strategic exits of IV
solutions in selected markets outside the U.S.
Integrated Pharmacy Solutions, or IPS, fourth quarter sales were $563 million, a 4% decline. Adjusting for
cyclophosphamide, sales decreased 2%. Performance in the quarter was impacted by lower sales in nutrition globally
given an increased competitive environment, lower pharmacy compounding sales, and higher sales deductions.
Surgical Care sales are $349 million or 1% in the quarter, mid-single-digit growth in our anesthesia business, offset by
lower sales in BioSurgery. While we are disappointed with BioSurgery performance, we continue to view this business
as a core growth platform and we have significantly reallocated investments to BioSurgery to improve performance.
In addition, we're pleased to welcome Wil Boren to the new role of President, BioSurgery. Wil is a 20-year healthcare
veteran with extensive global leadership and surgical care experience. We will benefit from his experience and
expertise as we expand our presence in this high potential market.
Finally, in Hospital Products, fourth quarter sales of $104 million in Other declined 6% year-over-year, reflecting lower
manufacturing services revenues from Shire. Adjusting for these impacts, sales growth in the quarter was comparable
to the prior year.

Moving on to the Renal business, global Renal sales for Q4 were $1 billion, reflecting 5% growth. We continue to see
strong momentum in peritoneal dialysis with growth of 7% globally, driven by patient growth of 6% along with
favorable pricing and product mix in the U.S. where we now have nearly 1,500 patients on AMIA.
Fourth quarter Renal results also benefited from our high-single-digit growth in acute renal care. Our PRISMAFLEX
System continues to lead the rapidly-growing market for continuous renal replacement therapy or CRRT.
In-center hemodialysis performance declined slightly in the quarter, but we are pleased to see growth is stabilizing
following a number of actions we have taken to enhance performance. Growth improved two percentage points
sequentially and, importantly, profitability continues to improve in this business.
In the fourth quarter, we launched our novel and proprietary HDx therapy enabled by our THERANOVA dialyzer
which has the potential to raise the standard of treatment and improve outcomes for end-stage renal disease patients.
With that, let's shift focus to the full year. This call marks my first anniversary as Baxter's CEO. I've found that at a
company with a solid foundation and good people, the goal quite simply has been to convert this potential to consistent
top-quartile performance, to do it fast and do it well. Our full year results demonstrate our progress towards this
objective; mid-single-digit sales growth; adjusted income of $1.96 per diluted share; and free cash flow greater than
$900 million.
Our business transformation has focused on three clearly-defined strategic levers: portfolio and innovation
management; operational excellence; and capital allocation. We rolled out this strategy at our 2016 Investor Conference
along with our Baxter 2020 financial targets and it has been about execution since then. [ph] This passion for (8:05)
management has meant taking a hard look at where we drive the greatest value for patients and the business across our
vast portfolio and global footprint and in investment according to the strengthened top line growth and ROIC. We have
made some very candid assessments that have been crucial to optimize our portfolio, go-to-market strategy, and
commercial mindset. Some of these decisions will impact our top line growth in 2017, but positions Baxter for
accelerated growth as we redirect resources to higher growth, higher margin opportunities.
Just like our fourth quarter, our research and development pipeline must drive clear value for our patients and the
business. In 2016, we accelerated R&D productivity and shifted differential investment to our core growth areas and
some compelling strategic bets. These actions will create the foundation for ongoing growth. We have also made
excellent progress established in a more efficient organizational structure and disciplined cost management strategies.
And while these actions have meaningfully contribute to margin expansion in 2016, we'll continue to identify new
initiatives through our business transformation, all this to drive operational efficiency across our organization.
Executing our capital allocation strategy to ensure appropriate investment in our business and returning value to
shareholders is pivotal to deliver sustained top-quartile performance. In 2016, we successfully completed the
disposition of the Baxalta retained stake and opportunistically restructured debt, among other steps to fuel growth and
create value. Rewarding shareholders is essential to this equation, which we emphasized through a 13% dividend
increase in opportunistic share repurchases of approximately $300 million.
Finally, we initiated the acquisition of Claris Injectables, providing key platform for future growth. So in sum, it has
been a year of rapid and meaningful strategic execution across the board in advancing both the top line and bottom line.
Am I satisfied? No. But we are off to a solid start and there's more to come.
And with that, I will turn it over to Jay.
James K. Saccaro
Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we're pleased with our fourth quarter results,
demonstrating continued progress towards achieving our long-term financial goals. Sales in the quarter increased 2%
on both a reported basis and constant currency basis, in line with our expectations. Walking through the rest of the
P&L, adjusted gross margin of 44.5% represents an improvement of nearly 200 basis points over the prior year, driven

by improved pricing in select areas of the portfolio and favorable manufacturing performance in the quarter.
Adjusted SG&A totaled $619 million, decreasing 8% on a reported basis. The primary driver of the improvement was
our ongoing focus on controlling expenses and the benefit from lower pension expenses.
TSA income totaled approximately $23 million in the quarter compared to approximately $30 million in the fourth
quarter of 2015. As mentioned last quarter, TSA income from Shire will continue to decline as the need for these
services ramps down, which is expected to be by mid-2017. Adjusted R&D spending in the quarter of $152 million
decreased 4% versus the prior year.
Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 15.4%, an improvement of 470 basis points versus prior year. Operating
margin compared favorably to our expectations, driven by improved gross margin and disciplined expense
management. Interest expense was $13 million in the fourth quarter. Adjusted other income totaled $19 million in the
quarter, primarily resulting from gains on the sale of select investments and a foreign exchange benefit on balance sheet
positions.
The adjusted tax rate was 24.5% for the quarter. This rate was higher than expected and reflects the finalization of the
effective tax rate for the full year, which reflects incremental profitability generated in higher tax jurisdictions in 2016
as compared to 2015. And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings of $0.57 per diluted share exceeded our guidance
of $0.49 to $0.52 per share. Relative to the midpoint of our range, this favorability was driven by approximately $0.06
of operational strength and a $0.02 benefit from other income. This was partially offset by approximately $0.02 due to
a higher tax rate.
During the fourth quarter, we opportunistically repurchased approximately $250 million or approximately 5 million
shares during the quarter. These repurchases were partially offset by option-related dilution.
Before I turn to our outlook for 2017, I wanted to spend some time discussing our cash flow performance. In 2016, we
generated free cash flow of $905 million, an improvement of more than $550 million versus 2015 and ahead of our
most recent guidance of $650 million for 2016. This improvement was driven by strong operational performance,
disciplined management of capital expenditures, which declined by nearly $200 million, along with the implementation
of new programs focused on improving the company's working capital. These new initiatives around days payable and
days receivable contributed to the strong cash generation in the fourth quarter.
We also took the opportunity in the quarter to repatriate approximately $1 billion in overseas cash to the U.S. We were
able to bring this cash back to the U.S. in a tax efficient manner via the partial repayment of an intercompany loan as
well as repatriation of previously taxed earnings in certain foreign jurisdictions.
Let me conclude my comments this morning by providing an update on our outlook for 2017. Starting with sales, on a
constant currency basis, we expect 2017 full-year sales for Baxter to increase approximately 2% and after adjusting for
the U.S. cyclo impact and the select strategic product exits we've discussed, we expect underlying operational growth
of approximately 4%. This growth is in line with our long-term projections and does not reflect any benefit from the
proposed Claris acquisition. With respect to Claris, we expect the acquisition to close in the second half of 2017, and
we'll provide updated expectations following completion of the acquisition.
On a reported basis, including the impact of foreign exchange, we expect full year 2017 sales to be comparable to the
prior year. We expect growth in the Hospital Products business of 1% to 2% or approximately 3% to 4% excluding
cyclo and strategic exits. Within the Hospital Products franchise, we expect sales growth of 2% to 3% for Fluid
Systems. Adjusting for strategic exits, we expect growth of 4% to 5%.
For the Integrated Pharmacy Solutions franchise, we expect sales to decline low-single-digits. We expect full-year sales
for cyclo of $115 million as compared to $210 million in 2015. Our assumption is that additional competitors enter the
market during the second and third quarters of 2017. And after adjusting for cyclo, sales are expected to increase 3% in
IPS.
Within the Surgical Care franchise, we anticipate sales to grow approximately 2% to 3%. Both the anesthesia and
BioSurgery businesses are expected to grow in that range. And finally, for the Hospital Products business, we now

expect [ph] EPS (16:06) and Other to increase low- to mid-single-digits. For the Renal business, we expect full year
sales to increase 3% to 4%, driven by continued growth across the segment. Adjusting for select strategic exits, sales
are expected to increase between 4% to 5%.
Moving down the P&L, we expect an operating margin of 15%, approximately 150 basis points improvement versus
2016. This is ahead of our long-term outlook we provided in May 2016 and reflects the benefit of all the actions we've
taken to optimize our cost structure. We expect to provide an update for our long-term guidance on our second quarter
conference call.
We expect interest expense to total approximately $60 million and other income of approximately $20 million for 2016.
For the year, we expect an average adjusted tax rate of approximately 20.5%. This reflects a benefit of $20 million or
approximately $0.03 related to the adoption of the new stock compensation guidance.
For full year 2017, we anticipate an average share count of 550 million shares. Based on these factors, we expect 2017
adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $2.10 to $2.18 per diluted share. Finally, for the year, we expect to
generate operating cash flow of approximately $1.75 billion and free cash flow of approximately $1 billion.
Specific to the first quarter of 2017, we expect sales growth to increase approximately 2% to 3% on a reported basis,
and 3% to 4% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for the impact of cyclo and selected strategic product exits, we
expect underlying constant currency sales growth of 5% to 6%. And we expect adjusted earnings, excluding special
items, of $0.50 to $0.52 per diluted share.
With that, we can now open up the call for Q&A.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] So, that we may be respectful
of everyone's time, please limit your comments to one question with one follow-up, if necessary. We appreciate
everyone's patience and would like to provide as many of you as possible with the opportunity to ask a question. We'll
pause for a moment while the list is being compiled. I would like to remind participants that this call is being recorded
and a digital replay will be available on the Baxter International website for 60 days at www.baxter.com.
And our first question comes from Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Good morning. Can you hear me okay?
<A - James K. Saccaro>: We can. Good morning.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Perfect. First off, congratulations on another fine quarter. Let me ask you a couple of
questions on the guidance, if I can, Jay. So, your 20 – well, let me step back, your margins over the last two quarters
have obviously been exceptional. You've made a ton of progress, your EBITDA margin was 15.4% this quarter, 16%
last quarter, your 2017 guidance is for 15%. So, tell me why is 15% the right number for 2017 given the second half of
2016 performance?
<A - James K. Saccaro>: Yeah. Great. First of all, normal seasonality, we typically do better from a margin standpoint
in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year. So, there are a number of factors that drive that in terms
of seasonality of sales and normal hospital buying patterns. But we do see some normal historic uptick in the second
half of the year margins relative to the first half, and that was certainly the case in 2016.
But interesting, maybe I'll make a few comments in terms of overall guidance as we think about 2017 operating margin.
Really there are a number of factors at play. One of them is we do have a cyclo headwind moving into next year, right.
So, that's about 80 basis points of impact on operating margin or, call it, $0.13 of headwinds. From a foreign-exchange
standpoint, we have another roughly 30 basis points of headwind. And from a TSA standpoint, we have about 50 basis

points of headwind.
So, when you sum these up, we're talking about headwinds of roughly 150 basis points or actually, as we calculate it
another, maybe $0.35 of headwinds. Now, converting that to performance, we expect to see, adjusting for that, roughly
300 basis points of margin improvement gross of those headwinds. That takes us from, on a full year basis, what was
13.6% to roughly 15% for 2017.
So, there are a couple of factors that mask the quantum of the overall margin improvement. If you think about it from
an overall EPS standpoint, like I said, we have about $0.35 of headwinds. We're doing a lot of work on the SG&A line
and we're going to see normal operational growth and portfolio optimization that contribute, that allow us to offset that.
But it is a fairly substantial increase.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Okay. And, Jay, just two follow-ups. So, if I look back in the analyst meeting in June, your
2018 margin guidance was 14% to 15%, your cash flow guidance was for $1.8 billion operating cash flow, $1 billion of
free cash flow. You're going to hit those targets if not exceed them in 2017. So, the question is are the 2018 targets that
you laid out last June now basically no longer effective or operational? And then second question is, are you assuming
any share buybacks in your guidance for 2017? Thanks.
<A - James K. Saccaro>: Yeah. So, as we think about the projections that we shared in May, I mean, I will tell you on
the operating margin side and certainly on the free cash flow side, we're extremely pleased with the performance so
much so that we've pulled forward 2018 basically one year to 2017 from a margin standpoint, from a free cash flow
standpoint.
So, we have to update those numbers. My full expectation is we will be able to over achieve those numbers, clearly
based on the 2017 performance. But from an overall profit standpoint, we feel through a bottoms-up long-range
financial planning process, our teams have initiated that work. It's work that we'll conduct over the next several months.
We'll review the outlook with our board of directors. And then I certainly look forward to sharing it with our investors
at the July earnings call, in part because I do believe that there will be upside to the numbers that we've shared.
As it relates to share buyback, we are assuming share buyback to offset dilution, so there is a few hundred million
dollars of buyback embedded in our guidance. As we've said, our standard approach, we don't commit to specific
amounts. A lot of it depends on the evolution of the share price relative to the intrinsic value of our company.
In the fourth quarter, we saw a great opportunity because, from an intrinsic value standpoint, the shares traded at a
higher discount than normal. So, we repurchased $250 million in shares. We'll look to do that again to the extent the
opportunity presents itself in 2017. But from a planning standpoint, we basically have share buyback offsetting
dilution.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Perfect. Thank you, Jay.
<A - James K. Saccaro>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Matt Taylor of Barclays. Your line is now open.
<Q - Matthew Taylor>: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So, just to follow up on the margin piece. You
outlined a number of the headwinds. I'd love to understand the components of margin expansion. If you could just kind
of walk us through portfolio management, new products, cost savings, things like that so that we can understand the
bridge that allows you to make such a nice jump over some of these hurdles in 2017.
<A - James K. Saccaro>: Yeah. No. It's a great question. And I did focus on the headwinds in the first answer. As I
said, we have about $0.35 worth of headwinds or 150 basis points. But the work that we're doing in a number of areas
has paid remarkable dividends in 2016, and we expect very big impacts in 2017.

The area that I'll point out from an SG&A standpoint, we expect about 120 basis points, 130 basis points of net
improvement or roughly $0.18 related to the cost savings initiatives that we've put in place. And we've talked a lot
about this concept of zero-based budgeting and how, from an organization standpoint and from a spending standpoint,
we've been incredibly disciplined on looking at every dollar consumed by our company. That featured prominently in
our results in 2016. But what it allows us to do in 2017 is improve our SG&A once again by 120, 130 basis points and
$0.18, and that's net of inflationary increases that we normally see from a payroll standpoint. So, that one factor is a
very big impact and, frankly, it offsets a number of the headwinds that we're facing.
But then the next piece relates to normal operational growth. If you think about the normal operational growth that
we've talked about, roughly 4-plus-percent, that will contribute because we've walked away from sales that are zero
margin, really. That drops through at a higher level than the standard corporate average. And when we start to see
growth in those core growth areas which, attached to them have a higher margin than the corporate average, it has a
great impact on the operating margin.
So, the operational growth of our business is roughly 170 basis points of positive impact. We'll see roughly north of
$0.30 of benefit from the operational growth of Baxter. So, taking a step back, we have a number of headwinds that
we're fighting through, but we have two very important tailwinds. One is this SG&A focus that we have as an entire
organization. And two is the drive to accelerate the growth of the business and the natural improvement that drives
towards the bottom line.
<Q - Matthew Taylor>: Great. And then just one follow-up. I would love to hear kind of your updated thoughts on the
Claris acquisition and the injectables space in general. Can you talk about how that's core to your strategy? And does
Claris gets you where you need to be in injectables? Are there other assets that you could add there or other white
spaces kind of higher priority?
<A - José E. Almeida>: Matt, the strategy we outlined is very clear. We're going to be into the injectables. It's difficult
to make a market. Claris is a step in the right direction. Between Claris and Baxter, the portfolio in the next three to five
years will be launching 100 different new molecules for us into the market. We also have plans to sign several different
collaborations and partnership agreements coming up probably in the next 30 days. We're going to probably have one
or two. And we're planning to have 100 more molecules on top of that. So, expect more to come.
We also have segregated our organization within Baxter to make sure that we have the right people in place to create
the three competitive advantage that this market requires, which is cost, quality, and speed.
<Q - Matthew Taylor>: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Vijay Kumar of Evercore. Your line is now open.
<Q - Vijay Kumar>: Hey, guys. Congratulations on another impressive performance here. Maybe I'll start with one
high level question on the revenue guidance. Jay, I mean, if you look at the 2% constant revenue growth, I think there
has been some question about what is the true underlying growth for Baxter ex pricing. Can you just comment on in a
volume versus price dynamic for that 2%?
<A - James K. Saccaro>: Yeah. I mean, the 2% is principally volume-related. There's a small impact of price included
in that but, by and large, it's a volume-related number. We've historically talked about this notion of organic or
long-term sustainable growth of 4% but our expectation is that we look to accelerate beyond that over time. And so, as
we sit here today, the 4%, when you adjust for cyclo and the strategic exits, we're kind of broadly consistent with that.
<Q - Vijay Kumar>: Great. And maybe one for Joe. Joe, when you think about the cash conversion, it really is up
remarkable rate. You guys I think have, last year instead of the targeted $500 million, almost doubled the free cash.
One, why is that $1 billion free cash you think, for 2017, the right number? Were there any timing-related impacts in
the 2016, in the fourth quarter [ph] period (29:52) which sort of affects the comp? And two, what's the use of cash? If I

do the math, 5 million shares repurchased for $250 million, that gets an average share price of $47.50. Your stocks
right now are close to those levels. So, how should we think about M&A versus share repo? Thank you.
<A - James K. Saccaro>: Yeah. Sure. Let me talk about cash flow performance in 2016 and the guidance for 2017,
and I'll turn it over to Joe to talk about uses and M&A versus share buybacks. But I will tell you, one of the – there are
a lot of things that went very well that we are very pleased with in 2016. But one of the areas that was really a bright
shining star was free cash flow performance.
We did significantly over-achieved the guidance that we shared in Q3. And inherently, as we think about cash flow, it
is difficult to forecast cash flow for a couple reasons. One is a lot of cash flow is typically generated at the very end of
the year. And then the second point is because we have such large working capital balances today and because free
cash flow has historically been such a small number, small improvements in working capital balance have a very
leveraged effect on free cash flow, and we clearly saw that play out.
But I'll tell you, we were thrilled with the progress. From a working capital standpoint, we really pursued the
transformation on three areas, right – days payable, days sales outstanding, and days inventory on hand – and in every
single area, our Baxter teams exceeded our expectations.
So, from a days sales outstanding, we're down two days year-over-year. We have several countries that have historic
decade-low DSO. So, the team in Spain has done just an extraordinary job. Our DSO in Spain is 100 days. I went to
Europe in 2007, I haven't seen a DSO at that level in ages. And really, the focus of the DSO effort was we did not want
the Baxter team to stand in the way of a collection, right. We did not want to be a bottleneck. And I think our teams in
Mexico, Italy, Spain, across the board, just did a fabulous job in that regard.
From a days payable standpoint, we improved one day year-over-year. And this is a program that I previously
referenced that we had not really seen such dividends earlier on this year because we had started it this year. But again,
one day. We have more to do in 2017. Great performance there.
And then another one – and you'll see this when you see the balance sheet – on the face of the balance sheet, inventory
comes down more than $100 million as days inventory on-hand declined 10 days, a remarkable performance by our
supply chain team. Really solid work there. So, on all three dimensions of working capital, we had outstanding efforts.
From a CapEx standpoint, CapEx came in a little bit lower, but if you noticed our guidance, we actually guided slightly
higher CapEx next year versus this year. There were a couple of programs that had slight delays, nothing material, but
shifting spending from December to January or Q1 along with placements of some products. Again, no material impact
to revenue growth or anything like that. But we did see some shift from 2016 to 2017, very modest.
So, I would say that CapEx, the benefits that we saw came earlier in the year, and this was a little bit more about
timing. And then from a working capital standpoint, those were benefits that, frankly, I was banking on in 2017 that we
were able to materialize earlier on.
As we look to 2017, we're seeing 10% cash flow growth, we'll see continued improvements in days inventory, days
sales, days payable. We will also have, embedded in our numbers, roughly $150 million in restructuring payments,
restructuring outflows that take place in 2017. So, there are some headwinds that we're facing, but we feel very
confident in the $1 billion, and we look forward to working hard to achieve that number.
For us, I think this has been a real area of focus because as we've thought about the valuation of our company
internally, really free cash flow conversion from sales, free cash flow conversion from EBITDA, that's a very important
metric and we strived hard to improve that. So, it's nice to see that improvement in 2016.
We did, by the way, with the over-achievement of the $650 million by $250 million, we really did self-fund the share
buyback in 2016. So, with that, I'll turn it over to Joe to talk about how we're going to use the cash.
<A - José E. Almeida>: I think the great use of cash is to provide opportunities for the company to deliver the top
quartile shareholder total shareholder return. So, for us, it's not a matter of one versus the other, it's we can do them all.
We can allocate capital to dividends. Our long-term objective is 35%, we're going to continue to pursue that. We will

buy shares back opportunistically because we're not going to hoard cash on our balance sheet. But more importantly is
with this cash flow performance associated with a clean balance sheet with a very, very low net debt over EBITDA, we
can now contemplate inorganic opportunities that we probably were a little shy in looking into in the past.
So, as I said in the previous meeting this year, 15% to 20% of our market cap is reasonable to think about acquisitions
on that level. We have several opportunities that we're evaluating. And the transformation of our portfolio in a higher
weighted average growth market rate business is our objective.
<Q - Vijay Kumar>: Thanks, guys.
<A - James K. Saccaro>: Thank you, Vijay.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Brooks West of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.
<Q - Brooks E. West>: Hi. Thanks. Can you hear me?
<A - James K. Saccaro>: We can.
<Q - Brooks E. West>: Great. Good morning, guys. I've got two franchise-level questions. First, on the IV business.
Can you comment on where Baxter is with the upgrade cycle for SIGMA SPECTRUM? I know there has been some
competitive disruption there so I'm wondering if there's more share to be had in the actual pump market.
And then secondly, it sounded like you have a little pricing leverage within that business. Wondering if you could just
talk about some of the pricing dynamics within the injectables. And then I'll go ahead and ask my second one. Just on
BioSurgery, Joe, sounds like you've got a new leader there. You're guiding for that business to improve. I'm just
wondering is it execution? Is there a product pipeline to call out? Are you looking at deals there? If you could give us
some details on how that business should start to turn around. Thanks.
<A - José E. Almeida>: Sure. We do have several improvements to our pump portfolio coming about for the U.S. We
just recently also signed a development partnership deal with a very reputable company outside the U.S. They will be
augmenting our outside U.S. portfolio. If you remember, Baxter still holds a significant amount of channels outside the
U.S. under the Colleague pump. And as we space Colleague pump out, we're going to come up with a new platform
soon to be able to substitute that. And then that partnership is going to grow into new areas of different applications of
pumps and things of this sort.
So, we have two efforts that I feel very confident about. One is the internal launch in connectivity improvement and
programmability of our pumps. As you know, we have best in class 2016 pump in the market, our SIGMA
SPECTRUM is really doing well. And then now we're going to go with the international effort with another platform.
So, I feel quite confident in our way to approach this market.
When it comes to price dynamics, we don't comment on price dynamics. I can tell you that price has been a modest
contributor to our growth. We spoke – Jay spoke earlier today about 1%. We have long-term contracts with our
hospitals in the U.S. and these contracts are solid and are being executed.
Our responsibility at the moment is to actually make sure that we have plenty of supply and we're investing money in
our operations in North Carolina to the tune of $100 million to make sure that we continue to provide quality products
to the market and also create a North American network with more capacity coming out through Canada and Mexico.
When it comes to BioSurgery, I have to say that our execution has not been the greatest. But with Wil Boren onboard,
he quickly is going to be able to turn this business around. We're looking at a nice licensing agreement right now and
we are renaming this unit within our company to [ph] Advanced Surgery (39:30), so he's going to open opportunities
for adjacency and acquisitions in the area. So, you don't only have [ph] a chance to therapy (39:37), but now you're
going into specialty areas of surgery, which I find very refreshing.

So, it's all about execution with the new president in place. We segregate this business on a global basis, a truly vertical
business across Baxter. We're moving from the traditional international organization. And lastly is augmentation of
licensing deals and doubling of research and development. So, we have a lot of faith in Wil and I'm sure he'll be able to
turn this business around.
<Q - Brooks E. West>: Great. Thanks, Joe. I appreciate the comments.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
<Q - David Ryan Lewis>: Good morning. Just a couple of financial questions for Jay and then one strategic one for
Joe. So, Jay, just real quickly, a couple of things. IPS performance was a little lower in the fourth quarter and that's sort
of, relative to our model, looks a little lower in 2017 as well. So, on an underlying basis, is there something in IPS that
happened in the fourth quarter that kind of bleeds into 2017?
And then, operationally, for the guidance for the year, just the pacing of quarters. First quarter starts out very strong and
then, obviously, that slows a little bit across the next two quarters. Is there anything going on there other than just
comparables? Obviously, your second and third quarter were the toughest comps of the year. And then I have a quick
follow-up for Joe.
<A - James K. Saccaro>: Okay. Let me hit the second one first. We do see some of the strongest growth in our Fluid
Systems occurs in the first half of the year. As you recall, we signed a number of agreements and the last of which was
really signed, I believe, in the second quarter of last year. So, we start to annualize those benefits in the second half.
Thus, the slight deceleration in sales growth from really the first quarter and maybe second quarter to the rest of the
year. So, that's really the seasonality factor.
As we think about IPS, I would point out that in the U.S., in the Hospital business, we don't really do a lot of discussion
around selling days, but we did have a couple of days less from a selling days standpoint which is, call it, 3% or 4% of
impact. And in particular, in businesses like IPS, it can have a material impact on the growth rate. So, I would point to
that. I think there's not really other trends going on in that particular business. We continue to be very excited about it.
IPS, as you know, includes nutrition, GPI, our injectables business which, so far, the injectables, we're very optimistic
about that space.
<Q - David Ryan Lewis>: Okay. And then, Joe, just if I go back to the Analyst Day and think about strategic
priorities. I mean you have this – 40% of the company is dialysis and you have a product suite there that's delivering in,
obviously, good guidance for 2017. You spelled out the importance of generic injectables and gaining that platform for
[ph] Brik's group (42:27) and that happened. Now, with Wil being onboard and kind of renaming that group, is the one
area where there's the greatest opportunity to sort of transform the growth rate of the company, is that really in this [ph]
Advanced Surgery (42:28), BioSurgery space? That seems to me to be sort of the one hole post the Analyst Day that
could be filled with sort of strategic action. Thank you.
<A - José E. Almeida>: David, that points to a great area of opportunity I think inorganically. And now with our
balance sheet and our performance in cash flow, I feel more confident in how we go about this businesses because –
give us more flexibility. I think when you start going away from classifying your businesses, products or narrow areas,
it opens a strategic opportunities, adjacencies. So, in the Surgery business, I think that is the case.
I would like to underscore that Renal, despite the fact that we're market leaders in peritoneal dialysis and we've been
gaining market share in the U.S. and other markets in acute renal care, which is our CRRT versus our competition
because our technology is far superior. I would say that there is still opportunity in peritoneal dialysis for growth in
emerging markets with technology that currently does not exist there.
So, I feel that we're always going to have that nice business, 5%, 6% growth in Renal. This keep turning and turning
and delivering on cash. And Giuseppe Accogli has done a great job with his team turning the in-center hemodialysis

business around. And with the adoption of AMIA, with its telemedicine platform, I feel really confident about that
business.
So, as we see new opportunities and adjacencies, I still think there our base renal business continues to return a great
deal of cash and helping the company finance expansion in that area and other areas.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
<Q - Larry Biegelsen>: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So, Joe, emerging markets are about 25% of
Baxter sales. Can you talk about what you're seeing for Baxter in emerging markets? What was growth in Q4? What's
your expectation for 2017? And I had one follow-up. Thanks.
<A - José E. Almeida>: Our emerging markets totaled 3% growth in the fourth quarter, but I would like to qualify that,
that all of our exits are happening in that market. We're exiting some of the business in India, Turkey, and Venezuela
and they're depressed. I like to point out that in greater China where we're up now to 6%, with plans to get to
high-single-digit growth, we see our peritoneal dialysis business recovering in China, which is very important to us. We
also see a recovery in Latin America and some of the underlying growth here would be primarily in BioSurgery and
peritoneal dialysis, areas we're going to focus.
As you know, we exit – and we're going to be exiting a lot of the IP business in some of the markets that we're not
making any money, so the other way, we're losing money. So, I feel that we have now investment plans for China
which will bring that business close to $1 billion in a few years. And we are very, very bullish about Latin America,
and their – our expanded investment there.
So, I would say that for the mid term to long term, growth rates we're looking at low – high-single-digits for that region
so once we get over this hump, 12 months of us exiting the business in India, China, – I'm sorry, India, Turkey, and
Venezuela.
<Q - Larry Biegelsen>: Thank you. That's very helpful. And then just back to Claris. I know there was a question
asked on that earlier. But can you tell us what the sales were for 2016 and the growth? And I'm asking because the IMS
data implies, for at least the U.S., that growth was north of 50% through the first three quarters of 2016. And just
wanted to confirm that if it closes later this year, it's about a $0.01 to $0.02 benefit in 2017? Thanks for taking the
questions.
<A - José E. Almeida>: So, we are planning to close Claris as fast as we can. But more – the realistic approach is
probably the second half, July, August. We'll give more clarity. We're talking about it couple of cents a share for this
year, and the company has north of $100 million in sales. So, you can do some of that bath. I would think we will come
out with very transparent guidance on how is that going to impact 2018 so you can put in your long-range plan what
that will do for us. And we'll keep you guys posted on the acceleration programs that we're putting in place for
additional molecules for this market.

<Q - Bob Hopkins>: Great. Good morning, Jay, and Joe, and Clare. Just a quick question first for you, Jay, on the
guidance. I know we've talked about this a little bit already in terms of how Q1 starts and then the rest of the year. But
what I'm curious about, if you could just talk about what drives the improving underlying growth in Q1 versus Q4?
Because I think in Q4 you said you grew 3% and then you're expecting 5% to 6% underlying in Q1. Is that just comps
or what drives such an acceleration from Q4 to Q1?
<A - James K. Saccaro>: Yeah, it's interesting. There's definitely a comp factor in play. As we look back to last year,
we had a strong Q4, and then Q1 was not quite as relatively strong as Q4. But then, and I don't want to get into this
whole billing day thing, but it is a factor that comes into play in particular in our Hospital business globally. We lost a
couple of billing days which was several points of growth and I believe in Q1 we actually gained one billing day. So,
that swing factor actually modulates the growth rate to some extent. Those are really the factors that are in play.
<Q - Bob Hopkins>: Okay. So, it's less fundamental issue, it's more sort of calendar issue it sounds like just in terms of
Q4 to Q1.
<A - James K. Saccaro>: Exactly.
<Q - Bob Hopkins>: And then, Joe, for you, again, for everybody, congrats on a great 2016. You've talked a lot about
M&A already on this call but I was wondering if you could just, in broad terms, set expectations for us for M&A in
2017. How likely are deals – how confident are you that there are attractive assets out there that could be priced at
levels that you find interesting in 2017?
<A - José E. Almeida>: Now, Bob, it is quite a test to answer your question because it's opportunistic and our efforts
are relentless. So, eventually, we're going to get to the right target. We're working very hard. As you know, we rebuilt
our M&A team completely from scratch. We have very good people onboard. But we are financially disciplined so our
ability to strategically identify targets are there – is there, but things have to work. And some assets are expensive, and
we want to make sure that we can extract value because our first priority is to really return to the top-quartile total
shareholder returns and we'll do that.
We have plenty of targets, a good team in place, good direction on where to go. We need to find the opportunity where
this target becomes available, is interested and the price is something that will be attractive to the company.
We are always speaking about three to five years company average ROIC return. We're talking about internal rate of
return greater by far exceeding cost of capital, all that and equity included. So we will continue down this path. But we
are excited about the position that we have in our balance sheet, but that does not create a bias for us to act without
thinking about the financial returns.
<Q - Bob Hopkins>: Great. Thanks for taking the questions.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Matt Miksic of UBS. Your line is now open.
<Q - Matt Miksic>: Hey. Thanks for taking our questions. Can you hear me okay?
<A - James K. Saccaro>: We can. Thanks, Matt.
<Q - Matt Miksic>: So, I just wanted to – I know there has been a couple questions on Claris and on some of the other
efforts that you're making across the portfolio to improve performance. And we felt the Claris deal was right on target
with the injectables strategy laid out last year. But one of the things – it has come up a couple times in the call – that we
think you're doing particularly well, and would love to hear some thoughts on 2017, is the impact of product line
rationalization, particularly by geography.
You've mentioned some of the changes here in the back half. I was wondering, Jay, if you could talk a little bit about
the size or the scale of that contribution to your operating – your underlying 300 basis point operating improvement

you talked about before headwinds. And I have one follow-up.
<A - José E. Almeida>: Yeah. I mean, it's interesting because for us, over the last 1.5 years, and we really intensified
the focus over the last six months, we've been focused on rationalizing the portfolio and challenging every single sale.
I think we've done a nice job looking at the fully-loaded and variable profitability of every product line in every
country in which we operate. And as part of that, we identified a set of sales which didn't quite make sense for us on a
going-forward basis, and so we walked away. The impact next year is around $100 million in sales. That was really a
zero margin contribution. And so, the simple fact of walking away from those sales is roughly 10 to 20 points of
margin improvement due to those strategic exits.
Now, it's important to note, as we sit here today, I think we have cleansed the portfolio to the extent that it needs to be
cleansed at this stage. Of course, things change. So, it could be a foreign currency evolution, it could be pricing
pressure in a particular emerging market, which would cause us to relook at this. But, again, as we sit here today, I
think we feel very confident that all of the sales that we have contribute positively to the economics of Baxter.
But now it's about, from a portfolio management standpoint, not so much walking away but shifting our R&D
investments and our SG&A investments towards those areas that we think are promotionally sensitive where Baxter has
a proprietary right to win, where we have higher margins. And that will be the next leg of the journey as we think about
margin improvement related to portfolio management.
<Q - Matt Miksic>: That's great. And as follow-up, again, this is a theme that has come up in a couple of other
questions on pricing. But just given the sensitivity and the focus on this, particularly drug pricing, which is away from
your core lines of business, it would be helpful to understand – I think we understand that the majority, vast majority of
growth is driven by volumes. But we often think in terms of things like price net of mix or price and mix as the other
variable plus or minus around that growth rate. Are you living in a sort of a negative price world with some positive
mix? Or the other way around? Or how should we think about it?
<A - James K. Saccaro>: Yeah, I mean, look I think what I would say is as we look at 2017, to be clear, we have
roughly 30 basis points of pricing in our numbers. So, it's not a substantial number from an overall pricing standpoint.
And really, that's not new price increases that we're anticipating insomuch as it is previously agreed to, agreements that
we have in place with our major customers with kind of normal price increases attached to them. So, really that's the
environment that we're operating in.
As we've said, when we look at our long-range plan, we see a fairly neutral price environment. There are some benefit
and some areas where we're seeing pressure. We've commented historically about price pressure in the area of
dialyzers, but we've also commented about things like the launch of AMIA and what that does as a new therapy and
ability to charge a higher price because of the great value that we're providing with that product.
So, it's a difficult question to answer. But what I can say is we're not really counting on much price. We think the
environment's fairly neutral and it's a little bit different than some of the other dynamics that are in play with other
areas in healthcare.
<Q - Matt Miksic>: Thanks so much.

<Q - Glenn John Novarro>: Hi. Good morning, guys. First, Jay, did you give us targets for gross margin and R&D
ratio for 2017?
<A - James K. Saccaro>: We did not share those targets. I think from a gross standpoint, we're looking at roughly 50
basis points of expansion next year. Mind you, some of the foreign exchange impact and some of the cyclo impact, in
particular, impact that line which is why we're not seeing more expansion.

And from an R&D standpoint, we're looking at mid-single-digit increase. And it's interesting because our R&D team
has done a very nice job looking at infrastructure costs and controlling costs and diverting spending to new product
development. And so, while we're only increasing mid-single digit, the actual amount spent on projects is going up
fairly substantially, so we're very pleased with that.
And then from an SG&A standpoint, we expect, again, there will be a decline in SG&A down low to mid-single-digits.
And that's in large part driven by the zero-based budgeting techniques that we're applying across the portfolio.
<Q - Glenn John Novarro>: Okay. And then, let me just follow up on that SG&A comment just because one of the
questions I often get from investors is, how sustainable or how much runway is left in terms of bringing down SG&A?
In other words, has all the low-hanging fruit been removed? So, maybe some thoughts either from Joe or Jay in terms
of the sustainability of the SG&A decline over time. Thanks.
<A - José E. Almeida>: Glenn, we are in the middle of doing it. We still have a few programs that are in process of
being contemplated. And what I'm finding here at Baxter that I did not find before in my previous experience is that the
business transformation office has changed the way we look at things in how we spend money and the effectiveness of
our spending patterns. So, we are now a company that is, for the vast majority, a six-layer company with very few
exceptions. We're a company that understands category management. But every meeting that we go, we go to a 2-hour
business transformation meeting every month.
We just identified a significant amount of savings in the future, of programs that were not contemplated.
So, this is a journey. This is not a project. So, do we have more? Yes. Is this more elasticity? Yes. Do we want to see
the SG&A lower? Yes. What is the right SG&A for this company? Well, we're going to talk more about what we think
the margins are going to be in 2020 later this year so then you can estimate what the SG&A is going to be as a target.
But we are not satisfied. We're happy with the progress and the people of Baxter has done a great job embracing this
very difficult way of managing business in terms of expense.
<Q - Glenn John Novarro>: Okay. Great. Thanks, Joe.
<A - José E. Almeida>: You're welcome.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
<Q - Joanne Karen Wuensch>: Thank you very much for taking the question. Very nice quarter. Joe, you've been
there for about a year now. What would you say were your key highlights or takeaways? And a year from now when
we're all together, what do you really want to make sure that we have seen happen this year?
<A - José E. Almeida>: Joanne, I was surprised by a culture that was ready to be changed. People here were looking
for a change. And so, some of the things that we were doing in terms of portfolio management, reallocation of R&D
resources, completely revamping of our marketing organizations, how we organize our [ph] PD&L, our (1:00:31)
M&A groups, this has been a significant change in how people used to do business. And folks here have adopted and
really didn't miss a beat in getting on with the program. So, I will highlight that of everything we're doing, we couldn't
have done it without the great employees of Baxter.
Looking forward, if I'm still here a year from today, what I would like to see? I would like to see this BioSurgery
business start to transform itself and look at some opportunities outside. I would like to see us with probably another
100 to 200 molecules in our pipeline above what we have today. I would like to see us with a well-defined pump
technology which is not only U.S. but is a global one that has the ability to be in the three levels of pump platforms that
we need to have. So, I have significant expectations. And lastly, is to make sure that we don't lose the sense of urgency
and the speed by which we transform the company.

<Q - Joanne Karen Wuensch>: As my follow-up, there has been a lot of questions already on M&A. We throw
around a lot of different names amongst ourselves. But what is your current thinking about adding another leg to the
stool or is it really just adding-in things to your current structure? Thank you.
<A - José E. Almeida>: We will continue to look at adjacencies. You got to be able to walk before we go into the
triathlon here. So, a white space and a brand new leg to the stool becomes a high order for a company that has not done
many M&As and the areas that they did were always an adjacency. So, we're going to look into adjacencies we have
not looked in past. However, to have a completely new leg of the stool, I think is a little premature for us to speak
about.
<Q - Joanne Karen Wuensch>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Larry Keusch with Raymond James. Your line is now open.
<Q - Lawrence Keusch>: Yeah. Hi. Good morning. So, Joe, for the year, on a constant currency basis, looks like you
did 6% growth in the U.S. and about 3% overseas. So, I wanted to just pick your brain a little bit on how you think
about accelerating the overseas growth because I think it's probably a bit below what you're anticipating in your LRP
and just wanted to see if you could expand upon that a little bit.
<A - José E. Almeida>: Larry, a couple of things. The overseas will be impacted by two or three factors, let me start
by saying that once we anniversary, the exits of $137 million in sales that we are exiting in Turkey, India, and
Venezuela, for the most part you gain a good 1.4%, 1.5% or 150 basis points of incremental growth. Right on that.
Second thing is we must improve performance in Europe. We're making some changes in Europe to make sure that we
get the right people in place so we can get performance. It has been a while. And despite the fact that Europe is a slow
growth market, it's a difficult market for the most part, the developed part of Europe, not the emerging part of Europe,
which would be the Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa, which in 2017, we're expecting good growth from it.
And I want to make sure that we have the right structure in Europe. We're making changes to that effect. And also,
getting the BioSurgery out of the Baxter structure on a fully vertical organization and couple of licensing deals, I think
we can accelerate that. So, our objective for outside the U.S. is make sure that we return to a 4.5% to 5% growth rate in
the mid term.
<Q - Lawrence Keusch>: Okay. Perfect. And then the other quick question is just thinking about your pump business
specifically. How are you thinking in sort of the 2017 outlook relative to the potential for a pause in spending at the
hospital level given some of the uncertainties around ACA?
<A - José E. Almeida>: Listen. It's very uncertain right now with this whole repeal and replace. One will be actually
the replacement policy and what is going to be in place to bring coverage to people that may be out of coverage? So, I
think hospitals always take a pause at big capital items and investment and expansions. I would say that the capital
plans that we have – no, the capital products that we have, rather, are small capital investments that the hospital needs
to make. Those are pumps – they need the pumps. These are not big diagnostic machines. So, I would say that if there
is a effect and there's a cascading effect, we're probably at the tail-end of it, and we'll see a little of that, if any, into
2017.
I would say that we have performed tremendously well with our SIGMA SPECTRUM pump in the U.S. in the last two
years. Clearly, we're going to see that flattening out into 2017 because the number of accounts that we took from
competitors. But that is independent of the fact that the capital policy for hospitals based on the environment, the
political environment, and the mandates, that are coming down. So, let's separate them.
I think Baxter will have a good performance in 2017, maintaining its base and selectively expanding its base in
hospitals with more beds in the U.S. because we took a significant market share in the last two years. So, now it's to
[ph] maintain/grow (1:06:25) and make sure utilization on those pumps are done correctly.

<Q - Lawrence Keusch>: Okay. Terrific. Thank you very much, Joe.
<A - José E. Almeida>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy of Leerink Partners. Your line is now
open.
<Q - Danielle J. Antalffy>: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question, and congrats on a
great quarter. Jay, I was hoping you could give some color on some of the various top line headwinds as we head into
2017. Well, all of the headwinds and tailwinds as well. Just thinking about your underlying growth projection or
guidance for 4% is below the 5% you delivered in 2016. Just looking to get some color on the puts and takes there.
Thanks so much.
<A - James K. Saccaro>: Yes. I mean, look, 2016, we did benefit from a Fluid Systems performance that I would say
is above the long-term steady-state. In part because we had the benefit of the first quarter, it's really the first early
stages of the SIGMA SPECTRUM relaunch. And in part because of all the work we did in terms of volumes and
contracting in our Fluid Systems business. So, really the biggest driver of the deceleration, excluding the one-time
impact relates to the slowdown, expected slowdown, I should say, in our Fluid Systems business.
As we move to 2017, I think there are just a few important points, right. We've got a cyclo impact that's about $100
million. We've got a strategic exits impact that's about $100 million. And then the rest of the portfolio is kind of largely
in line with our long-term expectations. So, no radical departures, but the stabilization of the Fluid Systems business,
which will continue to grow and a little bit faster in the first half of the year, that's the biggest driver of the change of
growth rates.
<Q - Danielle J. Antalffy>: Perfect. That makes total sense. Thanks for that. And then any major tenders I guess,
specifically, in the Renal business that we should be cognizant of over the next 12 months that are coming up?
<A - James K. Saccaro>: We have nothing major at this stage from a significant tender standpoint to point out. We do
have a lot of our business that goes through tenders outside the U.S., some of them are large tenders, some of them are
small tenders, but as we sit here nothing major to point out to you that would be an area of concern for us.
<Q - Danielle J. Antalffy>: All right.
<A - José E. Almeida>: I just want to augment Jay's question quickly, we're seeing 5% to 6% increase in patients in
PD, which is a great indicator for us into 2017.
<Q - Danielle J. Antalffy>: Perfect. Thank you very much.
<A - James K. Saccaro>: Thanks, Danielle.
<A - Clare Trachtman>: Thanks, Danielle.
