Giovanni Caforio
Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. Well, 2015 was a pivotal, very important year for Bristol-Myers Squibb.
We began a new chapter of growth and laid a strong foundation for our future. This was true across the company.
Commercially we had $16.5 billion (sic) [$16.6 billion] (2:08) in sales, 4% growth over the previous year, which is
especially strong given the loss of exclusivity for Abilify early in the year.
Regarding R&D it was an extraordinary year with 112 product approvals, including 23 in major markets and 11 by the
FDA alone. In addition, we also had three Opdivo study stops for overall survival. Let me share just a few of our
highlights, and Charlie will then provide more details about our key brands.
We are very encouraged by the global performance of Eliquis. And I believe that we are well on our way to becoming
the number one NOAC globally. Global sales for 2015 were $1.8 billion, which represents more of a doubling versus
prior year.
Our hepatitis C portfolio delivered strong performance in 2015, notably in Japan, in certain European countries, and
most recently in the U.S., where we saw good performance in the fourth quarter. Overall, we had $1.6 billion in global
sales. Obviously we all know this is a very competitive and highly dynamic market. We do expect new competition to
have an impact on our business, as we are already seeing in Japan. Orencia also had a good year with almost $1.9
billion in sales, 14% increase over 2014.
Regarding immuno-oncology, it was nothing less than an incredible year. We exceeded expectations, thanks to
important clinical results, earlier than expected launches, and an unprecedented uptake in new patient share across
multiple tumor types, validating our development strategy, our belief in the importance of overall survival, and our
strong commercial capabilities. Commercially, Opdivo performance was very strong, nearly $1 billion in global sales.
In lung cancer in the U.S. we have approximately 60% of new patient share in non-squamous and around 70% in
squamous. In melanoma we are pleased to have a broad approach to this market with indications ranging from the with
the adjuvant setting with Yervoy to the metastatic setting with Opdivo. The adoption of our combination therapy, the
first of its kind, has been strong. And we have approximately 20% market share. And in renal cancer I'm pleased to
report that the uptake has been similar to what we've seen in lung with new patient shares over 50%.
With respect to R&D 2015 was an exceptional year. And in fact we are already off to a very strong start in 2016. This
morning we announced the early stop of our CheckMate 141 study in patients with head and neck cancer, our fifth
early study stop with Opdivo. We look forward to discussing the data with the regulatory authorities.
Last year three of our key trials with Opdivo were stopped early because of a survival advantage versus the previous
standard of care. And we moved quickly and effectively with regulators, receiving seven approvals from the FDA
across three tumor types. Opdivo is now approved in 46 countries.
We accomplished much in lung. In the U.S. Opdivo is the only PD-1 indicated for all second line patients across all
histologies, and importantly, regardless of PD-1 status. In the EU we have received approvals for squamous and are
awaiting regulatory review for non-squamous. And in Japan Opdivo was approved with a broad label in December. In
renal cancer Opdivo's approval came in the second half of the year, only one week after our submission was validated
by the FDA, which demonstrates the importance of the data in an area where the medical need for patients is very high.

All in all, I am very proud of our accomplishments in immuno-oncology. including our ability to establish Opdivo as
the leading immuno-oncology agent, one that is foundational and a standard of care within its approved indications.
Going forward we remain fully committed to further strengthening our position. This year we should see data from
Opdivo trials in four additional tumors and in first-line lung cancer. And start to see some data from some of our earlier
assets.
Finally, we expect three additional I-O assets to enter clinical trials, bringing the total to eight clinical assets beyond
Yervoy, Opdivo, and Empliciti. I'm confident we're making all of the right investments from a commercial perspective
and from an R&D perspective to continue to execute our strategy in immuno-oncology and further strengthen our
leadership position.
Now before turning the floor over to Charlie to provide our 2015 financials and 2016 outlook, let me say that I am very
confident and optimistic about our future here at Bristol-Myers Squibb, as we have entered a period of expected
growth.
Driven by the unprecedented success in 2015, we are in a position of strength with significant group opportunities in
I-O, where we have advanced our leadership position in Opdivo. Eliquis is well on its way to becoming the number one
novel anticoagulant. The performance of our underlying portfolio remains very strong. And we are advancing a diverse,
innovative, and promising pipeline by combining our internal R&D efforts with a continued focus on business
development, seeking to develop transformative medicines for patients in need.
And with that I'll turn the floor over to Charlie. Thank you.
Charles A. Bancroft
Thank you, Giovanni. Good morning, everyone. I will start with some comments regarding the quarter and then move
on to our 2016 guidance. As Giovanni mentioned, we had a strong fourth quarter with very good performance across
our key brands.
Total revenues were $4.3 billion, up 1% over last year. With the continued strengthening of the dollar against most
currencies foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact on sales of 5% in the quarter and approximately $0.08 on EPS.
Sales for Eliquis were $602 million, more than double from fourth quarter last year. Eliquis is now the number one
NOAC in new-to-brand patient share in cardiology across 12 markets around the world. And we continue to see strong
demand trends from key markets such as the U.S., Germany, and Japan.
Sales for our Hepatitis C portfolio were $458 million, with most of the sales coming from Daklinza. U.S. sales were
$212 million, and we are seeing strong demand since the launch in Q3. Sales in Europe were $121 million with strong
performance in Germany, France, and Italy. In Japan we had sales of $80 million, which is down significantly from Q3
sales of $175 million, as recent trends reflect the pressure from new regimens that have entered the market.
Opdivo uptake continues to be very strong with sales of $475 million for the quarter. As Giovanni mentioned we are
seeing rapid adoption in the U.S. with Q4 sales of $410 million. About two-thirds of Opdivo sales are within lung
cancer, both squamous and non-squamous We are also seeing an increase in melanoma with the approval and launch of
the Opdivo plus Yervoy regimen. Our I-O portfolio now has the leading new patient share in first-line melanoma.
Opdivo has now been approved in 46 countries. The European launch for both first- and second-line metastatic
melanoma and squamous non-small cell lung cancer is going well in the countries where pricing has been secured,
notably Germany, where we are seeing rapid uptake in both lung and melanoma.
Sales for Yervoy were $256 million (sic) [$265 million] (11:04), down 28% from last year. There are two dynamics at
play. With the U.S. approval and launch of the regimen and the adjuvant indication, we are seeing signs of stabilization
there. Outside the U.S., the launch of Opdivo and Keytruda are having an impact on Yervoy, where sales were down
40%.

We launched Empliciti in the U.S. in December. We began promotional activities with just a couple of days and are in
good position with access. While it's early, we are seeing a high level of interest, and recent trends are encouraging.
We continue to see competitive pressures on our HIV business, with sales of Reyataz and Sustiva down 14% and 23%,
respectively. Recall that we transferred our rights to Erbitux on October 1, and therefore we no longer record revenues.
In the quarter, total royalties for Erbitux in both the U.S. and Japan were approximately $60 million and were recorded
in other income.
Now I'll comment on a few line items from our non-GAAP P&L. Gross margin was 78% during the quarter. Our gross
margin varies primarily due to product mix, and benefited from the divestiture of Erbitux and strong Opdivo and hep C
sales. As you recall, we increased investments to support important growth opportunities in our portfolio, both
commercially and in R&D.
Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses, which now includes A&P, increased about 10% in the quarter due to
the increased investments in key brands, primarily Opdivo.
R&D expenses increased primarily due to investments behind I-O and Empliciti, which includes clinical trials and
expanding our medical organizations globally.
Our non-GAAP tax rate was 15.1%, which reflects a full year of the R&D tax credit, which was permanently extended
in December.
2015 was a very good year across the board. We are pleased that it marks a year of both top and bottom line growth.
We expect this momentum to continue in 2016, with revenues expected to grow about 5% and strong double-digit EPS
growth. As you saw in our release, we are setting our non-GAAP EPS guidance range at $2.30 to $2.40. This range
assumes current exchange rates.
As Giovanni mentioned, we expect strong performance in Opdivo, given the strong execution in the U.S. and launches
in more countries as we secure additional approvals, with associated pricing and reimbursement. Eliquis is also an
important growth driver, and we are seeing strong exit trends that we believe will continue.
Our hep C portfolio will continue to be a meaningful contributor to revenues. Though new regimens are already having
an impact in Japan, we expect a similar situation in the U.S. later this year.
As a reminder, there are several factors to keep in mind which will have an impact on our 2016 revenues. As I
mentioned, we are seeing stabilization of our Yervoy business in the U.S., but ex-U.S. we are seeing pressure,
particularly in the EU. And that will expand as PD-1s launch globally. Recall that the regiment and adjuvant indication
are not yet approved outside the U.S., which accounts for approximately 50% of Yervoy sales. So we do expect to
continue to see the impact of PD-1s there.
The HIV franchise remains under competitive pressure. Our mature products are a naturally declining business. In
addition, the expiration of certain relationships with third-party supply agreements, and the divestitures of Ixempra and
some international products last year, further impact this category. As previously mentioned, we no longer record
revenues for Erbitux. We will record royalties on Erbitux sales in other income.
As you all know, the U.S. dollar has strengthened against almost all currencies from 2015 average rates. Based on
current FX rates, this is expected to negatively impact our 2016 revenues by approximately 2% and $0.10 to $0.12 on
earnings per share, which is factored into our guidance.
To summarize our 2016 sales outlook, we are very pleased that our key brands that are important to our future growth
are performing very well. Our underlying revenue growth, excluding the impact of Erbitux, Abilify exclusivity, and
FX, is in the low teens.
Our gross margin continues to be largely driven by product mix. For 2016, the loss of rights to Abilify and the structure
of our co-promotion agreement for Eliquis will put downward pressure on gross margin. Partially offsetting that will be
the growth in sales of new products such as Opdivo and the divestiture of Erbitux. Additionally, FX favorability that

we saw on international cost of goods in 2015 is not expected to incur in 2016.
Our operating expense projections for 2016 reflect investments that we began in the second half of last year that are
continuing, particularly in R&D, which includes additional clinical trial investments, increased medical resources, and
phase 4 studies. We will however continue to be prudent with commercial resources on our older brands and leverage
our specialty model. As Giovanni described, 2015 was an exceptional year, which provides great momentum as we
enter 2016.
Now we'd be happy to address your questions.
John E. Elicker
Thank you, Giovanni and Charlie. Sean, I think we're ready to go to the Q&A session. And just as a reminder, in
addition to Giovanni and Charlie, Francis and Murdo are here to answer any questions you might have.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse. Your line is now
open.
<Q - Vamil K. Divan>: Great. Thanks so much for taking the questions and the comments. So I want to apologize, I
missed some of this. But just a little more color on Opdivo and kind of the trends you're seeing there. Obviously, you
had the entry of Merck into the lung cancer space, kind of the beginning of the quarter, the holidays, near the end of the
quarter. If you could just give a sense of what you saw over the course of the quarter? Maybe even a little sense of how
things are going so far this year, just so we can get a little better sense of the ongoing run rate and how we should look
at forecasting that product going forward?
And then maybe the second one more for Murdo around, we saw the positive data on the head and neck side. Could
you just give a little bit more color on how you see the commercial opportunity for that potential indication relative to
lung, where I think a lot of the focus has been so far? How do you see this one stacking up? And the importance within
the overall portfolio? Thanks.
<A - Giovanni Caforio>: Vamil, thank you. Let me just start. This is Giovanni, and then I'll ask Murdo to give you
some more color on performance and answer your question on head and neck.
We're very pleased with the performance of Opdivo in 2015 and particularly the acceleration we've seen in Q4. That's
clearly driven by the breadth of our label in lung cancer across all histologies, regardless of PD-1 status. It's driven by
the high unmet medical need in renal. And again the strength of our overall survival data. And a very solid uptake of
the regimen in melanoma, given the efficacy profile. We have approximately 80% value share of the PD-1 market and
very strong commercial execution. Murdo?
<A - Murdo Gordon>: Yes, thanks, Vamil. I would add a couple things to Giovanni's comments. Specifically in the
lung area, we have been very pleased. As you know we saw rapid uptake in squamous after availability of the 017 data
and subsequent approval. And we've seen similar uptake now in non-squamous, where we're about 60% new patient
share in second line.
That profile is a very competitive profile for Opdivo. We have two strong indications with overall survival benefit. And
continue to see very strong receptivity from oncologists, because of the lack of a requirement to test for PD-L1 status in
lung.
Now with the release of other data from our competitors, namely the 010 study, we continue to feel that that
competitiveness in second line will continue. Given the fact that we've been able to establish superiority in squamous

and non-squamous separately in all-comer populations and have a resulting indication for both histologies that reflects
that, we feel really good. We haven't really seen a deterioration in our new-to-patient share with the advent of the 010
data set.
I think you also asked about head and neck. We see the opportunity in head and neck as really exciting. Obviously
when we see the actual full data set, we'll know more about what to expect. But what I would say is this is a high,
unmet medical need area. And it's one where Opdivo in second line could represent a significant opportunity. That
being said it is a smaller tumor type. It's between – in second line it's between 5,000 and 10,000 treatable patients in the
U.S., a little higher than that in Europe.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Thanks, Vamil, for the questions. Sean, can we go to the next one, please?
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Marc Goodman from UBS. Your line is now open.
<Q - Ami Fadia>: This is Ami Fadia on behalf of Marc. I have two questions. Number one, on Opdivo you gave us a
sense of some of the latest market share. Could you remind us what time period that was measured for? And how do
you see those market shares across the different indications play out in 2016?
Also then also sort of a second part of the Opdivo question is we've seen good strength in the U.S. In 2016 where do
you see progress coming from outside the U.S.? Where do we have pricing already? What do we expect to change over
the next few months? And then I have a second question.
<A - Giovanni Caforio>: Thank you. Let me just start answering the first part of your question and ask Murdo to
provide more detail. As both I and Murdo mentioned in our remarks, and the answer to the first question, there's really
[ph] traffic (21:45) penetration across all of the indications where we have a label to do histologies in lung, renal, and
melanoma.
The two most recent approvals where there is more dynamic growth in the fourth quarter really were the uptake of the
regimen in melanoma and renal. And we are very encouraged by both trends. Those trends will continue into 2016.
We also see that in 2016 we will begin to see uptake in other European countries. The only country where we really
have an uptake to date is Germany. And those are curves are similar to the U.S. But we are making progress with
negotiating pricing and reimbursement in many other countries around the world, namely in Europe. And we will begin
to see the impact of our international business later in the year.
<A - Murdo Gordon>: Yeah. Thank you, Giovanni. The profile as I mentioned in lung for Opdivo in both squamous
and non-squamous has shown to be very competitive in second line. And we're seeing strong shares. We expect that
that will continue.
In melanoma the Yervoy plus Opdivo regimen is getting about 20% of new patients in first line. It's early days, and we
have a newly expanded label to include all patients regardless of BRAF status. And so we hope that that will continue
to evolve in the U.S.
Now I'll go back to comments that Charlie made. Ex-U.S. for Yervoy specifically, where we don't have a regimen
indication nor do we have an adjuvant indication, we would expect to see Yervoy continue to feel the pressure of the
advent of first line new patient share of Opdivo and Keytruda across Europe. So expect Yervoy to have some pressure
going forward ex-U.S.
When it comes to renal cell carcinoma, the most recent approval for Opdivo, we're very happy and are seeing rapid
uptake like we saw in melanoma and in lung, where we see roughly a 50% new patient share. Now these percentages
move around. They're from very small data sets. We use them as directional. And we use them to estimate how rapidly
behavior is changing in the market.

Ex-U.S. we're very happy with reimbursement evolution. And we are seeing reimbursement authorities across Europe
move quickly with us to find appropriate reimbursement for patients across Europe. And we feel very good with the
broad label that we have in Europe that includes both first line melanoma for Opdivo and squamous non-small cell lung
cancer. We feel very good about our ability to negotiate good access for European patients.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Great. Sean, can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you. And congratulations on a terrific year. Charlie, I have a question for you on guidance.
I'm a little bit confused about something. So you ended 2015 with 77% gross margins. And the guidance for 2016 is for
gross margins between 75% and 76%. I'm assuming that you are just being conservative, since this is the beginning of
the year. And it probably proves or pays to be conservative at this early part of the year.
But help me to understand. While I understand that Eliquis will get bigger and that puts pressure on your gross margin,
the other line items of your business are growing. And when I think about the contribution of Opdivo and the expected
growth of Opdivo in 2016 relative to the expected growth of Eliquis, I would think that mix should be in your favor.
You also mentioned that Erbitux would be in your favor too. So if you could just explain why 75%, 76% versus ending
the year at 77%?
And then if you could also just address with respect to guidance, the guidance doesn't seem to imply much in the way
of margin expansion. You had made some comments about that a couple quarters ago. But where are we in terms of
when we should expect to see meaningful margin expansion to play out? Thanks very much.
<A - Charles A. Bancroft>: Okay. Thank you, Jami. Our gross margin as you point out has to do a lot with mix. And I
talked about the different products coming in and out. So Abilify going away. HIV, pressure there. You're right.
Opdivo is going to be a big year in 2016. Eliquis though does put a drag on that. I would say net-net, a lot of our mix
almost nets off.
But the bigger impact as I mentioned in my comments is related to FX on international cost of goods sold. If you recall
at the end of 2014, FX rates started deteriorating. And the benefit that we got as that flowed through our international
cost of goods in 2015 doesn't repeat again, given the rates are – don't have that larger dichotomy year over year. So
that's almost a 2% impact and also includes some hedging gain that flow through costs of goods sold again in 2015 [ph]
that don't repeat in 2016 (26:48).
In regard to operating margin the way we're defining it, and most of all of you analysts define it, is our operating
income over sales. So that's how we're looking at it, and that's how we can talk about it going forward. We've addressed
this and said that we expect leverage mostly beginning in 2017. As I look at how we finished 2015 at about 23.4%, we
don't expect any decline in 2016. It should be flat or slightly above that as we look at 2016.
<A - Giovanni Caforio>: And, Jami, this is Giovanni. Just to reiterate what Charlie just said. As you've seen in our
guidance, we have initiated a number of really important strategic investments commercially in R&D in 2015. Those
are continuing at roughly the same level in 2016. And just to confirm what Charlie said and we've said before, we are
committed to increased profitability beginning in 2017.

<Q - Andrew S. Baum>: Hi, thank you. Two questions please. Firstly, in regard to CheckMate 026, your first line
Opdivo trial versus chemo. The primary point is progression free survival. Obviously the initial experience with PFS
was checkered because of pseudo-progression. Could you outline the measures you have taken to minimize the risk to
using the PFS endpoint within this trial? Obviously I understand it's first line and therefore you need to use it. But how
you managed to de-risk some of the initial observations?
Second, a strategic question for Giovanni. Your portfolio and approach is very heavily focused on novel checkpoints
and biospecifics and on. But obviously there are alternate asset classes within the I-O space, where you're less active
than some of your peers.
So how are you thinking about either broadening out – and I guess I'm thinking of cancer vaccines or cell therapies, and
there are of course others – versus reducing the risk profile of the organization, because of the short cycle times in
immuno-oncology, by bolting on an additional asset class outside oncology, especially given the rating of the sector
and the availability of finding interesting assets to acquire?
<A - Giovanni Caforio>: So let me ask Francis to start and address your questions, Andrew, on 6 – 026. And then I'll
make some comments on your second question.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Well, good morning, Andrew. Let me first of all say, I'm really proud of R&D's performance
in 2015. And I'm actually thrilled that we've showed survival benefits in the second line lung setting in a patient
population of platinum resistance that frankly, have no options.
As far as – forgive my laryngitis. As far as 026 is concerned, we've actually taken great care in the design of this study.
We've paid real attention to the choice of endpoint, the optimal timing of the analysis, the role of the non-proportional
hazard ratio, and of course the role of PD-L1 expression and the sample size. And we've used a wealth of data, both
published and our internal data on Opdivo, to help guide us.
So we believe we really have got the optimum balance of speed and the design to deliver positive results in the widest
population of first line lung patients, as we've done in other studies of Opdivo recently. Thank you.
<A - Giovanni Caforio>: And, Andrew, just a quick answer to your question on immuno-oncology breadth, and then
diversification more broadly.
Let me say first, with respect to immuno-oncology, I feel very confident that we have a broad approach to
immuno-oncology for the short term, the medium term, and the long term. And when you think about our central pillar
today, obviously it is checkpoint inhibition. We have two assets in the market. And really exciting data with the
combination of Opdivo and Yervoy, which we are taking into more tumors.
We have an exciting pipeline of eight agents, early agents in the clinic. And we've actually strengthened that approach
recently, last year in 2015, through a number of business development activities. We built what I think is an attractive
early pipeline addressing the tumor microenvironment, which is a new area for us. So we have a lot to do with
continuing to advance our existing portfolio combinations and early assets.
Obviously, as the leaders in the field, we always look at new platforms and technologies. And as they become better
established, and we're interested in that data, we are very much open to making moves in that area.
Let me also say though that, beyond immuno-oncology, we actually are continuing to work to build differentiated
pipelines in other areas. And we made, again, progress in fibrosis in 2015, which strengthened our CV pipeline with a
clear focus on heart failure. And continuing to progress potentially transformative assets beyond oncology in every one
of our areas.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Great. Thanks, Andrew. Sean, can we go to the next question please?

The next question comes from the line of Tim Anderson from Bernstein. Your line is now open.
<Q - Timothy Minton Anderson>: Thank you. A question that kind of deals mostly with the timing of various data
releases. So if I look at 026, your first line trial, clinicaltrials.gov says that that recently got pushed out by three – I
think three months or four months, to October.
If I look at the combo IPI NIVO data, so CheckMate 227. That looks like it slipped by eight months, from 2017 to
2018. Now at the same time, it also looked like 141 slipped. That was pushed out by three months or four months very
recently. Yet today, you stopped that trial early.
So on these other trials that I described, is it still very much in the realm of possibilities that those could read out early
on an interim? And I guess of special importance would be the first line lung, given the fact that the Merck results
might be due in a similar timeframe.
And then the second question on timing has to do with your later generation products. So in October in your earnings
call, you talked about having data on things like [ph] LAG and cure (33:45) and CD-137 late 2015 or early 2016. And
now if I understand the guidance correctly, we're really looking at late 2016. So in a matter of three months, the timing
of data disclosures have been put back by about a year. And I'm wondering if you can just articulate exactly why that's
the case?
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Good morning, Tim. So we expect to have data, as you say, towards the end of 2016 for the
026 study. And we don't expect an earlier readout. There is no interim analysis on that study. As far as 227 is
concerned, we're very happy with the progress of the trial. We're looking at the beginning of 2018 for that.
And as we move to the combinations, I think it's just worth pointing out that, when we talk about I-O combinations, we
already have a combination approved, of two approved drugs in melanoma. We've got it under review in the EU. And
we've got late stage studies in lung, renal, and several other tumors.
So as far as the exploratory programs in novel combinations, we're getting data in house now, both in monotherapy and
combination. It's possible we'll present data later in 2016. And I think depending on what we see, we could move into
larger studies by year's end or early 2017.
But I want to make this point. We have a very high hurdle for bringing new assets forward, because basically it's got to
be better than what we believe Opdivo/Yervoy is going to be, which already as far as I know is the only proven
combination to potentially show synergy. So we're very optimistic about the Yervoy regimen with Opdivo. And we will
be bringing forward data later in the year on the others. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Seamus Fernandez from Leerink. Your line is now open.
<Q - Seamus Fernandez>: Thanks very much for taking the question. So a couple of quick questions, one for Francis
and then one for Murdo.
Francis, as we kind of think about new areas for combinations, can you just help us understand where you really think
the new combinations can be most impactful? As we look at it, I think many of us focus in on the lung cancer market
quite a bit. And as I think about it, is it something like refractory lung cancer? And then perhaps more broadly
colorectal cancer? Those are sort of the big nuts that need to be cracked. How are you sort of thinking about next
opportunities for the overall I-O story at Bristol?
And then separately for Murdo, can you just help us better understand the transition that you think is going to be
necessary as you shift from a broad marketing message for patients in the second line setting to a potentially narrower
PD-L1 biomarker driven message, post a hopefully successful CheckMate 026 study. Thanks.

<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Good morning, Seamus. So our strategy is to look at our combinations through the tumor lens.
And as you mentioned, we're focusing on prioritizing those areas of the greatest unmet need, since we believe that I-O
combinations are the best way forward to drive that long-term survival for patients.
We are again looking at IPI and NIVO together in a number of trials at the moment. And then in those areas where as
you said unmet need, those rapid progresses in lung and those that relapse in lung. And certainly those tumors where
there has been modest benefit from monotherapy, we think there's a particular opportunity as new and novel
combinations come forward to perhaps meet the unmet need there.
So with our portfolios Giovanni mentioned now of eight combination – eight assets with three more to come in this
year, we think we are going to be driven by the science and the clinical data. And of course should we see good data,
we'll be moving – in these areas of unmet need we'll be moving it very quickly forward.
<A - Murdo Gordon>: And, Seamus, with regard to your question of how do we transition from a leadership position
that we will maintain and continue to grow in second line with the evolution of data sets in first line.
I would say first off we have to look at the reasons why we're being successful in second line beyond perhaps testing or
not testing. We have a very strong commercial and medical organization worldwide. We've seen very rapid uptake
across the board in the U.S. We're seeing it in Germany. We're actually seeing it in France as well. It's just not
translating into revenue recognition there, because it's in the ATU. And we have a high degree of readiness in Japan.
But really we've got clarity on our dosing. We have a strong customer-centric organization, a breadth of indications
beyond lung, and a very strong clinical development program.
One thing to keep in mind is what we are seeing in the lung market is there is a slow-moving but growing evolution of
testing, particularly in first line. So testing in second line is a difficult proposition as you know, because of ability to
read biopsy or assess tissue. But we are seeing first line testing in the range of about 60%.
And we are very, very focused on ensuring that the Opdivo biomarker PD-L1 test is available everywhere where we
market the product. So we think we'll be in really good shape for a PD-L1 selected population in first line. And I think
we'll have all the necessary commercial and medical capabilities for that period in time.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Thanks, Seamus, for the questions. Can we go to the next one please, Sean?

Your next question comes from the line of Tony Butler from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.
<Q - Charles Butler>: Yes, thanks very much. One brief question please on elotuzumab or Empliciti. Congrats on
getting that out in the marketplace. But the label as you know is quite broad in multiple myeloma. And the real question
is where today are you seeing it used most? In failures first line? Do you see the utility there? Or is it in second- or
third-line failures? That would be very helpful. And finally, John, I hope you do feel better. Thanks.
<A - Giovanni Caforio>: Tony, first let me say, as Charlie mentioned, that the early signs from the U.S. market are
encouraging. They're very early signs. As you know Empliciti is the first immuno-oncology agent to get into multiple
myeloma. It's a crowded market, but one that continues to have a really high unmet medical need. And we think that
that asset can play an important role. Let me ask Murdo to give you a little more color on where's it's being used.
Remember it's really early times.
<A - Murdo Gordon>: Yeah, that was going to be my first comment. It's really early. And it's difficult right now to do
any kind of segmentation on the initial uptake that we have. We're very pleased with the uptake in the U.S. We're
seeing nice trends. We are seeing good coverage and execution from the commercial organization and the medical
organization being able to reach all key customers.

The team that is working on the promotion and education of physicians on Empliciti has been the team that has
successfully driven Sprycel over the last few years. So this is a team that can execute very effectively. But it really is
early to tell whether we're getting true relapse refractory patients in second line or beyond. We'll continue to –
monitoring that going forward, but the early feedback, very positive.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Oh, hey, guys, I appreciate you taking my question. And if I ask a question that's
already been asked, please ignore it. I apologize. I was on and off the call, given today's carnage.
But I was wondering, you guys I believe recently started a phase 2 trial looking at Yervoy plus Opdivo in lung cancer.
That's running in parallel I believe with the registration trials. Wondering what you hope to learn from that phase 2?
And when – why do it, given that the phase 3 is already ongoing? And what you hope to learn? And when Wall Street
might expect some data release from that?
And then I'd love to ask Giovanni about capital allocation. I certainly felt like, please correct me if I'm wrong, that
you've signaled that diversifying the company – that I-O will kind of – is on auto pilot. And the company is very
focused on it. But one of your goals as a relatively new CEO was to make sure the company was well-diversified. And
you've mentioned several therapeutic areas you're interested in. You've done some smaller deals. But is this still a big
focus for you? And how is your appetite for perhaps medium-sized deals around the $10 billion mark that other
companies have cited? Thank you very much.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Good morning, Mark.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Good morning.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: So this is CheckMate 568. And so let me first of all say that we have full confidence in the
227 study as the definitive randomized study for first line non-small cell lung cancer in combination. That being said
we believe the experience from single-arm studies of combinations like this can help inform future medical practice as
part of our very expansive data generation that's going on in non-small cell lung cancer.
<A - Giovanni Caforio>: And Mark, this is Giovanni. Let me just answer your question on capital allocation,
specifically diversification. So first of all business development remains a top priority for us. I must say that while
many of our deals last year were smaller deals on early assets, they all are extremely interesting from a scientific
perspective. And actually 2015 was a year of unprecedented activity for us from a business development perspective.
First, we continue to be very active in immuno-oncology. I know you were joking when you said it's on auto pilot. But
in reality we really feel we are at the very beginning of an extraordinary story in immuno-oncology. And we continue
to be very focused, not only on delivering the value of the portfolio in the pipeline we have, but also continuing to
strengthen that. Then going back to what I said a few minutes ago, the agreements we reached in 2015 really have
strengthened immuno-oncology, particularly in the tumor microenvironment.
Second, we are focused on diversifying beyond immuno-oncology. We have signed some important agreements last
year that have strengthened our pipeline in cardiovascular medicines, where we now are combining internal and
external. We have a really attractive approach to heart failure. We are building a very differentiated early pipeline in
fibrosis. Continuing to advance interesting assets in immuno-science. And as you know we have two genetically
defined disease products in the clinic as well. So that coupled with the strengthening performance of Eliquis provides a
good platform for growth outside of oncology as well.
And with respect to your question regarding the size of the deals, as we've said in the past we are agnostic. We're really
interested in deals that make sense strategically in terms of the therapeutic area fit, that are very strong in terms of the

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
<Q - Christopher Schott>: Great. Thanks very much for the questions and congrats on the data. Two questions here.
First on Eliquis, can you just talk about the strength in the quarter? I know last quarter was impacted by the doughnut
hole. But can you just elaborate on the 4Q trends a little bit more?
And my second question was on Opdivo. Any update on duration of therapy that we've seen with patients in lung
cancer so far? I guess specifically on non-responders, are you seeing physicians discontinue therapy at time of
progression? Or are we seeing some physicians continuing to treat through progression? Thanks very much.
<A - Murdo Gordon>: Yeah. Thank you very much, Chris, for the question. It's Murdo. I'll just – I'll go through
Eliquis very quickly. But we are seeing strength in Eliquis across all major markets. Performance in Japan, U.S., and
across Europe has been very strong. As was mentioned we now lead in new-to-brand precipitations in cardiology,
which we see as a leading indicator for the entire market, across 12 markets. And we're seeing really, really strong
demand in all of the major markets in our stroke prevention atrial fibrillation indication.
And we have more recently launched the VTE treatment indication across Europe and in Japan. So we'll see hopefully
some continued acceleration of that.
You alluded to the doughnut hole effect in Q3. We did see somewhat less coverage gap impact in Q4 in the U.S., but
we did have nonetheless some of that in Q3. So we're very optimistic that we'll continue to see strong evolution in
Eliquis. And along with our Pfizer partners we feel really good about being able to drive Eliquis to become the number
one NOAC, as Giovanni mentioned earlier in the call.
With respect to your question on Opdivo and DOT, duration of therapy, in lung. Really this is a very difficult number
to get at so early after launch. It seems like longer. But we've only really been in the market in lung since March of last
year. And you really need 24 months to have a 12-month look back to get to an accurate duration of therapy. So it's still
difficult to elucidate that. So we don't have a good number for you there.
And then you also asked about, are we seeing physicians persist when there's evident progression? I wouldn't have a
good answer for you there. But we are seeing, in the case of patients who are high expressors and the status is known, I
would think that persistence there would be more likely than in low expressors.

<Q - David R. Risinger>: Yes. Thanks very much. With respect to Opdivo, I think that you mentioned that two-thirds
of the sales in the fourth quarter were in lung. Could you further break out kidney versus melanoma?
And then second, could you just discuss the Opdivo phase 2 trial readouts to watch this year in lymphomas and bladder
cancer? Could you just frame those for us? And talk about the evidence for likely success and your level of
enthusiasm? Thank you.

sales.

<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Well, good morning, David. Just to say it's a very exciting year for data this year. We've
started well with head and neck. I think the Hodgkin's lymphoma, we have the data in-house and we're in discussions
with the regulators about submission there. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, we should see later in the year. A single-arm
study there. We're expecting data in bladder. And we believe that, no matter what the [ph] Roche submission (50:28)
does, we may – assuming the data is good, we'll have an opportunity to go forward with that too possibly, depending on
the data.
<A - Murdo Gordon>: Yeah. Thank you. And the question regarding mix. I mean really, we were really only
generating significant revenue in lung and melanoma in the fourth quarter. We had about three weeks, four weeks, of
renal sales and really at the very beginning of the uptake. So it's a two-third/one-third split lung/melanoma for fourth
quarter last year. Obviously that will evolve.
We feel really good about the early penetration in renal, reaching, as I said, in the early part of this month, about a 50%
new patient penetration. So really it's – what we're seeing are very similar uptake curves across all of the solid tumors
that we've had approval in so far. And that gives us confidence about Opdivo's outlook for 2016.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Great. Thanks, Dave. Can we go to the next question please, Sean?
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Your line is now open.
<Q - Geoff Meacham>: Morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. Yet another for Opdivo and lung. Just
checking to see what type of share you guys have already in first line lung, ahead of the data this year?
And then a bigger question here. I know data dependent, but is it your view that the science really has evolved to where
I-O combinations with chemo may be as attractive as non-chemo in markets such as first line lung? And even bigger
tumor types like breast and colon? Thanks.
<A - Giovanni Caforio>: Just very briefly on first line, let me just say we have very, very little penetration in first line
at this point. As Murdo mentioned before, we are really at the beginning of a very rapid uptake, with high shares. Let
me ask Francis to answer your question with respect to combinations.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Well, just to mention the combinations, Geoff. As I said, we believe the best opportunity for
prolonged survival and responses is with I-O combinations. But we have a very comprehensive program, including
both I-O/I-O combinations and also chemotherapy combinations, both in our 227 study, in a community study, and
some exploratory studies.
I think I would say the data to date – our data at least, and we probably have the most and most prolonged data –
doesn't support broad use of chemotherapy in combination. But I think we will see what the data shows. And there's a
possibility there may be some areas where that is beneficial.
But as I said, I think our view is, what science we have would suggest that I-O/I-O combinations are going to be
perhaps the best for long-term survival.

kind of put that in context of SG&A coming down?
And also, the increase in your R&D spending, I'm just wondering to what extent is this indicative of increased concerns
about competitive threats to your I-O franchise? Or is it a function of new opportunities that have become available to
you? Thank you.
<A - Giovanni Caforio>: Alex, this is Giovanni. So first of all, let me say we stepped up our commercial investments
behind the key growth brands last year, Opdivo and Eliquis you mentioned. And we are very committed to continue to
invest competitively going forward, including 2016.
Obviously we continue to look at our mature portfolio and the evolution of our portfolio overall. And we have been and
will continue to be very disciplined in allocating all of our resources to the growth portfolio we have. So I just want to
make sure that we continue to be very clear that Opdivo, Eliquis, and all of our growth opportunities continue to be
competitively resourced and supported in terms of their growth.
With respect to R&D, actually our increased investment come from our confidence in our R&D strategy and the
increased leadership position that we have gained in [ph] 2000 (55:16), which makes us really confident, given the
number of successes we have to continue to broaden our development footprint.
And when you look at the R&D spend, a lot is about development. But we are also continuing to resource a very
competitive medical organization and data generation activities across the board in support of many launches we have
ahead of us in 2016.

Your final question comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Thanks. A couple questions on Opdivo that are a bit different. Is your net pricing across global
regions holding steady, as was your original intent? And if not, can you perhaps quantify some of the differences?
And then secondly in the U.S., curious about your DTC campaign on Opdivo. I would have thought that the speed of
uptake for these I-O agents and the market share dynamics would not really be affected by patient awareness that can
be dealt with via DTC. But maybe you could share your thoughts on the philosophy of DTC for this area? Thanks.
<A - Giovanni Caforio>: Gregg, let me start with your second question about DTC and patient awareness. We made a
conscious decision and an important decision to invest in DTC advertising for lung cancer, because we feel there is a
long history of treatments that have not delivered significant value to patients with lung cancer. There is pessimism for
many patients. And the number of patients, particularly in the second line setting that are not being treated as
aggressively as they should be treated. So as for the first time we've been able to offer a really meaningful opportunity
through Opdivo to patients, pretreated patients with lung cancer, we felt it was important to invest in a campaign. And
in many ways mobilize patients to seek treatment now that an option is available. Charlie or Murdo, on pricing?
<A - Murdo Gordon>: Yes, Gregg, on net pricing around the globe, we're as I mentioned before really pleased with
the recognition of the value that Opdivo represents and have been pleased with our discussions with reimbursement
authorities. There have been positive assessments in France and in Germany for Opdivo. We're making good progress
in the U.K. So we feel good about how net price will hold up ex-U.S.
Giovanni Caforio
Thanks, everyone. Thanks for the question. Let me just conclude by saying again that 2015 was a very important year
