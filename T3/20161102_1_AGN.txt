MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is LaShonda, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to
welcome everyone to the third quarter earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn
today's call over to Lisa DeFrancesco to begin. Please go ahead.
Lisa M. DeFrancesco
Thank you, LaShonda, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to the Allergan third quarter 2016
earnings conference call. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release reporting Allergan earnings from continuing
operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. The press release and our slide deck, which we are presenting this
morning, are available on our corporate website at www.allergan.com. We're conducting a live webcast of this call, a
replay of which will be available on our website after the conclusion. Please note that today's call is copyrighted
material of Allergan and cannot be rebroadcast without company's express written consent.
Turning to slide 2, I'd also like to remind you, during the course of this call, management will make projections or other
forward-looking remarks regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. It's important to
note that such statements and events are forward-looking statements and reflect our current perspective of the business
trends and information as of today's date. Actual results may differ from current expectations and projections
depending on a number of factors affecting the Allergan business. These factors are detailed in our periodic public
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Allergan disclaims any intent or obligation to update these
forward-looking statements except as expressly required by law.
Turning to slide 3 in our agenda this morning, with us on today's call are Brent Saunders, our Chairman, CEO, and
President, who will provide an overview of our third quarter business highlights; Bill Meury, our Chief Commercial
Officer, will provide an overview of our commercial performance in the quarter; David Nicholson, our Chief R&D

Officer, will provide highlights from our pipeline achievements in 2016 and upcoming milestones; and Tessa Hilado,
our Chief Financial Officer, will discuss the Allergan third quarter continuing operations results in more detail. Also on
the call and available during the Q&A are Rob Stuart, our Chief Operating Officer, and Bob Bailey, our Chief Legal
Officer.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brent.
Brenton L. Saunders
Great. Thank you, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. At Allergan, we continue to take bold actions as we move
forward with our Growth Pharma agenda. We continue to drive top-tier revenue growth and top-tier profitability. We
are also making strategic Open Science investments to build even greater depth, breadth, and capabilities in our R&D
pipeline. In the third quarter, we added shareholder-friendly capital allocation to our story, with a $5 billion share
buyback that we completed ahead of schedule. And today we are announcing a new board-approved action to increase
return for shareholders and take our capital allocation plans to a new level.
In addition to doing the things that make Allergan strong financially, we're also taking bold actions in these turbulent
times, when the price of healthcare is in the spotlight. A good example is our Social Contract with Patients. We are
leading the way with responsible pricing ideals for our branded therapeutic products, and we are leading the
conversation to codify what our social contract means to us. It means balancing investment and innovation with pricing
and access, as well as quality and education. The Social Contract is Allergan's commitment to the people who count on
us to find new treatments for their most pressing medical needs, and it is good for Allergan. So why are we able to be
so bold and adopt a Social Contract? Because it is the right thing to do, and because we have such strong confidence
that our business and our R&D pipeline will sustain our future growth.
Turning to slide 6, the two major actions we announced today demonstrate our deep-seated conviction in the future
revenue growth, as well as strong cash flows, from our business. Over the last quarter, we have spent a lot of time
looking at various opportunities to deploy our reloaded balance sheet to increase shareholder return, and our board of
directors has acted. The actions we are taking today illustrate that we are focused on increasing shareholder return.
First, we are beefing up our share repurchase program to a total of $15 billion. Second, we are initiating a
$0.70-per-share quarterly dividend for the very first time.
Let me start with the enhanced share repurchase program. Since the Teva close, we've been aggressively buying our
stock in the open market and have already repurchased $5 billion of our own stock. While we believe that our stock
should be trading significantly higher than it is today, the current market conditions create an opportunity to repurchase
significantly more stock. There is no more accretive asset on our radar than our own stock. So our board of directors
has authorized an additional $5 billion repurchase. This brings our total share repurchase authorization to $15 billion.
Now we are moving quickly to purchase the remaining $10 billion through an accelerated share repurchase program, or
ASR, which allows us for significant upfront share count reduction.
Next, the dividend. For the first time, our board has approved a cash dividend to return cash flow to shareholders on an
ongoing basis. The initiation of a dividend is consistent with our Growth Pharma profile, the free cash flow that our
business generates, and our desire to increase shareholder return. This dividend will be funded from our ongoing cash
flow without dipping into the proceeds from our Teva transaction. And we expect it to grow annually while
maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings. And we retain the vast majority of our firepower and flexibility to
continue to invest in our business, acquire additional stepping-stone assets, and provide fuel for sustainable top line
growth. Our capital allocation actions are intended to balance shareholder return with the investment for future growth.
Turning to our operating performance on slide 7 and our report card on how we did this quarter. Obviously, we are
disappointed that our results this quarter did not meet our expectations, and therefore we are revising our 2016 full-year
guidance. However, we believe that we are incredibly well-positioned for 2017 and beyond. So let's look at the health
of our company. In my view, there are five key measures to gauge the health and growth prospects of any
biopharmaceutical company. First, how are the promoted products doing? Second, how are the new product launches

going? Third, how are the established products faring near the end of their patent lives when they're no longer being
promoted? Fourth, how is the pipeline progressing? And, finally, how is the company performing against key
profitability metrics?
Allergan continues to generate sales growth that is at the top end of our peer group. Sales were $3.6 billion, up more
than 7%, excluding Namenda IR, divestitures, FX, and other adjustments. Our key promoted products are growing
nicely, most of them double-digit. Our new product launches are performing exceptionally well. I'm absolutely thrilled
with how we are doing with our key brands and future growth drivers. Our pipeline is on a roll, and our profitability
metrics are in the top tier of our peer group. Where we missed the mark was among a few of our established brands and
non-promoted products. All in all, the report card for growth looks good this quarter, setting us up for growth in 2017
and beyond.
Even with the weakness in our established and non-promoted products, we retain a top-tier profitability profile with a
gross margin of 87.8% and an operating margin of 49.3%. These metrics were a little lighter this quarter, partly due to
investments we are making in manufacturing to support continued strong growth of Botox and our Eye Care products
and continued promotional investment behind our brands, and increased R&D investment versus last year. Our
non-GAAP EPS was $3.32. I am confident that our team has made the right investments in our business and has laid a
strong foundation for top-tier growth and profitability.
You can see on slide 8 that the majority of our top-level products are growing, and along with the new launches they
represent 73% of our total revenue. Many of them are growing double-digit rates, including Botox, up 15%; Restasis,
up 13%; Linzess up 42%, our filler line up 21%; Lo Loestrin up 16%; Ozurdex up 25%. I'm also proud to see new
product launches contributing more than $90 million this quarter. This is a top-tier growth story.
On the established and non-promoted products, we had more erosion than expected on Namenda XR and our
mesalamine-containing products, which are facing in-class competition from generic drugs and have had some
formulary disruption. Our future is not driven by these established products. Our future is built on our growth products,
which is why I am so confident in it. Overall, our business is very healthy, and it's a very good picture to have so many
products growing so strongly.
Before handing off to Bill, I'd like to mention the progress we're making in R&D to build and deliver our pipeline. The
team is doing an exceptional job. Our R&D productivity is strong. Already this year we've had 19 major pharma and
device product approvals and 11 major submissions. We've also reached some key milestones, such as the approval of
our multidose Restasis and a positive relamorelin Phase 2b results that were announced just last week. Relamorelin was
one of our early Open Science deals. We used an option agreement to gain access to this promising treatment for
gastroparesis. Now that relamorelin has demonstrated broad efficacy and tolerability in a Phase 2b trial, we have
exercised our option to acquire Motus and plan to take relamorelin into Phase 3 trials within Allergan.
We have also completed six new stepping-stone deals this quarter, which are helping to build even greater pipeline
depth and breadth in our therapeutic areas. In addition to pipeline-building acquisition, we are also very interested in
accretive acquisitions. While we continue to look for these accretive acquisitions, the most accretive acquisition for us
today is in our own stock.
Now let me turn the call over to Bill Meury, our Chief Commercial Officer.
William J. Meury
Thanks, Brent. Good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 11, our core business was strong in the third quarter. Sales in
all seven therapeutic areas increased versus prior year. Five of the seven therapeutic areas grew at a high-single or
double-digit rate. And, as Brent mentioned, the majority of our revenue is made up of top products and new launches
that all together are growing at a double-digit rate. This is a high-quality business and the foundation for 2017.
Eye Care sales increased by 10%, powered by Restasis, which showed durability in the third quarter with a sales
increase of 13% versus prior year, and Ozurdex, which was up 19% in the United States and 29% internationally. And

we look forward to the launch of two new dry-eye products over the next six months.
In CNS, sales increased by 3%. Botox therapeutic sales increased 16% globally versus the prior year, coupled with
continued strong performance by Vraylar. Offsetting the growth in these products was a reduction in Namenda XR
sales, driven by lower demand and a higher discount rate to maintain broad formulary coverage. We're seeing an early
and strong market response to the new indication for Namzaric.
In Aesthetics, sales increased by 14%, driven by Botox and fillers. Demand for Kybella is projected to increase
significantly in the next two quarters as our DTC campaign reaches more and more consumers. Overall, demand for our
Aesthetic product line in the United States and internationally, among dermatologists and plastic surgeons and across
age demographics, is very strong. And we're as optimistic about this part of the business as we've ever been.
In GI, sales increased by 9%. Linzess, our flagship and fastest-growing product, continues to produce strong results, up
42% year over year. And Viberzi demand has been exceptional. Mesalamine's revenue declined overall due to lower
promotion, loss of formulary coverage, and the loss of exclusivity for Asacol HD. And, finally, we continue to see
strong growth in our Women's Health franchise, with sales up 15%, as well as nice performance from Urology.
Let's dig into some of our products. On slide 12, you see our flagship IBS products, Linzess and Viberzi. Demand for
both products is very strong across the board and regardless of metric. Both products are attracting new users each
week. Both products are being used in a broad range of patients. Both products are taking share from the OTC market.
Both have excellent formulary coverage. And both are being supported by significant promotional programs. The
outlook for Linzess and Viberzi is excellent. Sales for Linzess are up 42% versus prior year. And approximately 73%
of new business for Linzess is coming from the OTC market, which is exactly what we want. And we're preparing to
launch the Linzess 72 mcg product, which is designed to accelerate conversion of the OTC market. Based on sales,
Viberzi is trending at approximately 90% of Linzess during the same time period post-launch. Demand for this product
is robust, and with IMS prescription levels having reached an all-time high last week, we are very optimistic about the
future.
Turning to slide 13. Our Medical Aesthetics business accounts for approximately 20% of total sales and includes three
key products: Botox, fillers, and Kybella. This is a high-quality, double-digit growth cash business and an expanding
market, both domestically and internationally. The fundamentals here are the following: Allergan has product line
depth which no other company can match and which creates cross-selling opportunities. In other words, one product
builds on the next. Botox is a gateway for the fillers, and Kybella is a gateway to Botox. Allergan has a steady stream
of new, innovative product launches on the way. We invest more in education and training than any other company in
the space, and we have market share leadership in a category that could double in size in the next five-plus years.
There are four major trends driving Aesthetics' market expansion. First, more physicians are moving into aesthetics
worldwide. Next, we are training more injectors. Third, there's a youth movement; attitudes towards aesthetic
procedures are changing across the world. That is especially true in the 20- to 30-year-old age segment. And, finally,
there's a male movement. With the launch of Kybella, we are seeing more interest by men in aesthetic procedures, and
we expect this trend to accelerate over time.
Now, I often get asked about the durability of Botox and future sales growth, which is an important topic. What you
can see on slide 14 is this: As successful as we've been with Botox, as popular and widely used as Botox is, we've only
scratched the surface of our three primary growth indications: aesthetics, migraine, and overactive bladder. Utilization
by the eligible patient population in each area is still low, ranging from 3% to 7%. If these numbers were in the 15% to
20% range, one might anticipate growth moderation, but they're not. We believe we will sustain high growth rates for
Botox for at least several more years, and that is why we continue to invest in sales and marketing, manufacturing, and
research and development, and why we are confident in the future.
Turning to slide 15, with Vraylar, we're about 33 weeks into the launch, and prescription levels are increasing week
over week at faster than the market. The product is clearly distinguished by its pharmacology, symptom relief, and
metabolic profile for both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Vraylar's trajectory is strong, and the future of Vraylar is
promising.

With Namzaric, we're relaunching on all fronts, with the sales force engaged in a DTC campaign ready to go in less
than two weeks. We are already seeing a significant increase in sales in both the retail and long-term care settings. This
is the first time we have an option for transitioning patients from monotherapy Aricept to Namzaric, and we're
capitalizing on that opportunity with a starter kit that early on is getting a great deal of traction. So the differences here,
as compared to several months ago, are the indication for Namzaric is complete, the availability of starter kits is
plentiful, and formulary coverage is widespread. I think this franchise demonstrates the nimbleness and power of our
commercial capabilities as we move from one innovation to the next.
Turning to slide 16. No company has more to offer in the Eye Care space than Allergan. Overall, the dry-eye market
has expanded significantly since the launch of a second treatment option. At the same time, volume and sales for
Restasis have been durable. Sales for Restasis were up 13% versus prior year. This growth was supported by strong
unit demand in both ophthalmology and optometry. The growth in the overall market is being fueled primarily by new
patients who are on OTC tear products or receiving no treatment at all. New investments and innovations for dry eye
will continue to drive the market and our business. We recently received FDA approval for Restasis Multidose, which
will launch in the fourth quarter. And then True Tear, which is a nasal neurostimulator that we are planning for a staged
launch beginning in 2017. True Tear is a non-drop treatment for dry eye. I just returned from the AAO meeting, and
this is getting a great deal of interest from the Eye Care community.
Turning to slide 17 and our international business. Sales in our international business totaled nearly $700 million in the
third quarter. Every single region grew in the high-single or double-digit rate. Western Europe is our largest region, and
we expect Asia-Pacific will be our leading international growth contributor, with China the fastest growing aesthetics
market in the world. NESEE – North, East, and Southeast Europe – is our fastest growing region, up 26% this quarter,
excluding FX. Medical Aesthetics and Eye Care anchor our business internationally. Sales for Botox Cosmetic and our
filler line were up 18% and 25%, excluding FX respectively. We've launched Belkyra, Kybella in the United States, in
Europe and plan to have it in 10 countries by the end of the year.
In terms of Eye Care, glaucoma is our largest product line, and retina is the fastest growing. In glaucoma, we're
launching a multidose, preservative-free formulation of Ganfort. And we have our Xen gel stent, which is a minimally
invasive procedure to lower IOP. Xen launched in 10 international markets already this year, and we look forward to its
potential approval and launch in 2017 in the United States. In retina, Ozurdex has a very strong following in Western
Europe, and in 2017, we will expand geographically with launches in Brazil and Australia.
GI product launches are also underway in our international markets, with Constella, Linzess in the United States,
launched in key countries, and Truberzi, Viberzi in the United States, planned for 2017.
Beyond the results of the quarter, we're excited about the upcoming new product launches. in Eye Care, we're focused
on the launch of Restasis Multidose, Xen, and True Tear. And in medical dermatology, oxymetazoline, now called
Rofade. In the GI space, we're launching a lower dose of Linzess, or Linzess 72 mcg, as I mentioned. In cardiology,
we've recently launched Byvalson, which is a combination of Bystolic and Valsartan. In infectious disease, we will see
Avycaz return to full supply before year-end and with full indications for UTI and intra-abdominal infections.
We expect formulary coverage to continue to be strong in 2017. We will continue to invest in and leverage our
platform of capabilities, which include physician and consumer e-commerce programs, DTC, and a well-trained and
customized sales force. Allergan has share-of-voice leadership in nearly every market, is number two in the industry in
direct-to-consumer spending, and has one of the most productive sales forces in the industry. And that is why I believe
the fundamentals of our business are healthy and our growth outlook is excellent.
With that, I'll turn the call over to David.
C. David Nicholson
Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 20. Before I discuss our R&D productivity, a few remarks on
our Open Science model. Open Science is an R&D philosophy focused on two key elements. The first, building the

pipeline, defines our approach to identifying, acquiring, and developing the best game-changing ideas and innovation.
We are agnostic where innovation comes from: academic research centers, venture-backed startup companies,
R&D-based public companies, or our own research centers. This maximizes our ability to deliver true innovation to the
healthcare system, and most importantly, to the patients who need breakthrough medicine to treat their unmet needs.
The second and very important element of Open Science is our ability and success in delivering the pipeline. Once we
complete an acquisition or in-license a product, our teams advance development, prepare for regulatory approval, and
drive life-cycle innovation for innovative products that helps patients. We do this whilst remaining a true partner with
our external collaborators. As Brent mentioned, we have achieved 19 total major pharma and device global approvals
and 11 major regulatory submissions so far this year. These outstanding results have been delivered by a team of more
than 2,000 dedicated scientists, R&D professionals who are delivering important new treatments for patients. This team
will be the fuel that delivers more products from our pipeline of 70 mid- to late-stage programs.
Turning to slide 21, we are adding differentiated compounds and programs across our key therapeutic areas. We've
added six stepping-stone acquisitions since the second quarter. These are channelrhodopsin-2, a novel, innovative gene
therapy for the treatment of retinitis pigmentosa, a leading cause of blindness. Second, a periocular ring designed for
extended drug delivery to the eye. The first product reduces elevated intraocular pressure in glaucoma patients. Third,
ROR gamma t inhibitors and LXR beta agonists, highly differentiated compounds for the treatment of psoriasis and
atopic dermatitis. Fourth and fifth, Cenicriviroc or CVC, Evogliptin, and our FXR agonist. These establish a portfolio
of differentiated NASH compounds that could provide combination therapy for this multifactorial disease. Finally, a
monoclonal antibody selectively targeting IL-23 for the treatment of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and potentially
other autoimmune disorders.
Turning to slide 22. We have made significant progress in advancing major programs. In Eye Care, last week we
announced FDA approval of the Restasis Multidose, a preservative-free multidose bottle of Restasis. Bill has already
discussed the launch of this new product for patients suffering from dry-eye disease. In CNS, and as we previously
promised, we have now initiated our Phase 3 program for ubrogepant for the acute treatment of migraine, and we have
initiated our Phase 2b program for atogepant in migraine prophylaxis.
As we have also previously promised, we have started a Phase 3 study for rapastinel in major depressive disorder. We
expect to have top line results for the short-term studies in early 2019. But, remember, we need to complete the
maintenance study before we can file. As a reminder, we are also developing apimostinel and an earlier small-molecule
compound as next-generation oral NMDA receptor modulators for the treatment of MDD. Internationally, we received
a positive opinion from the EU for Truberzi in GI disorders, and we expect to launch that product in international
markets in 2017. In Urology, the FDA's Bone, Reproductive and Urologic Drugs Advisory Committee voted recently in
favor of approval for SER120 for the treatment of nocturia. We look forward to working with the agency on the
approval of this product.
Looking ahead, we have a number of near-term pipeline deliverables. In CNS, many of you have asked me about our
plans regarding cariprazine and the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. After discussions with the FDA, we plan to
file an sNDA for cariprazine for this disorder in the first half of 2017. We also expect to announce Phase 2 top line
results for Botox in depression in the second half of next year. Regarding Semprana, our inhalable dihydroergotamine
treatment for acute migraine, we have resolved the issues raised by the FDA during their previous review and continue
to work on scale-up in manufacturability, which may result in submission in the second half of 2017.
Turning to medical dermatology. We will shortly initiate later Phase 2 studies with our lead ROR gamma t inhibitor in
psoriasis. Also, we will complete Phase 3 trials for sarecycline, a potential treatment for acne, in early 2017. We've
recently received data from an early development study with our LXR beta agonist. In this study, target engagement
was not satisfactorily achieved, so we need to re-evaluate the concentration used and formulation utilized.
Now, GI. First, some breaking news for CVC, Cenicriviroc. We plan to initiate Phase 3 trials mid-next year. At a recent
end of Phase 2 meeting, the FDA agreed that the compound is Phase 3-ready and that the primary endpoint should be
reduction in fibrosis by one stage without worsening of steatohepatitis. Remember, this is the endpoint that was
achieved at year one in the ongoing CVC CENTAUR study. The one-year data will be presented as an oral late breaker

at the forthcoming liver meeting in Boston. The CENTAUR study, meanwhile, continues, with two-year data available
mid-next year. We also expect to have Phase 2a data for brazikumab, an oral IL-23 monoclonal antibody for the
treatment of Crohn's disease, in the first half of 2017.
In Women's Health, we will have the second Phase 3 results for Esmya in uterine fibroids early next year, with filing
plans later in the year. Turning to Eye Care, Bill has already discussed True Tear and Xen. As you know, we have an
option agreement with Mimetogen for tavilermide in dry-eye disease. The first two Phase 3 trials have been completed,
and the Mimetogen team are presently evaluating the data.
Turning to slide 23, we recently announced our decision to exercise our option for relamorelin. Data obtained from
both the Phase 2a and Phase 2b trials are shown on this slide. I am showing here the efficacy of relamorelin in
comparison to placebo on a four-point composite endpoint of nausea; post-prandial fullness, or early satiety; abdominal
pain; and bloating. In both studies, relamorelin was significantly more effective than placebo. In the Phase 2a study on
the left, I am showing the results in a subgroup of patients with a high incidence of vomiting at a dose of 10 mcg of
relamorelin. In this subgroup, vomiting was also significantly decreased following relamorelin administration. For the
Phase 2b trial, I am showing the average of efficacy of three doses of relamorelin, 10, 30, and 100 mcg, in comparison
to placebo in all patients. In these patients, there was a substantial reduction in vomiting in relamorelin-treated patients
in this trial. There was also a substantial placebo reduction in vomiting. This placebo effect was surprising to
investigators, KOLs, and our internal team. We are working to understand this placebo effect, which as you all know
can occur in clinical studies.
Recent draft FDA guidance on diabetic gastroparesis drug development specifies that the use of an endpoint that
measures each of the core symptoms and signs of the disease separately or as a composite with a responder definition is
recommended for the development of novel agents. So we believe that that the data shown on this slide will be suitable
for progression of the compound into Phase 3. We are very excited about the prospect of bringing a new treatment to
millions of patients who are suffering from this condition. No new drug has been approved since 1983.
As I have outlined, we continue to make great progress with our Open Science model, with tremendous results just in
the third quarter. We have many more milestones ahead to deliver for the remainder of the year and into 2017. Our
ability to identify and acquire the best science, matched with our strong results in advancing innovation, validates Open
Science. As always, I thank our global R&D team for their outstanding work and dedication in driving innovations,
delivering results, and for their commitment to the work ahead for the patients we serve.
I will now turn the call over to Tessa.
Maria Teresa Hilado
Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Please note that the discussion of continuing operations financial results
excludes both global generics and Anda, following the completion of our global generics divestiture in Q3 and the sale
of Anda in Q4.
Turning to slide 25, before I begin reviewing the results for the quarter, I wanted to first expand on some of Brent's
earlier remarks on our capital allocation decisions announced this morning. Following the receipt of the Teva proceeds,
we immediately took steps to strengthen our balance sheet through debt paydown. We started repurchasing our shares
in late August, and we completed $5 billion in share repurchases in October, ahead of schedule. We purchased a total
of 21 million shares at an average price of approximately $238 per share. We also continued to focus on evaluating
options to further increase shareholder value. We therefore expanded our share repurchases by $5 billion to $15 billion
in total and announced the initiation of a dividend to begin in 2017.
First, I want to expand on the share repurchase. We concluded that there is no better investment than in our own stock.
As we announced this morning, we will be executing the remaining $10 billion, utilizing an accelerated share
repurchase program, or ASR. As you may all know, an ASR program allows us to reduce a significant portion of shares
up front. Since the last conference call, we continued to evaluate various methods to repurchase shares. In conjunction

with our advisers, we have since developed an ASR structure that meets Irish legal requirements. Approximately $8
billion worth of shares will be retired during the month of November 2016. The remaining shares, if any, under the
program will be received and retired by the third quarter of 2017 upon completion of the ASR. Completion of the ASR
could occur sooner subject to market conditions. Up to 50% of the ASR program will be hedged based upon the stock
price over a reference period through a collar transaction.
Second, we initiated a dividend starting in Q1 2017. Our company has transformed over the last 18 months to a
pure-branded growth pharma company with a strong pipeline and strong growth prospects. Given our conviction in the
future of our current business and our ability to generate strong cash flow, we decided to initiate the dividend. The
dividend will be funded by our ongoing cash flow while allowing for further investment in growth. We are committed
to growing this dividend annually for shareholders.
Turning to slide 26, we remain committed to our investment-grade ratings. We expect to continue to strengthen our
balance sheet through debt repayment. We have already repaid close to $10 billion in debt this year, and we have an
additional $6.5 billion in contractual maturities which we intend to pay over the next 18 months. In addition, we ended
the quarter with $27.4 billion in cash and marketable securities.
Turning to our overall results for the third quarter of 2016 on slide 27. In Q3, we delivered strong year-over-year
performance. Continuing operations net revenues, which now exclude Anda distribution, were $3.62 billion, a 4.5%
increase versus prior year, primarily impacted by Asacol HD loss of exclusivity, divestitures, and lower-than-expected
Namenda IR and XR. Excluding Namenda IR, divestitures and FX, and an out-of-period adjustment related to
discontinued operations which impacted the third quarter of last year by $31.7 million, net revenues increased 7.4%.
Gross margins for the third quarter remain strong at almost 88%. The decline versus prior year was driven primarily by
higher production costs related to capacity expansion and manufacturing variances. These were costs that are accounted
for within corporate and did not impact any of the segment margins, which remained very strong. Operating margins
declined versus last year to 49.3%, impacted by higher sales and marketing investment to continue to support ongoing
launches such as Vraylar, Viberzi, and Kybella, and other marketing spend for key products, as well as higher
investments in R&D as a result of more projects versus the prior year.
Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.32 primarily reflect the loss of exclusivity of Namenda IR and Asacol HD
and lower sales of Namenda XR, higher SG&A and R&D spend compared with the third quarter of 2015. Our
non-GAAP tax rate was 8.2% in the quarter. Cash flow from operations for the third quarter was negative this quarter at
approximately $1 billion, primarily as a result of cash tax payments of approximately $2.6 billion related to the gain
from the sale of our generics business to Teva. Excluding this and the impact of R&D asset acquisition and
restructuring payments, cash flow from operations remains very strong at positive $1.72 billion. The GAAP equivalents
to our financial metrics can be found in our earnings release issued this morning and posted on our website.
Turning now to our U.S. Specialized Therapeutics results on slide 28. The business continued to deliver strong
performance year over year. U.S. Specialized Therapeutics revenue was $1.45 billion for the quarter, up 12.1% versus
the prior-year period, driven by strong growth across Medical Aesthetics of 14%, Eye Care of 13%, and strong growth
in Botox Therapeutic of 17%. Key products performed well, with Botox, Restasis, fillers, and the launch of Kybella as
key contributors to the strong performance. A sequential 2% revenue decline was driven by the typical seasonality of
Medical Aesthetics and Eye Care in the summer. Gross margin continue to expand at 95.2%. SG&A increased versus
prior year as a result of an increase in promotion efforts, including aesthetic sales force expansion and Kybella DTC.
Turning to slide 29. Our U.S. General Medicine business third quarter revenues were $1.49 billion, 4% lower than last
year, primarily attributed to Asacol HD generic entry, lower Namenda IR and XR revenues, and lower established
brands due to the Cervidil divestiture and Enablex generic entry. Adjusting for this impact, trends in our key products,
including Linzess and Lo Loestrin, continued to grow at strong double-digit rates. Third quarter gross margins
continued to be stable at 85%. Sequentially, SG&A increased versus the prior year, primarily related to higher sales and
marketing to support launches of Viberzi and Vraylar. The decline in SG&A versus prior quarter is due primarily to
timing of promotional spending.

Turning to slide 30 and our international results. Third quarter revenues were $698 million versus $661 million in the
prior-year period. Excluding foreign exchange and an out-of-period adjustment of $31.7 million, international revenues
in the third quarter grew 12% versus prior year, driven by continued strong growth of Botox Therapeutic, Botox
Cosmetics, fillers, and Ozurdex. Sequential revenue decline was driven by seasonality of Medical Aesthetics and Eye
Care, primarily in Europe. Gross margins were 86.4% in the third quarter. Segment SG&A was $216 million, up 14.3%
versus prior year, driven by continued support of Medical Aesthetics and new product launches, including Belkyra or
Kybella in the U.S., Xen, Earfold, and Constella. Contribution margins improved versus prior quarter from 53.4% to
55.4%, reflecting continued strong sales growth.
Turning to slide 31. Let me make a few comments on our 2016 full-year revised guidance. We are revising our
guidance for full-year 2016. While we are clearly disappointed that we have to revise our guidance, the level of
transformation our company has seen over the last 18 months has been unprecedented. We've carved out two major
businesses, a very complex process. We have now completed that process this quarter with the close of Anda. We are
looking forward to focusing on the future as a pure branded growth pharma company. We now expect full-year 2016
branded revenues to be between $14.45 billion to $14.65 billion, at or modestly below the low end of our previous
range. Reflecting the impact of sales that we saw in the third quarter, and our assumption that those trends on our
non-promoted, established products carry into the fourth quarter, we expect continued strong performance of our
top-promoted products and new launches.
Our gross margins, which were slightly lower sequentially, are now expected to finish the year between 87% to 88%,
consistent with our historical performance. Our non-GAAP SG&A of approximately $4 billion and our non-GAAP
R&D spend of approximately $1.5 billion remain unchanged. Net interest expense and other is in the range of $1.25
billion. Our tax rate for the full year is anticipated to be between 8% and 9%. Our tax rate should between begin to
trend upward toward normalized levels in early 2017.
Our revised average share count for 2016 of 408 million shares includes the impact of the completed $5 billion in share
repurchases, as well as the impact of the $10 billion ASR we just announced. Year-end 2016 diluted share count is
forecasted to be approximately $365 million, reflecting more fully the impact of the share repurchases. As mentioned
earlier, there could be further adjustments in share count depending on Allergan's stock price during the settlement
period. Approximately $8 billion worth of shares will be retired during the month of November 2016, and the
remaining shares, if any, under the program, will be received and retired by the third quarter of 2017 upon completion
of the ASR. As a result, we expect full-year non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $13.30 and $13.50. For the fourth
quarter, we expect a forecast average share count of 383 million shares for the quarter.
Turning to slide 32. We have strong, long-duration assets and a sound strategy. We have leading top line growth and
margins, driven by new, innovative products and excellent manufacturing capabilities. We have strong conviction in
the earnings potential and cash generation of our company, and we remain focused on long-term shareholder value
creation. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brent for closing remarks.
Brenton L. Saunders
Thank you, Tessa. In closing, in 2016, we have been on a journey to transform our company. This work is largely
behind us now, and we have multiple drivers, including top-tier revenue growth, top-tier profitability, a strong Open
Science R&D model, and significant new actions to return cash to shareholders. And we have taken the actions to set
the foundation for top-tier growth and profitability in 2017 and beyond.
We'd now like to open up the call to your questions. LaShonda, can we start the queue?

Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Great, thanks very much, and congrats on the incremental share repurchase and dividend
announcements. I have a couple questions. I don't want to take too long, but I guess first of all, Brent and Tessa, maybe
you could just frame how you plan to balance your optimism about the business and your motivation to drive the sales
force while also ensuring that consensus expectations can be achievable going forward? That's my first question. And
tying into that, how will you guide next year in the face of Namenda XR early generic risk? And then the second
question is on Vraylar in negative symptoms, you mentioned a first-half 2017 data submission. I'm assuming that
incremental data could show up in the body of the label in early 2018. But when do you expect to be able to file for a
formal indication for negative symptoms to be on the top of the label? Thank you.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah. So let me see if I can take those, David. Thank you for a full list of questions. I
think with respect to motivating the sales force and balancing the need to meet or beat expectations or consensus – it's
something obviously we take very seriously. I'm not sure the two are entirely connected. Our sales force around the
world is, frankly, one of the prides of Allergan. We take a great amount of our time and effort to make sure that our
front-line salespeople have all the tools and training and skills necessary to do the therapeutic line calls and promote
our products in a compliant and risk-imbalanced way, but to build customer intimacy and relationships. And I think
across a number of different dynamics, our sales force is the most productive, hardest-working sales force in the
industry.
And we've been expanding it. So in Eye Care we've expanded it, and in key markets like Brazil and China we've been
expanding it. I'd also say that we have had a relatively strong stability in our sales force despite the transformation of
Allergan. Our sales reps and our sales leadership is almost entirely intact from the early days of the company's
transformation. So it is a very important group of individuals and colleagues for us, and it's a highly motivated, highly
productive function in the company.
I think the question with respect to consensus is something that Tessa and I and our entire management team take very
seriously, but at the end of the day, we run the business to make the right decisions to propel growth and high
profitability in the future. And so things that we did this quarter, like bringing on a second Botox manufacturing plant
in Ireland, expanding our capacity in Waco to make many of our Eye Care products, investing behind our launches,
pulling forward some promotional spend behind Namzaric are all the types of things that I think we need to do to
continue to drive the growth and do the right thing for the business – in fairness, irrespective of consensus. And so
that's kind of how it nets out. I don't know if, Tessa, you want to add anything?
<A - Maria Teresa Hilado>: Yeah. I'd also want to add that the revised guidance we provided really was reflective of
just a couple of product lines where our expectations were not met, and specifically, as we pointed out earlier in the
presentation, it was really Namenda IR/XR largely, and Avycaz as well. So it doesn't really affect the bulk of the
product portfolio, as Bill pointed out, which really for the most part is growing double digits.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Right. And then it also includes some of our mesalamine products like Asacol. Let me
move over to your other question with respect to what happens if there's generic XR. Obviously, we believe in our
intellectual property position. We are going to be in the appeals court likely next year, and we'll see how that settles.
I'm not going to try to handicap how a judge is going to rule, particularly with respect to memantine. I've done that in
the past, and that has not worked out well for me, so I'm going to stay away from that.
I think the better thing that we can focus on is what we can control on a day-to-day basis, which is our promotion of the
better product for patients which is Namzaric. Reducing the pill burden from three pills twice a day to one pill once a
day is something that we know that caregivers and patients suffering from Alzheimer's really do benefit from. And,
look, the early data on Namzaric that Bill put up on the slide is encouraging, but we should keep in mind it's early. And
our entire sales force and our entire promotional effort is focused on driving the better therapy Namzaric, but we have
work to do. Bill, anything you'd add on that?
<A - William J. Meury>: I would just say, David, it's only been several weeks since we've introduced the more
complete indication. We haven't even started a consumer program, which will launch in a couple weeks, and the

volume for Namzaric is up 25% in both retail and long-term care. So we have our work cut out for us, to be fair, but if
we focus on that, by the time we get to the end of 2017 it may not matter if we have all our effort behind the better
product.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah. Then quickly on your last question with respect to Vraylar and negative
symptoms, David, I think you just want to clarify?
<A - C. David Nicholson>: Yeah, sure. Now, clearly we've been talking extensively to the agency about how to handle
our negative symptoms data. We already have the indication for schizophrenia. Negative symptoms are part of
schizophrenia and, as I mentioned, we're working with the agency how to handle this. We now plan to submit our
sNDA for negative symptoms in schizophrenia late in the first half of next year. During the review with the agency,
we'll be working with them to agree precisely how to position this in the label, and potentially we'll also be sorting this
out with an advisory committee.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Thanks, David. Next question?
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Thank you.
Operator
Ladies and gentleman, as a reminder, please limit yourselves to one question to allot time for others to ask a question.
Our next question comes from the line of David Maris with Wells Fargo.
<Q - David Maris>: Good morning. On the earnings reset, is the business becoming less predictable, or are you
managing it on a more fluid basis? And I get that investments are needed and you need a new Botox plan, you need it,
but when you set guidance about a year ago, is there something that changed in the approach? Because the reset is the
first in I think a few years. So maybe if you could just talk about whether or not it's a different change of approach or
that something changed recently.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah. So great question, David. Thanks for asking it. I think in fairness it's something
that, frankly, under my leadership we've never had. And it is disappointing for us that we have to do it. It's something
that we take a lot of pride in not having to do. That being said, the business is not less predictable in any way, shape, or
form. I think – I don't want to make excuses, but rather I accept full responsibility and accountability for the situation,
but we did have a lot going on this year with the transformation of the company, almost a complete transformation of
the company, and perhaps we didn't anticipate some of these older product erosion that happen. And, to be fair, I think
this is true across the industry. I think competing in categories where there is strong generic alternatives is becoming
increasingly more difficult, and then frankly with the mesalamine franchise, we were excluded by one major exclusion
list with that particular product. And that does – was unanticipated, unlikely to happen to any of our other products in
2017, frankly, or maybe even 2018, but something that when it happens does have an impact on sales. I don't know,
Bill, if you'd add anything.
<A - William J. Meury>: Two risks that we managed that would create unpredictability would relate to of course
pricing or competitive activity, and there's really been nothing over the past 12 months or anything that I see 2017 or
2018 that would make this business more difficult to predict. If you look at almost three-quarters of our product line,
it's at expectations or even exceeding expectations. You look at product launches, they're either at or exceeding
expectations generally. Some of these established products, though, which is a smaller part of our business, can be at
times a little difficult to predict. But, overall, I think we have a very good handle on what's going to happen in the
future.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah. And, look, it's not something I enjoy saying, but if you had to have this situation,
clearly the miss wasn't in our promoted products, it's not in our launches, it's not in the things that propel our growth
next year or beyond. They're in some of the products that we don't promote or don't pay as much attention or in the
gross margin, where we made the right investments for the long term given the demand for products like Botox and
some of our Eye Care products. So it is what it is. It's not an excuse. Hopefully it won't happen again, but it is what it is

Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Thank you. Brent, how would you characterize the pricing environment now and the outlook for
the next couple years? And maybe you could divide your comments between the stuff you missed on the older stuff
where price might not be – as a lever, might not be as robustly available as in the past. And so comments on pricing
environment now and going toward on sort of the growthy stuff and the non-growthy stuff. And, Tessa, can you put
some context around the negative cash flow number in the quarter? Thanks.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah. Thanks, Gregg. So, look, I mean, I think for us our pricing outlook for 2017 and
frankly our early look into 2018 is very stable. We don't see really any significant changes or surprise at this moment. I
think, to be fair, for the industry, I think it's going to be a very different situation depending on the product mix of their
portfolios. I think – looking at earnings for the companies that have reported before us, many of them have seen
less-than-stellar growth in their key promoted products, but they've achieved their results by price increases in their
established products. I'm not sure that is sustainable.
And so, while some may criticize our Social Contract and our pricing discipline, we would have not taken those price
increases irregardless of the contact because it's not the right thing to do. And I think it does create additional risk or
inappropriate risk for the company. And so I think what you're seeing from Allergan this quarter is the new reality that
frankly you'll start to see from everybody else in the industry over time.
<A - Maria Teresa Hilado>: Yes, so on the cash flow, Gregg – that's actually relatively simple to explain. So we had
negative cash flow of about $1 billion. If you add back the cash taxes that we paid attributable to the gain on the sale of
our generics business to Teva of about $2.6 billion, and then you add back one-timers such as milestones and
restructuring of about $240 million, cash flow would have been about $1.7 billion positive.

Our next question comes from the line of Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Vamil K. Divan>: Great. Thanks so much for taking my question. So I'll just stick with one I guess on the
business development side. And you mentioned all the stepping-stone deals you completed recently. Maybe, Brent, if
you could just give a little sense of sort of how you view the future opportunities? Should we continue to look at things
along these lines, stepping stones, maybe smaller things, maybe earlier-stage assets? Or your interest in maybe
something later stage or larger in scale? Thank you.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah. So we do retain significant firepower to do stepping stones irregardless of our
capital allocation decisions this morning. I think that we will continue to look for things that strategically fit our growth
agenda, and that means that you'll see a nice balance over some longer period of time between buying intellectual
property or R&D to support our pipeline and our therapeutic areas of expertise or short-term accretive deals that get us
near-term or marketed products that expand our commercial capabilities in our therapeutic areas or our geographic
footprint in our therapeutic areas. And so we're looking at lots of things.
I think in terms of size, we look at everything from $100 million to several billion dollars, and I think we still retain
ample capacity to continue to looking at everything that we used to do. And so we're looking at accretive deals that are
in our therapeutic areas or adjacent to our therapeutic areas, but for now we should just point out the most
overwhelmingly accretive thing we can do is buy our stock. And so I think we've found a nice balance between making
a statement on that specific point but retaining enough firepower to continue our strategy of stepping stone. Next

question?

Our next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you. A couple questions, Brent. I don't mean to beat a dead horse, but it's obviously very
important, and it explains why the share price is where it is. Allergan is a new company. It's a new collection of assets.
You've been through tremendous transition over the last many years, not just the divestitures. And so investors listen to
what you say and take what you say at face value. And for the last 12 months I would characterize your guidance as
having drip, drip, dripped, I mean, from double-digit top line to the $25 aspirational number that was pushed out, to
gross margin guidance to revenue guidance.
And so my question is, obviously guidance is really important, market takes it very seriously. We're just trying to
understand your company. What are you doing for your own internal controls so that you have better visibility to
communicate with investors? This quarter, a lot of the shortfalls came from older products that I would have thought
you would have foreseen. So I'm just wondering what you're doing about that going forward. And most importantly,
will this be the last – I mean, I don't think you can – I don't know how definitive you can be, but to help us understand,
will this be the last of the rebasing?
And then my second question is, if you could help us to understand how to think about the pushes and pulls in 2017.
Obviously the buyback should be a positive to your bottom line, but at the same time investors are questioning your
level of R&D spend to sustain top line growth, SG&A which is coming in above but obviously important to sustain
new product launches. So if you could sort of give us a preliminary vision for what 2017 might look like. Thanks very
much.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah. So thanks, Jami. That was a lot. I'm trying to think of where to start. Look, I think
I have to just mention, we're not going to provide 2017 guidance today. We'll do that in the normal course in early next
year, in just a few months. But that being said, look, we have a business that I think has some very important
characteristics that even despite the miss today on some of the older products are the thing I hope investors focus on.
We have top tier growth. We have a portfolio that's diverse with many growth drivers, not one big growth driver but
many growth drivers. You can look at products like Botox up 15%, Restasis up 13%, Linzess up 42%. Even drugs like
Lo Loestrin up 16%, Ozurdex up 25%.
And I think see the pattern of that the previous quarter, the previous quarter, and the previous quarter and get a feel for
the growth trajectory of this business. You can look at the new launches, which I said contributed about $90 million in
the quarter. Viberzi, Vraylar, Kybella all off to either at our expectations or exceeding expectation start. You heard
David talking about filing for negative symptoms on Vraylar. Could be, if approved by the FDA, a certainly multiple
changer in terms of the sales multiples for that drug.
But then I think most importantly, the question I take the most exception to, is this idea that the percentage of our R&D
spend is too weak to propel innovation. I mean, I think that's ridiculous. I think, just to be straightforward, it's the
quality of the spend against the programs and the productivity that you have. And I think when you look at our 70
late-stage programs and you think about some of the big ones that are coming over the next year or two, whether it be
abicipar, rapastinel, ubrogepant, Esmya, relamorelin, just to name a few, let alone drugs like Rofade and others, or
SER120, that are kind of forgotten about in the context. We have ample new product flow, and we have several shots
on goal that could be blockbuster new drugs for unmet medical needs.
So would you rather have that or have us spend $8 billion or $9 billion on R&D to have no productivity and late-stage
failures and all the other things that come with it. Not saying we won't have failures. Of course we'll have a few, but I
think we spend our money more wisely, and it hopefully over time will prove in a more efficient way to get meaningful
innovation out to market. And just as an aside, our R&D is up 29% year to date, so it's not that we're not increasing
R&D. So hopefully that answers some of your questions. We can continue the debate next time I see you, but we feel

very good about our position. We feel very good about our growth profile, and I think we feel very confident that we
will be continuing top-tier growth and top-tier profitability in 2017 and beyond.

And our final question comes from the line of Marc Goodman with UBS.
<Q - Marc Goodman>: Okay. Brent, can you talk about internationally some of the countries where you plan to
expand infrastructure? I think you talked about some of the launches overseas, but where are the places where you need
to expand the infrastructure? And then second question, Bill, can you talk about just the dynamics in the dry eye market
right now? Obviously, Shire has been very aggressive or generous or whatever you want to call it giving away product.
Just give us a sense of what's going on out there, what you're seeing, and what you're doing. We're seeing the IMS data,
obviously. Thanks.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah. So I'll turn it over to Bill in a second, but I'm glad you raised international
expansion. When we think of our levers for growth, we tend to talk about new product launches, R&D, late-stage
success, expanding markets like Medical Aesthetics, but clearly another very important lever for Allergan that
sometimes isn't discussed as much is international expansion. We saw that business up about 12% this quarter, after FX
and one other adjustment. And so that team around the world is performing at very high levels, and there are a few
countries that I think we really believe we would have a high return on investment, and we have already started making
many of those investments. Bill, you want to talk about those?
<A - William J. Meury>: Yeah. I would say there's three regions of our international business that are getting a great
deal of focus right now. That's Asia Pacific; North, East, Southeast Europe, essentially everything other than Western
Europe; and Turkey, Middle East, Africa. The investments that we make right now relate to expansion of the field
force, especially in Asia Pacific and namely in China. We've dramatically increased the scale and scope and intensity of
our injector training program, not just in Asia Pacific but in the other two regions as well. And internationally there are
opportunities to run consumer advertising campaigns, namely on our fillers line, which is growing at 25% year over
year.
Not a major increase in sales force is required, but of the three things I mentioned, that is the largest one. And the
business is really very, very well-resourced. The regional presidents and the country managers that run this business are
very, very capable, and the trends just look very, very good. You know, a business that's up 12% versus prior year and
has experienced price erosion of 1% to 2%, and so it's a very, very strong product line. The same can be said for the
Eye Care business as well, where we're launching new products for glaucoma, and I like how it looks. The second
question was about?
<A - Lisa M. DeFrancesco>: Dry eyes.
<A - William J. Meury>: Oh. Dry eye. I would make the following observations. The first is, as you know from the
IMS data, and I think that this is a good development, the market for dry eye, if you look at total prescriptions, is up
over 20%. If you look at new prescriptions, it's closer to 30%. Most of the expansion is coming from, as I mentioned
earlier, patients who are on over-the-counter tear products or were receiving no treatment at all. The next observation is
that the revenue stream for Restasis has been very durable. If you look at the six-week period, for example, before the
launch of Xiidra and the six-week period after.
And then the next, final point I would make is we're focused right now on launching Restasis and BPF and True Tear at
the end of 2016 and 2017. And I still believe that when the dust settles here – I'm sure the people at Shire feel the same
way – this isn't going to be a fight to the death between the two companies and the two products, but this is going to be
a larger market. There's a lot more attention being paid to ocular surface disease, and I think we're seeing it. A second
treatment option appears to have created an expansion event in Eye Care, which is good. I believe that Allergan,
because of our product line depth and capabilities, is going to maintain a majority share in a much larger market, and I
think things look pretty good in that regard.

Great. Well, thank you. So let me just thank everyone for joining us today. I know we're going to see many of you a
little bit later today, and we look forward to continuing answering questions and the dialogue. Again, we are very
pleased about the foundation we have laid for growth in 2017 and beyond, and we look forward to continuing to update
