insights and Ellen will speak again with concluding remarks followed by your questions. As you know, Trian Fund
Management has invested in DuPont stock and proposed a plan to break up the company, a spin upon a spin. Our board
of directors and management are unanimous in their belief that the plan we are pursuing will continue to deliver
superior value for all DuPont shareholders.
On January 8, Trian announced that it has nominated four individuals for election to the company's board of directors at
our 2015 annual meeting of shareholders. As we said at the time of that announcement, the corporate governance
committee of the DuPont board will review Trian's candidates and present its recommended slate of director nominees
in the company's definitive proxy statement.
In the meantime, we remain focused on continuing to execute our transformative, strategic plan, which has already
delivered and continues to drive superior value for shareholders. We look forward to ongoing discussion and
engagement with our shareholders and, as always, appreciate their views and perspectives. Please note that the subject
of today's call is the company's fourth quarter earnings. We will not be taking questions on the topic of Trian's plan or
slate.
With that introduction, I direct you to slide number two, and it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Ellen.
Ellen Jamison Kullman
Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. DuPont made important progress on our strategic plan in 2014, and
we're looking ahead with excitement to a year of continued transformation that will enhance our prospects for the
future. Our fourth quarter results reflect our continued focus on execution with volume and margin improvements in
almost every segment and operating EPS increasing 20% year-over-year despite market and macro-challenges.
We achieved several significant milestones in 2014. These include the ongoing refinement of our portfolio with ten
strategic portfolio actions during the year, and our Form 10 filing in December reflecting steady progress towards the
mid-year spin-off of Chemours.
We initiated our redesign program last July and already exceeded our second half cost reduction targets, and we
continue to act on our commitment to return capital to shareholders through $2 billion of share repurchases and
increasing the common stock dividend 4% in July for a total of $3.7 billion returned to shareholders in 2014 alone.
In 2015, DuPont will continue its transformation as a dynamic science company driven by innovation, execution and
global reach. Our focus on creating shareholder value and leveraging advanced science and technology, market and
value chain knowledge, global scale, and disciplined management has delivered 266% total shareholder return and $14
billion of cumulative capital returned to shareholders since our leadership change in 2009. We are executing on key
initiatives that will continue to deliver shareholder value going forward.
Before Nick and Greg take you through the details of our results, I want to highlight two key elements that underscore
our commitment to increasing shareholder value. Over the course of this year, you will continue to see a major
contribution from our operational redesign. I'll have more to say about this important program, but I'm also pleased to
note that we have increased our cost reduction target by approximately $300 million to at least $1.3 billion of total
expected savings to be achieved on a run rate basis by 2017.
We've already achieved $0.07 per share in 2014. By the end of 2015, we forecast annual run rate savings of
approximately $1 billion, a significant acceleration of our originally announced schedule. This is a top priority for all of
us at DuPont, and we're working with a leading international consulting firm with extensive experience in initiatives of
this magnitude. Plans are being tracked with business leaders held accountable for achieving them, and you'll continue
to hear about our quarterly progress. The most significant strategic action anticipated in 2015 is the separation of
Chemours. As part of that separation, DuPont will receive a one-time dividend from Chemours at the time of
separation. We expect to return all or substantially all of the proceeds from that dividend back to shareholders within 12
to 18 months of completing the separation with a portion to be returned by the end of 2015.

Nick will provide more detail about this in his remarks. I'll be back to give you more perspectives on the year ahead.
But now, I'll hand it off to Nick to walk us through our fourth quarter and full-year results.
Nicholas C. Fanandakis
Thank you, Ellen. Let's start with the details of the fourth quarter on slide three.
We delivered $0.71 operating earnings per share versus $0.59 in the prior year. The 20% increase in the fourth quarter
reflects gains from strategic portfolio actions, continued productivity, and cost reductions related to the company's
operational redesign initiative, lower performance based compensation expense and share repurchases. The
improvement is a direct result of disciplined execution in innovation, despite macroeconomic and market headwinds
including a weaker ag economy, stronger dollar, and a difficult market pricing environment. Consolidated net sales
were $7.4 billion. Volume growth of 3% was more than offset by a 4% impact from portfolio and a 3% negative
currency impact.
The company continued to execute on its strategy to enhance the value creation of the portfolio, finalizing five
divestitures in the fourth quarter and ten portfolio actions for the full year. While these product line divestitures reduced
our revenue by 2% in 2014, they remain the right strategic choices to unlock shareholder value over the long term,
enabling our future growth by allowing us to focus on higher growth opportunities, margin improvement and less
cyclicality.
From a currency perspective, the dollar continued to strengthen against most currencies, particularly the euro, Brazilian
real and the Japanese yen. Currency for the quarter was a $0.07 hit, impacting segment results. For the full year, we had
a $0.26 per share currency headwind comprised of an $0.11 hurt impacting segment results, and an after-tax exchange
loss of $0.15. Volume growth of 3% across most segments was led by Agriculture and Performance Materials, which
grew volumes 5% and 4%, respectively. The Agricultural volume increase reflects higher crop protection volumes and
the timing of seed shipments.
Performance Materials volume growth was driven by demand in the automotive sector in North America and China and
growth in industrial and consumer markets. Volume decline was limited to Electronics & Communications, which saw
a 5% decline year-over-year, primarily due to the impact of competitive pressures on Solamet paste. Weaker local
pricing of 1% in the quarter was primarily driven by lower pass-through metals pricing in Electronics &
Communications, lower corn seed prices in Agriculture, principally in Brazil, and Performance Chemicals.
In 2014, we delivered full-year earnings growth, despite the headwinds I previously described. We achieved
double-digit operating earnings growth in three segments, and improved margins year-over-year in five segments. We
continued our focus on improving operational productivity and completed the first wave of our enterprise-wide
redesign, which delivered cost savings of $0.07 per share in the second half.
Although not specifically reflected on the chart, I'd like to comment now on taxes. For the full year, our base tax rate
was about 19%, two points lower than we anticipated three months ago, and more than one point lower than the prior
year. The lower rate in 2014 results from favorable geographic mix of earnings and the reenactment of the U.S. R&D
credit in the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter base tax rate was about 9%, reflecting a favorable year-to-date catch-up
adjustment and the net [ph] impact (11:51) of these tax law changes.
Now let's turn to the fourth quarter segment operating earnings analysis shown on slide four. As you can see here, the
performance in the quarter was driven by higher results in Agriculture, Performance Materials and Industrial
Biosciences, partially offset by higher expenses associated with precommercial programs incorporated in the other
category in the chart. As noted on the slide, segment results included $175 million in lower performance-based
compensation versus the prior year, reflecting the alignment of our compensation practices with performance.
Turning now to slide five, I'd like to highlight some of our geographic results. Worldwide, our sales were down 5% in
the quarter, as the volume increase of 3% was offset by reductions in portfolio of 4%, currency of 3%, and local pricing
of 1%. Sales in developing markets decreased 3% during the quarter, primarily due to the impact of portfolio changes,

currency, and lower Latin America sales. Sales in developing EMEA increased 4% in the quarter versus fourth quarter
2013. Volume increases in most segments, led by Agriculture, Safety & Protection and Industrial Biosciences, were
partially offset by currency. Volume growth in Safety & Protection was driven by public sector demand for Kevlar.
In Latin America, sales declined 10% principally due to 5% negative currency impact, 3% decline from local price, and
lower seed volumes. Lower price is primarily attributed to lower corn seed pricing in Brazil.
Developing Asia grew 3% in the quarter on 8% higher volumes offset by portfolio and the negative impact of currency.
Volume grew in most segments led by Performance Chemicals and Performance Materials.
Turning now to slide six, you can see that the growth in operating earnings per share in the quarter is attributable to the
combination of higher segment operating earnings, lower corporate and interest expense, and the benefit of lower
shares outstanding.
Portfolio changes in EG&L each had a $0.03 per share negative impact on earnings in the quarter. Segment results
contributed $0.09 higher operating earnings in the quarter, excluding a $0.03 hit from the portfolio changes I described
earlier. For the full year, segment results contributed $0.11 in operating earnings excluding a $0.09 hit from portfolio
changes. The favorable variance in corporate and interest expenses provided a benefit of $0.07 in the quarter primarily
reflecting the impact of our cost-cutting program.
For the full year, lower corporate and interest expenses provided a benefit of $0.11 to operating earnings. Turning now
to the balance sheet and cash on slide seven. We ended the year with $1.7 billion of free cash flow on a total company
basis versus $1.3 billion last year. The increase primarily reflects the absence of tax payments related to the sale of
Performance Coatings.
We ended 2014 with net debt of $3.7 billion versus $3.4 billion in December of 2013. Year-end cash balances
decreased to about $7 billion. The decrease is primarily due to the completion of our $2 billion share repurchase
commitment in 2014.
Let me point out that our unfunded pension and OPEB liabilities increased nearly $4 billion from $8 billion last year to
$12 billion now. The increase is driven by the impact of lower discount rate as well as a change in mortality tables that
was enacted in late 2014. On slide eight, I'd like to highlight that we are continuing to execute on our operational
redesign initiative, which delivered about $0.05 of benefit in the fourth quarter. For the full year, earnings benefited
$0.07. As Ellen noted, we have increased our original cost reduction target to at least $1.3 billion, and I want to
underscore that we will continue to look for additional areas of productivity improvements and cost reductions. The
spin-off of the Performance Chemicals segment remains on track for the completion in mid-2015. In December 2014,
the initial draft of the Form 10 registration statement was filed with the SEC, and we announced that the new company,
named The Chemours Company, is targeting a high yield debt rating of BB. We expect the commensurate debt level to
result in approximately $4 billion of one-time dividend proceeds from Chemours to DuPont.
As Ellen stated earlier, we intend to return all or substantially all of these proceeds back to shareholders via a share
repurchase within 12 to 18 months of separation and with a portion being returned by the end of 2015.
However, the amount of the dividend received from Chemours depends on the rating agency outcome and the
underlying business conditions which may change between now and the time of the separation. We will provide more
updates as information becomes available.
Turning now to slide nine, I'd like to review our assumptions regarding our key markets and the broader economy in
2015. These assumptions form the foundation of our 2015 guidance. Broadly speaking, the U.S. dollar continues to
strengthen against most currencies and will be a substantial headwind for us in 2015. We expect global growth of 3%
against a backdrop of world economy that continues to face many uncertainties. We expect global industrial production
to increase about 3% in 2015. Growth has strengthened in North America, and uncertainty in Japan and Europe
continues as industrial production has stalled and Russia and Ukraine remain in recession.
In Agriculture, the fundamentals are challenging. Farmer net income has declined, and we anticipate lower corn planted
area as farmers favor soybeans over corn. Auto growth continues, while growth in the U.S. housing is expected to

accelerate. With this backdrop, let's now turn to slide 10.
We expect net sales to be even with prior year, as about 5% volume and price growth across the company is expected
to be offset by the impact of portfolio changes and currency. The company expects 2015 operating earnings of $4.00 to
$4.20 per share, which includes full-year result for the Performance Chemicals segment. The outlook also includes a
$0.60 per share headwind based on last week's currency rates.
The global currency markets have recently experienced significant volatility and a meaningful strengthening of the
dollar against a broad basket of currencies that we operate in. This has created a significant headwind for DuPont's
expected outlook for 2015. The currency impact is expected to be most significant for us in the first half of the year due
to the seasonality in operating earnings from Agriculture in the northern hemisphere. Headwinds from a weaker euro,
lower corn planted area, and a difficult market pricing environment in Performance Chemicals will be strongest in the
first quarter and are expected to more than offset growth in other segments.
Excluding currency impacts, we would expect earnings growth to be in line with our long-term targets, driven by this
underlying sales momentum and a full-year benefit of accelerated cost reductions through our redesign efforts. For the
full year, we expect our base tax rate to be about 22%, an increase from prior year, due to geographical mix of earnings
and the absence of the U.S. R&D credit. This represents about a $0.15 per share headwind in the outlook. Capital
expenditures are expected to be $1.8 billion.
In 2015, we will continue to exclude from operating earnings the transaction-related costs of the separation of
Performance Chemicals and report them on schedule B of our earnings report. We anticipate these expenses will be
about $0.30 per share for the year, compared to $0.14 in 2014.
Our market environment continues to be a dynamic one. We are cautious as we enter 2015, but confident in our ability
to execute our plans, while remaining poised to capitalize on changing market conditions and growth opportunities.
With that, let me turn the call over to Greg, who will review the segments. Greg?
Gregory R. Friedman
I'd now like to provide some brief segment insights focused on our full-year 2014 results, and the first quarter and
full-year segment outlooks. As a reminder, the slides with complete segment commentary are posted on the Investor
Center website under Events and Presentations, along with other materials for today's call.
Starting with slide 11, in Agriculture, full-year operating earnings decreased 5%, as higher crop protection volumes,
higher local seed prices and lower costs, including seed inputs, were more than offset by lower corn seed volumes, the
negative impact of currency, and portfolio impacts. During the year, we took disciplined actions to streamline our cost
structure, further focus our investments on the highest growth opportunities, and better position ourselves for the
current economic environment. As we look to the near future, we expect the economic environment in the Agriculture
sector to remain challenged.
Farmer net income has declined, and growers in Brazil's safrinha season and in North America are likely to reduce corn
plantings again in 2015, putting pressure on volumes in the first half of the year. Our seed order book reflects this shift
in acres. In addition, lower insect pressure in Brazil and continued elevated distributor inventories in the Americas will
present headwinds in 2015 in Crop Protection markets. Farmers are increasing demand in our newest corn seed
genetics, our AcreMax integrated refuge corn products and our new T Series soybean varieties. However, with profits
coming down, farmers are sharpening their pencils when it comes to input purchases.
Coupled with strong industry seed supplies, 2015 continues to be a very dynamic and competitive season. We
anticipate currencies will remain volatile and headwinds to be substantial in markets like Europe, Brazil and Canada
where we have seen strong growth in our market position in recent years. For the first half of 2015, which reflects of
the majority of the northern hemisphere season, we expect Agriculture segment sales to be mid-single digits percent
lower with operating earnings about 10% below 2014 as price gains from new product mix are more than offset by
currency and lower volumes. The currency impact will be greatest in the first quarter when the majority of 2015 season

sales in Europe occur. Volumes will be more challenged in the first quarter due to an expected decline in North
America and Brazil's safrinha corn area, the earlier timing of northern hemisphere seed shipments which benefited the
fourth quarter of 2014, and a reduction in herbicide volumes.
We expect first quarter sales to be about 10% lower and operating earnings about 25% below 2014.
For the full year, we expect sales to be down low single digits percent and operating earnings down high single digits
percent as price gains from new seed and crop protection products are more than offset by currency headwinds.
Excluding this impact of currency, we would expect operating earnings to be up mid to high single digits.
While Agriculture markets may continue to face challenges in the short term, we remain confident in the long-term
fundamentals for sustainable demand growth for grain and oilseeds in our growth strategy.
We are excited about our near-term pipeline of new genetics and traits like DP4114 and Leptra insect protection in
seed. Leptra will bring an additional mode of control to help Brazilian farmers manage the intense pressure they face
from insects including fall armyworm.
In crop protection, our robust pipeline of new actives will continue to complement our recent launches of insecticides
and fungicides and our expanding seed treatment portfolio.
On slide 12 in Performance Materials, we delivered another solid year. Full-year operating earnings were up 1%
overcoming the negative impacts of portfolio changes and the 60-day planned ethylene outage. Operating margins
increased 70 basis points to close the year at 21%, well above our long-term target.
For the first quarter, we anticipate sales will be down in the mid-single digits percent range due primarily to currency
and portfolio impacts. Operating earnings are expected to be up in the mid-teens, however, on a percentage basis on
improved volume as prior year sales were constrained in advance of the scheduled ethylene outage.
In 2015, we anticipate strong volumes will be more than offset by the combined negative impact of portfolio, price and
currency resulting in sales down mid-single digits. Full-year operating earnings are expected to increase in the
mid-single digit range, however, as higher volumes more than offset the negative impact of currency.
Moving to slide 13, in Industrial Biosciences we delivered outstanding full-year results. Higher volumes and improved
mix from the continued ramp of new products helped deliver a 25% increase in operating earnings and a 300-basis
point increase in operating margin. Our volume growth in enzymes was driven by new product offerings and increased
sales into emerging geographies in key markets including ethanol, food and animal nutrition. While ethanol industry
fundamentals are adjusting to a lower energy cost environment, we anticipate demand for DuPont's novel enzymes and
other functional bioproducts designed to increase production rates, yield and efficiency will remain steady for this year.
For the first quarter of 2015 we anticipate higher segment volumes will be offset by the negative impacts of currency
and lower prices resulting in sales even with the prior year. First quarter operating earnings are also expected to be even
with the prior year. For the full-year, we expect sales will be flat but higher volumes and stronger mix will result in
earnings up in the high teens on a percentage basis.
On slide 14, full-year sales in Electronics & Communications were 6% lower, as volume growth in several product
lines was more than offset by lower metals prices and by competitive pressures in photovoltaic paste. Full-year 2014
operating earnings of $355 million increased $21 million, or 6%, on volume growth and productivity gains, partially
offset by the absence of $20 million in OLED licensing income realized in 2013.
Looking ahead to 2015, global photovoltaic module installations are expected to grow about 20%, fueled by
installations in China, Japan and the U.S., and in developing markets. We expect continued strength in Tedlar film,
consumer electronics and packaging graphics. In the short term we expect segment results will continue to be
negatively impacted by declines in Solamet paste, as intense competition has impacted price and share in this business.
We have begun testing a new metallized paste product for the PV market with customers and expect to ramp up
production in 2015.

For the first quarter, we expect sales to be down low teens percent from short-term challenges in PV paste and lower
metals prices, with operating earnings about flat, benefiting from productivity. We expect to see the impact of our new
photovoltaic paste products in the second half the year. Full-year sales are expected to be up low single digits percent
from volume gains offset by the pass through of lower metals prices. For the year, we expect operating earnings to be
up in the high-teens percent range.
On slide 15, in Nutrition & Health, our disciplined focus on productivity and mix enrichment is paying off, as operating
margins improved over 200 basis points for the full year. 2014 was a strong year for this segment, as full-year operating
earnings grew 27% from improved product mix, volume growth, productivity and a gain on termination of a
distribution agreement, partially offset by the negative impact of currency.
Market conditions are expected to remain challenging in Europe, where the Russia food import ban continues to have
an effect and currency will be a strong headwind. In the first quarter, we expect sales and operating earnings to be
about flat, with broad-based volume gains negated by the impact of currency. Full-year sales are expected to be about
flat, with broad-based volume gains offset by currency. Full-year operating earnings are expected to be mid-single
digits percent higher, benefiting from lower raw material costs, improved mix, and a continued focus on productivity,
further expanding operating margin.
On slide 16, in Safety & Protection, we delivered full-year 2014 operating earnings of $794 million, an increase of
$104 million, or 15%, from higher volumes driven by increased demand for Nomex thermal resistant fiber and Kevlar
high strength materials, paired with productivity improvements and lower product costs. These gains were partially
offset by lower sales from clean technologies offerings and portfolio changes.
Operating margins were up 260 basis points versus the prior year. In the first quarter of 2015, we anticipate sales down
in the low single digit percent range and earnings growth in the mid-single digit percent range, as volume growth,
higher operating margins and sustained operational productivity will be partially offset by the impact of currency and
portfolio changes. For the full year 2015, segment sales are expected to be flat and earnings up in the low teens on a
percent basis, as strong volume growth, continued margin improvement and productivity will be offset by portfolio
changes and currency.
On slide 17, in Performance Chemicals, full-year operating earnings were down 8%, primarily due to lower pricing and
the negative impacts of portfolio and currency. We delivered volume growth across the portfolio, but competitive
pressures in TiO2 remain high, as soft industry fundamentals, especially in Europe, contributed to lower prices during
the year. We believe industry utilization rates remain essentially unchanged, with inventory levels near normal. In the
first quarter of 2015, we anticipate sales will be down in the mid-single digits on a percentage basis and operating
earnings will be down about 35% due primarily to lower U.S. dollar pricing. Full-year 2015 segment volumes are
expected to grow at one to two times the rate of GDP, with full year sales up low single digits on a percentage basis.
Full-year operating earnings are expected to be about flat as higher volumes are offset by the negative impact of
currency and portfolio changes.
Now, I will turn the call back over to Ellen.
Ellen Jamison Kullman
Thanks, Greg. Overall we made strong progress on our strategic plan in 2014. Our decisive actions across the company
enabled us to deliver volume, margin, and earnings growth in the majority of our segments even in an environment of
significant market and macroeconomic headwinds.
As we look ahead, we're focused on strategic choices that will position DuPont for higher growth and higher value.
While we are very focused on cost reduction, our transformation goes far beyond that. As you know, over the past six
years our actions have been guided by a clear plan. We dramatically refined the portfolio to focus investments in areas
of significant opportunity and secular growth, fueled our innovation platform, in good times and bad, to deliver
substantial revenues from the new products introduced over the prior four years, instituted a focus on efficiency, cost

discipline, and accountability as a way of life, expanded our global penetration, and demonstrated our commitment to
shareholders by returning approximately $14 billion to shareholders. When you consider that over a three-year period
we will soon have divested of our two largest legacy businesses representing over $11 billion in total sales, you'll begin
to understand the magnitude of change we're driving.
As we've said before, the spin-off of Chemours is a major inflection point on this path. In preparation for that event last
July, we launched a sweeping operational redesign with the advice of a leading consulting firm. Through our work,
we've created a blueprint for the new DuPont, and we're making sure that we start out with a foundation that aligns a
highly effective, innovation driven operating and business model with a significantly reduced cost structure.
Our partners have helped us conduct a top-down and bottom-up analysis. We're upgrading and modernizing everything
from our management reporting structures to our manufacturing supply chains to the way we process transactions. With
a more streamlined structure, our investments will be targeted, disciplined and effective, enhancing our competitive
position in the marketplace and we will continue to identify additional opportunities to reduce costs and streamline our
organization. Just as they have been, productivity, efficiency and accountability will be a way of life for the new
DuPont.
In short, our redesign will help us to continue to deliver on our cost and value initiatives and drive growth across our
three strategic priorities: extending our leadership in agriculture and nutrition, strengthening and growing our advanced
materials capabilities, and leveraging our cross-company knowledge to develop a world leading bio-based industrial
business.
This year, our investments will continue to be targeted towards these three priorities. In Agriculture, we're making
strategic investments to extend our leadership in germplasm and breeding while advancing our exciting biotech and
crop protection pipelines to create valuable solutions for farmers.
We're making excellent progress towards the commercialization of Leptra corn hybrids in Brazil, corn event DP4114
and several active ingredients in crop protection.
DuPont crop protection recently was awarded three prestigious 2014 Agrow awards, including best R&D pipeline for
the second consecutive year. And we continue to ramp up recent innovations like AcreMax in corn, T Series soybeans,
Encirca services, [ph] Diazapure (38:06) for insect control and Dermacor seed treatment to name a few.
In Specialty Food Ingredients, we're focused on expanding our nutritional offerings with high growth emerging health
and wellness markets. Products like our successful line of HOWARU probiotics are designed to meet expanding
demand for health-enhancing bacteria in food, beverages, and dietary supplements.
In Advanced Materials, our application and product development investments in innovative polymer, electronic and
protective materials will help expand the performance boundaries in markets including automotive, aerospace,
packaging, photovoltaics and construction.
And in Industrial Biosciences, we continue to ramp up our new products including cold water, bakery, and animal
nutrition enzymes to build on our current momentum. As innovation creates new demand for these products, we're well
positioned to create new categories of renewably sourced bio-based materials and fuels that draw on our knowledge
from our agriculture and advanced materials business.
Our strategic priorities continue to guide us and focus our growth strategy. To deliver, we will be relentless in the
pursuit of operational excellence with three operating priorities: innovation, global reach and strong execution.
Looking ahead, 2015 will build on the solid progress we've made in the execution of DuPont's strategic plan. Following
the separation of Chemours, we will be a very different company. With greater emphasis than ever before on
science-driven innovation, we are facilitating an even closer connection between our laboratories and the marketplace
and faster, more effective execution in delivering innovative solutions for our global customers. We are enhancing our
agility and responsiveness to market conditions necessary to win in a globally competitive environment, and we're
already starting to see results.

The cultural shift we're driving started with the global financial crisis, and has been reinforced by portfolio changes,
large and small, and the recast of our corporate and functional support. This is enabling us to capture the enormous
opportunity ahead and provide a clear understanding of how each of us can contribute in new ways to the DuPont that
will emerge post-separation.
In summary, DuPont continues to move forward with discipline, focus and purpose to deliver value now and position
DuPont for the longer term. Our board and management are on course following a plan we began implementing six
years ago that has delivered significant value, a cumulative capital return of $14 billion to shareholders, and a 266%
total shareholder return, well ahead of the S&P 500 and our proxy peers. We will continue to pursue the right choices
and decisions to build on our historic track record as a dynamic science company, delivering value through
market-driven innovation and a highly efficient low-cost structure. And most importantly, we remain confident in our
plan to deliver sustained, long-term value for our shareholders.

Thanks, Ellen. We'll now open the line for questions. Also joining us for Q&A is Jim Borel, Executive Vice President.
As a reminder, the purpose of today's call is to discuss our operating earnings. We ask that you keep your questions
focused on our results and outlook.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent
background noise. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Thank you, good morning.
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Good morning, David.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Good morning. Ellen, can you comment on the pace of a $4 billion buybacks? Why as long
as 18 months? Why not something a little bit quicker?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Nick?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Yeah, so a couple things I guess I should mention, David. First, I qualify the $4
billion as I mentioned on the call. The value of the midnight dividend will obviously be dependent upon once we get in
front of the credit rating agencies with the Chemours business outlook at the time and in order to maintain that BB
rating will determine what level of debt we're really going to be able to put on there.
Right now, we're estimating that to be $4 billion. Now, there are some IRS rules that come into play here around the
length of time one would have to return that value to the shareholders, and it has to be done in this 18-month period in
order to maintain the tax-free status of it. And so we're projecting somewhere in that 12 to 18 month period is when we
would look to return all, or substantially all of that estimated $4 billion to the shareholders.
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yeah, David, and as we get to closer to knowing exactly what the number is and
looking at going forward, we'll be more definitive on the timing of that, what would occur in 2015 and what would
occur in 2016.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Understood. And Ellen, just on corporate expense, you've seen a nice decline in the last
couple years to $700 million in 2014. What would you expect corporate expenses to be in 2015?

<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: So obviously, they're going to be lower. And obviously, with Fresh Start, and we've
sized that for you. But Fresh Start hits not only corporate expense, it hits the segment expenses and even product costs
as we're doing some things around like warehouses and things like that. So we continue to drive that very efficiently,
and we've been very proud of the work we did in the last quarter to identify another $300 million in savings and be able
to achieve those savings by the end of 2017.

Our next question is from Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Hey, good morning, folks.
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Hey Frank.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Hey, hey. We're about six weeks since the Form 10 came out on Chemours. And I know,
Nick, that you had said in the past that that would set the base case in terms of a spin-out or if there were other avenues,
a sale or what have you that might be considered. Can you talk about the interest that you've seen there or how that has
been trending and you know, what's your best guess in terms of does this go spin-out or not?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Well, you characterized it right, Frank, that we said that we're going to have a Form
10 out there to essentially build the box, if you will, of what would be the base case and how we would proceed. And
I've always said that we're going at warp pace to execute against that spin separation. We do remain open to explore
opportunities. I'm not going to get into specifics in that regard. But we would remain open to explore opportunities. But
I've also said many times that I find it very difficult to imagine something that's going to take me off the spin path. I
think the value that would have to be there in the way of the upside versus the speed and risk that one would take from
going off of the spin path that we're on would have to be significant enough that I just find it hard to imagine that that's
going to be possible, Frank.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: All right, that's helpful. And if I could follow up on Fresh Start, obviously a nice bump in the
program here and a nice acceleration in terms of when you'll realize that. I think you said, what, $0.30 to $0.35 would
be realized here in 2015, which at that $1 billion run rate suggests $0.50 or so to be realized in 2016, an incremental
$0.50 to be realized in 2016. Is there anything that might be deflating that in terms of stranded costs or something like
that that might be an offset to that $0.50 positive from Fresh Start in 2016?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: It's not going to be stranded cost, Frank. But obviously, as you go into 2016, there'll
be inflation that's going to occur on some of the cost items. There's also growth efforts that we continue to expand upon
and drive. So there's going to be some increases in that cost element that this is going to be going against that sort of
increase, but It's not going to be something like stranded cost that's going to be there that's going to cause any kind of
reduction against our projections. Our number, as you said, is, we believe we'll realize about $0.35 in 2015. And then at
the end of 2015, we will be at a run rate of about $1 billion. Now, that run rate of $1 billion includes, the run rate of $1
billion includes the amount of cost that would be going over to PCHEM as part of the separation. The $0.35 does not.
That's just $0.35 of value created within DuPont itself without the money going over to PCHEM.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: All right, terrific. Thank you so much.
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Okay.

I was looking at the fund flow statement, and your change in operating assets and liabilities was the use of $1.3 billion,
and the previous year was $1.4 billion. What's behind that change, in that your receivables and inventories don't really
change that much, but there's something that's using up cash? Do you have a forecast for 2015 for that number?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yeah, Jeff. So, you have a knack for going to a very specific place, and Nick has just
now told me he's figured it out, so Nick?
<Q - Jeffrey J. Zekauskas>: Oh good.
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Jeff, I think the biggest thing there is the absence of the tax payment for the Coatings
sale. We had about $700 million of tax payment that shows as part of that free cash flow, but the inflow of cash is
below the free cash flow line in the investments area. So that's the biggest reason for the delta on a year-over-year
basis.
<Q - Jeffrey J. Zekauskas>: Okay.
And I guess, secondly, the currency hit of $0.60 seems a lot, in that – I was wondering what it translates to in terms of a
change in sales. In that – my guess was that if your consolidated sales decreased 5% from currency, that that would be
$0.30, not $0.60. Are there currency positions that are jeopardized? Is that what makes the number so large, or is the
sales impact bigger?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yeah, so if you look at it, we only have 37% of our revenue last year was in the
United States. Okay? So we have a very large revenue base outside. If you look at the total impact on the revenue line
for 2015, we're looking at now about 3.5%. And then when you translate that down our positions and in all of our
businesses, it does come out to $0.60 a share. So it is large. It's obviously why we wanted to get it out there, and we've
seen this coming through the fourth quarter, because you saw the currency start to move there. But January's been
tremendously volatile in and of itself.
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: The other thing I'd add to what Ellen said -- I fully align with what she just told you,
Jeff -- but the other piece I'd add is, think about the timing of all of this. So, those exchange rates may change
throughout the year, but we're most heavily exposed, especially against the euro, in that first half of the year with the ag
business. So our mix and timing of that mix and when those sales are going to take place is going to have a significant
impact on our company.
Operator
Our next question is from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Robert Andrew Koort>: Thank you. Good morning. Was wondering if you could give me a little more color on
the comp hit. I think you sized it at $175 million in the quarter. It seems you made your guidance that you had
rejiggered mid-year. So, is it just a function of you need to wait till the end of the year to true up that expense line? And
what were the specific metrics that were failed or weren't met that resulted in that big comp hit?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yeah, thanks, Bob. So, we set aggressive performance targets at the beginning of the
year for each one of our businesses and for the company. Again, our results did not meet the aggressive targets that we
set at this time last year, and therefore the performance-based compensation is hit accordingly, and we true it up at the
end of the year from that standpoint.
So, it is pay-for-performance, a performance-based culture we're driving this company. And I think that's reflective of
it.
<Q - Robert Andrew Koort>: I might follow up on Solamet. You mentioned that it's maybe becoming somewhat
commoditized or intensified competition and you're doing some new product development. Can you talk about what
those new products offer that might get your customers to switch from a deflating product towards something that
might cost them more, but add some value?

<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yeah. So, obviously, with the increased competition in that segment, we've upped our
game on the innovation side coming through 2014. There is innovation left in that market space and we have the line on
new products that we are testing now, in small quantities, with our customers, that we will be commercializing in 2015.
So we still think there's attractive space. We think that innovation still matters.
I don't consider it commoditized. I just think that the competition is intensified in terms of creating new performance
products. Some people have caught up with us, and we're going to focus our efforts on pulling ahead again in 2015.

<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Hi, P.J. P.J., you're on mute.

<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yeah, that's great. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question is from Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial.
<Q - Don D. Carson>: Thank you. A question on your domestic agricultural business. Can you just size the impact for
the full year on the shift from corn to soy in the U.S.? And as you move forward and sell more Roundup Ready 2 seed,
will you be expensing more of your Monsanto royalties? Is that going to be a drag on earnings as well?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yeah. Jim, why don't you take that one?
<A - James C. Borel>: Yeah, so as we look at 2015, clearly we're expecting corn acres – the soybean corn price still
favors soybeans, so we're expecting corn acres to be down but it's very difficult to size, and those final decisions will be
made by growers closer and closer to the season. So it's hard to size the shift, but we do expect the decline in corn acres
and a slight increase in soybeans.
Regarding the royalties, the royalties will be higher as we continue to increase the penetration of Roundup 2 into the
lineup. So that'll be expensed as those things increase into the portfolio. For example, in 2015 we'd expect Roundup
Ready 2 sales to be about double what they were in 2014.
<Q - Don D. Carson>: But Jim, overall, so you're saying a shift from corn to soy is negative for you? We just don't
have the exact amount?
<A - James C. Borel>: Yeah. At this point, the shift from corn to soy is a negative for us. We make good money on
both of them, but corn is a bit more profitable the last few years.
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: And that is part of our guidance that we've put out to you today, Don.
Operator
And our next question is from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Vincent Stephen Andrews>: Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Just on the Performance Chemicals business
and maybe specific to TiO2, I just was trying to reconcile how we get – in 4Q volume was up, price was down both

sequentially and year-over-year. And then you're talking about 1Q profits being down 35%. I see there's a lot of
currency in there. How do we openly get the year to be flat with that as the backdrop?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yeah, so the first quarter is specifically problematic because of sequential price versus
year-over-year price specifically in TiO2. So, sequentially if price in the first quarter is about flat, it is down by high
single digits from last year. And that along with flat volume, because the first quarter really there isn't a lot of volume
improvements typically, kind of results in that kind of earnings profile.
Then you expect as the volumes improve throughout the year, as specifically also in chemicals and floor products, as
their volumes, the season in refrigerants in the second quarter and things like that, you start to see that improvement
come throughout the year. So, the first quarter is specifically problematic for Performance Chemicals.
<Q - Vincent Stephen Andrews>: Okay. And then if I could just ask a question around PV. I know solar and oil have
very different purposes, but are you seeing or hearing anything that suggests that the runway for solar is going to
change in the lower oil price environment?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: We haven't heard that yet. And I think first of all, solar is still pretty small, so having
growth rates of 20% still can occur. They're also being put into places where it is from a grid parity standpoint, in
places like China, where there's just an – they have come out to say that by 2030, they're going to be capping CO2
emissions, and some of that's got to come from an increase in their renewable energy sources, and solar is a big part of
that, as they're the largest producer of solar modules.
So, we don't see that, a short-term blip in oil, as taking the PV industry off its long-term kind of projections.
<A - Gregory R. Friedman>: Okay. So we'll take one more question.
Operator
It's from John Roberts from UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - John E. Roberts>: Morning. Nick, each year you give tax guidance in late October and then in the final two
months of the year you seem to discover a lot of new tax info. Does the seasonality of the ag business cause that or is it
perhaps your integrated tax and currency hedging that causes these big swings in the last two months of the year in
your tax outlook?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Yeah, John. Thanks for the question. You know, the last couple of years a big part of
that has been driven by the enactments around the legislation for the extenders package that were held out and then all
of a sudden we saw it brought back in. And certainly that happened this year. Held out until very late in the year, and
then granted for 2014. And as you know, in 2015 it's not in place. So I cannot use in my base tax rate the assumption
that that is going to occur. I've got to keep that out and run my books as if it's not there, and then if it gets enacted by
year-end, then I have to adjust for the full year at that point in time. So that's a big part of it. And then the other piece is,
it is difficult to get exactly the mix right of all the places in the over 90 different countries that we're operating in
exactly what the tax in those jurisdictions is going to be based on the actual sales that are going to occur there. So the
geographic mix does play a part in that. And you have to true that up at year-end. So we go through that final true-up at
year end on that piece. So those are the main drivers, John.
<Q - John E. Roberts>: And as a follow-up, does the higher pension liability affect the 2015 earnings at all, or is that
all incorporated into the fourth quarter adjustment?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: The higher pension liability will be part of the non-op pension costs. So you'll see
impact there, but it won't be part of the operating earnings piece. And really what we're talking about here is on the
funding, the unfunded portion that really took that step up of close to $4 billion, $3.7 billion. You know, it's funny, it
doesn't take much in the way of discount rate change to have a significant impact. Our rate assumptions for the
calculations changed by 80 basis points and we saw a $2.8 billion impact of that alone. So small movements as we saw
last year when it helped us, small movements can have a big impact on that unfunded position.
