MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to Accenture's third quarter fiscal 2015 earnings call.
At this time, all parties are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, instructions
will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I'd now like to turn the call over to our host, Ms. KC McClure. Please go ahead.
KC McClure
Thank you, Brad, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today on our third quarter fiscal 2015 earnings announcement.
As Brad just mentioned, I'm KC McClure, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations. With me today are Pierre
Nanterme, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and David Rowland, our Chief Financial Officer.
We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago. Let me quickly outline the
agenda for today's call. Pierre will begin with an overview of our results, David will take you through the financial
details, including the income statement and balance sheet, along with some key operational metrics for the third
quarter. Pierre will then provide a brief update on our market positioning before David provides our business outlook
for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2015. We will then take your questions before Pierre provides a wrap-up at the
end of the call.
As a reminder, when we discuss revenues during today's call, we're talking about revenues before reimbursements or
net revenues. Some of the matters we'll discuss in this call, including our business outlook, are forward looking, and as
such, are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to, the factors set forth in
today's news release and discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other
SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in this

During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful
information for investors. We include reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures, where appropriate, to GAAP in
our news release or in the Investor Relations section of our website at accenture.com. As always, Accenture assumes no
obligation to update the information presented on this conference call.
Now, let me turn the call over to Pierre.
Pierre Nanterme
Thank you, KC, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We delivered excellent results for the third quarter,
building on the momentum we created in the first half of the year. I'm particularly pleased that our strong third quarter
performance was, again, broad-based across the different dimensions of our business. We gained substantial market
share and accelerated our growth in digital-related services.
Here are a few highlights. We delivered strong new bookings of $8.5 billion, bringing us to $25.5 billion year-to-date.
We generated very strong revenue growth of 10% in local currency, with growth across all five operating groups and
all three geographic regions. We delivered earnings per share of $1.30 on an adjusted basis, a 3% increase. We
expanded operating margin 20 basis points to 15.4% on an adjusted basis. We generated solid free cash flow of $1.3
billion, and our balance sheets remain very strong, ending the quarter with a cash balance of $4 billion. And we
returned $1.2 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. So we have delivered very strong
performance for the third quarter. And as we enter the fourth quarter, I feel very good about where we are and what we
have achieved for the year to date.
Now, let me hand over to David for more details. Over to you, David.
David P. Rowland
Thanks, Pierre, and thanks to all of you for joining us on today's call.
As you heard in Pierre's comments, the strong momentum that we established in our business continued in the third
quarter as we delivered excellent financial results. We're very pleased with the ongoing execution of our growth
strategy underpinned by strong operational discipline. The underlying business drivers and key themes in the third
quarter were very consistent with the past two quarters. And importantly, we again delivered on all three imperatives
for driving shareholder value.
Starting with durable revenue growth, even with a tougher compare this quarter, we delivered 10% growth in local
currency, which represents the third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Once again, our broad-based growth
demonstrates the strength of our diversified business and our ability to drive growth above the market, resulting in
increased market share. With respect to sustainable operating margin expansion, we continue to drive value from our
strong growth by expanding operating margin 20 basis points, while continuing to invest in our business and our
people.
And finally, regarding strong cash flow and disciplined capital allocation, we generated $1.3 billion in free cash flow
and returned roughly $1.2 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. We're on track to deliver free cash
flow in excess of net income for the full-year, and while we continue our disciplined approach of returning cash to
shareholders, we also remain focused on investing in our business to acquire scale and capabilities in key growth areas.
So we're very pleased with the third quarter as our results continue to demonstrate the durability of our growth,
profitability and cash flows.
With that said, let's now turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings. New bookings were $8.5 billion for the
quarter. Consulting bookings were the second highest ever at $4.5 billion, reflecting a book-to-bill of 1.1. Outsourcing

bookings were $4 billion, also with a book-to-bill of 1.1. We were pleased with the volume of bookings for the quarter,
especially when you consider the significant headwind due to foreign exchange impacts.
The major themes in our new bookings were consistent with last quarter. We saw continued strong demand for both
digital-related services and operations, and new bookings for Application Services and consulting-related services
landed within our book-to-bill target range. Finally, we had 12 clients with bookings in excess of $100 million, giving
us 33 year-to-date, which signifies the unique and trusted relationship that we have with many of the largest companies
in the world.
Turning now to revenues, net revenues for the quarter were $7.8 billion, slightly positive growth in U.S. dollars and an
increase of 10% in local currency, reflecting a negative 10% foreign exchange impact compared to the negative 11%
impact provided in our business outlook last quarter. Adjusting for the lower FX headwind, we still came in well above
the top end of our guided range. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $4.1 billion, up 1% in USD and 11% in local
currency. Outsourcing revenues were $3.7 billion, flat in USD and an increase of 10% in local currency.
Looking broadly at the major drivers of revenue growth in the quarter, the trends we've seen in recent quarters remain
very consistent. The dominant drivers were very strong double-digit growth in digital-related services and operations.
Application Services continued to grow in a range consistent with our overall rate of growth, and strategy and
consulting services combined continued to grow in mid-single digits.
Turning to the operating groups, Communications, Media & Technology continued to lead all operating groups with
17% growth in the quarter. While growth continued to be broad-based, it was most significant in North America, the
growth markets, and communications globally. The drivers across CMT continue to be digital-related services, cost
rationalization, several large transformational projects, and demand for network-related services.
H&PS grew 10% in the quarter. We again saw significant growth in our Health business, particularly in the public
sector at U.S. federal clients and our Medicaid-related projects at state clients. Digital-related services and operations,
particularly BPO, were also strong growth drivers.
Financial Services also grew 10%, with significant growth in both capital markets and insurance. Clients continue to be
focused on three main areas, risk and regulatory, cost optimization, and digital-related services, especially in
distribution and marketing.
Products grew by 8%, led by very strong growth in consumer goods and services, life sciences, and automotive. Clients
continue to be focused on digital-related services and operational effectiveness, as they position themselves to be more
competitive in the marketplace.
Resources grew 6%, continuing the recent trend of positive growth in all three geographic regions and all industries
except energy, with particularly strong growth in utilities. The pattern of broad-based growth for outsourcing-related
services continued as clients remain focused on operational efficiency and cost rationalization.
Moving down the income statement, gross margin for the quarter was 32.5% compared with 32.8% for the same period
last year, down 30 basis points. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 11.3% of net revenues compared with
11.6% of net revenues for the third quarter last year, down 30 basis points. General and administrative expense was
5.8% of net revenues compared with 5.9% of net revenues for the third quarter last year, down 10 basis points.
As I mentioned in quarter two, this quarter we recorded a non-cash settlement charge as a result of an offer to former
employees to receive a voluntary lump-sum cash payment from our U.S. pension plan. This $64 million charge
impacted quarter three operating margin by 80 basis points and diluted earnings per share by $0.06. The following
comparisons exclude this impact and reflect adjusted results.
Operating income on an adjusted basis was $1.2 billion in the third quarter, reflecting a 15.4% operating margin, up 20
basis points compared with quarter three last year. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.7% compared
with an effective tax rate of 25% for the third quarter last year.

Net income on an adjusted basis was $889 million for the third quarter compared with net income of $882 million for
the same quarter last year. Our diluted earnings per share on an adjusted basis were $1.30 compared with EPS of $1.26
in the third quarter last year. This reflects a 3% year-over-year increase.
Turning to DSO, our days services outstanding continue to be industry-leading. They were 37 days, up from 35 days
last quarter. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.3 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of
$1.4 billion net of property and equipment additions of $114 million.
Moving to our level of cash, our cash balance at May 31 was $4 billion compared with $4.9 billion at August 31 last
year, down $900 million, as we've returned over $3.1 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends year to
date.
Moving to some other key operational metrics, we ended the quarter with a global head count of about 336,000 people,
and we now have approximately 237,000 people in our global delivery network. In quarter three our utilization was
90%, down from 91% last quarter. Attrition, which excludes involuntary terminations, was 15% compared to 14% in
both quarter two and the same period last year. Lastly, we now expect that approximately 95,000 people will join our
company in fiscal 2015.
So turning to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the third quarter we repurchased or redeemed
approximately 5.6 million shares for $518 million at an average price of $93.11 per share. Year to date, we purchased
20.8 million shares for approximately $1.8 billion at an average price of $86.16 per share. At May 31 we had
approximately $3.2 billion of share repurchase authority remaining.
Finally, as Pierre mentioned, on May 15, 2015, we made our second semi-annual dividend payment for fiscal 2015 in
the amount of $1.02 per share, bringing total dividend payments for the fiscal year to approximately $1.4 billion.
So with three quarters in the books, we're extremely pleased with our results and are now focused on quarter four and
closing out a strong year. As always, we're working hard to continue to manage our business with a high degree of rigor
and discipline, which enables us to deliver on our near-term objectives while also investing at scale for long-term
market leadership.
Now, let me turn it back to Pierre.
Pierre Nanterme
Thank you, David.
Our strong results for the quarter and year to date demonstrate that we are benefiting from the investments we've made
in key growth areas such as digital, and I'm very pleased with the leadership position we are establishing in this
important part of our business. In the third quarter, we delivered more than 30% growth in local currency in
digital-related services, which now account for more than 20% of our total revenues. Demand for digital is pervasive
across the entire business. And we are leveraging our digital capabilities in the services we provide to clients in every
industry around the world.
Here are a few examples. We are helping Pizza Hut build and operate a new cloud-based digital platform to transform
the customer experience and boost online sales. The new platform will also enable Pizza Hut to expand its digital
marketing capabilities through enhanced customer segmentation, analytics, and mobility.
We are working with a leading global shipbuilding company to deploy an Internet of Things connected platform to
enable real-time monitoring of its shipping fleet. We will use over 100 different kinds of sensors to provide preventive
maintenance and spare parts optimization. And we are helping Rio Tinto, the global mining company, accelerate its
journey to become a digital business by migrating its enterprise IT systems to an as-a-service solution on the Accenture
cloud platform. Rio Tinto expect to realize significant cost savings, as well as increased agility from the consumption
based pricing model.

At the same time, we continue to invest to further differentiate Accenture and to scale our capabilities in order to
capture new growth opportunities in the marketplace. In Accenture Strategy, we announced two acquisitions in the
third quarter that further enhance our capabilities. We acquired Axial Limited, a U.S.-based strategy services provider
with expertise in life sciences, health and consumer good industries. And in May, we announced the acquisition of
Javelin Group, a U.K.-based strategy consulting provider with significant digital expertise in the retail industry.
In Accenture Digital, we are rapidly scaling our capabilities to bring innovative solutions to clients to enable digital
transformation. Just last week, we announced that we are joining forces with Fast Retailing in Japan to develop
digitally enabled consumer services across the retailer's seven global brands including UNIQLO.
Through this joint initiative, we are developing new digital business models to drive transformation in the retail
industry and beyond. We opened the Accenture Interactive Innovation Center at our technology lab in Sophia Antipolis
in France. This is all about providing clients with an immersive experience that brings to life the latest digital
technologies for engaging with customers in new and innovative ways.
We are expanding Fjord, the leading design and innovation group within Accenture Interactive. We recently opened
new design studios in São Paulo, Milan and Sydney and now we have 15 Fjord design studios around the world. And
with Accenture Mobility, it is now one of the world's leading developers of mobile apps. Leveraging the capabilities of
our Global Delivery center, we have now developed over 1,000 apps across nearly all industries.
Turning to the geographic dimension of our business, in the third quarter, we delivered strong growth in local currency
and gained significant market share across all three of our geographic regions. In North America, we delivered very
strong 12% revenue growth in local currency, driven by continued double-digit growth in the United States, where we
are strengthening our position as the market leader.
In Europe, I'm very pleased with our growth of 7% in local currency, driven primarily by Spain, the United Kingdom,
Germany, and the Netherlands. And in growth markets, we delivered very strong revenue growth of 13% in local
currency driven by double digit growth in Japan, Australia and Brazil, our largest markets in this region.
So, with the first three quarters of the year behind us, I'm extremely pleased with our results. We have excellent
momentum in our business and I feel confident that we are well-positioned to deliver a very strong fiscal year 2015. In
a market environment that remain uncertain and fast-changing, innovation, agility, and flexibility are more than ever
the name of the game. And we remain extraordinarily focused on executing our strategy to deliver sustainable
profitable growth.
With that, I will turn the call over to David to provide our business outlook for fiscal year 2015. David, over to you.
David P. Rowland
Thank you, Pierre. Let me now turn to our business outlook.
For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we expect revenues to be in the range of $7.45 billion to $7.70 billion. This
assumes the impact of foreign exchange will be a negative 10% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.
For the full fiscal 2015, based upon how rates have been trending over the past few weeks, we now assume the impact
of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be negative 7.5% compared to fiscal 2014. For the full fiscal 2015, we now
expect our net revenue to be in the range of 9% to 10% growth in local currency over fiscal 2014. For the full fiscal
2015, we continue to expect new bookings to be in the range of $33 billion to $35 billion.
As I mentioned previously in May, we recorded a non-cash settlement charge of $64 million which will impact
full-year 2015 operating margin by 20 basis points and diluted earnings per share by $0.06. Our guidance for full-year
fiscal 2015 excludes this impact.
For operating margin on an adjusted basis, we continue to expect fiscal 2015 to be 14.4% to 14.6% a 10 to 30 basis
point expansion over fiscal 2014 results. On an adjusted basis, we continue to expect our annual effective tax rate to be

in the range of 26% to 27%.
For earnings per share on an adjusted basis, we now expect EPS for fiscal 2015 to be in the range of $4.73 to $4.78 or
5% to 6% growth over fiscal 2014 results. This EPS range includes a $0.02 increase due to the lower FX headwind and
a $0.05 increase to the lower end of the range as a result of narrowing the revenue growth range.
Turning to cash flow for the full fiscal 2015, we now expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $3.8 billion to
$4.1 billion, property and equipment additions to now be approximately $400 million and we continue to expect free
cash flow to be in the range of $3.4 billion to $3.7 billion.
Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $3.8 billion through dividends and share repurchases and also continue
to expect to reduce weighted average diluted shares outstanding by approximately 2% as we remain committed to
returning a substantial portion of cash to our shareholders.
With that, let's open it up so that we can take questions. KC?
KC McClure
Thanks, David. I'd ask that you each keep to one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as possible to
ask a question. Brad, would you provide instructions for those on the call, please?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Hi, guys. Good morning. Pretty good results here, looks very similar to last quarter. I saw that
digital accelerated though up towards 30% on a constant-currency basis. I think that was up from 20%. Just curious if
that offset anything that slowed or anything that was weaker than last quarter?
<A - David P. Rowland>: No, I don't think it's indicative of a weakness in another area. Last quarter, we said digital
growth was over 20%. And we did see an uptick and I think some of the drivers behind that were pretty evident in
Pierre's comments as he described our Digital business and how it continues to evolve in a very positive way.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yeah. And when we talk about digital-related services, we're talking about all digital
activities we have across our five businesses: Accenture Strategy, Accenture Consulting, Accenture Digital, Accenture
Technology, and Accenture Operations. So all of our five businesses are growing across the board with an accelerated
growth with digital-related services.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Okay. And just as a follow-up, I saw the operating cash flow adjustment for the full year. Just
curious what caused that. And then how much did acquisitions contribute to the revenue growth? Thanks.
<A - David P. Rowland>: The acquisition growth continues to be in the range of what we've talked about before, so in
that 1% to 1.5% range. On the cash flow, there's really not anything notable. There's some puts and takes in there but
really not anything significant to note.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Okay, thanks so much.

<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: Good morning, great results. I'll ask on the gross margin, if that's okay. It was definitely
better than we expected. I'm just curious if this trend is sustainable, if we could go back to what we saw in the first half.
I guess ultimately just trying to gauge if some of these drivers like contract profitability and industry subcontractors are
performing better.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Hey, good morning, Tien-Tsin. Again, when I look at profitability and I don't mean to be
redundant on this but let me just restate the things that I focus on in the context of our quarter three results. So, the first
thing that I look at is the trend in our contract profitability and we were pleased with our contract profitability. It was
up year-over-year for both consulting and outsourcing, and it was up year-over-year in total. And that has an
influencing factor on gross margin but it's certainly not the only influencing factor.
The second thing that I look at for our overall profitability is the evolution of our labor costs in relation to our revenue
growth. And that pattern continued as we've seen in the first half of this year where we were very pleased with being
able to manage our labor cost efficiently but I should add, at the same time, investing in our people through actions that
we have taken through the year including in the third quarter with respect to promotions and salary increases.
And then I really look at those two things primarily in the context of, are those things progressing to the point that we're
creating headroom so that we can invest in our business while at the same time drive the profitability or GAAP margin
expansion, in this quarter our adjusted margin expansion, to support the objectives that we communicate externally?
And all of those things happened as planned in the third quarter.
So in terms of evolution of gross margin, Tien-Tsin, as you know, I don't really guide or make forward-looking
statements on gross margin because we focus on operating margin. It does ebb and flow in different quarters across the
year. But if we have the right evolution of contract profitability and the right evolution of our payroll efficiency then,
frankly, everything is clicking from a profitability standpoint and that's what we focus on.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: All right, great. That's perfect. That's helpful context. As my follow-up, I know Bryan asked
one on acquisitions, I wanted to ask just to your philosophy if we should expect more of the same here, sort of buying
or tucking in some of these smaller businesses. And I'm curious. I know culture is very important. Any surprises in
terms of retention of some of the people that you brought in with some of these deals? So just trying to understand the
retention and how the culture is meshing and then also if the philosophy could change here? Could you do larger deals
given sort of the big appetite on acquisitions? Thanks.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Good question. We have overall been very pleased with our experience with companies that
we've acquired really over the last two or three years. I'll remind you that, at this point, we have acquired roughly 45
companies or so. So we're not novices at – I'm talking about over, let's say, over the last two and a half to three years.
So we have become very experienced in executing our inorganic strategy. And an important part of that is the approach
that we take to integrating and assimilating the companies that we buy.
And we're fundamentally a people-based business so we're especially tuned into that with respect to integrating and
assimilating the people in these companies that we acquire and our experience has been positive in terms of the
retention and assimilating them into our culture very quickly. And again, as we've mentioned before, the financial
returns have been certainly in line with our expectations and, in many cases, better.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Absolutely, we all have been very clear on our acquisition strategy. Do we want to leverage
our cash to make acquisition in order to further enhance our capabilities and get more differentiation? The answer is
yes. We are looking at acquisition from very specific areas, as you know, from deep expertise in consulting and
strategy from an industry standpoint to digital native organization to companies with a big footprint in operations. I'm
thinking about Procurian as an illustration.
And we will continue to do so and look at the kind of acquisition we believe we could get an excellent return, and that's
going to further improve our differentiation, our competitiveness and our relevance in the business. And so far, frankly,
I'm very pleased. I've found even David a bit neutral on this.

I'm less neutral. I think we have an excellent return on the investment we made. It is making good impact in the
marketplace. I'm thinking about Fjord, I'm thinking about Acquity, I'm thinking about Procurian where clearly we are
taking leading position in these different areas. Not only we have a good retention but we are scaling further the
acquisition we made.
I announced in this call that we are significantly and rapidly scaling Fjord, our design and innovation studio in
Accenture Interactive where we have now 15 design studio around the world and more to come. So we will continue
executing this strategy against the parameters we set, and we will continue to further improve Accenture.

<A - David P. Rowland>: Good morning, Brian.
<Q - Brian L. Essex>: Good morning, and thank you for taking the question. I was wondering if I could dig in a little
bit on Health & Public Services. And given the contract wins you have there, particularly some of the material ones in
the state and federal business, what impact do those wins have on your profitability? Particularly as we hear some of
your competitors, as they bring on some of these larger contracts that are less profitable up front, how do you manage
those and how can we expect that segment to kind of grow and the contribution to profitability going forward?
<A - David P. Rowland>: We've been very pleased with the progression of our profitability in H&PS broadly and in
health specifically. When you're talking about some of the recent wins, of course, we don't talk about contracts
specifically, but as a general philosophy, we're in the business of driving profitable growth and we look at every client
and contract opportunity against that objective. And so we don't put business on the books that doesn't support our
near-term and really mid and long-term financial objectives.
So we're quite pleased with the health of our Health & Public Service business. We're actually very excited about the
opportunities that we see in health, which is growing strong double digits as an industry and are very encouraged about
what the opportunities in the future hold for us.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yes, I'm very pleased with H&PS. It's certainly an area where we invested, I guess, wisely in
getting the return. As mentioned by David, Health segment been growing double digit for many years now, many
quarters in the world. And if I'm looking at our business in both federal or in local state, it's exactly moving in the right
direction and growing and all this H&PS business is accretive to Accenture. So we are pleased with that and again, it's
all a question of how you differentiate the type of services you're providing.
In healthcare, we decided to be extremely digital-rich by being among the first to deliver a digital health record,
connected healthcare and a very significant differentiation in healthcare. If you look in terms of public sector, we've
been among the first to launch the local exchange insurance centers and you know how much it's important.
Now, in federal, we recently invested in Agilex to bring more digital-rich services in the context of our federal
business. So again, for us the name of the game is always the same, is to avoid commoditization and low value services
in each and every industry and to relentlessly focus on where we could bring innovation and differentiation in each and
every industry at Accenture.
<Q - Brian L. Essex>: That's very helpful. And maybe if I could follow up on some of the previous M&A comments,
are you seeing a change in the competitive environment with smaller, maybe more specialized firms as a result of all
the recent M&A activity that we've seen in the market recently? In particular as you may be competing with them in
certain contracts, are your win rates changing at all?

<A - Pierre Nanterme>: No, I don't think we see any significant change in all the landscape from an acquisition
standpoint. Everybody is trying to find the right nugget and the right company. So far, David mentioned that we
acquired between 40 and 50 companies these last three years, in the range of 45. And we're pleased with the companies
we integrated, and it's a very competitive market because everybody's looking to buy a company who's going to bring
differentiation.
I think we are differentiating ourselves in this acquisition market with our brand. I tend to believe without being
arrogant at all that our brand is serving us very well as a magnet for talent. We have a very strong brand, highly
recognized companies. We are contacting, are recognizing that Accenture is a good company to work with, with a good
culture, with a good client service DNA, and always trying to do the right thing. And in the acquisition environment,
having an excellent reputation, a strong brand, and being recognized for performance, culture, and operating with
seriousness is a competitive advantage.
<Q - Brian L. Essex>: That's very helpful, thank you.

And our next question comes from Lou Miscioscia with CLSA. Please go ahead.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Good morning, Lou.
<Q - Louis R. Miscioscia>: Hey. Good quarter, guys. If we go into App Services, you guys mentioned that that was an
area of strength. So one, just curious as to how much App Services do you see still hidden within companies that you
could pull out, possibly drive a multiyear growth rate there. And then secondarily, I hear that you're starting to get more
competitive and going after business against the Indian outsourcers. Is that the case and is that a bit of change of
strategy?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: I'm very pleased you're asking a question with what we are calling Accenture because indeed
it is a very important business for Accenture. It's a very significant part of the technology market, and we have set a
very specific strategy to compete in Application Services on both ends of this market.
On one hand of Application Services, you have application development and maintenance. And in Accenture, we are
actually competitive with our Global Delivery Network in this market, which is more a market where you need to
rationalize the technology operations of clients. And then on the other end of the Application Services market, you have
the capability building, solution building. And Accenture as well is very well positioned to capture the opportunity to
build new solutions in Application Services.
All of our job with our clients is to look at this Application Services and to make sure that the money, if you will, they
are saving in application maintenance and development through leveraging offshore, through productivity, through
automation, which we provide, a lot will be reinvested in capability building and new technology solutions and
Accenture operating on both sides and at both ends of the spectrum is a very good position to be the partner of our
clients in making this reinvestment possible. That's why I'm very pleased to see that all in all Application Services at
Accenture has been growing very well again this quarter.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Right, absolutely.
<Q - Louis R. Miscioscia>: Okay. And a quick follow-up is on the consulting side. Any change or maybe let me ask it
this way, who do you see the most from the consulting side, especially in the U.S.? Thank you.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Competition is remaining extremely, I would say, traditional. I do not see much change. In
consulting, we would compete typically against what everybody's calling the big four, the Deloitte, the Ernst & Young,
the KPMG. Probably, Deloitte and Ernst & Young, if you want me to say two, would be the companies we are typically
competing against. And we love that.

And our next question comes from Lisa Ellis with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Good morning, Lisa.
<Q - Lisa D. Ellis>: Hey, guys. Good morning. Can you do a quick update on the four cost-related initiatives that you
had laid out at your Investor Day last fall? Particularly in light – I guess I'm looking at the head count growth numbers
which have been running ahead of constant currency revenue growth for four quarters or so, which I think implies some
pyramid mix shifting. So could you give us a bit of an update on that front?
<A - David P. Rowland>: For the benefit of other listeners, there were four areas of focus for expanding our margins,
both near term and over a longer-term horizon. The first thing that I called out was our focus on managing each of the
five dimensions. Pierre mentioned those earlier. I mentioned them in my script, in a fit-for-purpose way, recognizing
that each of those dimensions has a different economic profile, from the price points in the marketplace to the
cost-to-serve points to how much we invest, management and overhead, et cetera.
And on that front, we have made very good progress this year as we continue to take our organization up the maturity
curve or the adoption curve for our new growth strategy and really reorienting how we manage and drive our business
fundamentally around those five dimensions. And I see evidence of that, for example, in the way we approach pricing
for our strategy services and our consulting services in a much more differentiated way than we would've been doing
certainly a year ago, 18 months ago, 24 months ago, as one example. So I think we're making good progress.
The other thing I called out was leveraging our talent-based model, which is also aligned with these five dimensions, as
a way to manage our workforce, our talent, and the associated market relevant labor cost in a more fit-for-purpose,
more granular way. And everything we're doing to evolve how we manage our talent, how we develop careers, and also
how we do compensation management and planning is progressing nicely against that objective. And that certainly has
been one of the contributing factor to our profitability so far.
I mentioned portfolio optimization as a third area. Again, we are making progress on that front in terms of raising the
game of all of the P&L runners around Accenture so that they look at our business across the portfolio and are turning
dials to optimize the total by looking more discretely at the individual pieces.
And then underpinning all of that was our ongoing efforts in operational efficiency, the cost of running the
organization. That includes, for example, our business management functions, finance, HR, marketing, and we have
made very good progress this year across all of those functions in the efficiency of those organizations. So, Lisa, we're
very pleased. A lot of work to do, it's ongoing but we're very pleased with the progress we've made so far.
<Q - Lisa D. Ellis>: Terrific, thanks.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Thank you.
<Q - Lisa D. Ellis>: And then on my follow-up, can you give a bit of an update on Accenture Operations? I think of
Accenture Operations as typically more outsourcing-related work. You've had some mix shift here into the shorter
duration consulting work, heavily digital-driven, I imagine. Can you just give some highlights on the operation side?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Sure, it's nice to hear from you, Lisa. I hope you're doing well. On the operations, indeed, we
created something very special and I'm pleased to have a couple of minutes to mention the good progress and the
positioning we're taking on operations. As you know, in Accenture we're not using anymore or much more the

terminology consulting and outsourcing. And that's something especially in the area there we will continue to comment
on how we see the market in professional and business services evolving.
And when we created Accenture Operations, we're creating a very unique capability in the marketplace, I don't believe
that anyone else has been building a similar capability, with two major capabilities in it, one which is around
infrastructure services, where you will find as much consulting and outsourcing in it. So it's a combination of services
from cloud-related services, leveraging the Accenture Cloud platform, from high-value services in security and from,
indeed, infrastructure outsourcing.
And the other significant capability is going to be around business process management, if you will, where again we
are providing business process more and more as a service platform based in the cloud as an illustration, and think
about what we are doing, which is extremely leading edge with procurement, where we are probably the first in the
industry to provide procurement as a service platform-based with an economic model on the consumption and on a per
transaction.
So operation is indeed already a combination of consulting and outsourcing. And this is what you're going to see more
and more in Accenture is the richness of the services we are providing will come from the integration of consulting and
outsourcing services in a new economic model on leading edge platforms.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Thank you, Lisa.
<Q - Lisa D. Ellis>: Thank you, guys.
Operator
And our next question will come from James Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - James Schneider>: Good morning, thanks for taking my question. I just want to ask about consulting versus
outsourcing for a moment. Consulting continues to get momentum and maybe even accelerating, but outsourcing seems
to be decelerating somewhat. So I was wondering what you put that down to. Is that mainly clients trimming on
maintenance to fund strategic initiatives, or is it something else? And do you see a way to where outsourcing could
actually start to inflect higher again?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Jim, thanks for the question. Again, let me direct you back to – because I think it's important
to just reinforce the dot connecting between the consulting and outsourcing and the five dimensions of our business.
And again, as we introduced the five dimensions of our business at IA day, the reason we're moving in this direction is
because this is reflective of where the market is moving.
And so again, when you look at our five dimensions of Strategy, Consulting, App Services and Operations with Digital
across all four, if you relate that back to consulting as a type of work, which we've talked about historically, that
includes strategy, consulting and a part of Application Services to be clear. And if you look at outsourcing, that
includes a part of Application Services and most of Operations. And so we really think that it's more helpful to talk
about our business in the new dimensions.
And so again, if you look at strategy and consulting as more of the traditionally consulting-centric part of our business,
that grew mid-single digits again, which is a very good growth rate relative to the market. If you look at Application
Services, which has components of consulting and outsourcing, using our historical vernacular, systems integration and
application outsourcing, that grew mid-single digits (sic) [Application Outsourcing grew mid-single digits]. And the
thing that's unique about Accenture in that space, as Pierre explained very clearly, is our ability to play across the
spectrum of services within Application Services.
From the application maintenance side, which has one set of buyer values and economic profile, to the deployment of
technology, which is part of the Application Services market space, which has a different set of buyer values and
economic profile. That (sic) [Application Services] grew again roughly at the average of Accenture, so in that 10% plus
or minus range. And then when you look at operations, it was strong double digit. And so really, when you think about

our business and what's driving the growth, think about it in those terms because I think you'll find that to be most
helpful.
<Q - James Schneider>: That's helpful, thanks. And then as a follow-up, I just want to ask a question about some
color on short-term versus longer-dated bookings. Can you maybe give us a sense of whether the short-term bookings
continue to be a dominant source of the growth? And can you maybe talk about roughly, or if you can quantify it, what
percentage of revenue was both booked and billed in the quarter versus what that was, say, a year ago?
<A - David P. Rowland>: I can't really comment on the latter. What I will say is that we had signaled I think maybe
the latter half of last year and even earlier this year that we were seeing a characteristic of our bookings where a higher
percentage of our bookings was converting to revenue within a four-quarter period. And what I would say is that trend
has remained pretty consistent. We continue to see a nice chunk of our bookings, so the bookings in the quarter, a nice
chunk of that that will convert to revenue in the next four quarters. And of course, that has been part of the story for our
strong growth rates over the last – really not only the last three quarters, but really quarter three and quarter four of last
year.
<Q - James Schneider>: Great, that's helpful. Thank you.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Thank you, Jim.
Operator
And our next question comes from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Daniel R. Perlin>: Thanks, so digital, clearly, pretty impressive. It looks like it accounted for roughly 60% of
your growth in the quarter. The question that I have more specifically around your labor pool is the cost of the digital
labor pool is clearly a lot more expensive. And I know you're talking about these pillars and managing it, but I'm
thinking more specifically like, what is it in terms of differential as we think about that? And then what specifically are
you able to do to manage that talent pool cost? Because if it's accounting for 60% of growth, I'm also wondering. Is
there a head count correlation that's starting to decouple longer term with that pool and that's going to help it? That's
my first question.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: On these labor costs, what we are doing in Accenture, and it's no different in digital, is to
make sure that we have the right mix of skills and the right locations for our skills. If you look in this digital space, we
have now roughly 28,000 people working in that environment. And these 28,000, it's very interesting because you will
see, as you might suspect, extraordinary I would call them high-calibers. I'm thinking about the business scientists we
are hiring. I'm thinking about the PhDs we are hiring to drive algorithms in Accenture analytics. And I'm thinking as
well about some leading-edge designers we are hiring for Fjord, our design group at Accenture.
And on the other side of the spectrum, you will see that we are now one of the largest enterprise apps developers in the
world. All this app development is done in our centers from India, as an illustration. And they are marvelous as
developer from India, and we are leveraging part of the global delivery network for digital to deliver apps services. I'm
thinking about analytics. We have as well, very strong people in our delivery centers who are every day doing analytic
work from the GDN and from a lower-cost location. So it's no different in digital from the rest of Accenture, where we
are always looking to put the right people at the right place with the right cost, so we make sure that we have the right
skills, that we are cost competitive. It's exactly the same with digital.
<Q - Daniel R. Perlin>: Okay. And then shifting gears for a second, I wanted to ask an M&A question, but not
pertaining to the businesses that you want to acquire. It's more a function of all the businesses globally that have been
doing M&A, and I'm just wondering. To what extent are you seeing that driving business maybe let's say into your
consulting business, as I would think you would be a top-of-list company to be thinking about in terms of helping the
integration of those companies?

<A - David P. Rowland>: You're talking about Accenture working with our clients, helping them with the integration
of companies they're buying. Certainly, I think we do that in essentially all of our industries. That is a space that we
operate in, and it plays very well to really the full spectrum of our service offerings. From the strategic aspects of that
to the consulting side of that, where we're integrating the business, the business processes, the organization, et cetera,
rationalizing the systems from the acquired company, and then also driving the cost efficiency agenda, introducing and
extending our operations capability as part of those transactions. And so it's certainly a typical type of work that we see
where our large clients engage us to do that.
<Q - Daniel R. Perlin>: But is the pace of play on that increasing or similar to what we've seen in the past? Thanks.
Sorry.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: I think consolidation been everywhere. You have some waves in some industries. I'm
thinking about we have a very significant wave in banking post-2008, 2009 and 2010, and we've been one of the
leading organization in doing post-merger integration, a lot in communication when you're just reading the papers and
see what's going on in communication, and we might expect more to come in the energy industry for good and valid
reasons.

And our next question comes from James Freedman with Susquehanna.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Good morning, Jamie.
<Q - Jams E. Friedman>: Hey. Good morning, guys. I was hoping to drill in a bit, if I could, on the eleven $100
million – thirty-three $100 million-plus deals that you've signed in the quarter and year to date. If you were to look at
those with the lens of the operating groups, is there anything to call out there? Are they more populated in one or the
other, or do they roughly parallel the growth of the OGs themselves.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: I guess when we are – we're checking a bit, but if I'm looking back on the past few quarters,
and I don't believe that this quarter is untypical compared to all the quarters, the number of these transaction across –
above the $100 million, which is the threshold we are communicating every quarter, it's quite well-spread across all our
operating groups and potentially as well from a geographic standpoint. Now, what – and I'm pleased you're giving me
the opportunity to re-emphasize that message about being very pleased that our growth is very well balanced across the
different dimensions of our business, industries and geographies.
<A - David P. Rowland>: I would – if you look at the quarter, for example, and you look at the 12, as I'm glancing at
the list, for example, all five operating groups were represented on the list. And so it's – I guess, it really reflects this
broad-based kind of theme that we've been talking about, is that all of the operating groups have, as a part of their
portfolio, these larger transformational-type relationships, and the pattern is really as you would expect. Okay?
<Q - Jams E. Friedman>: Okay, thank you. And then...
<A - David P. Rowland>: Thank you.
<Q - Jams E. Friedman>: ...if I could ask one follow-up.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Sure.
<Q - Jams E. Friedman>: So it's great to see Brazil coming back. I wanted to ask about the growth markets in general,
but specifically to Brazil, the – is that – because it's a hard one to predict, but is – do you see that as sustainable? Is
Brazil on track to continue in this acceleration?

<A - Pierre Nanterme>: As I will comment on the past, more than on the future, but I'm pleased you're asking the
question because I'm not doing that often during call, but I would like to recognize one of our greatest leader at
Accenture, namely, Gianfranco Casati. We appointing Gianfranco Casati was been one of our best leader at Accenture,
leading products for many years and leading the growth markets.
Gianfranco Casati is now located in Singapore to lead the growth market, and you have a natural correlation between
putting a great leader and the results in the growth markets. So I'm not surprised at all with the return we have made on
Gianfranco investment, if you will, and we have growth in Japan, Australia, in Brazil. Part of the growth in Brazil, of
course, is the recovery, is probably a kind of catch-up. But now, we are beyond the catch-up mode. And I guess what
we see in Brazil, likewise the other markets, is how our strategy of rotating the Accenture business to be more
digital-rich and cloud services-rich, what we tend now to call the new, if you will, is paying off. So again, all the
markets, they have a potential if you find the right entry point, and to that, the right entry point around the world is this
unique combination of digital-related services and cloud-enabled services. So if you're digital-rich and cloud-rich, then
you have probably the right formula to drive more growth in each and every market.
<Q - Jams E. Friedman>: Thank you.
<A - KC McClure>: Brad, we have time for one more quick question, then Pierre will wrap up the call.
Operator
Thank you. And that will come from Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Good morning, Jason.
<Q - Jason Alan Kupferberg>: Good morning. I'll make it quick here and try to wrap two into one, because they're
short. First one is just margins and rough GDN mix of digital versus the corporate average. And then what categories of
competitors do you think you're taking share from in general around the globe?
<A - David P. Rowland>: The GDN mix for digital versus the rest would be very similar. It's not a – overall, on
average, because you have to remember, digital is in – is reflected in Application Services, is reflected in operations,
consulting and strategy. So it would be roughly reflective of the average.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: From a competition standpoint, of course, we respect all our competitors and we love all of
them. If I'm looking at the dynamic, I would say the fierce competition is more on balance coming from the name I
mentioned before, among the big four, and the Indian pure players. So by contrast, you will see against who we are left
competing now.
<Q - Jason Alan Kupferberg>: Okay.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: All right, I think it's time for closing, KC. Right?
<A - KC McClure>: Yes.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Okay, thank you.
Pierre Nanterme
So thanks, again, for joining us on today's call. Given our performance year to date and the strong momentum in our
business, I feel confident in our ability to deliver our revised business outlook. The investments we made in strategic
acquisitions, in assets and solutions, and in the skills of our people have produced strong results so far. And we will
continue executing our strategy to seize the opportunities in the marketplace and deliver value for our clients, for our
people and for our shareholders. We look forward to talking with you again next quarter. In the meantime, if you have
any question, please feel free to call KC. All the best.
