O. B. Grayson Hall
Thank you, Dana. Good morning and thank you for joining our call today. Our third quarter results reflect continued
momentum in 2016 and demonstrate that we are successfully executing our strategic plan. We are pleased with our
continued progress on fundamentals, despite a challenging operating environment. Dave is going to take you through
the details shortly, but let me just provide a few highlights.
For the quarter, we reported earnings available to common shareholders of $304 million and earnings per share of
$0.24. There are number of items that impacted the quarter, which we will address as we review the results, but all in
all a good quarter and a solid quarter for Regions.
We delivered solid revenue growth by increasing deposits and non-interest income. Total adjusted revenue increased
5% over the third quarter of 2015, driven by strong adjusted non-interest growth of 12%, clear evidence that our
investments are paying off. Notably, capital markets and wealth management both produced record quarters. As part of
our continuing effort to grow and diversify our revenue, we recently announced the acquisition of low income housing
tax credit corporate fund syndication and asset management business of First Sterling Financial. This acquisition
complements our existing low income housing tax credit origination business, and further expands our capital market
capabilities and our ability to serve our customers.
With respect to market conditions, the global macroeconomic environment continue to remain somewhat challenging.
As such, it's critical that we focus on things that are within our power to control. And to that end, we remain committed
to disciplined expense management and are on pace to achieve our 2016 efficiency and operating goals.
Our plan to eliminate $300 million of core expenses over the next three years is clearly under way. However, based on
current expectations for continued low-rate, low-growth environment, we have determined that additional expense
eliminations are necessary to operate in this environment to go beyond the $300 million amount. To that end, we have
targeted additional $100 million, which we expect to achieve by 2019. In total, this $400 million represents 11.5% of
our adjusted expense base.
Turning to asset quality for just a moment. We continue to see some stress in certain segments, given where we are in
the cycle, but we view our overall asset quality as stable today. In addition, the continued stabilization of oil prices has
positively impacted certain credit metrics. With regards to loans, we continue to exercise caution and remain focused
on prudent and quality loan growth.
Regarding business lending, average loans are down modestly on a year-over-year basis. We continued to experience
muted customer demand and heavy competition in the business segment, particularly in the middle market commercial
and small business sectors. We're also seeing some large corporate customers accessing capital markets and are using
these proceeds to pay down bank debt.
In addition, we experienced 100 basis points decline in the line utilization of commercial customers during the quarter.
Corporate customers remain focused on liquidity, which is evidenced by a 2% increase in average Corporate Bank
segment deposits. Excluding the impact of public funds, average deposits in the Corporate Bank at Regions are up 5%.

In addition, direct energy loans continue to pay down or pay off. And over the past two quarters, we have seen a
favorable decline of approximately $500 million on a point-to-point basis and approximately $300 million on a linked
quarter basis.
It's important to point out that while reduced demand is impacting industry, we are deliberately limiting production in
certain areas. For example, investor real estate in particular is an area where we remain guarded. We're also limiting
exposure specifically to multi-family and medical office buildings. Year-to-date, in these – outstanding balances in
these portfolios have declined approximately $300 million combined on a point-to-point basis.
Importantly, we continue to focus on achieving appropriate risk-adjusted returns within our business, portfolios and
relationships. Now, we believe this approach will lead to quality loan growth in the future. Despite market uncertainty,
the overall health of the consumer remains strong and we continue to see solid demand and steady growth in almost all
of our consumer loan categories.
With respect to capital, we're encouraged by recent regulatory directions and comments, and the subsequent notice of
proposed rulemaking, which we believe will be constructive for Regions. That said, our capital deployment priorities
remain unchanged. First and foremost, we are focused on prudent organic growth. We will also continue to evaluate
strategic alternatives that increase revenue or reduce operating expenses, while returning an appropriate amount of
capital to our shareholders. Year-to-date, we have returned approximately 99% of our earnings to shareholders through
dividends and share repurchases.
In closing, our third quarter results reflect the continued execution of our plans and our commitment to our three
primary strategic initiatives, which are, number one, grow and diversify revenue streams, two is to practice discipline in
expense management, and three, to effectively deploy our capital.
With that, I'll turn it over to Dave, who will cover the details for the third quarter. Dave?
David J. Turner, Jr.
Thank you and good morning, everyone. As Grayson noted, several items impacted the third quarter, and I'll speak to
each of them as we move through the results. So let's get started with the balance sheet and look at average loans.
Average loan balances totaled $81 billion in the third quarter, down 1% from the previous quarter. Consumer lending
experienced another solid quarter of growth, as average consumer loan balances increased $302 million, or 1% over the
prior quarter. This growth was led by mortgage lending as balances increased $259 million linked quarter, reflecting
another seasonally strong quarter of production. We continue to have success with our other indirect lending portfolio,
which includes point-of-sale initiatives. This portfolio increased $93 million linked quarter, or 14%. Average balances
in our consumer credit card portfolio increased $44 million, or 4%, as penetration into our existing deposit customer
base increased to 18.2%, an improvement of 50 basis points.
And turning to the indirect auto portfolio, average balances decreased $36 million during the quarter. We continue to
focus on growing our preferred dealer network, while exiting certain smaller dealers. In addition, we remained focused
on achieving appropriate risk-adjusted returns in this portfolio. And average home equity balances decreased $94
million as the pace of run-off exceeded production.
And turning to the business services portfolio, as Grayson mentioned, the decrease in average business services loans
during the quarter was driven by an approximate $300 million decline in average direct energy loans. In addition, loan
growth was impacted by a continued softness in demand for middle market commercial and small business loans.
Furthermore, we are remaining disciplined with our management of concentration risk limits and a continued focus on
achieving appropriate risk-adjusted returns.
More specifically, we are limiting our exposure to multi-family and medical office buildings. And as a result, total
business lending average balances decreased $979 million, or 2%, during the quarter. Despite this decline, there are
areas within business services experiencing growth, such as technology and defense and asset-based lending. And we

continue – expect to continue to leverage our go-to-market strategy of local bankers working with industry and product
specialists to deliver the entire bank to our customers to meet their particular needs.
Related, we're also making progress with our focus on profitability and are using capital more effectively. Through
July, we have achieved greater relevance in a number of large corporate relationships and improved our risk-adjusted
returns on these loans over 200 basis points. Let's take a look at deposits.
Total average deposit balances increased $439 million from the previous quarter, including $330 million of growth in
average low-cost deposits. Deposit costs remain near historically low levels at 12 basis points and total funding costs
remain low, totaling 30 basis points for the quarter.
Total average deposits in the Consumer segment were up $483 million, or 1%, in the quarter, reflecting the strength of
our retail franchise, the overall health of the consumer, and our ability to grow low-cost deposits. As previously noted,
average Corporate segment deposits increased $675 million, or 2%, during the quarter, as corporate customers remain
focused on liquidity. Average deposits in the Wealth Management segment decreased $637 million, or 6%, during the
quarter as certain institutional and corporate trust customer deposits, which require collateralization by securities,
continued to shift out of deposits and into other fee income-producing customer investments.
So let's see how all this impacted our results. Net interest income and other financing income on a fully taxable basis
was $856 million, a decrease of $13 million, or 1%, from the second quarter. The resulting net interest margin was
3.06%. Net interest income and other financing income was negatively impacted by a $7 million leveraged lease
residual value adjustment, and this adjustment reduced net interest margin by 3 basis points.
In addition, historically low rates experienced in the second and third quarters of 2016 caused prepayments in our
mortgage-backed securities book to increase, resulting in higher premium amortization of approximately $13 million
during the quarter. However, given the recent moves to modestly higher long-term rates, we expect $4 million to $6
million of improvement in premium amortization during the fourth quarter.
And lastly, lower average loan balances further reduced net interest income and other financing income in the quarter.
These reductions were partially offset by higher short-term rates, one additional day in the quarter, and our debt
deleveraging that we executed this quarter. So if you exclude the impact of the $7 million leveraged lease residual
value adjustment and the expected $4 million premium amortization improvement, net interest income and other
financing income for the third quarter would have been approximately $867 million on a fully taxable equivalent basis
and a margin of 3.09%, and we believe the fourth quarter will approximate these amounts.
Non-interest income increased 14% in the quarter and included the impact of $47 million of insurance proceeds
associated with the previously disclosed settlement related to FHA-insured mortgage loans. Adjusted non-interest
income growth was particularly strong in the third quarter and reflected our deliberate efforts to grow and diversify
revenue. Almost every non-interest revenue category increased, driven by record capital markets and wealth
management income and growth in card and ATM fees, resulting in a 5% increase compared to the second quarter.
Capital markets fee income grew $4 million, or 11%, during the quarter, driven primarily by the mergers and
acquisition advisory services group. Card and ATM income increased $6 million, or 6%, during the quarter, driven by
an increase in the number of active cards and spend volume. Wealth management income increased $4 million, or 4%,
during the quarter, driven by increased investment management and trust fees, as assets under administration increased
5% from $88.1 billion to $92.6 billion.
Mortgage income was stable during the quarter as increased gains from loan sales were offset by declines in the market
valuation of mortgage servicing rights and related hedging activity. Within total mortgage production, 67% was related
to purchase activity and 33% was related to refinancing.
Also during the quarter, we completed a bulk purchase for the rights to service approximately $2.8 billion of mortgage
loans. And year-to-date, we purchased the rights to service approximately $6 billion of mortgage loans and our
mortgage portfolio service for others has grown from approximately $26 billion to $30 billion over the past year. We
still have additional capacity and we'll continue to evaluate opportunities to grow our servicing portfolio.

Other non-interest income includes a recovery of $10 million related to the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill. We also
recognized an $8 million leveraged lease termination gain, which was substantially offset by related increase in income
taxes. These increases were partially offset by a $4 million decline in revenue for market value adjustments related to
employee benefit assets, which were offset in salaries and benefit expense and resulted in no impact to pre-tax income.
As it relates to future non-interest income growth, Regions is one of the nation's largest participants in affordable
housing finance through the low income housing tax credits program. And we're excited about the opportunity to
enhance our capabilities through the recently announced acquisition of the low income housing tax credit corporate
fund syndication and asset management businesses of First Sterling.
So let's move on to expenses. Total non-interest expenses increased 2% during the quarter and include a $14 million
charge for the early extinguishment of parent company debt and a $5 million charge associated with branch closures we
announced last quarter.
On an adjusted basis, expenses totaled $912 million, representing a 3% increase quarter-over-quarter. Total salaries and
benefits increased $6 million from the second quarter, primarily due to one additional weekday, which accounts for
approximately $5 million. Production-based incentives also increased during the quarter.
These increases were partially offset by a $4 million decrease in expenses related to market value adjustments
associated with assets held for certain employee benefits, which are offset in other non-interest income that I
mentioned. In addition, year-to-date staffing levels have declined 5%, or approximately 1,200 positions, as we continue
to execute on our efficiency initiatives.
Looking at the fourth quarter, and excluding any impact from market value adjustments, we expect salaries and benefits
to decline as a result of one less weekday in the quarter and the impact of continuing expense management.
Professional and legal expenses increased $8 million during the quarter, primarily due to increases in legal reserves. As
expected, FDIC insurance assessments increased $12 million in the third quarter, including a $5 million related to the
implementation of the FDIC assessment surcharge. In addition, the second quarter assessment benefited from a $6
million refund relating to prior-period overpayments.
The company also incurred $8 million related to the reserve for unfunded commitments, as well as $11 million of
expense related to Visa class B shares sold in a prior year. The Visa class B shares have restrictions tied to the
finalization of certain covered litigation. The current quarter charge primarily relates to a class action settlement that
was overturned on appeal, and we would not expect this level of expense to repeat.
For the first nine months of 2016, our adjusted efficiency ratio was 63.3% and we have generated 3% positive
operating leverage on an adjusted basis. As Grayson mentioned, we have targeted an additional $100 million in
expense eliminations beyond our original announcement, bringing the total target to $400 million, or 11.5% of our
adjusted expense base. And we will continue to identify opportunities to pull those savings forward whenever possible.
Let's move on to asset quality. Net charge-offs totaled $54 million in the third quarter, a decrease of $18 million from
the second quarter and represented 26 basis points of average loans. Charge-offs related to our energy portfolio totaled
$6 million in the quarter. The provision for loan losses was $25 million less than net charge-offs in the quarter and our
allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans decreased 2 basis points to 1.39%.
The allowance for loan and lease losses associated with the direct energy loan portfolio decreased to 7.9% in the third
quarter compared to 9.4% in the second quarter, reflecting the continued improvement in our overall energy book.
Total non-accrual loans, excluding loans held for sale, increased to 1.33% of loans outstanding. There were five energy
and energy-related loans which primarily drove the increase in non-accrual loans. However, the increased provision
associated with these loans was more than offset by the credit quality improvement in the balance of the energy
portfolio, driven by continued energy price stabilization, as well as declines in loans outstanding.
Troubled debt restructured loans and total delinquencies were relatively flat, while total business services criticized
loans increased 2%. The increase in criticized loans was driven by a small number of multi-family construction and
transportation loans that were downgraded from pass to special mention.

While oil prices are continuing to stabilize, uncertainty remains. We expect cumulative losses for all of 2016 and 2017
to range between $50 million and $75 million. And should oil prices average below $25 per barrel through the end of
2017, we would expect incremental losses of $100 million. Through the first nine months of 2016, we have incurred
$23 million of charge-offs related to our energy portfolio. And we are encouraged by the performance of our energy
segment to-date, however, we will continue to monitor and manage it closely. Given where we are in the credit cycle
and considering fluctuation in commodity prices, volatility in certain credit metrics can be expected, especially related
to larger dollar commercial credits.
Let's talk about capital and liquidity. Under Basel III, the Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 11.9% and the Common Equity
Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 11.1%. On a fully phased-in basis, Common Equity Tier 1 was estimated at 11%. In
addition, our liquidity position remained solid with a historically low loan-to-deposit ratio of 81%.
Now, in terms of expectations for the remainder of 2016, we expect both average loans and average deposits to be
relatively stable with the fourth quarter of 2015. Our expectation for net interest income and other financing income
remains unchanged, with full-year growth of between a 2% to 4% range. As a result of our investments, we now expect
to grow full-year adjusted non-interest income by more than 6%. Total adjusted non-interest expenses in 2016 are
expected to be flat to up modestly from 2015. And we expect to achieve a full-year adjusted efficiency ratio of
approximately 63%, with positive operating leverage in the 2% to 4% range. And we continue to expect full-year net
charge-offs to be in that 25 basis points to 35 basis points range.
With that, we thank you for your time and attention this morning, and I will turn the call back over to Dana for
instructions on the Q&A portion.
Dana W. Nolan
Thank you, David. Before we begin the Q&A session of the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to one
primary and one follow-up to accommodate as many participants as possible this morning. We will now open the line
for questions.
Q&A
Operator
The floor is now open for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Matt O'Connor of
Deutsche Bank.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Matt.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Good morning. I was hoping to follow up on expenses a bit and a couple of
questions. I guess, one, any more color – or can you frame how much of the $400 million of cost saves will fall to the
bottom line or what it means to expenses overall? And then what's the base off of? Because I'm a little confused. This
quarter, the costs came in higher than expected. Part of it was higher revenue. But even adjusting for that, it seemed
like a little bit higher. I know you're increasing the cost target. So I'm trying to figure out what the base is and then
what it means for overall expenses.
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: Yeah. So, Matt, we have some more work to identify what that additional $100 million
will be and what year it will fall in. We did extend that component of the cost elimination program to 2019. That being
said, as I mentioned, we're trying to bring forward as much as we can. The base we've been working off is that base
from last year, which is about $3.450-ish billion range, $3.454 billion I think to be more exact. And that's an adjusted
expense number, okay? So, that's where we're tagging this $400 million off of and that's where you calculate the 11.5%
from.

<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: And I guess just specifically in terms of this quarter's expenses, I mean, besides the
items you called out within adjusted expenses, would you view kind of the adjusted expense base as being a bit
inflated? I know you talked about some decrease coming in 4Q on seasonality. But is it at an inflated level?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: Yes, that's right. That's why I tried to go through what I was enumerating, not just on
adjusted schedule, but enumerated some of the unusual things that occurred in the fourth quarter. That $912 million is
higher than our core run rate.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. All right. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore ISI.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, John.
<Q - John Pancari>: Good morning. Back to expenses, just wanted to get a little bit of feel how this impacts your
efficiency ratio. I mean, if you look at it, you're running year-to-date around 63.5% or so, and you came in around 65%
for the third quarter. I just wanted to just get some color on how you're confident that you're going to come in below
63% for the full year 2016. What that means for the fourth quarter? And then more importantly, just overall thoughts on
2017 efficiency, what we can expect out of that.
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: Yes. So kind of consistent with Matt's question, we believe the adjusted number of $912
million was higher than the run rate that you'll see in the fourth quarter and into 2017. We still need some more work,
John, around the 2017 numbers. We'll highlight that in the first part of December at our next conference in terms of
what we think we'll do over the next three years on a number of metrics. But if you – if we put our forecast in for the
fourth quarter, recalculate the adjusted expense number, we think we'll be right on top of 63%.
<Q - John Pancari>: Okay. All right. Now that helps. I was just trying to go at it a different way. Okay. And then
separately on the loan growth front, I wanted to see if I can get your thoughts on the outlook for loan growth for 2017. I
know you flagged a couple of times the weaker business loan demand in mid-market and the conservative approach to
certain portfolios that you flagged as well. So, can you talk about how you feel about loan growth as you look into 2017
considering that?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Yeah. I mean, John, if you look at our reported earnings for the third quarter, clearly,
Consumer was a very strong quarter. We were very encouraged by what we saw in the Consumer not only from a loan
growth standpoint, but from an asset quality perspective it continues to be very good and very stable. And we think
while there's some seasonality in consumer lending, in particular around mortgage lending, we do anticipate that that
positive momentum carries forward.
On the commercial side, especially in the small to medium size enterprises, we had very good production in the third
quarter, but we also had an abnormally high level of payoffs and paydowns, and in particular around reductions in
outstandings on commercial lines of credit. When you look at our thoughts for fourth quarter, we think production
bodes well, but we do anticipate stability in the fourth quarter. I would just ask John Turner, who heads up that group
for us, to add a little bit more color, because I think this is an important question.
<A - John Turner>: Well, thank you, Grayson. We've said, as we think about our strategy, that we're underpenetrated
in certain markets, businesses and portfolios. We have, we think, too many single-service and credit-only relationships.
We've been good about client selectivity, but not as focused on returns. So as we think about our businesses and our
desire to create a better mix of revenue, we've talked about real estate and our desire to manage that carefully, given
where we are in the cycle.
Within our larger credit exposures, our Corporate Banking business, again, we want to be thoughtful. That business has
been growing over the last few years, but it grows with large exposures. And so we're mindful of the tall tree risk and
mindful of the returns that we're getting in that business. And so a lot of what we've been doing there over the last nine

months is reallocating capital within that portfolio to relationships that are going to generate higher risk-adjusted
returns. And we are beginning to see meaningful impact as a result of that. And I think it's also, as you could see,
helping grow non-interest revenue, which is up almost 20% year-over-year.
And then finally within middle market and small business, it's really important, we think, that, again, we build those
relationships out broadly. We don't chase opportunities. While Grayson said production was good, we had an
opportunity to generate almost, again, half as much credit as we did. But it wasn't priced appropriately or the structures
we didn't think were consistent with our risk appetite. So we have some levers to pull if we felt like that we needed to
do that, but we believe a disciplined approach to building long-term, prudent, sustainable relationships that are
profitable to the company that generate the value for our customers and for our shareholders is appropriate. And so
we'll see stabilization, we think, in the fourth quarter, and then, we believe, kind of modest growth, I think, we've
indicated, [ph] David (33:16), in 2017.
<Q - John Pancari>: And then – I'm sorry, just one more thing. The modest growth that you just mentioned there,
John, is that back to where you were previously in that sub 3% type of range?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: Yes. So, John, this is David. So, we'll put together our total loan growth plan. That's what
we'll share with you on the 2017 metrics. But John was trying to address, we believe – we will have certain things
working against us, energy being the big one, in 2017 as much as we had this past year. So we'll give you more
specificity on loan growth at the next conference.
<Q - John Pancari>: And did you – thanks. And did you quantify the paydowns in the commercial real estate side?
<A - John Turner>: I don't think we did. I can't recall whether we...
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: The main decline we had talked about was energy. Over the last couple of quarters, it's
been about $500 million with average of $300 million of that this past quarter.
<A - John Turner>: Yes. I think the number in real estate was about $300 million, right, point-to-point. And again, as
we're trying to remix our business, real estate is an example, and shift from a very high level of construction loan
production to a better mix of term lending and construction lending, we can't manage the timing, as you can imagine.
And so, it is going to be a bit lumpy as we experience paydowns in the construction book and we seek to grow the term
book. And so, we over time expect to grow real estate as the economy grows, but we'll have, I think, some timing
differences as we attempt to remix that business.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: But, John, as you saw in this quarter, when we – with all the actions we're taking, we're
actually reducing the risk profile of our overall loan portfolio and are encouraged with the progress we're making in
that regard. It does create some noise on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but I think the point is we're trying to be very
thoughtful and very prudent about reducing the overall risk profile of our portfolio.
<Q - John Pancari>: Okay. Thanks, Grayson. Thanks for taking all the questions.

Your next question comes from John McDonald of Bernstein.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Hi. Good morning. I wanted to ask a little bit about credit quality. The charge-offs,
David, this quarter came in at the low end of your range with the 26 basis points. Do you expect to hold the lower end
in the near term in terms of the charge-offs? And then, on the reserve front, are you comfortable letting the reserve go
further down from this 1.39% or so, or do you expect the provision to kind of match charge-offs going forward?
<A - Barbara I. Godin>: Yes, this is Barb. I'll take that question. Relative to – I'll touch the reserve first. As you
know, we have a pretty prudent ways we go about looking at it, consistently we go looking at our reserves. So we will
let the numbers speak for themselves at that point. However, I don't see us going back to what we call the old days of
something sub-1% coverage. We came at 1.39%, as you know, so we'll move in and around that band for what that's

worth relative to charge-offs. It was a great charge-off quarter. I would stick with our guidance of 25 basis points to 35
basis points as we close out the year, and that would include the fourth quarter coming up.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: But again, there can be considerable volatility from quarter-to-quarter, given the
granularity of the portfolio and some of the larger credits we have. But overall, to Barb's point, very good quarter from
a credit quality standpoint this quarter; had a lot of things moving around, but at the end of the day we think we're in a
good place.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. Just to follow-up on that, Barb. The consumer charge-off ratios, if we look in
the supplement, is showing a trend of going up. And obviously, you're growing this from a small base. So just kind of
wondering what you're seeing there. Is it seasoning that you kind of expect on this trend? These are small numbers right
now, but as you grow this consumer portfolio, do you have destinations in mind for where these charge-off ratios
should be headed?
<A - Barbara I. Godin>: Yes. Firstly, they're all within our risk appetite, so we're very comfortable with what's
happening in the Consumer book. What we see is real estate continues to improve. In particular, the home equity was
down significantly this quarter. Mortgage is really back to its all-time low tracking along the bottom. Some of the other
portfolios that we see, indirect is pretty stable. And then, of course, we have a handful of new initiatives that we're
looking at that contributed a little bit, a few million to our numbers overall. But again, on the revenue side, we're seeing
that handful of increased losses are more than offset by the increased revenues. So we don't see the Consumer book
moving up significantly in terms of overall losses at this point.

Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Hey. A couple of questions, one is on expenses. Just in general, what do you think
your normalized expense increase is on an annual basis, not including the cost saves, but just what you have to consider
as normal course of inflation of expenses?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: Yes. I think if you start back at that $3.454 billion number and it could go up modestly
there, we're hitting that run rate of – adjusted expenses $912 million, that's a little bloated. I tried to enumerate those. If
you carve those out, you're going to be in that $880 million range, $885 million range is probably where that's more
normal run rate at this point.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Okay.
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: But that's all adjusted. It's all adjusted.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Right. So, if you're talking about a 2%-ish or 3%-ish normalized increase from just
salaries and expense inflation, then we're looking at over a three-year period an outlook where you should be able to
bring your expense dollars down over a three-year period. Is that fair?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: Well, one of the things that's important to us strategically, as we laid out in Investor Day,
is to grow and diversify our revenue and to continue to make investments. In order to make those investments, we have
to – and control expenses at the same time, we have to have savings from kind of our core operations. And that's really
what the $300 million – now $400 is all about. And so we have to continue to find other ways to become more
efficient, because it is [ph] firstly (40:05) important for us to continue to grow our company and to grow non-interest
revenue in particular. And so having a reduction in expense versus having a flat to up modestly, which is what we have

today, and again we'll give you 2017 and beyond that it will be somewhere in that range as well.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Okay. So, yeah, what I'm missing in my little calculation is the investment spending
you're making, okay. Okay. And then just separately, you no longer have to deal with the qualitative part of CCAR test.
I know the regulator says that they're going to be assessing your process in the normal course regulation. But maybe
you can give us a sense as to how much that helps you in terms of dealing not only with the CCAR itself at that point in
time in the year, but also how you think about the capital return that might open up for you without the qualitative test
issue that you have had to deal with over the past few years?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: So I would start with, obviously, the – it's still just a notice of proposed rulemaking, so we
still need the finalization there. But based on what is out there, I think it's constructive for the industry, for the regional
bank space. That being said, we managed our capital in the manner we played out a capital planning process and all the
governance, and none of that is going to change. We're going to continue to have robust capital planning and loss
forecasting. What this does is that plus learnings that we get from each CCAR filing help us frame up what we could do
with our capital.
First and foremost, we want to leverage our capital to grow organically, and that's the first order of business. We want
to make investments for bolt-on acquisitions that we've done. You saw the one we released yesterday. Those are
important. Having a fair dividend to our shareholders is important. And then when we have excess capital that we're
generating, having an appropriate return in the form of a share buyback is in order.
So, I think given all of that, it gives us an ability to think about capital targets relative to the risk that we have in our
balance sheet. And we've mentioned that based on today's risk that we have, that Common Equity Tier 1 ratio with
9.5% is where we would target over time and we're at approximately 11%. So we have capital to be put to work or to
be given back to shareholders over time. And so I think all the body of evidence that we have will help us manage that
in a prudent manner over perhaps a shorter period of time. We have to think through that. So, Betsy, it's a little early to
tell what that exactly means for our CCAR submission in 2017.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Okay. Thanks.

Your next question comes from Jennifer Demba of SunTrust.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Jennifer.
<Q - Jennifer Demba>: Good morning. Just wondering if you could give us some color around the increase in
criticized loans in the multi-family and transport area.
<A - Barbara I. Godin>: Absolutely. Betsy (sic) [Jennifer], it's Barb again. So what we have is we have effectively in
multi-family three credits. Two of them are in the Houston area; one was in Oklahoma. The one in the Houston area,
I'll give you a little more color on. Higher concessions than originally expected, so we moved that to a special mention
loan. Another that was also in the Houston area, construction delays due to rainfall, so we moved that one over.
And the last one is in Oklahoma, 93% complete on that building, marginally behind schedule in terms of the leasing,
but we still expect completion of the building by the end of December. So, again, we look at everything relative to how
you are supposed to be performing on any of these credits. And if you're not performing as per what we originally laid
out, we will move you to a special mention.
The transportation credits are energy-related; one large transportation credit energy-related. What I would say, though,
about our overall criticized book is that 93% of our criticized book in the business services area is paying as agreed. So
I don't expect at the end of the day that there will be a significant number of losses at all coming from any of those
loans that we moved over.

<Q - Jennifer Demba>: Okay. Separate question on your branch sales incentives. Grayson, do you expect any
meaningful change to your branch sales incentives given the backdrop of what's happened with Wells?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Yes. I think given the backdrop that the industry is facing right now, I think the prudent
thing to do, and I assume all of our competitors are doing that, is taking a very deep dive on all of our sales practices
using both our internal leadership, internal experts, as well as external advisors to re-challenge our sales on all of our
sales practices. We're quite proud of the culture we've built in Regions. We had a sales culture that is really based on
shared values, making sure that it's customer-focused and we're doing the right thing for customers in the right way.
And our messaging is quite strong and the feedback we get from surveys and external sources is very encouraging.
But all that being said, we believe in the backdrop of all that's going on that we're all re-challenging ourselves to make
sure that everything is done correctly and appropriately, and that activity is going on here as I'm sure it's going on
everywhere. But as I said, we've got a lot of confidence in the processes we've built. We think we're doing the right
things, but more importantly, we think we're doing them the right way. But we've got to make sure that that's occurring
in all aspects. And so, given the backdrop, we're re-reviewing everything we're doing.

Your next question comes from Steve Moss of FBR.
<Q - Stephen Moss>: Good morning.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Steve.
<Q - Stephen Moss>: Just want to circle back on expenses a little bit. I know in the past you've talked about pulling
forward expenses, and I was wondering what's the possibility that the $300 million, you can complete it in 2017.
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: Yes. So, we are continuing to challenge ourselves on the $300 million plus the additional
$100 million in terms of timing, and are looking to pull forward as much as is prudent without harming the long-term
franchise. So, I can't give you probability of being able to complete that in 2017. I think getting all of that in 2017
would be very difficult. But could we move some of it that is currently in 2018 into 2017, I think that's an appropriate
challenge to our team. And we'll be coming back again after this challenge, and in December at our next conference,
we'll lay out what that three-year plan looks like, including metrics like operating leverage and efficiency, and just total
expense bogey as well.
<Q - Stephen Moss>: Okay. And then my second question on investment securities yields, just wondering, what is
your new money purchase yield these days?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: Well, we're in the – mortgage-backs are about 1.75% to 2% and corporate bonds are
2.30%-ish range to 2.75%. But the preponderance of what we're at have been adding to mortgage-backs.

<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: No, Michael, those are – if you go back to Investor Day, you'll see roughly four broad
categories of expense. I suspect they'll fall into those categories. I think you should expect us to leverage – see us
leveraging technology a bit more, which gives us time to put things in place to help us from an efficiency standpoint.
So that could be one of the changes.
As we go through this, we kind of started on the human capital size and then getting into really third-party spend,
which we've done some of. There is probably some more room there. We continue to work on occupancy cost and
branch consolidations and office space. As you know, we had 1 million square feet we wanted to take out over the
initial three-year period of time. We're in good shape with that. But we're continuing to challenge ourselves on those
kinds of areas. We think there will be more to come there.
<Q - Michael Rose>: Is it fair to say that most of the kind of heavy lifting from the expenses efforts have been realized
at this point? One of your competitors this morning basically said that they had anything kind of incremental beyond
today's announcement, it would be much smaller. Is that a similar view for you guys? Or if you were to take a more
critical look at your branch network, could you actually see some more material savings as we move forward?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: No. I mean, Michael, you look at the past few years, we have been very focused on
efficiency and trying to find expenses. And obviously, the duration of this operating environment has continued to put
substantial pressure on expense management, and a lot of the easy first steps are all behind us in terms of expense
management. And really, what you're doing now is having to sort of transform how you do business. And if you look at
the investments we've made in a lot of our digital channels, investments we've made in sort of retooling our branches
and how we operate out of our branches, we're really, at this point in time, having to really challenge ourselves on how
we go to market in certain parts of the company and, as David said, using technology to make those people more
efficient and more effective.
So to answer your question, easy expense saves are long behind us, have been for a while. And so the things we're
doing now are much more transformative; interesting, take a little more longer to execute. But at this juncture, you
really have to look at how you do business rather than just trying to look at normal inefficiencies of process.
<Q - Michael Rose>: Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just one more for Barb on energy. I appreciate the
guidance around charge-offs for energy [ph] reiteration (52:03) that you provided. What would cause you to be kind of
at the lower end of your range, and then what set of variables would cause you to be at the upper end of that $75
million?
<A - Barbara I. Godin>: Yes. Michael, it's clearly oil prices, where they sit right now, generally around that $50 area,
that provides some stabilization. But we honestly don't believe that things will really move in the right direction until
we get somewhere in the $60 a barrel range, give or take. But if they stay at $50, we do see stabilization in our metrics.
If they go down into – again, you saw our guidance of sub-$30, we would expect significant increases, i.e., being an
additional $100 million. But if oil got down into the $30 a barrel range as well, we would also see some upward
pressure on our – all of our credit metrics and in our [indiscernible] (52:55) as well.
And by the way, just for some more color on the energy charge-offs that we did have this quarter, of the $6 million that
we had, roughly $1.5 million was coal. So year-to-date we've had $23 million in energy charge-offs, and of that,
approximately $9.5 million, $10 million is related to the coal portion of our book as well.
<Q - Michael Rose>: That's very helpful. Thanks for the color.

on what you were referring to there.
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: Yes. So when we talk about strategy, it would be the things like we saw yesterday with
our announcement of First Sterling, continuing to make any type of investments that are helping us to serve our
customers, to give us a more fulsome offering to our customer base as we seek to meet their needs.
There are other investments that we seek to make. We talked a little bit about leveraging technology to help us from our
cost standpoint over time. So we're looking at different technologies to help us – look at process improvement to help
us where we might be able to get a better answer to take labor out and improve our internal control structure for making
those type of technology investments. So those were kind of the ideas we had.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Yes. We really believe the best strategy for us at this point in time is to really focus on
executing our plans. We've got plans that allow us to continue to improve the fundamentals of the company. If you look
at the fundamentals, the fundamentals are posting out some very good numbers, in particular on the Consumer side of
our house, but really across the board. And so, that focus on execution is a key point of what we're doing.
And the other side is innovations. I think in this market you got to be able to execute but you've also got to be able to
innovate. And so, we're spending an awful lot of time trying to figure out how we innovate in a way that better serves
our customers and does it in a way that creates greater efficiency in the way we operate. So I think that we got a
number of good strategic moves that we're making that will help improve the overall performance of the company.
<Q - Geoffrey Elliott>: So it sounds like the focus is more around bolt-on acquisitions where you think you can do
something to improve efficiency rather than selling businesses which you look at and you don't think they fit anymore.
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: I think actually what we've done thus far that you've seen our advancements on things like
our GreenSky initiative, Avant was an initiative. We do challenge ourselves on our businesses to ensure that they are
seeking appropriate risk-adjusted return on the business. And when we have a business that can't help us meet our
return hurdles and/or don't serve a customer, then we'll challenge ourselves on that.
But right now, it's been investments that really help us grow and diversify revenue. And that diversification is moving a
little bit away from NII to NIR. It's moving geographically. It's diversifying in products and services that we offer to
give us a little more balance in terms of how we generate revenue and earnings for our shareholders.

and you had some nice growth across capital markets, card and wealth. Can you just speak to some of the momentum
that you're seeing in your fee income the remainder of this year and into next?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Yes. I mean, I'll ask John Owen, if he would, to sort of talk about some of our fee rates
businesses and some of the growth rates you're seeing there. It's a very encouraging story.
<A - John B. Owen>: Sure. Thanks, Grayson. Good morning, everyone. As Grayson said, we're seeing steady
improvement in our Consumer business. If you look at an account growth standpoint, we're going to grow checking
accounts about 2.5%, debit card growth about 4% year-over-year, credit card growth about 12% year-over-year, now
banking customer account growth by 14%. The other point I would make is utilization on debit cards both total
transaction and spend is up as well on cards. So, those are driving lot of our increases.

<Q - Jill Shea>: And then maybe just any color on capital markets involved and some of the momentum you're seeing
now.
<A - John Turner>: Sure. This is John Turner. We're continuing to build out our debt capital markets platform, and
doing that across a number of different products and capabilities. So, what you've seen is we've grown capital markets
revenue significantly over the last two years is the introduction of some of those products and capabilities. We had a
very nice third quarter largely built on the M&A advisory revenue that we generated. We also had a pretty good quarter
in real estate permanent placement, particularly through our Fannie DUS license.
We expect to continue to see that kind of growth going forward as we continue to leverage these new capabilities.
We're excited about the acquisition of First Sterling businesses. The Community Investment Capital business is one
that's been very important to us. We decided that we wanted to grow that business strategically two years ago. We've
set out to find a syndication platform that will help us build out some distribution capabilities that we didn't have. So,
again, that's another product capability that we have that will allow us to meet customer needs, grow revenue in a more
diverse and balanced way. And we expect to see, again, nice growth in capital markets into 2017 as we leverage more
of these capabilities.

Your next question comes from Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Matt.
<Q - Matthew Hart Burnell>: Good morning, Grayson. Thanks for taking my questions. First on margin, I thought I
heard David mention something about some loan re-pricing efforts that you've been able to pass through. I'm curious if
there's more of that to come and what the benefit might be going forward. And I guess in a related question to David,
how do you think of a 25 basis point hike, if we're lucky enough to get it in December, would benefit Q1 margin? Last
year, it was about a 5 basis-point benefit quarter-over-quarter on an adjusted basis. Should we see something similar in
the first quarter if we were to get the 25 basis points?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: Yes. So I'll start with your second quarter first, and I think when you look at 25 basis
points to see where we're positioned, you're probably for the year in a $15 million, $20 million range, so your number
is not too far off for the first quarter.
<Q - Matthew Hart Burnell>: Okay.
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: I would tell you, as we think about the returns, improving our returns, that's not just a
pricing issue only. It's really the relationship. It's trying to get the relationship return, which can include credit, but it's
going to include all the other products and services that we offer that customer.
<Q - Matthew Hart Burnell>: Right.
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: And so, we certainly are looking at things that have a credit-only relationship, that have a
suboptimal return for us, and those are the ones we want to try and get the relationship, get our price improved, get our
returns better or recycling and leveraging that capital into another option or another alternative. So I think over time
what you ought to see is, we should have some positive impact to the margin, the pace of which is really dependent on
how we change this whole relationship and whether it's credit-related or product and service-driven.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: I would just add, as we look at yields, going on spreads over LIBOR did improve during
the quarter. More importantly though, as David talked about, I think you're seeing is a growth in fee revenue, a growth
in deposits, all because of our focus on relationship returns. Just to underscore the work that's being done, talk about
our Corporate Banking portfolio, particularly shared national credit book and our desire to improve returns in that
business, we actually exited almost $2 billion worth of credit in the first nine months of the year. We reallocated that

capital back into new relationships and existing relationships, and in doing that, we increased the revenue per
relationship over 50% and the risk-adjusted returns in the business by almost 250 basis points. So we are seeing that
activity really begin to have an impact. It will take some time to see it in the P&L. We believe that it is occurring, and
it's the right approach.
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: And, Matt, I'll add. This is David. In terms of kind of margin expectations I tried to put in
the prepared comments, we had a couple of things that were fairly unusual in the fourth quarter that pushed our margin
down to the 3.06% that we think rebounds a bit in that 3.09% range, give or take. There are a lot of things that can
move, but based on the best evidence we have today, we'd be in that range. I gave you about $11 million of NII that
was a bit different for the quarter that we think helps get you some stability in terms of NII and resulting margin for the
fourth quarter.
<Q - Matthew Hart Burnell>: Sure. No, that makes sense, David. Thank you for the color. And actually your
comments earlier about the re-pricing and relationship are a nice segues into my final question. Specific to the capital
markets business, how far along are you relative to where you'd ultimately like to get in terms of cross-selling those
investment banking, capital markets products into your corporate middle market customer – credit customer base?
<A - John Turner>: This is John Turner. I'd say we're probably 70% along in developing – 70%, 75% developing the
product capabilities that we'd like to have in our debt capital markets business, and maybe 20% to 25% along in terms
of really capturing what we think is the opportunity within the business. Today, about 24% of our total revenue in the
Corporate Banking business is non-interest revenue, and we'd like to see that number improve to 40%-plus over time,
which means we've effectively got to double the business, and we think that there's visibility to get there. It will take a
while, but we see the opportunity, clearly.
<Q - Matthew Hart Burnell>: Thanks for answering my questions.
<A - John Turner>: Sure.

Your next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Thank you, Ken.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Hey, guys. Good morning. Just one quick follow-up on credit. You talked about the quality of the
book improving over time as you remix. This quarter we still saw your ability with the energy improvement to release
some reserves and the overall reserved for loans ratio is still quite high versus almost all peers at [ph] 1.4 (01:05:07).
But just can you talk about philosophically over time with that change in the mix of the business, do we see that reserve
to loans ratio continue to come down? And as credit continues to improve on energy, is there more room to still be
releasing as we continue to see the improvements on the resi side as much as the potential improvements in energy?
Thanks, guys.
<A - Barbara I. Godin>: Yes, Ken, it's Barb. And so as we book loans – book new loans, we're always going to have a
provision associated with those. So, we'll put that as a positive to increase the provision. On the other side, as our books
continue to get better and our ratings improve on all of these credits, we also have the opportunity then again to reduce
our overall provision on these.
So net-net, over time, if we're suggesting that we're going to have a book that's stable to some continued improvement,
then you should see some stability in the provision to improving. And again, a lot of that build will be driven by
energy. You saw that this quarter. So as the number of energy credits got much better, we were able to reduce our
overall level of provision, roughly $50 million in that book, and we'll continue to review that book every quarter as we
move through the next several quarters and see how that impacts our overall numbers.

<Q - Ken Usdin>: Just a follow-up. Do you expect that the new stuff that you're adding on the consumer side, is that
higher loss rate content? Do you have any change in your kind of philosophical, like what your through the cycle loss
rate should be? I understand there is a lot of current things that are plus and minus underneath.
<A - Barbara I. Godin>: Yeah. Our overall philosophical, we stated 75 basis points of loss through the cycle. We still
believe that that's the right number. Consumer book was heavily weighted towards real estate, and again real estate
tracking in those low double-digit numbers in terms of losses. But also it doesn't give you the returns that some of the
other products that we're looking at do give us. So the answer is, yes, we will see some increased credit cost on the
Consumer side, although we think, again, they're going to be quite manageable. We do have limits on concentrations on
any of those new initiatives that we do.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Okay. Thanks a lot, Barb.

Your next question comes from David Eads of UBS.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Hi, David.
<Q - David Eads>: Good morning – or slightly afternoon now. Maybe just a follow-up for Barb here on, can you give
a little bit of color on what you're seeing in the oil field services portfolio? It looks like you've had some declines in
balances and commitment, but you had a tick-up in criticized. I mean, is it one of the things with that portfolio really is
the only part that you're really worried about here and that improvements elsewhere are more than offsetting some
continuous headwinds there.
<A - Barbara I. Godin>: Yes, I think you're correct. I think on the E&P side of our book, that generally what we've
seen is certainly some stabilization, especially with prices where they are for a barrel of oil. We have talked about in
prior quarters that the oil field services portion of our book will lag in terms of recovery to the E&P portion of our
book. And we're seeing that. And that's the reason we're continuing to guide that between now and the end of next year
we believe our total overall losses will be somewhere in that $50 million to $75 million potential total range. We are
seeing that oil field services – here and there there's pockets and we are seeing that they are getting back to work. But
again, that is, as I've said, going to take I think the rest of 2017 for that to work itself out.
<Q - David Eads>: All right. And then you mentioned comments earlier about multi-family and some of the medical
care facilities pulling back from those. And just want to get the read. Is that more about hitting concentration limits and
wanting to be disciplined on that front as opposed to seeing any kind of specific signs that are worrying on that – kind
of excluding some of the comments you made about Houston energy-related locations where you're saying you had
some downgrades this quarter?
<A - Barbara I. Godin>: You're exactly right. We do have a very disciplined concentration methodology. We've
learned a lot coming out of the last crisis, and what we learned is diversification of our books and concentration limit
management is paramount to having a good, solid, prudent book. And so as we've come up on some of our
concentration limits, we've worked very closely with, in particular, John Turner and his team to, again, recycle capital,
but also stay well within those concentration limits. And again, that's the reason for the commentary on that, and the
same thing with our medical office building.

<Q - Marty Mosby>: Hey, thanks. I got two bigger strategic questions. As you look at Barb talking about your through
the cycle losses, you all are spending a lot of time de-risking, offloading what could be some of the more troublesome
loans. Really over time to get the benefit from that – I think you're seeing that with lower losses now, but you should
also see it with less volatility when we get in that downdraft. I think communicating and talking about the benefits of
the de-risking is going to be very important for Regions. Just your thought on as you keep saying, 75 basis points the
benefits of de-risking and how you can see it materialize over time.
<A - Barbara I. Godin>: All right. Thank you for those comments and you're absolutely right. We have spent a lot of
time on the de-risking. [indiscernible] (01:10:51) de-risking was, as you know, in the real estate book what we wanted
to do is, as we thought of how do re-risk our portfolio that we do it with assets and we do it with portfolios that are
much less volatile and back to again that we do it within our concentration limits, so that we don't get outsized in any
one area, in any one product and sticking to that discipline.
The other challenge that you have when you de-risk a book and by de-risking you sell a lot of the assets is you don't
enjoy the recovery stream after. Whereas, if you instead manage a book that is prudent and less volatile when you do
have losses, you do also anticipate a benefit and also having future recoveries. So those are lot of benefits to making
sure that we stay within a pretty tight [ph] data (01:11:38) on what we're doing.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Because, Marty, we really are trying to make sure that we're not only diversifying, but
we're remixing our loan portfolio to have it be a better performing asset through the cycle with reduced volatility,
exactly to your point. We're trying to be very careful about client selectivity, trying to make sure that we understand
who we're banking and how we're banking them, and we try to make sure we've got a full relationship with that client.
And we do believe that there'll be points in the cycle where we'll grow less than some peers, but we do believe that
what we're doing in diversifying and managing concentration risk will, in fact, reduce the overall operating volatility of
our company over a longer period of time.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: No, I have seen that and I just think that communicating and materializing how that's going to
kind of play forward is going to be important. And then, David, on the extra $100 million in expense savings, you've
been producing 2 percentage points to 3 percentage points of operating leverage, and actually revenue growth is
picking up. So I just want to go back on how you couched it in this environment. It almost seemed like things weren't
improving or you weren't getting revenue growth, so you had to go and dig harder.
Are you just finding things as you've gone through, like you said, redesigning that gave you another $100 million that
you can now put on the table? I think the difference between that feeling is pretty important. Is it desperation or is it,
no, we're just finding more things that we can do more with?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Marty, I would put it this way. We've been really working with a great sense of urgency on
efficiency. We know it's important. But we're finding investment opportunities and we know in this environment that
we have to figure out how to self-fund those investments. We have to figure out how we can reduce our expenses to
make those investment decisions. And those investment decisions are getting traction now. We're starting to see the
benefits of some of the decisions we've made in terms of investments. You're seeing that very strongly in capital
markets.
But as we've gotten into this process, we've just come to the conclusion that, if this environment persists, we got to be
even better. And we're finding opportunities that will allow us to extend this process further, and we believe get our
company into a much better position. We do believe that operating leverage is the right metric to look at. We continue
to believe we're delivering on that. But it's going to require both – work on both revenues and expense side of the
income statement, and so we can't give up on either one.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: And then one tactical question. David, you had $13 million negative in prepayment write-offs.
You're getting about half of that back in the fourth quarter. But if rates stay where they're at or at what level do you
have to get to get the other $6 million back into your quarterly NII from pre-payments going back to where they were
in the prior quarter?

<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: Yes. I think where we are clearly is beneficial. We, obviously, are seeing a lot of volatility
though in rates. And I think that you're right, we'll get a piece of that back naturally because of what has happened. But
I think that it's going to be – it's a little premature to say when we might get that other piece in. We need to see what
will happen over maybe the next couple of quarters before we can get our – that premium amortization down into the
lower 40 range.

Your next question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good afternoon, Erika.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Good afternoon. I apologize in advance for prolonging the call on one more expense
question, but I just wanted to make sure I understood David's response to Betsy's question correctly. The way it was
framed was the core run rate for expenses was $880 million to $885 million, plus potentially a natural growth rate of
2% to 3%. Should we then, on top of that, separately think about the $400 million of savings, and that $400 million is
being used to fund all those investments that you've been talking about for the past hour?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: Yes. So, I think if you look at our kind of core, that $880 million to $885 million is where
we are. We do continue to make investments to grow our revenue, so an example will be our release we had yesterday.
You'll see expenses coming through from that investment in 2017 and none in 2016. And so, we're trying to figure out
how to pay for that by having other savings, so part of that $400 million is to compensate us for that.
We do have built in natural inflation that we have, salary increases and the like, that we try to curtail by ensuring that
we have the right number of people – the right number of the right kinds of people to manage our business and run our
businesses. We're down some 1,200 people and we continue to challenge ourselves on that. And you see some of that
manifest in the branch consolidations that we've had during the year.
So the question is, how do we keep the $880 million and $885 million as stable to up modestly as we can while we're
making the investments to grow revenue and having things like First Sterling with 12 months' worth of expense next
year and virtually none in 2016. Does that make sense?
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: It does. Thank you.

Your next question comes from Kevin Barker of Piper Jaffray.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Afternoon, Kevin.
<Q - Kevin J. Barker>: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to follow up – not to beat a
dead horse, but follow up on expenses again. You say flat to up modestly on a yearly basis. I mean, that could be a very
wide range going into the fourth quarter. Are you assuming that the run rates could be closer to the $880 million to
$885 million range going into fourth quarter, or is it going to be – could you see some volatility where that would drive
that number lower?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: We believe that's our core kind of run rate where we are right now for the fourth quarter,
is in that $880 million to $885 million.
<Q - Kevin J. Barker>: Okay. And then when you think about the revenue side, when you say it's going to be, on a
yearly basis, up around 6% or more than 6%, that's a run rate closer to $500 million going into next quarter from $544
million. But it seems like you have a lot of positive commentary around your momentum on the fee income side. It

seems like that number could be up a lot higher than the 6% that you're guiding to. Is there some moving parts there
that may cause the number to come down considerably going into the fourth quarter?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: We've had – we grew just about every category of non-interest revenue, and we're excited
about those investments that are paying off that we've made. So I don't see that – the 6%, the reason we've left it there
is our initial target at Investor Day was 4% to 6%. We had said we'd be in the middle, and then we said we'd be at the
upper end, and now we're giving you guidance that we'll be over 6%. But that's where we stop, and we haven't – we're
letting you draw your own conclusion as to what percentage you want to use over that. But there's nothing that
indicates to us that we have any type of major disruption in that trend that you're seeing.

Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good afternoon, Gerard.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Good afternoon, Grayson. Good afternoon, David. Couple of questions for you. David, you
touched on the premium amortization and how it's going to improve obviously in the next quarter and in an earlier
question you talked a little bit about and maybe getting even better if rates go higher. Can you quantify where rates
would have to go, the 10-year government bond yield that is, when the premium amortization would really drop
significantly and be a non-factor?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: So I think if you took the 10-year maybe up closer to 2%, we might have some
meaningful reduction in the premium amortization, and that's just an approximate, because obviously what happens
with prepayments, refis and mortgages didn't always totally correlate to the 10-year. But suffice it to say, that's a pretty
good proxy.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Okay. And then on the other end, if we were to see a higher level similar to what we saw this
quarter, would the 10-year need to get close to the 1.60 or below for that to reoccur?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: Yes. I think that we're coming off of pretty historic lows in the second quarter. And when
you look at that, I – that's why we were able to give you maybe that $4 million that we don't think will repeat. But
you'd have to be steady in the 1.50s for the quarter for it to get anywhere close to where it was.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Okay, great. And then coming back to the capital question, obviously, Grayson, you talked
about using the capital deployment for organic growth and strategic alternatives. And, David, you pointed out that
you're comfortable with the CET1 ratio at 9.5%. If the NPR turns into an actual regulation about the qualitative portion
of CCAR, you are not going to have to go through it anymore. Would you guys consider doing an accelerated share
repurchase agreement in the next CCAR exam or a Dutch tender offer to really pull out a lot of excess capital to bring
you down closer to your 9.5% and obviously the ROE would go higher?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: I mean, I'll let David add to this, but we do believe that the proposed rules are constructive
and give us more certainty. And we do believe that given the risk profile of our company today as we run through
CCAR that given the current mix that we think we're in that sort of 9.5% range, as David said. Obviously, we're trying
to improve the mix of our portfolio. That'll change some of our metrics if we're successful in that regard.
But the rules that are proposed give us more certainty, but we feel it's our responsibility to manage capital and do that
prudently and thoughtfully. And assuming the rules get approved in somewhat similar fashions they stand today, I think
it is constructive for our bank and constructive in general for a lot of the regional banks and will give us more
flexibility. All that being said is we're still some time away from those strong deliberations that go into our submission.
And so it's premature for us to comment on what we might or might not do in that regard. But it's a possibility.

<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: So, Gerard, I would tell you it's really important that this 9.5%, that's our number, that's
our loss forecasting, that's the way we go about measuring the kind of capital we need to have. We're not interested in
pushing ourselves to the point where we have a quantitative failure and ask for a mulligan and all those kinds of things.
I think it's important that we have a capital planning process with the appropriate governance – I'm talking about the
board review – that helps us establish capital based on the risk in our company. Today, we think that risk would
indicate 9.5% Common Equity Tier 1 number. We are evaluating, as Grayson mentioned, how we might change that
risk profile to help us get the appropriate amount of capital that we have to keep.
Now, your question really is, fine, you're at 9.5% versus – you're at 11%, you've got to go to 9.5%, how quick – what's
the pace of change assuming the NPR turns in exactly as it is? And I think that's a great question. We have – we're
going to have a lot of thought put into that, especially after learning what we did last year from CCAR submissions.
But I do think we need to be real careful about indicating this as some form of panacea. I do think that we need to be
prudent, very careful on how we manage this capital, because we have other players, we have shareholders, we have
other third parties that are looking at how we think about capital, too. So being very thoughtful about it and looking at
that pace. We want to go at the pace that's fair and reasonable for all interested parties. And so a lot of work needs to be
done.

Your next question comes from Vivek Juneja of JPMorgan.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good afternoon, Vivek.
<Q - Vivek Juneja>: Hi. Let me just follow up on that capital discussion a little bit with both of you. David, to your
point about, yes, it's going to take time obviously to go from 11% to 9.5% and, Grayson, you've been doing the bolt-on
acquisitions, but they've not really used up that much capital and you've done a bunch of these, given how much you're
generating. So as you look into 2017 – and I recognize you can't do this right now, but looking to 2017, where is –
where do other uses of capital, how would you prioritize them? Returning more than 100% versus, say, bank
acquisition?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: Yes. So, Vivek, you're bringing up a good point in terms of capital deployment. Let's go
through the how we think about it. First and foremost is organic growth, but it's organic growth on things that add to
the return hurdle that we're trying to get to, which is growing to 12% to 14% return on tangible common equity. It's
what we laid out at Investor Day. It's where we are today. We're going to update that in December. So to the extent
that's not there and we continue to generate capital that we're not utilizing, having an appropriate dividend that we have
is important to us.
Bolt-on acquisitions have helped. You're right. They don't use – have a tendency to use up a lot of capital. And then
outside of that, returning it to the shareholders and exceeding 100% payout ratio has been done. I think that's a learning
that we picked up this past year, and we would consider that as well.
You mentioned bank acquisitions. When you look at the valuation for us, right now I'll say we have our CRA issue that
we hope gets cleared up, but we really have to get those two things dealt with before we can really start looking at it.
And from a valuation standpoint, the math just isn't very supportive of that at this juncture.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: And even then, I think we've been pretty clear. I mean, we're very interested in non-bank
bolt-on acquisitions. We've been active in that. There'll come a time when bank-related bolt-on acquisitions matter will
be of interest when valuations improve. And I think that we look at that and we try to understand that. I think that right
now that's just not our primary focus for – as David mentioned, for a couple of reasons, as well as others.

And so our focus on organic growth, our focus on improving the fundamentals of our company, and our focus on
bolt-on acquisitions that, while they don't consume a lot of capital, they also don't add a lot of risk to our company. It's
the integration, the synergies that we create. We've got the ability to do that. We're pretty good at it.
We think we could continue to do that. Hopefully over time, we could even increase the pace of this kind of activity.
But it doesn't – it's a very manageable risk profile when we execute it this way. Larger acquisitions, obviously, have a
very different risk profile. And right now, we're just focused on building a very sustainable franchise value for our
shareholders.
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: Vivek, I'll add one other thing I should have mentioned is, we do – as we think about our
12% to 14% target in terms of return on tangible common equity, we're working on the new range, as we've just talked
about for a little over an hour and a half, but also managing the denominator in terms of our capital base. And getting to
our target is important in that calculation. So I think we're all – we get the message. And the pace is – back to Gerard's
question, the pace of how we get there just needs to be done in a responsible manner, and we need a little more time to
think how that might look.
<Q - Vivek Juneja>: Okay. I have a small one for Barb. Thank you for that. And, Barb, what was the NPL ratio on
energy loans last quarter? Your slide had 12%. What was it this quarter?
<A - Barbara I. Godin>: Give me half a second. I'm trying to – 6% --

We have time for one more question. Your final question comes from the line of Christopher Marinac of FIG Partner
Research.
<Q - Christopher William Marinac>: Thanks. Good afternoon. I guess just kind of going back to part of what Gerard
was asking about. Do you think, given the changes on the margin are positive and expenses also a positive heading into
the near future, should we be paying more attention to return on tangible equity or return on assets? Which would be
more appropriate to kind of gauge progress of Regions?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: So we look at both. When you kind of look at the – regress the return on tangible common
and stock price evaluation, it's a pretty tight correlation. So we have a tendency to focus on return on tangible common.
It also forces us to make sure we have an appropriate capital base for our business model. So, while ROA is important,
you'll see businesses and peers that have more revenue generated from non-balance sheet, non-assets always have a
higher ROA, but I think that where the rubber meets the road is really returns on the capital.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: I'd add to that. I think also we monitor pretty close the growth in the absolute value of
tangible common equity, not just the return, but how much of our tangible common equity is improving.
<Q - Christopher William Marinac>: Great, guys. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Thank you.
