And now I'd like to turn it over to Steve.
Stephen J. Easterbrook
Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Since stepping into this role nearly two months ago, I have been
relentlessly focused on assessing current plans, challenging our people and teams to think differently about what we're
doing and how we're doing it and working with senior leadership to determine the best path forward. As we announced
this morning, we've scheduled a separate call on the 4 May to share the initial details of our turnaround plan. We
appreciate your patience as we focus today on our first quarter results and the overall approach we're taking as we
develop plans to reenergize the business.
First quarter performance reinforces our imperative to stabilize and improve our underlying business performance. Let
me start by sharing an overview of recent performance across the top nine markets that contribute most to our overall
consolidated results, starting with Australia, the UK, and Canada which are trending positive.
Australia is in the early stages of turning around its business through a multi-faceted approach to enhance brand appeal
for consumers. This includes meaningful enhancements to our menu, including both core and new menu items across
several categories, value platforms, and better restaurant operations.
The UK continues its strong track record of positive performance with first quarter comparable sales representing the
market's 36th consecutive quarter of growth. These results reflect the market's diligent execution of its customer-centric
plans that span multiple initiatives including food choice and food quality, marketing and promotions, and
enhancements to the service experience, such as expanding drive-thru capacity during peak periods and building the
overnight experience.
In addition, in Canada, strong promotional performance and new menu news drove average check and positive
comparable sales performance for the quarter.
Next are Germany and China, two markets that have shown recent signs of improvements. In Germany, negative
comparable sales trends have moderated the last two quarters. The market has strengthened its value platform and, at
the same time, promoted premium products and add-on purchases to grow average check. We expect recovery in this
market to remain uneven; however, as reflected in March's weak comparable sales performance.
China continues to recover from last year's supplier issue. Efforts to regain brand trust are working and the market
remains on track to return to a normalized level of performance by midyear.
And finally the U.S., France, Russia, and Japan, where challenges persist. U.S. results remain disappointing. Recent
actions taken by Mike and his leadership team, including implementing a more efficient operating structure,
simplifying the menu, and holding the U.S. Turnaround Summit with operators in March, are helping to create a
renewed sense of energy and focus around better delivery of local customer needs.
In both France and Russia, consumer confidence remains low and challenging macroeconomic conditions continue that
negatively impact results. Despite a declining IEO industry, France continues to maintain market share as efforts to
strengthen the value platform and enhance the customer service experience are differentiating the brand in the market.
Amidst the external pressures in Russia, the team remains focused on driving sales through strong product and
promotional offers, growing the breakfast business and initiatives that focus on rebuilding brand trust with consumers
in the market.
Japan's recovery from the supply issue has not been as strong as China, and subsequent consumer perception issues
have further depressed sales and profitability. As evidenced by last week's announcement of the business revitalization
plan, the Japanese and APMEA teams are intensely focused on addressing the significant challenges in this market,
though we expect results will continue to be negatively impacted for the foreseeable future. Kevin will provide more
details around our first quarter results in a moment.

Let me shift gears now and discuss the approach I'm taking to lead McDonald's into the future; my operating principles,
if you will. First is a greater emphasis on personal accountability. I'm honest and fair, but I don't dispense forced
kindness. Where we need to fix the fundamentals, we need to act now, and where we need to make an impact, I'm not
looking for incremental steps. We intend to make meaningful impact with customers and how they perceive our brand
and our food. I hold people accountable for tangible actions and outputs and I can assure you that I hold myself
accountable to these same high standards.
My second operating principle is grounded in the customer. As a retail business, we must be even more
customer-centric. This means deeper understanding, better listening, better segmentation, genuine sharp insights
regarding what our customers want and need and when they want it as determined from the smart use of data and
analytics. We need to be the best at knowing what matters most to consumers, and we will focus our best talent and
prioritize spending where it will optimally support our turnaround.
My third philosophy is progress over perfection. We will try new things, move fast with what works and even faster
from what doesn't. And when we find winning plays, we'll be more nimble, much like we did with the rollout of Apple
Pay this last fall; from first contact to going live took 12 weeks. We can make meaningful changes for customers in
weeks; we just have to do it more often.
My final approach to leading is that I champion simplicity. We're simplifying for greater transparency, accountability,
and speed. We're making the business more responsive to market conditions by using our scale advantage more
effectively. We cannot afford to carry legacy attitudes and legacy thinking, and we won't.
My overall vision is for McDonald's to be seen as a modern progressive burger company delivering a contemporary
customer experience. Modern is about getting the brand to where we need to be today and progressive is about doing
what it takes to be the McDonald's our customers will expect tomorrow. We're already moving more assertively in this
direction with actions that delight our customers and energize our brand. For example, we've recently committed to
enhance the benefits to employees at company-owned restaurants in the U.S. including a wage increase and paid time
off for full and part-time crew employees.
In March, we announced in the U.S. that we'll stop using antibiotics that are important to human medicine in our
chicken supply chain within the next two years. And there are plans to feature 100% sirloin burgers for a limited time
in the U.S. along with a current test on all-day breakfast.
We also undertook a significant effort to excite our customers and bring the world together virtually with imlovinit24.
About 70,000 people participated in the event, which included 24 hours of McDonald's inspired disruptive creativity in
major cities around the world. And it garnered more than 2 billion impressions across public relations stories and social
media interactions.
Last month, the German team opened a new 500-seat flagship restaurant in Frankfurt, showcasing our most modern
digital and service amenities. And just yesterday, we announced our global commitment on deforestation, which
confirms our aspiration to end deforestation throughout our supply chain. We're harnessing the power inherent in the
McDonald's brand and in our network of valued franchisees, employees, and supplier partners to make this great brand
even greater.
One of the advantages of my broad experience within McDonald's and running other restaurant chains is seeing other
cultures, different structures, and different models. Through this experience, I see McDonald's and its fundamental
advantages, challenges, and opportunities much more clearly. It is this perspective that's helping me look objectively at
the business and make decisions to position McDonald's to deliver enduring, profitable growth for shareholders and the
system.
Thank you for joining us this morning. And now I'd like to turn it over to Kevin.

Thanks, Steve, and hello, everyone. We begin 2015 taking action to lay the foundation for McDonald's turnaround as
we work to address the significant internal and external headwinds that are impacting our business.
Today, I would like to begin by discussing the performance factors that impacted our first quarter results, including the
strategic charges taken in the quarter. Then I'll provide updates on key financial metrics and close with some final
thoughts about our path to realizing our long-term potential.
Our financial model and, therefore, my remarks start with top line sales. First quarter comparable sales were down
2.3%, reflecting negative guest traffic across all of our geographic segments. APMEA's first quarter comp sales decline
of 8.3% had the largest impact on our global performance, with Japan and China posting declines of 32.3% and 4.8%,
respectively. While these results are partly due to the lingering impact of the APMEA supplier issue, Japan's
performance reflects the broad-based consumer perception challenges that the market is working to overcome.
Japan accounts for the lion's share of the segment's quarterly comparable sales decline. Sales trends in China continued
to show sequential improvement as we moved through the quarter. And Australia remains a bright spot, posting its third
consecutive quarter of positive comparable sales.
In the U.S., comparable sales were down 2.6% for the quarter as the segment's slightly positive breakfast daypart was
offset by weakness across all other dayparts. We are working to enhance the customer experience with locally relevant
tastes, a simplified menu, and compelling value offerings.
Europe comparable sales ended the quarter down 0.6%, with positive performance in the U.K. more than offset by
weak results in France and Russia.
Looking ahead to April, global comparable sales are expected to be negative. This weak top line performance
accounted for about half of the constant currency decline in operating income for the first quarter. The other half of the
decline in operating income is attributable to the $195 million of strategic charges taken in the quarter to optimize the
business. The first component of the charges totaling $85 million includes asset write-offs related to our refranchising
initiative, as we've decisions to sell certain restaurants to developmental licensees.
The next component of these charges is related to the strategic decisions to close about 350 underperforming
restaurants, primarily in Japan, the U.S., and China. These restaurant closings are in addition to the 350 global
restaurant closings originally planned for 2015. The total charge for asset write-offs related to these incremental
closings was approximately $72 million. Most of these restaurants were not contributing to our overall profitability or
cash flow. And we'll continue to review our restaurant portfolio, with the intent of optimizing our asset base around the
world.
The final component of the charges was $38 million related to restructuring costs for our U.S. business. This amount
consists primarily of employee severance and other related costs.
Earnings per share for the quarter was down $0.37, which includes $0.17 related to the strategic charges and $0.09 in
negative foreign currency impact. Excluding the impact of the charges and foreign currency translation, earnings per
share for the quarter was down $0.11, or 9%.
From an operating perspective, with 81% of our global restaurants franchised, the largest driver of operating income
continues to be our franchise margins, which declined $152 million to $1.6 billion, a 1% decrease in constant
currencies.
Global company operated margin dollars declined $164 million to $560 million for the quarter, a 13% decrease in
constant currencies. The company operated margin percent decreased 180 basis points to 14.3%, reflecting negative
comparable guest counts across all segments as well as higher commodity and labor costs.
Next, I want to provide an update on our commodities, pricing, foreign currency impact, and cash returned to
shareholders. I'll start with commodity costs for the U.S. and Europe. For the first quarter, U.S. commodity costs rose
approximately 2%, primarily due to higher beef prices. To help offset this pressure, we took some price increases. Our
first quarter pricing in the U.S., year-over-year, was up roughly 2%, which was below food away from home inflation

of around 2%. The current projected increase in food away from home inflation for the full year is 2% to 3%.
Excluding currency, Europe's commodity costs were relatively flat in the first quarter. Our pricing increases in Europe
vary by market with the overall segment, excluding Russia, averaging about 2% year-over-year.
Now turning to foreign currency impact. The U.S. dollar has strengthened dramatically against nearly all of the world's
other major currencies. During the last eight months, the dollar has experienced its fastest rise in 40 years. At these
levels, foreign currency translation is having a significant impact on our reported results as evidenced by the $700
million impact to our first quarter reported revenues and the $0.09 impact to our first quarter reported EPS.
Based on current exchange rates, we now expect foreign currency translation to negatively impact our results by $0.13
to $0.14 in the second quarter, and $0.40 to $0.45 for the full year. As usual, take this as directional guidance only,
because rates will change as we move throughout the year. And keep in mind this is an accounting translation impact
more than a cash impact.
Despite our top line and margin pressures, our business continues to generate significant cash flow. In addition to
reinvesting in the business to drive future growth, we returned $1.4 billion to our shareholders in dividends and share
repurchases in the first quarter.
As Steve mentioned, we're taking a close look at our organization, challenging ourselves and the status quo. Our goal is
to position the company for enduring profitable growth. We must get back to better leveraging the benefits of our
business model, including the entrepreneurial spirit of our franchisees. We must utilize our considerable resources more
efficiently. And we must meet our customers' evolving needs more consistently. I'm energized by the challenges before
us, and I look forward to working with Steve, Pete, and the broader McDonald's system to bring our vision to reality.
Thank you.
Now, I'll turn it back to Chris to begin our Q&A.
Chris Stent
Thanks, Kevin. Before we begin Q&A, I want to make a comment about our financial outlook for the full year 2015.
As you know, each quarter we provide details around our expectations for several key components influencing annual
earnings per share.
In light of the upcoming announcement of McDonald's turnaround plan, it was not appropriate to update our outlook in
management's prepared remarks or as part of today's 8-K filing. An update on our outlook will be provided in
conjunction with the announcement of our plans on May 4, 2015.
Q&A
<A - Chris Stent>: We will now open the call for analyst and investor questions. Please press star 1 if you have a
question and star 2 to remove yourself from the queue. To give as many people as possible the opportunity to ask
questions, please limit yourself to one question. We'll come back to you for follow up questions as time allows. The
first question is from Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer.
<Q - Brian J. Bittner>: Thanks, I really appreciate it. A question on the U.S. business. In the U.S., I heard a lot over
the last few months about the need for more simplicity, needing to improve speed, which I think suggests a diagnosis of
a throughput problem, but when you look at the underperformance in the comps versus the industry and on an absolute
basis, it does suggest a bigger, more pure demand issue. And so the question is what's going to be going on over the
next couple of months to really drive a resurgence in guest counts that may be more dramatic than simplification? I
guess like are the extended breakfast tests going well? What's the plan there? As far as new products being rolled out
more rapidly, like you guys just did the chicken sandwich, is that something we're going to see more of? If you could
just kind of talk about that altogether, that would be great.

<A - Stephen J. Easterbrook>: I'll take that, Brian, thank you. So I think you're absolutely right; there is no one single
solution to getting any of our businesses moving. We have a strong plan in place, if I can dissect that question of yours.
One is how we're going to drive demand and then secondly how we're going to manage that demand. The driving
demand is going to be driven through both national and local menu news. So we have some strong and some exciting
product lines ahead, so most recently we've announced the sirloin burger, which we believe will be a favorite with
customers and have broad resonance, but also we are liberating the creativity, and I guess the insight of our local
markets to develop local food menu items that better resonate with the local customer base. So the demand driving, I
believe, can operate at two levels.
That said and done, we've still got to make the entire McDonald's experience just a little easier for our customers and a
little easier for our crew, and that's where the simplification piece comes in. And it's not simply the menu
simplification, it's what else can we take off the workload of our teams in our restaurants to enable them to focus on
what really matters, which is taking care of customers. So menu simplification will certainly help. There has been the
initial phase of that from January where we have not seen a significant sales uplift from it, but we have seen it provide
us with easing of operational complexity. There will be further moves on menu simplification coming up now, because
we have a number of tests in place. And we can share those with you as the results become clearer. But also there's
other things we can do to take workload out of the restaurants and just simplify the job for our managers and crews they
can focus on their front line role, which is taking care of customers. So two things, driving demand and then meeting
demand, and we've got actions on both.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question is from Andrew Charles of Cowen & Co.
<Q - Andrew M. Charles>: Great. Thanks. Kevin, to put the U.S. and China restaurant closures into perspective,
what's the base of company restaurants that are currently cash flow negative? And should we expect these closures to
be the first wave in what could be future closures as well?
<A - Kevin M. Ozan>: Yeah. So the restaurants that we closed, or that we're announcing that we're closing right now,
were all certainly underperforming not adding significantly to profitability and cash flow. We don't expect a lot more
throughout the rest of this year, so you shouldn't expect to see a lot more happen through the rest of the year related to
additional closures. There may be some little charges that I'll say come in through the next couple of quarters, some
related to incurring costs as we actually close the restaurants and there may be a few additional restaurants, but you
shouldn't expect a lot more significant closings, certainly nothing the magnitude of the first quarter.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question is from Joe Buckley of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Joseph Terrence Buckley>: Thank you. Maybe a couple of follow-ups on that. You – and if you guys defer this
to May 4, I understand, but there was no mention of expansion in 2015. Are the older expansion plans kind of still in
place so net-net there would still be some increase in restaurants?
And then a somewhat related question, I guess, the $85 million charge from the prior or already previously disclosed
refranchising plans, is that coming because you decided to do those on a developmental licensing basis? And if so,
maybe talk about that change if in fact it was a change?
<A - Kevin M. Ozan>: Thanks, Joe, I'll take that. First, related to expansion, you saw we took everything out from the
outlook. Obviously, we're still opening restaurants, but we'll update all of the kind of outlook pieces, including
expansion, on the call on May 4.
Related to the charges, couple of things. So, we referred to one of the pieces of the charge as cost related to write-offs
as we made decisions to sell restaurants to developmental licensees. That'd be consistent with our past practice. As we
make decisions to sell, whether it's restaurants or countries to somebody, we need to look and see how it's valued and
what we believe we can get in return for selling those restaurants. And as we make a decision and evaluate kind of the
fair value versus what we have recorded on our books, it requires us to potentially write down the net book value to get
to the selling price we're going to realize. That's what those amounts relate to. It would be consistent with prior
practice. We made some decisions to actually sell some restaurants to developmental licensees and we need to now
record the cost of it – it equals what we expect to realize when we sell those restaurants

<A - Chris Stent>: Next question is from Jeff Bernstein of Barclays.
<Q - Jeff Andrew Bernstein>: Great. Thank you very much. Steve, just a question on the franchise relations or maybe
the health of the franchisees, however you want to look at it. But obviously difficult for us looking in from the outside.
On one hand, it would seem like your franchisees are probably among the most successful in quick service, whether it's
from a sales or a profit standpoint.
But at the same time, I can imagine the recent weakness doesn't drive some frustration. So, I'm just wondering, with
that kind of as a backdrop, I mean what's the greatest pushback or perhaps just maybe suggestions you hear from
franchisees in terms of turning around at least the U.S. business? That would be one thing, because I'm guessing they
have some pretty good insights.
And, secondly, do you typically discuss the initiatives and plans for the system with them ahead of time? For example,
like, the turnaround presentation, early May, do they get kind of an advance look or do they opine on the initiatives that
you plan on putting out there? Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Easterbrook>: Okay, Jeff. Thanks for your questions. So, the owner-operator relationship is
absolutely fundamental to the ongoing strength. It has been for 60 years. And, certainly, I want to continue that and
champion that. When business is a little tough, like it is at the moment in the U.S. with cash flows being challenged,
yeah, frustrations do arise, as you would expect.
The wonderful thing about the relationship we have with the operators is that there is a really open dialogue. Their
views and our views we share openly as we build these plans together and I don't think that will change.
As you go through turnarounds, I'm going to tell you from my experience in the past, in other markets, they are a little
bumpy by nature. It isn't just a straight line growth curve. And that will require – it does require some bold and decisive
decision-making, which, on occasions, can lead to one or two friction points. And there's one or two things we can
learn from one or two of the decisions we have made, but it doesn't mean the decisions we are making are wrong, far
from it. I'm confident in the decisions that Mike is making from the U.S. and I'm making on a global level. And the
ultimate objective from this clearly is, as you know, with our business model of the three-legged stool is that our supply
partners, our owner-operators, and the company succeed together. And I would love that to be an operator-led success
as well. Nothing would thrill me more.
With regards to what we're looking towards on May 4, there's to be a number of measures we'll talk to, some of which,
clearly, you wouldn't expect me to talk to now, some of which we'll be able to share some broader operating plans and
the markets with the broader audience. So, some of the work is going on in the markets as we speak. There will be
other elements that we will save for May 4 to share with all audiences at the same time.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question is from Keith Siegner of UBS.
<Q - Keith R. Siegner>: Thank you. Steve, if I could circle back to some of your original points earlier about driving
demand and ways to driving demand. You talked about the product, but in another increasingly important area is the
digital engagement tool. Just wondering if you could give us an update on the launch of a mobile app, maybe some of
the details of what functionality you might include in the launch. And then, is there going to be this role of subsequent
updates and increased functionality? How do we think about adding in this tool to the driving demand aspect of the
equation? Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Easterbrook>: It's a great question, Keith. It's something we are excited about here, I've got to say.
As you probably know, my previous role I was responsible for trying to establish our digital team and vision here, and
we built a highly skilled and capable group managing that for us. We are moving without a doubt from a world of mass
marketing to one I describe as mass personalization, and clearly technology allows us to do that now, which allows us
to build a much more meaningful relationship with our customers, to shift from a transactional relationship into a far
more engaging and meaningful purposeful relationship where we can understand their needs on an individual basis
rather than a generic basis.

We are building a, what we're calling, our global mobile app. We will be launching it in the U.S. in the second half of
this year, and there are two elements to our digital vision. One is the experience side and the other is the engagement
side. The experience is how can we use technology just to make the day-to-day customer experience easier and more
convenient. And the engagement side is really more about the fun part of the brand.
So the initial app that we'll be launching will be focusing primarily on the experience, just trying to make the
day-to-day customer experience smoother and more convenient. And then, future iterations which are already building
up the pipeline, I've got to say, will further enhance that experience and introduce more elements of fun to it. So, I
would not really be – personally, we are not building in a sales build in relation to this for 2015, but we do see it as
being a business driver as we look out.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question is from Jeff Farmer of Wells Fargo.
<Q - Jeff D. Farmer>: Thank you. In past 10-K filings you've disclosed it looks like that the annual cost to support a
typical company-owned U.S. restaurant was about $50,000. I'm curious if that number is still accurate? And just as a
quick follow up, on that May 4 date, I'm just curious how did you come to determine that that was an appropriate date
to share the turnaround plan details? Thank you.
<A - Stephen J. Easterbrook>: Well, I can take the second one.
<A - Kevin M. Ozan>: I'll take the – go ahead.
<A - Stephen J. Easterbrook>: So the date was – clearly this is my seventh week now in position, alongside Kevin as
well. And you can imagine we've been working pretty hard on this. It wasn't a standing start because we both have our
histories we've brought into our current positions.
May 4 is an important opportunity for us, partly because, yes, I've been moving flat out to build a meaningful plan of
merit sharing with you. Also, that week we have our leaders from around the world in here as well, and it's a great
opportunity to share it with them at the same time as we share it with the broader audiences. So that date just sits
comfortably in the cadence of action that we're building here.
<A - Kevin M. Ozan>: And then, regarding your question on kind of G&A per restaurant. In the U.S., we've said it's
about $45,000 per restaurant. Internationally it varies by market, but it's generally in that $45,000 to $50,000 ballpark.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question is from John Glass of Morgan Stanley.
<Q - John Glass>: Thanks. Thanks very much. Steve, to the extent you're willing to talk about it today, when you
think about your turnaround plans, do you think about them focusing more on the operating part of the business? Or is
it more of a financial restructuring? Or how do you weight those two in importance in your mind? If you're not willing
or less willing to talk about that now, I also wonder about how your own turnaround experiences, maybe it's the U.K.,
some other businesses you've been involved with, what are the important elements in those turnarounds? And are those
applicable to this situation, or is this very different in your mind?
<A - Stephen J. Easterbrook>: Yeah, no, it's a great question, John, thank you. Absolutely, unequivocally, this is
around driving operating growth and our operating business. Simply put, we want to sell more hamburgers to more
customers, more often around the world. So this is going to be a growth-led turnaround. There are things we can do to
help that, and probably to your second point and just from personal experience back in the U.K., which was there are
certain things we can do as management leaders in this business to help us run a more effective operating business.
So the sort of things that I have been looking at is around our organizational structure, around our ownership mix about
how we can get that drive in the restaurants most effectively. And about how we best use our resources. And you may
have heard me say before, any leader in any business, there are typically three resources that we have at our disposal:
there's human resource, there's financial resource, and there's time. So we're challenging ourselves to how we can most
effectively use those three resources to prioritize them behind the areas that are going to deliver the greatest return, and
the greatest growth in this turnaround.

<A - Chris Stent>: Next question, David Palmer from RBC.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: Thanks. Steve, just a question on premium and value, on the value side, particularly as you
focus on the U.S. How confident are you that regional value marketing is going to be the way going forward? And how
confident are you that this will be effective enough to replace what the dollar menu did for McDonald's over a decade?
And on the quality side, how good – I know this is a journey, which you're embarking upon and you're seeing a little bit
in the second quarter. But, how good is good enough? For instance, one would have no doubt that if you had a chicken
sandwich as good as Chick-fil-A, that that would sell well, but I'm just trying to get a sense of your commitment and
how you're benchmarking and what your goals are on quality. Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Easterbrook>: Thank you, David. So on the value piece; I would say regional clearly has a part to
play. But it is a balance, and I know that Mike and the U.S. team are working on that balance between getting
national-driven value, where we can use our scale, and economy of scale on a national level, along with freeing up the
regions to really identify the menu items that matter most in their geography, given maybe their climates and given
affordability issues. It very, very much differs region by region. So, there will be a balance of play on value. We
haven't quite found that equation yet, but we know we're working hard to unlock it.
In terms of quality, our benchmark is ourselves. What we're working on now, and what Mike and the menu teams are
working on, is how can we deliver a better McDonald's menu? So we're very proud of our core products, what can we
do to enhance the quality, both direct quality and also the quality of perception, as we develop new items. Again, our
benchmark is ourselves, and the customers are guiding us on that. So we believe if we can bring great quality products
at the value of McDonald's that is the equation that will drive growth.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question is from Karen Holthouse of Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Karen Holthouse>: Hi, thank you. So, looking at a number of initiatives, whether it's on the improving sort of
employee benefits and the wages or improving the quality of products, theoretically, there would be a cost associated
with most of these. And how do we think about it from a high level, first, the plan to absorb those costs versus push that
on to the consumer through pricing in the company system? And then, as these cost pressures on the ingredient side
would float a franchisee and then wages, there could be some spill-over effects for McDonald's and then other margin
players who are making similar moves, just helping them manage through that without necessarily passing all of it on.
<A - Kevin M. Ozan>: Yeah, hey, Karen, it's Kevin. I'll take that. The minimum wage cost as well as all other costs
certainly impact how we look at pricing, how we look at our margins. We've talked about with the minimum wage that
it will impact our margins in the near-term. But it also – there's a lot of benefits to it, in that it'll be able to enhance our
competitiveness in the marketplace.
Our thought is that our turnover will decrease; we'll be able to attract and retain the best employees. So while there's a
near-term cost to some of those, we also look at the benefits, and the market will help dictate to us what kind of pricing
we're able to get related to some of those costs. But we look at a lot of this as what do we need to do to make sure that
we've got the business set up to be able to drive top line sales. And those are some of the pieces.
<A - Stephen J. Easterbrook>: Just one piece to add to that as well, is – I talk about simplicity and simplification,
complexity typically adds cost in one way, shape, or form as well. So I know Mike and the team are working hard to try
and strip either the non-value-added activity in the restaurant, or make cuts as far away from the consumer as possible,
just to free up just a little bit of room on the P&L, so we can mitigate one or two of the inherent inflationary costs that
we face.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question is from Sara Senatore of Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Sara H. Senatore>: Thank you. One little detail, and then, I guess a bigger question. The detail is can you – I
may have missed it, but could you give us the China comp?
And then the bigger question is you are – just going back to the store closures, can you give us a sense where – were
they more likely to come from later cohorts of stores, as in, is there some evidence that maybe the store growth that
we've seen over the last couple of years probably wasn't – may have led to a point of kind of oversaturation. I guess, in

general, when I look at turnarounds in this industry, they usually do include a fairly significant amount of asset
rationalization, so I'm just trying to get a sense of – of the sort of growth rate going forward that you would expect to
see and – and how you think about the stores, are they – maybe some of the more recent development decisions were
not ideal?
<A - Kevin M. Ozan>: Thanks, Sara, it's Kevin. I'll take that. Regarding China's comp for the quarter, it was negative
4.8%. So, that's the China question.
The other, regarding kind of optimizing assets. What I would tell you is we've been reviewing our restaurant portfolio
around the world to ensure that we're set up to grow successfully in the future. So, that review resulted in these
decisions to close the 350 underperforming restaurants, primarily in Japan, U.S., and China. In China, a lot of those
openings were, I'll say, between 2009 and 2012, where they have been consistently underperforming. Our sales
estimation processes probably weren't as great during those years, but we now have better tools and better processes so
that our sales estimation processes have been better.
Japan, they are generally heavy loss-maker restaurants that we're closing, so that will help the portfolio. And we're
pretty much complete with that review, like I said before, there may be some limited additional closures, there may be
some limited additional charges, but the magnitude of any additional charges will not be anything close to what we've
got in the first quarter.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question is from Will Slabaugh of Stephens.
<Q - Will Slabaugh>: Yeah, thanks, guys. Just a question around the menu globally and maybe even more applicable
here in the U.S. Can you talk about the balance of launching new items that are enticing and different enough to
actually drive new people or maybe lapse guests into your restaurants that's been lacking a little bit in the past number
of years versus your plan to simplify the menu?
<A - Stephen J. Easterbrook>: Yeah. So, I think there is, probably, three elements to this actually, Will. So, one is our
core menu, which is still our fundamental engine of growth. These are $1 billion brands, a handful of products are $1
billion brands in their own right, and are much loved. So, we are working hard to reinvigorate the consumers' love and
demand for that.
On the new items, two elements. Some is launching permanent new items, and some is just using LTOs. Again, they
both play a different role. You can only absorb so many new permanent items, because – clearly, they demand a
permanent place on menu boards and that does – can typically add additional complexity. LTO can provide some fun.
So, you are talking four-week, five-week, six-week promotional activity around themed events. It could be around
World Cup soccer, or it could be around the Olympics, it could be around a time of year and a seasonal event. That just
makes yourself interesting. That rewards existing customers who may want to try something different for a little while
and then return to their favorites.
So that's always a balance, but part of what we're working on with our marketing leads, certainly in the major markets
is to understand how that best balance works. If we lurch too far one way and streamline it, we don't have enough new
and enticing news out there, if you go the other way, it becomes a little frenetic and customers can't follow and the
restaurants find it hard to execute. But there is not a science to this, but all three are important. But primarily core,
meaningful new menu additions, and then introducing some fun on occasion through LTOs just to spice up the market a
little bit.
<A - Chris Stent>: The next question is from Jason West of Credit Suisse.
<Q - Jason West>: Yeah, thanks. I guess, going back to Jeff Farmer's question about the timing of the meeting. I
guess, it felt like you guys were going to spend a little more time, Steve, since you haven't been there very long, to kind
of get the plan together, based on some of your comments at the New York meeting. So, I guess, can you talk about is
the meeting on May 4 meant to present the comprehensive sort of final plan that you've come up with or is this more of
sort of first look at some of the things that you're working on and then you'll build from there? Can you help frame that
a bit?

<A - Stephen J. Easterbrook>: Yeah, on the call we will be sharing the initial details of the turnaround plan. Clearly, I
don't want to say too much about it, because that's the reason we're having the call on May 4. But we have selected that
date because we believe our plans – those initial plans will be well enough baked out that it will be meaningful news to
all of the audiences that have an interest in what we're doing at McDonald's.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question is from Andy Barish of Jefferies.
<Q - Andrew Marc Barish>: Good morning. Thanks, guys. Just one, I guess, quick follow up and then a financial
question. On the product news, Steve, in the research you are looking at or doing, do you think the brand has credibility
on the premium side? I mean there have been some efforts, obviously, with most recently re-introducing chicken
tenders, in the past on premium burgers and wings that haven't really worked. So, I guess, what's the current thinking
on that?
And then, the financial question for Kevin was you referenced higher lease cost in the franchise margin decline. Is there
something going on with rent escalations, they're something above average? I just don't recall seeing that, historically,
in your explanation.
<A - Stephen J. Easterbrook>: Yeah, thanks, Andy. For premium quality, I mean, I often describe McDonald's as
possibly the most democratic, with a small D, brand in the world. And what customers love the world over, and none
more so than here in the U.S., is how they can buy in to aspirational quality products but at a McDonald's price. They
don't have to pay over the odds for it. And when we're on our game and we have all elements of our business working
well, our service experience, our digital engagement, the across-the-counter quality, and new food news, then all those
components really do add value to the customer experience and their perception, their assessment of us. So, yes, there's
room for it.
We have to be competitive in the marketplace, but we can bring great quality. So, for example, removing of the
antibiotics out of our chicken supply chain across the next two years is a move that customers value because we can
bring to them quality ingredients and quality menu items at the McDonald's affordable prices. And they encourage us to
do more of that. And we will continue, particularly here in the U.S. as Mike brings to life the food agenda that he has as
part of his vision for the business, we will continue to make moves such as that to bring premium-quality food at
everyday prices. And again, the sirloin burger is a great example of that. It's a premium beef cut at McDonald's prices.
And looking forward to the customers' response to that.
<A - Kevin M. Ozan>: And then, Andy, related to the lease costs, to your point we normally have rent escalation, so
it's not necessarily anything new. Some of it is escalation, but more of it really relates to sales. We've talked about
before it's a top line game, so negative comp sales clearly put pressure on our margins. And when we don't have that
sales leverage, that significantly impacts margins. So, that's really the bigger impact.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question is from Matt DiFrisco of Guggenheim.
<Q - Matthew James DiFrisco>: Thank you. I think what stuck out to me also was a couple of the growth year
markets where you're opening a lot of stores also seem to be some of the weaker comp stories this year. I understand it's
a long-term plan, some of those openings, but is that somewhat of a foreshadowing I guess for 2016? Perhaps the lower
comp environment that we're in now might – should it be presumed that we're going to probably see a little bit more
pragmatic and slower development in those markets in response? Especially from the franchise community, more so of
the emerging franchise community in China, does that disrupt it at all?
<A - Peter J. Bensen>: Hey, Matt, it's Pete. Yeah, there's really no correlation between looking at the store growth
numbers in the release and the comp sales. We have acknowledged in some of the major markets we've got some
turnaround activities to undertake, and we're undertaking those obviously with the belief and the confidence that there
is long-term growth potential in those markets. And restaurant development is not something that we kind of turn on
and turn off with a switch, because there's a pipeline involved, there's a – from permitting to restaurant opening it's a
several months to multi-year process, depending on the country. So you shouldn't be drawing any correlation between
those two, and as we'll be able to talk about in a little more detail on May 4 the efforts around turning the top line in the
business are of utmost focus, especially in those markets where comps are weakest.

<A - Chris Stent>: Next question is from John Ivankoe of JPMorgan.
<Q - John William Ivankoe>: Thank you. Just a two-part question, if I may. Steve, as you've kind of seen all of the
research that McDonald's has had, was there maybe one or two big things that consumers were telling you about three
years to four years ago that you needed to change and you could have kind of prevented the decline in the sales? And I
ask this question really in the context of what were those preventable factors, if you will, and is the organization kind of
in a place where it can act on some of that right research?
And secondly, if I may, which I guess is a little bit unrelated, there's been at least some illusion that there could be
separate expressions of the McDonald's brand through the drive-thru and the in-store experience, at least in the U.S.,
and Create Your Taste is certainly maybe moving in that direction, but if you could give us some light in terms of how
some of the drive-thru optimization tests are going around the U.S. Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Easterbrook>: Yeah, sure. Thanks, John. So looking back three years to four years, I – rather than
anything we missed through consumer insight, I think perhaps the challenge we left ourselves with, we had four or five
growth initiatives working together really through the 2000s. So from 2003 to about 2010, 2011 we had a number of
different growth platforms that worked and they worked around the world. Different markets sequenced them in
different orders, but everything from delivering great quality coffee which then drove breakfast business, going to
extended hours, the re-imaging program, for example, just to name three.
Perhaps what we didn't foresee and respond as well as we could have done ourselves is to create that future pipeline of
growth platforms. Now sometimes the consumer will guide you there, but sometimes you've got to take that into your
own hands. And that was probably perhaps something that – as we look back through our history, we wish we could
have done a little better. The one trend I would say we're working hard to address now is general consumer desire to be
part of something big, but to treat as an individual, and that's where the whole personalization piece comes in. Whether
that's the way we engage and communicate with customers, which is, I believe technology will help us get there, where
we can have a much more personal relationship at a level that customers are happy with, but also on the menu side, and
that's where the customization of food comes in.
And then on to your second point on Create Your Taste. One of the views is we have here is we have an ability to test
these things out and learn. So Create Your Taste, for example, is an option within our broader McDonald's experience
for the future ambition. We have really concerted push on this in Australia, and we will have one or two markets up and
running within the U.S. And we will respond – we will be able to see from consumers' response to that pretty quickly
how that in-store experience builds out and plays out. And then, again, in relation to your second point, how that then
works through the drive-thru. And time will tell, but we have a number of other ways that we can perhaps customize
our menu or personalize our menu that we're also working on. We have test sales going on around the country and
around the world to better learn. How we can best meet that consumer need is around personalization. It is powerful.
We believe we can deliver against it. And our confidence is when we start to really connect on that level and unlock the
benefits of personalization, the 69 million customers a day that will have a significant impact and drive
long-term-sustaining growth.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question is from Nicole Miller-Regan of Piper Jaffray.
<Q - Nicole M. Miller Regan>: Thank you, good morning. I just wanted to ask about the early stages of the efforts to
drive results of the restructuring of the field-level operations. I think that is something that was done in the U.S. I don't
know, a quarter or two ago. And I believe it was maybe doing it by region or better matching up the corporate with the
local consumer preference. Could you just let us know what you are hearing from the field-level operations, please?
Thank you.
<A - Stephen J. Easterbrook>: Yeah, so I'll take that, Nicole. Yeah, so, Mike made a very deliberate move at the back
end of last year to announce a streamlining of the organization structure. I mean, over time, the structures can build up,
and he took a very concerted view of that. He really took out one level, one layer between corporate and then the
regions. That leaves us with 22 regions around the U.S. What that has done is ask for a different role of performance
out of our general managers and our operator leaders in the regions and a different way of engaging and speed of

decision-making in the center. So as the teams are embedding with these new accountabilities, new responsibilities,
we're in that transition stage. I don't think we've got everything humming perfectly right now, but nor would I expect us
to. It's a significant change for the organization. It's absolutely the right one to have made, and has my full support and
we want to shorten the time period to get to execution of the new roles and responsibilities in that structure.
<A - Chris Stent>: The last question is from David Tarantino of Robert W. Baird.
<Q - David E. Tarantino>: Hi, good morning. Steve, just a high level question about your vision. I think you
mentioned that you wanted to remove some of the legacy thinking and change the mindset of the organization. I was
wondering if maybe you could share some examples of some of the legacy thinking that needs to be changed. And then
maybe secondly, based on the seven weeks or so you've been in the job, maybe talk a little bit about how ready you
think the organization or the system is to embrace some of that change in thinking?
<A - Stephen J. Easterbrook>: Okay. That's a nice soft one to end with, David. Thank you. Right. So when I talk
about legacy thinking, and legacy attitude, I mean we have been phenomenally successful for 60 years, and there's so
many good reasons for that and much of that I would not ever wish to change or challenge, it's very precious to us and
we stand in good stead for the next 60 years. However, there is a certain conservatism and incrementalism that builds
into that, and again as a company that has not necessarily been a bad thing, but when you do need to make a step
change, our organization doesn't naturally go there. It needs to be led there. And in my experience at McDonald's,
whenever we've made substantial decisions and substantial changes, we are wonderfully adaptable once that has been
spelled out, but we won't naturally take ourselves there as an organization. So with the team around me, we're
challenging some of the conventional thinking on multiple fronts, and some of that we'll be able to share with you in
the – over time.
With regards to whether several weeks will get people into a state of readiness, I think there's a hunger and an interest
in our business to embrace change. So, I mean, I hear it as I get into the markets, hear it from the owner-operators, and
I think there is a pull and a hunger in the field for what are we going to stand for, where are we heading, and how are
we going to get there. And I'm not new to most of the McDonald's system. I'm new in position, I totally recognize that,
and different expectations and accountabilities come with that, but I think my track record and my history in
McDonald's is relatively well-known around the place. And, therefore, I don't come as a complete surprise. So I look
forward to sharing more on May 4 and ongoing.
<A - Chris Stent>: We're nearing the top of the hour, so I'll turn it over to Steve who has a few closing comments.
Stephen J. Easterbrook
Thank you, Chris. And again, thank you everyone for joining us this morning. In closure, I want to reemphasize our
commitment to reenergizing the business on moving more quickly and assertively to meet the demands and the needs
of our more than 69 million customers everyday around the world. I'm confident in our ability to make the right move
to reset McDonald's as a modern progressive burger company that provides a contemporary experience for our guests.
We will keep driving towards this vision as we build the business and brand and deliver long-term value for customers
and shareholders. I look forward to sharing the initial details of our turnaround plan with you on May 4. Thanks again
to you all. And have a great day.
