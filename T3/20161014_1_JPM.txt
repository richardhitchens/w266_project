MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's third quarter 2016 earnings call. This call is being
recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call.
We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan
Chase's Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead.
Marianne Lake
Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is available on
our website. Please refer to the disclaimer at the back of the presentation.
Starting on page one and taking a look at the quarter, we had strong performance in each of our businesses, despite the
continuation of reasonably challenging conditions. And bringing it all together, this quarter's result was clean with no
significant items and with the Firm reporting net income of $6.3 billion, EPS of $1.58, and a return on tangible
common equity of 13% on $25.5 billion of revenue.
Highlights of the quarter include the highest reported revenue for a third quarter in the CIB, with IB fees up 15%, and
market revenues up 33% with strong performance across the board. Robust core loan growth for the company of 15%
on the back of sustained demand across businesses and the continuation of strong credit performance, including a net
release for Oil & Gas. Card sales are back to double-digit growth year on year, and we saw a strong positive market
reaction to new proprietary products. And finally, we had record consumer deposit growth, up 11%.
Before I move on, we recently submitted our 2016 Resolution filing. The board and management believe that we
submitted a credible plan and more than met the requirements for the October submission. With tremendous efforts

across the company, involving all businesses and functions, and we took many significant actions, perhaps most
notably improving the Firm's overall liquidity, and pre-positioning our material legal entities for both liquidity and
capital. We determined this is in the best interest of the company albeit at some cost. And we took many other
important actions, which, hopefully, you've had the chance to review in our public filing.
Moving back to the quarter and moving on to page two, revenue of $25.5 billion was up $2 billion year on year or up
8%. On the back of continued strong growth in core loans, net interest income was up $700 million and is trending for
the full year to be above the $2.5 billion guided last quarter. Noninterest revenue was up $1.3 billion driven by strong
performance in the CIB. Adjusted expense of $14.5 billion was up $500 million both year on year and quarter on
quarter, largely driven by two notable expense items in Consumer, which I'll talk about later as well as the increase in
FDIC surcharge which took effect this quarter and some higher marketing expense. Credit cost of $1.3 billion in the
quarter includes consumer reserve builds of $225 million, primarily Card, but against that, we have a net reserve
release in Wholesale for Oil & Gas of about $50 million.
So, as I said, net income was $6.3 billion and while down 8% year on year, you will recall that there were a number of
significant items in last year's results, most notably significant tax benefits. If you adjust for tax, legal expense, and
credit reserves, net income is up over $800 million year on year.
Dealing with Oil & Gas here, we are encouraged by how quickly investor sentiment and risk appetite for the sector
returned as the outlook for both oil and gas prices continue to improve. Capital markets opened more broadly to these
clients, and we experienced lower draws against our facilities than previously anticipated. So, a combination of
paydowns, opportunistic loan sales, and select upgrades more than offset the impact of downgrades. If the environment
remains broadly consistent with today, we would not expect further significant builds in the fourth quarter for energy.
Moving to page three and capital, key takeaways from this page, capital and leverage ratios were broadly flat quarter on
quarter with a CET1 ratio of 11.9%, as net capital generation was offset by strong loan and commitment growth.
Our spot balance sheet closed a little over $2.5 trillion, principally a result of strong deposit growth as well as liability
actions taken to raise liquidity in the context of resolution, which also drove up liquid assets. While HQLA was up $23
billion quarter on quarter, our liquid assets were up significantly more than that, as excess liquidity at the Bank is not
included in reported HQLA. Finally, we returned $3.8 billion of net capital to shareholders, including $2.1 billion of
net repurchases and common dividends of $0.48 a share.
Moving on to page four and Consumer & Community Banking, Consumer & Community Banking generated $2.2
billion of net income and an ROE of 16%. We continued to experience record deposit growth, more than twice the
industry average, up 11% year on year. More than half of that growth is from existing customers. And based on the
FDIC survey for 2016, we were number one in absolute growth and grew share in each of our top 30 markets.
Core loan growth remains strong at 19%. And while it's primarily driven by mortgage, we also saw 14% growth in
Auto, 9% in Business Banking, and 7% in Card loans. Card new account originations were up 35%, with strong
demand for Sapphire Reserve and Freedom Unlimited, and with more than three-quarters of new accounts being
opened through digital channels. Card sales volume was up double digits this quarter, and we expect share gains to
accelerate.
So to close on drivers, we saw merchant processing volumes up 13% and our active mobile customer base up 17% (sic)
[year on year].
Revenue of $11.3 billion was up 4% year on year. Consumer and Business Banking revenue was also up 4% on the
back of strong deposit growth. Mortgage revenue was up 21% on higher MSR risk management but also on higher
production margins and growth in NII, as we continue to add high-quality loans to our portfolio.
Card, Commerce Solutions & Auto revenue was down 1%, as the strong momentum in Card and Auto volumes and
balanced growth was offset by higher card origination costs and the remaining impact of co-brand renegotiations. And
while the new account origination costs do cause a near-term drag on revenue, it's a high-class problem to have, as we
expect these accounts will be strongly accretive over time. Looking forward, assuming strong demand (sic) [but

tapering demand] for Sapphire Reserve through the fourth quarter, we would expect revenues for CCSA to be down
about $200 million quarter on quarter on higher acquisition costs, but it will clearly be dependent on the number of new
accounts originated.
Expense of $6.5 billion is up year on year, as I said, driven by two notable items totaling $175 million as well as the
increased FDIC surcharge. The first item relates to liabilities assumed for a merchant in bankruptcy, and the second is a
modest increase in reserves for mortgage servicing. Underlying this expense performance is an incremental investment
of $250 million in marketing and auto lease growth, which is in line with Investor Day guidance and largely
self-funded with expense efficiency.
Finally, the credit environment remains favorable. In Card, we built $200 million of reserves this quarter, reflecting
growth in the portfolio, including newer vintages, which have a higher loss rate than the portfolio average, consistent
with our discussion during the second quarter and consistent with how we underwrite the loans. And in Auto, we built
$25 million of reserves on the back of high-quality loan growth.
Now turning to page five and the Corporate & Investment Bank, total revenue for CIB of $9.5 billion, up 16% year on
year, was the best reported performance for a third quarter and included the highest IB fees on record for a third quarter
too, up 15%. With strong Markets performance across the board, revenues up 33%.
Expense is down 20% year on year on lower legal costs but also with strong expense discipline more broadly. Coupled
with solid credit performance, including a modest reserve build for Oil & Gas here, the business delivered a pretty
clean $2.9 billion of net income and a 17% ROE this quarter.
Diving deeper, IB revenue of $1.7 billion was up 14% year on year, with strong performance across products. We
ranked number one in global IB fees, maintaining share on a year-to-date basis, and ranked number one in North
America and EMEA. Advisory fees were up 8% year on year, and we continue to rank number two globally and have
done more deals than anyone else so far this year.
In equity underwriting, fees were up 38% year on year. With a stable market backdrop and strong investor demand,
issuance was up across products and particularly in IPOs. We ranked number one in wallet globally and in North
America and EMEA, and we also ranked number one on a number of deals basis for overall ECM and IPOs.
Debt underwriting had the highest third quarter on record with strong market-wide bond issuance, record high-grade
bond supply in August, and yields near record lows. Fees were up 12% from a high watermark last year, and we ranked
number one. In terms of outlook, given the strength this quarter, we expect IB fees to be down in the fourth quarter
sequentially but relatively flat year on year.
Markets revenue of $5.7 billion was up 33% year on year. Clients were active and risk management conditions were
favorable. Fixed income revenue was up 48% compared to a weaker third quarter last year. Rates was a standout in
terms of performance this quarter as markets stayed active post-Brexit, with good client flow as well as anticipation of
an uncertainty around central bank actions.
Currencies in emerging markets matched a very strong third quarter last year but were slowed down slightly. And
Credit and Securitized Products came back from a weak prior period with a recovery in the energy sector and central
bank actions motivating clients to put money to work, producing a much more constructive market-making and new
issuance environment, resulting in a particularly strong quarter.
Equities revenue was up 1% compared to a strong third quarter last year with Asia matching last year's strong
performance and strength in North America flow derivatives offsetting weakness in cash volumes.
Taking treasury services and security services revenues together, each were over $900 million, with strong forward
pipelines and levered to higher rates.
Moving on to page six and Commercial Banking, Commercial Banking reported record net income of $778 million on
revenue of $1.9 billion and an ROE of 18%. Revenue was up 14% year on year, driven by a trifecta of NII on loan
growth, higher deposit spreads as well as higher IB revenues.

Loan growth continues to be strong across both C&I and CRE, outperforming the industry. C&I loans were up 10%
year on year despite competition for quality loans as the investments that we've been making this year are delivering
results. We've added over 100 net new bankers, opened seven new offices, and further built out our specialized industry
coverage. And we've added nearly 600 new relationships in middle market this year.
CRE loans grew 19%, reflecting strong originations in both Commercial Term Lending and Real Estate Banking. We
are also seeing stable to improving new loan spreads.
IB revenue was up 57%, in part driven by a few large transactions but bringing year-to-date IB revenues closer to flat
versus last year which is a strong performance. Expense growth of 4% is driven by our investments. And as I said,
these investments are already paying off. Finally, credit performance remained strong with a net charge-off rate of 10
basis points, roughly half of which was driven by Oil & Gas. In addition, you see further reserve releases for Oil & Gas
here as I mentioned earlier. Outside of energy, credit quality is good and the commercial real estate portfolio had no net
charge-offs during the quarter.
Leaving the Commercial Bank and moving on to Asset Management on page seven. Asset Management reported net
income of $557 million with a 29% pre-tax margin and an ROE of 24%. Revenue of $3 billion was up 5% year on year,
driven primarily by strong banking results on higher loan and deposit spreads. Expense of $2.1 billion was up slightly
year on year and up 2% sequentially on higher incentive compensation. We saw positive long-term flows of $19 billion
with strengths in multi-asset, including the benefit of a large mandate this quarter as well as inflows in alternatives and
fixed income, partially offset by outflows in equity products.
In addition, we were the beneficiaries of $22 billion of liquidity flows this quarter, capturing more than our share of
money in motion given money market reform. AUM grew 4% and overall client assets, 5%, to $1.8 trillion and $2.4
trillion, respectively, driven by markets as well as long-term flows. Our long-term investment performance remains
solid with 80% of mutual fund AUM ranked in the first or second quartiles over five years. Lastly, we had record loan
balances of $114 billion, up 5% year on year, driven by mortgage.
Skipping over page eight and Corporate where the results were very close to home and where there are no significant
items to highlight.
So, turning to page nine and the outlook. Looking forward to the fourth quarter, expect net interest income to be up
modestly quarter on quarter on continued strength in loan growth even as we digest the incremental cost of
resolution-based liquidity actions, which will be fully in our run rate in the fourth quarter. Expect noninterest revenue
to be down quarter on quarter based upon our current outlook for IB fees and assuming flat year on year Markets
revenues, also including higher card acquisition costs and seasonally lower mortgages. All else equal, expect NIR to
come in at $50.5 billion plus or minus for the full year market dependent.
Finally, expect adjusted expense in the fourth quarter to be flat year on year, bringing full year expense in at
approximately $56 billion, consistent with our guidance and self-funding the consumer items I mentioned.
So, to wrap up, strong performance whichever way you look at it this quarter. We're continuing to demonstrate that our
operating model and our platform is working for our clients, that our scale across businesses gives us operating
leverage and that our investments through time are paying off. And while as a company we are proud of this quarter's
performance and in particular proud of the growth in the underlying business drivers, we take a long-term disciplined
view and remain focused on delivering excellent customer experience, strong execution, particularly in risk
management and expenses, so that we can continue to deliver best-in-class performance.
With that, operator, please open up the line and we can take questions.

[audio gap] (17:27 – 17:44) from CLSA.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Good morning, Mike.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: Hi. Can you talk about the competitive environment in capital markets? I mean, you had strong
growth. Is that due to better markets, better share, or both?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So, I think there are three things, three or four things to mention. The first is that I would say
that the industry generally had a pretty weak third quarter last year. And so when you think about the year-over-year
comparison, we are a little flattered by last year's performance, not necessarily more so than our peers, but nevertheless
we are. And then we talked about the fact that this quarter the conditions were relatively favorable broadly and
compare/contrast that to last year where there were pockets of activity in client flow, but there were also pockets where
people were really sitting on their hands and not transacting. So I think client flow quite broadly across the environment
would characterize the quarter.
In terms of the competitive performance, I would say it feels like we did well. Obviously, we're the first to report at
approximately six-fifty this morning. It feels like we did relatively well, so we may have gained some share. Certainly,
hopefully, the momentum in terms of the business we've been building and the way we are serving our clients will
serve us in that capacity, not just this quarter but through time. But obviously, there can be a bit of volatility in the
market share space. So we prefer to look at it more through time, and we feel pretty good about the performance.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: Specifically versus the European banks, are you looking to use your balance sheet more to gain
share?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So I would say we don't specifically target to a competitive set, but I will tell you that our
balance sheet, we talked about it many times on this call before that we do have the capacity to put our balance sheet
and our resources to work for our clients, for our best clients, and we think about using those resources in the context of
overall relationships. So if any peer is more leverage-constrained and has less access, we may have a competitive
advantage, and certainly we will continue to make those resources available to our clients.

Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Hi, Glenn.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Hi, thanks very much. I'm curious on card delinquencies ticking up. I know you've been guiding
towards that. But when you see it, it's the only part of credit that has anything but great trends. You mentioned on your
comments newer vintages will have a higher loss rate than the portfolio average. Do you mind just drilling down a little
bit more color on what exactly is driving that? Is that going down credit a little bit, or is that just expected season as
you had thought?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So I don't know, Glenn, if you recall that we had a bit of a discussion about this last quarter
and guided to the fact that we would expect to see our loss rates go up slowly, partly because obviously at 250-ish basis
points, I think we could call that pretty low historically, but also because over the course of the last couple of years, we
have been changing the mix of our originations a bit to the prime, near-prime space, still completely within our credit
risk appetite and at risk-adjusted margins that are better than the portfolio average. So we're getting paid for that. So
we're doing it within our risk appetite, doing it judiciously. But as a result, as those vintages become a higher
percentage of our overall population, they will have a gentle upward pressure on the charge-off rate. So what we're
seeing in terms of the delinquency uptick and the charge-offs gradual increase is completely in line with how we
underwrote those loans and our expectations.
And so as you look forward for us over the course of the next several quarters and we would expect those phenomena
to generally continue, again, slowly, we are growing our portfolio. We are going to see the seasoning of those vintages
as the mix increases and as they become more seasoned, cause us to build reserves but for the right reasons.

<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Fair enough. Fair enough, just one follow-up. If I could get just a high-level comment on, has
anything material changed in terms of rate or curve sensitivity as you remix the portfolio and as you're getting all this
great loan growth? I'm just curious on the current positioning.
<A - Marianne Lake>: No, nothing significant, Glenn. No significant changes to our sensitivity.

Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Hey, good morning.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Good morning, Betsy.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: I had a question on the card strategy. And I know – we all know that you've created
the closed loop and you're using that in part, it seems to drive really efficient pricing in the marketplace on the credit
card products. What I'm obviously seeing is an increase in share on card issuance. You're taking some nice share in the
merchant space as well. I just want to understand what the goal is and how far you're willing to push this, market share
versus ROA, ROE.
<A - Marianne Lake>: So look, I would say that all of the things that you mentioned, whether it's closed-loop
network, whether it's our new proprietary products, whether it's our investments in the technology platform and the
business in merchant services, are all at good returns that ultimately will drive the business to be profitable in the future
as it has been in the past. So we haven't given specific guidance for ROE targets for this business, but nothing has
changed over the medium term for what we think that the performance of the business would be.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: So is it fair to suggest that part of the market share improvement here is coming from
some give up of profitability? And the underlying question is, really how much market share do you want in this
business? You're already at 18% to 22% market share of the credit card space depending on which numbers you want
to use.
<A - Marianne Lake>: It's a very competitive business and it's very profitable. So all other things being equal, we
would like to continue to gain share.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Thanks, good morning. Marianne, I'm just wondering, you mentioned that part of the increase in
Consumer cost this quarter was planned investments and that you're continuing to self-fund. I'm just wondering as you
think forward and we get past this good year that you've had, will that be a kind of an underlying expectation for you
guys, again, with the understanding that the revenue environment will always take things up or down? But do you have
an aspiration that you can continue to keep costs flat?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So look, we haven't given specific cost guidance going out beyond this year at this point, but
our objectives will remain consistent with those that we stated previously which is we continue to try and become more
efficient across our businesses. As you know, we're at the tail end but not finished on a couple of large expense
programs in our largest businesses so that we create capacity to be able to invest in the businesses broadly, whether
that's in products, in marketing, an investment in innovation, all of which we're doing as much as we can as long as we
do it well.
And so it's going to come down to, if we think we have investment opportunities that we can execute well that have an
appropriate return, we would like to keep doing that. And in order to have the right to do it, we would like to become

more and more efficient in our core business operations. So we haven't actually given guidance. I think I would
characterize it as expenses under control, creating capacity to invest. But we will decision investments based upon their
merit and obviously, explain them to you in the future at Investor Day, if not another venue.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Understood, okay. And if I can come back to another investment day (sic) [Investor Day] point
from earlier this year, you had mentioned that you had felt comfortable with an 11% CET1. You plan to get to your
CET1 to 12%. You're at 12.1% now already. Just within the construct of Governor Tarullo's recent commentary, does
11% still feel like the right time? Did you sense anything from the commentary that would change your philosophy
around where you'd like to live and that potential comment you made at February to potentially go above 100 if, in fact,
this was the right mechanism?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So first of all, I would say that based upon the speech – and obviously, you know that there are
still some unanswered questions with respect to specific parts of the proposal which I'll come back to. But based on the
speech, moving to a baseline minimum standard is more consistent with how we think about our capital management
policy and using the capital stack add-up using our GSIB score and our stress drawdown. Actually, you would come
out with a sort of capital constraint under CCAR that's pretty much on top of our regulatory capital minimum.
So in that sense, because of the offset, because of the lack of balance sheet growth, lack of RWA growth, and the
curtailment of capital distributions, we've actually ended up in a place where we look to be approximately equally
bound based on last year's test by both of those two measures, which is basically we played in for a while. As we've
talked about before, we've been bound by many constraints somewhat equally over a period of time and striving to sort
of operate within that constraint and maximize shareholder value.
I think the things we don't know are obviously how funding or liquidity shock will be incorporated. And in any case,
this is not for the 2017 CCAR cycle, so it's a whole cycle away from now. So we will be operating in 2017 under the
same basic test construct that we had previously. And so I don't think it's a clear and present danger necessarily that we
will be able to look at payout ratios that are above the top end of our range. Meanwhile, we are at the top end of our
range now.

Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell from Buckingham Research.
<Q - James Mitchell>: Hey. Good morning. Maybe just a quick follow-up on FICC and your commentary and maybe
kind of a broader commentary around how the widening LIBOR or rising LIBOR yields have helped your businesses
across the board in FICC or anywhere else. Just help us understand how that's playing through the income statement.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes. So generally speaking, with respect to our rate sensitivity, as I think you know, we are
most sensitive to the front end of the curve but to IOER and prime. So we do have LIBOR-based assets but also
liabilities. A good example would be commercial loans on the asset side or long-term debt on the liability side but our
notional mismatch is not particularly big. And so as a consequence, the impact of LIBOR curve moves has been not
very significant on our P&L. We wouldn't expect it to be.
I will say that the LIBOR moves were one of the features that our Rates business had a perspective around, and they
got good client flow in and around that trade. And so it was one of the catalysts, one of many, but one of the catalysts
that we point to in terms of the ability for rates to monetize flow as we had a lot of client flow around that conviction.
But I wouldn't yet put a number on it for you.
<Q - James Mitchell>: Good, fair enough. And maybe just a follow-up on deposits. You guys have very good trends
in retail, but on the institutional side, there was quite a bit of flow, it looks like as well. Any particular drivers there?
Was it money market reform helping the flows in institutional or something else?
<A - Marianne Lake>: We obviously did get some good inflows, liquidity flows in terms of money market reform
into our government fund, but we also have been very focused in our other wholesale businesses on continuing to

attract operating deposits. And so as I look at our overall strong deposit growth, I wouldn't say it was equally, but it was
pretty much equally wholesale operating and retail deposit growth. So we feel good about both of those.

Your next question comes from Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Good morning.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Good morning, Matt.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: In light of some of the selling issues over at Wells Fargo, I was just wondering if
you've thought about reevaluating how you approach the consumer, how you compensate staff, and this was obviously
not a JPMorgan-specific question but just for the overall industry. I think it's something folks are wondering about.
There's clearly some stuff that's black and white that you shouldn't do. But I think we also worry that there might be
some gray areas that are somewhat less known. So just how are you thinking about kind of the way you conduct
business and compensate staff in light of what's going on?
<A - Marianne Lake>: I might just give for context remind you all or maybe you recall that for a number of years
now, for a fairly long time, we've been standing up at Investor Day and other venues saying that customer experience is
the central tenet to how we think about engaging with all of our clients but certainly, our retail clients in the branches.
And we've been very, very focused on investing in customer experience broadly defined and have made great progress
I think in doing that. And also, we had talked about the fact that what we are looking for very, very clearly is deep
customer relationships, engaged customers. We want to be a primary bank. We want to gather a deeper share of wallet,
so balance is not necessarily products.
And so again, remember saying, cross-sell is an outcome. It's not an objective, and that's certainly the philosophy with
which we have designed our compensation and performance structures for the branches. And we review them regularly,
at least annually, to make sure that they continue to be aligned with our objectives and again, objectives about the
engaged relationship with customers, good customer experience, in the right products for the right reasons, the right
way.
And so as we think about those objectives and how we've designed our plan and as we look inwardly, not just
obviously because of the news now but also regularly in our BAU [Business as Usual] capacity, we feel like our plans
are designed to incent those behaviors.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from Erika Najarian from Bank of America.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Hi, good morning, just a question back to CIB. You had a slide during Investor Day that
showed a walk to $19 billion of expenses by 2017. If some of the factors that you mentioned that drove revenues in the
CIB higher repeat for 2017, is that $19 billion number still achievable? Or I guess a better way to ask it, will any
incremental revenue uplift from here fall to the bottom line?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So first of all, I would say we are on – I'll tell you we're on track with respect to the
commitment that Daniel [Pinto] made to you to deliver over time the $2.8 billion of expense saves. While we are not
finished yet, we are substantially through that program. So it moved from being a plan through execution to being in
the later stages of execution. So we feel very good about that, which means that, all other things equal, that $19 billion
is still a reasonable level of expense target.

However, obviously, we pay for performance. And so clearly, if we have significant outperformance next year relative
to our expectations at the time we're setting those plans, there would be some variable cost associated with it. But for
every dollar of outperformance, the variable cost may not always be the same. So obviously, it also depends upon the
mix and the payout ratios and all those sorts of things. But a large, large portion of it would be, it would be obviously,
as you know, incredibly accretive because we will be leveraging all of our scale, so the only variable cost would really
be comp largely.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Got it. And just as a follow-up to that, a follow-up to Ken's question actually, he mentioned
the stress capital buffer. Outside of the static balance sheet and capital distribution offset, is there an element to this in
terms of just getting better at the test that you could do to reduce that stress capital buffer without actually taking risk
down significantly?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So look first of all, based upon last year's results for us, we are at the floor for the stress capital
buffer, not to suggest, by the way, that we wouldn't continue to want to properly understand and better understand how
we can, through time, make sure that we are performing the best we can under stress within our risk appetite, but we
are at that floor right now. So within those constraints, what we're trying to do is to be within our risk appetite manage
risk properly but also add shareholder value. We have to carry that capital anyway, so we would want to use it but use
it well.

Your next question comes from Paul Miller from FBR.
<Q - Tim Hayes>: Hi. This is Tim Hayes for Paul Miller.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Hi, Tim.
<Q - Tim Hayes>: Can you give any color on your outlook for margin throughout 2017? To me, Fed commentary
suggests that rates could remain low and potentially hover around these levels over the next 12 months. So how can we
think about your NIM in that type of scenario? And then what would a December rate hike do for your outlook?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Okay. Just for your purposes, I'm going to talk about NII. We don't really manage to NIM, but
you can obviously back into it. So if we ended up in a situation right now where rates were flat throughout all of 2017,
which for what it's worth, I don't think is pretty much anyone's central expectation right now, but if we were rate flat,
you've seen us grow our core loans and our loan balances pretty strongly, pretty consistently across businesses. And
while we may not be able to replicate 15% core loan growth forever, certainly we can continue to grow our loans. So
on that tough mix shift away from securities over time, we should be able to deliver $1.5 billion of incremental NII
next year rate flat.
You know that if we are fortunate enough for the right reasons that we see a hike this year, at the end of this year and
get the full benefit of that next year, it will be higher than that, and you've seen our earnings-at-risk disclosures.
They've been pretty close to a $3 billion number on a 100 basis point move for a while, most of which is front end.
<Q - Tim Hayes>: Okay, thank you. And then switching gears, your CRE and C&I lending was pretty strong this
quarter, and regulators have obviously grown a little bit more cautious on those segments. So if you could, just give any
part of your outlook on lending to those segments going forward.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah. So look, we're aware obviously of the riskier types of CRE lending, the types of lending
that attract scrutiny for reasonable reasons considering how they performed in past cycles. We're also mindful of where
we are in the cycle and take that into consideration in our underwriting. So we have and continue to avoid what I would
characterize as the riskier segments and those segments that performed poorly in previous cycles, and we really stick to
our knitting, if that's an American expression, in terms of continuing to do what we're good at within our risk appetite.
And so if you think about our commercial real estate growth, commercial term lending is about three-quarters of our
portfolio, and you know that we're very focused on smaller loan size, class B, class C properties with low vacancy

rates, so rent-stabilized, high-constrained markets, underwriting low LTVs, good debt service coverage. We look at
forward rates and current rents. And so we really have expertise in a specific niche, and we compete on speed and
certainty of execution, not on credit and structure. So we feel pretty good about our exposures. And even in the more
traditional real estate banking space, we have avoided the riskier segments with limited construction lending, exposure,
homebuilders, minimal exposure. We're pretty disciplined about it.

Your next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom from Guggenheim.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Thanks very much. Marianne, at a conference just before the end of the quarter, another
bank talked about improving underwriting conditions in the auto lending space, particularly sort of in the mid to lower
FICO range. Are you seeing anything similar?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So we're primarily a prime lender in auto. We're the number one prime lender. We actually
have the lowest share in subprime among the national banks, so it's less than 5% of our originations. So I wouldn't
speak specifically to underwriting in the lower FICO sectors, not where we play at this point.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Sure. Sure. I think the reference was to below 700 which includes sort of the bottom end of
the prime segment, which has been an area of intense competitive focus. I'm just wondering if you've seen anything in
that segment.
<A - Marianne Lake>: So not that I would comment on it except for we have recently decided to pull back on
84-month-plus term loans on all FICO bands just as where we are in the cycle, as we see the risks of that type of
lending. So we continue to calibrate our underwriting, but I wouldn't comment on seeing anything specifically.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Got it. And is that influencing your reserve expectations for consumer at all?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Auto?
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Yes.
<A - Marianne Lake>: We've built $25 million of reserves this quarter for Auto, and we expect to continue. We think
the auto opportunity is still strong, and we have a great franchise. We have great manufacturing partnerships that are
growing strongly, too. So as we grow that portfolio, I would expect us to continue to grow reserves modestly in 2017.
However, we are expecting charge-offs to stay under control.

Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chubak from Nomura.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Good morning.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Marianne, I appreciated your remarks on the latest guidance from Tarullo relating to GSIB
capital. One of the questions we've been getting from a lot of folks is because this SCB is calculated based on stress
losses year to year and historically, CCAR resulted in pretty volatile. I'm wondering how you're thinking about the
appropriate management cushion or buffer above the minimum. Historically, it'd been about 50 bps just for AOCI
volatility and maybe operational risk losses, but do you now have to also handicap CCAR volatility when thinking
about that cushion?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So you're right, and obviously, even specifically for JPMorgan, if you look at our stress results
counted by the Fed over the course of the last three years has been reasonable volatility, and clearly, it's not the case
that we would expect it to be completely stable. I would not expect to see the same levels of volatility going forward as

you've seen historically as the test has, as you know, over time occasionally included new not insignificant features.
And while that may continue to be the case, I would think that there would be a bit more stability. But we haven't
actually gone through and finalized our thinking about what the buffers would look like.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Understood. And one more question, just thinking about capital management priorities,
given that the new proposal, as you noted, allows for curtailment of the buyback or termination of the buyback and then
curtailment of the dividend halfway through the test, do these changes as well as the softening of the 30% dividend cap
alter your thinking about how you prioritize buybacks versus dividends?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah. Just before I talk about the prioritization of capital distribution, I would just start by
saying our capital management policies prior to this year's CCAR and this year's resolution had us making those actions
regardless of whether they were allowed to be reflected in the test. And obviously, as part of the resolution planning,
we have revised our policies to include more granular triggers. So our policies do with some specificity run pretty
granularly through time through stress, speak to the sorts of actions that we would be leaning into and taking even if
they don't get reflected in the test.
With respect to the prioritization, look, the soft cap on dividends has been lifted. Dividends are ultimately still a part of
the baseline minimum standard, so there will be possibly some natural constraint there. It hasn't changed at this point
anyway the Board's determination or management's determination about the order of priority. We would like to
continue to have the capacity to grow our dividend. And I think even though there may be some natural constraints, I
think it would be above 30%.

Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy from RBC.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Thank you. Good morning, Marianne.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Good morning, Gerard.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: A quick question. You pointed out that about three-quarters of your credit card acquisitions'
organic growth are coming through mobile channels or digital channels I should say. Can that be moved over to other
consumer products? Or is it just unique to credit cards that you're going to be able to generate that much growth
through the digital channel?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So we are very focused across the sections of our businesses on developing best of digital
capabilities to allow seamless engagement with customers and acquisition through digital channels. There are
complexities associated with documentation and standards for know your customer and anti-money laundering that we
are continuing to work through, but ultimately, it should be achievable, and we're working on it. So one of the things
that we have previously mentioned is that majority of our consumer accounts were opened in branches, one of the
reasons, among others, why branches have been important to us as well as advice centers. And we'll continue to work
on trying to see how far and how fast we can move people to be able to have a better digital experience opening
accounts with us.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Okay, thank you. And then as a follow-up, obviously, third quarter results in Investment
Banking were very strong. Fourth quarter seasonally is weaker than third quarter as you pointed out. Are there any
other reasons why you think the fourth quarter numbers may be weaker than the third quarter other than the traditional
seasonality?
<A - Marianne Lake>: I'll start by pointing out that all of our businesses, not just the ones that I talked about at the
high level, not just Macro Spread Equities, but even if you go a level below that quite granular, all of our businesses did
really quite well this quarter. So not to overuse the phrase, firing on all cylinders, but it really was pretty consistent.
And normally, you might see pockets of more strength and less strength. So I think it would be hard to imagine
replicating this kind of strength through time consistently, but the fourth quarter is seasonally low, and we have no

Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Hi. Hey. I just wanted to follow up on FRTB and Basel IV and how you're thinking
about the implications for JPM at this stage.
<A - Marianne Lake>: So there isn't a whole lot of really clear new news. So as we think about all of – the FRTB, we
talked about before, modest and manageable, and nothing about that has changed for us, but obviously, there's the
advanced and standardized credit operational proposals out there. The most important thing that we've yet to really –
and there are pluses and minuses in it and different for us and others maybe, but the one thing that we haven't really
heard about yet, Betsy, is how it will all be calibrated, and calibration will be very important.
So we're expecting to hear over the course of the next short while maybe that will be delayed just given some of the
discussions, and we'll update you when we hear a bit more about how it's all going to come together. But right now, it's
a little bit unclear.
