Phebe N. Novakovic
Thanks, Erin. Earlier today, we reported fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations of $2.19 per fully diluted
share on revenue of $8.36 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $737 million. It was our strongest revenue
performance in the past 12 quarters, the highest operating earnings ever, and the highest earnings from continuing
operations. For us, it was a powerful quarter. Incidentally, we beat analysts' consensus by $0.06.
For the year, we had fully diluted earnings per share of $7.83 on revenue of $30.85 billion and earnings from
continuing operations of $2.7 billion, a return on sales of 8.7%. It was a year of solid achievement from both an
operating perspective and the development of significant backlog.
As you can see from Schedule H to the press release, funded backlog grew from $38.3 billion at year-end 2013 to $52.9
billion at the end of last year. The story for total backlog is much the same. We were at $45.9 billion at the end of 2013
and sit at $72.4 billion at the end of 2014. As a result, we are well-positioned for growth in 2016 and 2017.
Free cash flow from operations was a negative $254 million in the quarter. However, for the year, we had free cash
flow from operations of $3.2 billion or 120% of earnings from continuing operations. This outpaced 2013 by $532
million.
Let me give you some detail on the quarter and the year in each of the business groups. First, Aerospace. Revenue and
earnings were up nicely over the year ago quarter. Sales were up $105 million, 4.9%, and earnings were up $64 million,
a significant 18.4% on very strong margin improvement. This is particularly impressive when one considers that G&A
and net R&D were up $40 million over the year ago quarter. On a sequential basis, sales were off $49 million, but
earnings were up $1 million on a 40-basis point improvement in operating margins.
I should add that Jet remained nicely profitable in the quarter with a better contribution on both a year ago and
sequential comparison basis. The order activity in the quarter was robust as one would expect with the announcement
of two new aircraft. As you can observe on Exhibit H, funded backlog, total backlog and total potential contract value
including options are all up significantly.
Even if we were to ignore the orders related to the two new aircraft, total orders from current production aircraft were
the highest of the year. All large cabin aircraft had a dollar base book-to-bill greater than one-to-one. For the year,
revenues were $8.65 billion, and operating earnings were $1.61 billion on an operating margin of 18.6%. This is a
year-over-year improvement of 6.5% on sale, 13.8% on earnings and 120 basis points on operating margin. All in all a
very good year at Aerospace with strong operating leverage.
At Combat Systems, sales were up $23 million or 1.4%, and earnings were up $21 million or 8.4% on a 110-basis point
improvement in operating margin over the year ago quarter. Sequentially, the story is similar. Sales were up $219
million, and earnings were up 39%. For the year, sales were down $100 million or 1.7%, and earnings were down $46
million or 5.1%.
This compares quite favorably to the guidance we provided at this time last year. You may recall that we guided to a
4% to 4.5% revenue decline as opposed to the 1.7% decline that occurred. We also guided to operating margins of
14%, which we beat by 100 basis points. Overall, Combat Systems is the story of solid additions to backlog, better than
anticipated revenue and outstanding cost and margin performance. This is a business group that has clearly stabilized.
Marine Group revenue in the quarter exceeded $2 billion for the first time ever. Operating earnings of $193 million
were the second highest ever recorded. Revenue was up $410 million or 25.2% compared to the year ago quarter and
up $220 million or 12.1% sequentially. Revenues for the year were up $600 million, almost 9%, very nice growth.
Operating earnings were up $34 million or 21.4% against the year ago quarter and up $23 million or 13.5%
sequentially. For the full year, earnings were up $37 million or 5.6% on a 30-basis point decline in operating margin
attributable to mix shift, which was consistent with our guidance to you.
In the Marine Group, we guided you at this time last year to a revenue increase of 2.5%, which we obviously exceeded.
We forecasted margins at 9.5% and wound up at 9.6%. All-in-all, a very good year for the Marine Group.

IS&T is a business group where we saw less than expected revenue decline and improved operating performance.
Revenue in the quarter was $2.47 billion, down $223 million or 8.3% against the year ago quarter. Revenue was up
9.8% sequentially and down $1.1 billion or 10.8% for the year. Remember that this is dramatically less than the 20%
revenue decline we forecasted in our guidance to you at this time last year.
Operating earnings of $212 million in the quarter were 8.2% better than the fourth quarter a year ago. On a sequential
basis, operating earnings were up $10 million or 5%. For the year, earnings were down only $10 million or 1.3%,
which is very good performance in the face of a 10.8% revenue decline.
On this call a year ago, I gave you guidance with respect to operating margins in the 8.2% range, which we beat by 40
basis points. All-in-all, we beat forecasted revenue by $1 billion and operating margins by 40 basis points. When that
happens, the result is a very pleasant upside surprise.
So company-wide, on this call a year ago, our guidance for 2014 was to expect revenues of $30 billion, operating
margin rate of 12%, a tax rate of 31% and a return on sales of 8%. We wound up the year with revenues of $30.85
billion, an operating margin rate of 12.6%, and an effective tax rate of 29.7% and a return on sales of 8.7%.
We provided EPS guidance of $6.80 to $6.85. We wound up at $7.83. About $0.62 of the improvement came from
better than planned operating performance; $0.13 from a slightly lower than planned tax rate, and the balance from
share count as a result of share repurchases.
So let me provide you some thoughts about 2015 initially by business group and then on a company-wide rollup. In
Aerospace, we expect revenues to be approximately $9.4 billion, up about 8.3%. Margin rate should be approximately
18%, somewhat down from 2014 attributable in part to less favorability at Jet. Nonetheless, up about 4.5% in earnings.
In Combat Systems, we expect both revenue and earnings to be essentially flat with growth resuming in 2016 and
beyond. The Marine Group is expected to have revenue growth of 2% to 2.5% and a margin rate in the 9.5% range
resulting in a very modest improvement to operating earnings.
Finally in IS&T, we expect a revenue decline of about 5.5%, but improved margin rate of slightly more than 9%. This
will result in improved operating earnings year-over-year. We expected last year to be our low water mark for revenue,
in part, we are seeing some of the decline we anticipated last year being delayed into this year. Once again, we should
see revenue growth in 2016 and 2017.
All of this rolls up to an operating plan of about $31.3 billion to $31.5 billion of revenue. EBIT rate around 12.8% and
a return on sales of roughly 8.7%. This plan is purely from operations, assumes a 30.5% tax rate, assumes we buy
enough shares to hold the share count steady with year-end figure so as not to permit dilution from option exercise.
This rolls up to an EPS guidance of $8.05 to $8.10 per fully diluted share. This compares with last year's guidance of
$6.80 to $6.85 at the same time, on the same basis.
So much like last year, beating our guidance must come from outperforming the operating plan and the effect of share
repurchases. So how should one think about the quarterly progression of EPS? Whatever your model is for the year,
divide by four. And the first and second quarters will be light by about $0.10. The third quarter about right on and the
fourth quarter about $0.20 better. By the way, quarterly progression is notoriously difficult.
With respect to capital deployment, we anticipate using all of our free cash flow in 2015 for dividends and share
repurchases. While we don't anticipate a robust year from a free cash flow perspective in light of the advanced
payments on international orders that we have received last year, we intend to treat the free cash available for dividends
and share repurchases on some normalized basis. In short, we will use balance sheet cash as necessary to normalize the
year.
I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jason Aiken.

Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll take just a minute and cover a few miscellaneous financial items before the
question-and-answer period. Net interest expense in the quarter was $19 million versus $23 million in the fourth quarter
of 2013. And for the year, interest expense was $86 million, consistent with the year before.
For 2015, we expect net interest expense of around $82 million, a decline from 2014 resulting from the repayment of
$500 million of fixed rate notes that matured last week. At the end of the year, our balance sheet reflects a net cash
position, that's cash in excess of debt, of $477 million. This was down by about $1 billion from the end of 2013
reflecting the cash we used from the balance sheet for capital deployment activities, which I'll address in just a minute.
Our effective tax rate was 29.5% for the quarter and 29.7% for the year and that's a bit lower than we had been
forecasting. As you'll recall, our most recent projections were in the neighborhood of 30% to 30.5%. The lower
outcome is attributable to the R&D tax credit extension in late December. For 2015, as Phebe mentioned, we expect an
effective tax rate of around 30.5%.
And finally, on the income statement you'll notice we took a charge in the quarter in discontinued operations. This is
related to the sale of our AxelTech business, which we first reported in the second quarter when we made the decision
to sell that business. The charge we took at the time was predicated on the 2014 closing of the sale. The regulatory
review process for the transaction delayed the closing until the 5th of January, and as a result, we were not able to take
advantage of some tax benefits we'd anticipated, so we adjusted the loss on the sale in the fourth quarter.
Switching gears, we contributed $515 million to our pension plans in 2014 and for 2015, we expect that amount to
decline to approximately $185 million, as a result of the interest rate relief from the Highway and Transportation
Funding Act of 2014.
On the capital deployment front, to summarize our activities for the year, we delivered on our commitment to return
capital to our shareholders while maintaining a strong balance sheet. In total, we expended approximately $3.4 billion
on share repurchases in 2014 and when you combine our share repurchases with our dividend payments, we spent $4.2
billion in shareholder friendly actions in 2014, or 1.3 times our free cash flow from operations for the year.
Erin, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the time back over to you for the Q&A.

<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi, David.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Phebe, could you give us a little bit more detail on the free cash flow outlook? It sounds like
it's going to be large. Can you maybe peg it as a percent of net income in 2015 and what exactly – how much of that is
an advance draw-down in terms of the pressure on free cash flow? Thanks.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: So we tend not to give you specifics as a percent of net income on our free cash flow, but
suffice it to say, it's going to be less robust as a result of our draw-down in our deposits. But we will intend to
normalize our free cash flow using our cash on the balance sheet to affect any capital deployment. I think that's about

Your next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
<Q - Ron Epstein>: Yeah, good morning. Just a quick question for you on Gulfstream. How do you expect I guess the
sales profile for the business to grow when you are leading into their ramp-up of the new models, right? So maybe
better way to say it, in the transition between kind of the old models and the new models, would you expect the profile
of the business to continue to grow?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yes. We do expect the profile to continue to grow in the near years, but at less of a rate
that it will grow when we introduce an entry into service of the new airplanes. So we have growth between now and
entry into service of the G500 and we expect accelerated growth going forward from there.
<Q - Ron Epstein>: Okay. Great. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Good morning, Phebe.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi, Robert.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Hi. I wanted to talk a little bit about Marine and the strength you talked about there, your
very strong fourth quarter and how things do trend as we go through 2015, especially on some of the development work
you're doing on upcoming programs.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Okay. 2014 growth was driven by higher than expected volume on Block IV Electric
Boat, more unplanned repair work and additional commercial volume. And we anticipate that those growth elements to
continue into next year albeit at a less of a rate of increase. Our developmental work, primarily on the higher
replacement ballistic missile submarine continues apace. We're the sole source on that contract, and we're
year-over-year increasing our work on that contract. And it's going very well. So we like where we're positioned there.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: And would you say the fourth quarter itself, you said I think the strongest quarterly
revenues you've seen, how do we think about just the timing there?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Well, we'll continue to see growth this year at about 2% to 2.5%, which is, I think, very
good in this environment. And that growth will continue into the out years as we get more volume on Block IV.
Additionally, we continue to do additional work on our commercial volume. Repair work fluctuates but has
year-over-year been growing, and we begin work on the fourth MLP.
So we've got growth engines for Marine Group. We did obviously last year, we do into this year and we do in the
future. We've been telling a growth story for the last two years at Marine Group. And you saw it manifest itself in 2014.
It's going to continue to 2015 and into the foreseeable future.

<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi, Cai.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Yes. So I guess I'm a little confused at Gulfstream. If your sales go up to $9.4 billion, a nice
sales gain, and we're getting improving profitability on the G650, why are the margins down? I mean Jet just isn't that
big a part of the business. And maybe give us a little more color on the delivery mix if you could.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Sure. So we have a slightly – so there are a couple, I think, that are compressing margins
slightly in 2015. We have a slightly unfavorable mix shift in green production between large cabin and mid cabin.
We're keeping large cabin production about the same rate as we did last year at about 115 units. We're increasing mid
cabin by 10 units. So there is a somewhat unfavorable mix shift between large and mid-size greens.
It's got less of a contribution at Jet primarily and exclusively driven by mix shift. We've got higher R&D in this
upcoming year. Remember that we're building multiple test aircraft that carry with them no revenue and earnings. And
then the final issue that's impacting margin somewhat in 2015 is we have higher pre-owned. So those are the four
components that are driving the margin variability.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: But the R&D, I mean is that up as a percent of sales, because is the G650 still improving in
profitability? Or is the profitability declining on the G450 and G550?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: No. So that's a kind of two-part question. Net R&D is up slightly. The G650 profitability
continues to increase and the G450 and G550 profitability being exactly where it has been. We have a greater mix shift
this year, mix of mid cabin, which carries with it lower earnings, lower margins. Okay?
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Thank you very much, yeah.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: So I think you need to think about it that way. We've talked before about the variability of
margins at Gulfstream. And this is an example of it. There's nothing unexpected from our point of view. There's
nothing systemic. This is simply the ebb and flow of production, R&D and pre-owned.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi, Myles.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: You mentioned that all of the large cabin programs had book-to-bill above one, and
so the question is really two-fold. One is where are the demands you're seeing the biggest pockets of strength, and
whether you're seeing any dilution of strength in the oil rich countries or Russia in particular.
And then the other piece of it is, is 2015 the year where you're delivering more G650s than the G450 and G550s in the
mix?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: So let me talk a little bit about demand and give you a little bit of color there. The demand
for our in-production airplanes was quite handsome for the last quarter. The G650 and the G280 increased and
interestingly, but not surprisingly, when we got inside the demand curve for the G650 inside the three-year delivery
window, Q4 orders were particularly strong. G280 was again strong. The G450 and G550 demand has slowed slightly.
It's okay, not super-heated, but good enough. And we continue to see strong demand primarily in North America, and
somewhat in Asia and also in the Mid-East.
Heretofore, we have seen no impact on oil prices on our backlog or frankly in our demand. If you're asking what
percentage of our backlog may have some exposure to energy related – or have some energy related exposure, it's about
5%, but we haven't seen any impact yet. And I would add we're seeing historically low operating costs which is usually

with any more specificity than we already have with respect to models when you break it up by large cabin and mid

Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned of Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Thank you. Good morning
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi, Doug.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Hi. I wanted to just follow up on that. On the G550, when you look forward here, where
are you today in terms of months of backlog, something you've given us in the past? And how are you thinking about
pricing as you approach the G500 and G600 coming into operation?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yeah, so I think you know that we don't talk about pricing. That's competitively sensitive,
but let me give you a sense of where we are in first available. In general, for new customers for the G650 and G650ER,
first available is fourth quarter 2017 that moved to the right a quarter from third quarter of last year as a result of our
good order activity.
The G550 is about 12 months out; the G450 late this year. So that moved a couple of months just a few months into the
left. The G280 is also available, first available late this year and not that anybody asked, but the G150 is first quarter
2016. So it's important to recall that deals are often in the works that move customers around in the backlog for earlier
slots, but the above is about approximate window for new buyers. So I hope that helps you.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: And you can't really comment on the trajectory on pricing with the model change I guess.
Is that...?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: No. Look, we have continued to hold price on products and you could expect that over
time there is some price variability, but we're not about to get into any specifics. That's just not a good competitive
place to be in a highly competitive market.

fluctuating situation with the DOD budget?

<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Oh, fluctuating. So we have about three-quarters of our guidance for IS&T in our backlog,

for proposal activity and are bidding on a number of contracts, so we are pretty comfortable that we can hit our revenue

<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Hi. Can you talk – I guess two – I'm going to try and put two things in there, but first on
Marine. I'm somewhat surprised that you're not seeing more margin pressure given what I would think would be more
Block IV work and more Ohio replacement work in the year, just in terms of the mix. I guess what are you doing to
offset that?
And then just related to Combat, you talked about growth resuming in 2016. Is this a business that we should now
expect to see kind of growth and there's still 15% kind of margin runway kind of far into the future?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Right. Let me address your questions in the order that they were asked. We've talked
frequently about margin variability at the Marine Group. It's really a mix shift and you quite accurately point out that
we are experiencing a mix shift really frankly across our portfolio. More Block IV, less Block III, more commercial
work coming off of the MLP program and first of class ships on the DDG 1000 and DDG 51 restart.
That said, these businesses have continued to perform very, very well on cost cutting efficiency and their performance
has been quite good. And I frankly expect to see margin expansion primarily driven by Block IV, as we have increased
margin potential and earnings potential from our profitability and efficiency, as we move down our learning curve. So
Marine Group continues to function very, very well. And I like their growth story.
Combat Systems growth, we have that significant backlog. And now for us, it's all a question of performing on that
backlog and I think this group has demonstrated its operational excellence and will continue to do so. So I expect in –
I've given you my guidance for 2015, but as I project out into the future and think about the business, this is going to be
– we're going to see some growth in Combat. And I would expect, fully anticipate given the operational excellence of
this group to see margin expansion, but I'm not going to bake any of that in now. On some of these programs we're still
in fairly new starts and low rate production, but everything we see, this is a group that will continue to cut costs and
improve its efficiency.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Thank you.

<Q - Hunter K. Keay>: Phebe, can you talk a little bit about the variables that drive the decision to take up rate? As
we look here across the global landscape, questions about global economic growth possibly decelerating particularly in
emerging markets, we have a very strong U.S. dollar right now that might be having an impact on some of your
operating expenses.
And sort of as that filters into sort of potential cannibalization within the product lines, more of a G650 production than
anything else, but can you talk about maybe at a higher level if you prefer what factors you guys would look out when
deciding how to think about taking up production rates? Thank you.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: So we have historically, and as we talked about before, we've historically set our
production rate and we've continued that practice based on what we see in demand and to optimize around our
economic efficiency, our supplier base and we've been very judicious year-over-year in setting our production rates and
our delivery.
So as I mentioned, we continue to see very strong demand particularly for the G650. Our pipeline on the G650 is very
good, the G280 also. So we really haven't seen much impact on an emerging market, certainly not this year. North
America remained very strong with this, Asia Pacific and we're also seeing some increased demand in the Middle East.
I would also tell you that about 60% of our backlog is the public and private companies including Fortune 500, and
they tend to be very stable and reliable and predictable. And as I said our pipeline continues to show interest on their
part. So I hope that kind of addressed it. We look at the complex number of factors. What our demand is, what our
goals are for our operating efficiency, our supply chain, we manage prudently.
<Q - Hunter K. Keay>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment of Sterne, Agee. Please proceed.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Yes. Good morning, Phebe.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Good morning.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Phebe, question on just the international demand. I know you gave us some good color on
Gulfstream's impact, particularly tied to the energy end market. You won a lot of orders in terms of combat this past
year. How are we thinking about the international demand for some of the defense business that you have? And any
risk tied to see some of the lower priced oil on that? Thank you.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: The lower priced oil. I've been a big believer and I think history has demonstrated that
demand for defense products is driven by threat and perceived threat, and you just have to open up the paper to see that
the world is an increasingly unsafe place.
So we see an increased level of interest in parts of Europe and the Middle East as you might anticipate. Governments
begin to rethink their spending priorities in light of some of the threats that they see both actualized and potential. So
we have a pretty robust pipeline that's continuing in our IS&T unit and for Combat now. I will tell you that the Marine
Group has almost no and never have had much international exposure, just the nature of our Navy shipbuilding
program.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Okay. Thank you.

<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi, George.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: I want to pursue the margin at Gulfstream a little bit more. This quarter effectively you had
60% incrementals and if I add back the $40 million higher R&D and G&A you had, you would add 100% conversion.
So can you tell me what was so strong this quarter that all of next year's probably going to decline if your numbers are
right, to 15% kind of incremental margins? And also, you had no pre-owned this quarter. You had three for the year
versus 11 in 2013. So why does 2015 pre-owned go up? Thanks.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Well, that's a compound question, George. So let me see if I can at least address what I
think the essence is. The same – having less pre-owned this year, clearly, was an upper to our margins. Pre-owned
tends to carry no revenue. And we forecast pre-owned demand based on what we see in our backlogs. And sometimes
that comes to fruition and sometimes not. So this has been a pretty sustained pattern over time with respect to
pre-owned. It tends to be lumpy and we won't know until the quarter of execution whether in fact anticipated
pre-owned come into our market or they are sold before they get to Gulfstream.
So that makes pre-owned a little bit tougher to articulate. We had – the performance at Gulfstream this year was
extremely strong. And we had a favorable completion mix in the fourth quarter that we are reversing somewhat going
into next year. So we've talked multiple times about the fallacy of being able to predict with great specificity the
Gulfstream or Aerospace margins. And I will tell you Jet had a very strong year this year. And that contribution will be
less next year primarily driven by a mix shift as they move into some additional completion work and that comes down
their learning curve. So all of these factors play into Gulfstream and Aerospace margins.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Could you point to some unique things in the fourth quarter that caused such an
extraordinarily high conversion that won't repeat?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Well, I think again, gosh George I've tried. We've got less contribution from Jet. And we
had a favorable delivery mix on large cabin to mid cabin and that's a pretty – those are pretty big movers and less
pre-owned and that's a big one. Pre-owned tends to carry very little or no negative margins. So that's in my mind
explains it. That's the reality that we're facing. Okay, George.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Okay. Thanks very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel of Jefferies. Please proceed.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi, Howard.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Good morning, Phebe. Thank you. Rather than be too granular here, I wanted to take a step
back. As you look at your outlook and what you've asked your senior executives to do, where – as you look at the
various risks, might you see either challenges or opportunities? And I'll use two examples and then hopefully you can
add to that.
One is some of your operations have European or Canadian based costs, and you sell in dollars, so there may be some
upside there although I know you hedged some. And then also you're embarked on a very aggressive research and
development campaign at Gulfstream, and how have you assessed the risk, and where have you felt like you've made
progress?
So it's a bit of specifics and then wrapped in a little bit of the $8.05 per share to $8.10 per share is a nice start for the
year, but I'm sure we won't end there.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: So just to reiterate, we've given you guidance based on the same assumptions that we used
last year. And our ability to do better is simply going to be as a result of share repurchases and outperforming our plan.

If you look at our outlook, it's informed by the last two years where we focused on operations, reduced our costs and as
a result built our backlog. So we are poised for growth as a result of that backlog for several years to come. It's a very
nice position to be. We are going to see some good growth in 2016 and 2017 and the business is poised for that.
We've been focusing on operations and what we've basically called the back-to-basics, which is blocking and tackling.
That work is never done. So we're going to continue to attack our costs for a relentless focus on our cost performance
and re-engineering our business. That will make us more competitive, reduces our cost mix more competitive, and that
too will help growth. So we have positioned ourselves nicely and I think we'll continue to do so going forward.
Our opportunities are because of our improved competitiveness, increased growth, primarily both overseas and we've
talked about that before. We've got another opportunity as margin expansion going forward as we focus on our
continuous improvement. We've got – when I think about risks, you implicitly ask about the foreign currency risk. We
are less exposed to foreign currency variability than companies in other sectors for example. So 60% of our business is
with the U.S. government and Gulfstream's exposure is to the U.S. economy.
We have – there's some translation difficulty year-over-year with respect to currency fluctuations. We've embedded
those in our plans. We also have some nice natural hedges both in Europe and in Canada. So has the strong dollar
affected any of our demand? Not really. And we certainly haven't seen it in our backlog. We had a translation, we had
to adjust our Combat backlog as a result of a negative translation, but that's on work, that's many years out. But in terms
of sales, we're not just seeing any particular impact. Is it potential? Sure, but it's not affecting us.
So you asked about R&D as a risk. So the key when you introduce, I think, you invest in a business and a new product
development and you introduce new product is that you have managed that R&D and the engineering and development
and design effectively. And Gulfstream has a proven history of doing that, and we are continuing to see that same kind
of excellent execution in our design and engineering effort at Gulfstream.
So we don't see any risk that's outside of what we have always seen in the past with respect to R&D, but we manage
this. We manage R&D at Gulfstream and their design and engineering activities very, very closely. And we set the
expectations accordingly and we've got a great team there. It's all about the execution and so far so good. So I hope that
sort of [ph] answers (45:24) where you were headed.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: No, I'd actually meant the currency because of where you're building things is actually an
advantage either in Europe or in Canada. And that was...
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yeah, in some instances it is. But we haven't seen neither up nor down any particular
impact in the moment.

<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Which justifies the couple, I take it.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Well, one's more just as a clarification. On the Combat side, you're saying flat. You have
these big orders, obviously, in your backlog that were from international customers last year. Can you give us some
help with how much you expect international, if it's the case to be up and then U.S. down in 2015?

And then the second one is just more broadly speaking, looking at the whole company, can you speak a little bit
wherever you feel comfortable about the bookings that you're expecting across the company this year? Particularly
interested if there are any of these larger combat opportunities that are still out there that might hit kind of $1
billion-plus opportunities. And then also, particularly interested in the G500 and G600 and what the tempo you expect
on bookings there might be. Thanks.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Okay. Complex questions. But let me address them in the order in which you asked them.
We are seeing stabilization in our U.S. land forces exposure at Combat Systems, directly in line with our expectations.
And so, we don't really see any at least surprises that we can see in the near term.
International orders, our international sales this year comprised about, in excess of 55% of Combat sales. And will
increase to 60% over time, not at the expense of domestic activity, but just as a revenue expansion.
So we do – we still have a lot of, I'd say, a number of international orders in our pipeline that are of decent size, that it
is our expectation that given our competitiveness and our cost structure, we're going to be highly competitive in those
competitions. So we have additional upside in building our backlog at Combat. But I'm not prepared to give you any
specifics on whether that makes at a book-to-bill of one-to-one in any one given year. That will depend on a lot of
things on when these competitions are decided and – but we've got a lot of proposal activity out there.
And with respect to, I think, G500 and G600 tempo, both of those R&D programs are proceeding apace. No major
changes since the last time we talked to you about it. Our pipeline is very robust and I expect orders to increase as we
get closer and closer to the entry into services of G500 and then the G600. So there have been no stumbling blocks
heretofore and our profiles on R&D and production of the test airplanes remain right on plan. So we're very pleased
with that. And we're pleased with the interest that both of these models have generated.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky of Citi. Please proceed.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Thank you, and good morning, Phebe and Jason.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Similar to Joe, one clarification question and then one more in-depth one. On the growth for
Combat Systems out into 2016 and 2017, can you offer up a little bit of more insight on the type of growth that you
might be expecting there? And then if you wouldn't mind just driving down into IS&T, where are you seeing relative
areas of strength in 2015 and weakness in 2015? Just what's the mix doing there?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: So on our – I don't want to get into specifics about 2016 and 2017 other than we are – at
Combat, other than we have the backlog and are poised for reasonable growth, growth that we will manage according
to our terms and conditions of our contract and also our supply chain. So I would expect growth, but not of a
double-digit nature. So don't think about it that way. We're not going to burn off that backlog that quickly. It's not
efficient and it's not in accordance with the terms and conditions of our contract.
The second part of your question?
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: The mix at IS&T where are you seeing strength...?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Mix in IS&T. So we have, as you know, over the last few years, our IT services business
has composed a larger percentage of our revenues. That is somewhat changing as a percent of revenue. We, you may
know, combined two of our non-IT businesses and AIS and C4 Systems into Mission Systems. And over time, there it
is our anticipation that they will grow as a larger percentage of our IS&T sales than IT, but both of those businesses are
poised very, very well for, again, single-digit growth, but still growth.

And I would add that I'm very pleased with their margin performance. It's particularly interesting that the year that we
had some revenue decline, considerable revenue decline, we outperformed on margins and this year, we expect revenue
decline and again, higher margins and this time bring with it higher earnings than last year. So that's a pretty
wholesome story from my perspective.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Phebe, on that – just one point of clarification. Do you anticipate then at the end of 2015 to
be kind of in a flat revenue environment year-over-year or creeping into a positive territory on IS&T?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: We're projecting a positive territory. Positive growth.

Question comes from the line of Carter Copeland of Barclays. Please proceed.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Hey. Good morning, and good results.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Thanks, Carter. Hi.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Just – I will stick to one. And I want to switch gears and go back to the cash flow and capital
deployment discussion. And the question is, is there an upper bound to how much balance sheet you might use to
normalize your free cash flow deployment? Should we think of this as whatever the gap to 100% conversion is, is what
you'll use on the balance sheet? Or could it be more extensive than that?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Every year, we've provided the same kind of guidance with respect to capital deployment.
And that is that we, at least in the last two years and again this year, have anticipated deploying all of our free cash flow
in share repurchases and dividends and we anticipate doing that again this year.
But as with every other year, we give you the overall strategy and then the execution, the tactical execution comes
during the course of the year. So think about in general terms that we'll use our balance sheet to, as you quite I think
accurately put it, normalize our cash flow for share repurchases. But I see no fundamental reason or benefit from
tapping into our balance sheet beyond that for share repurchases.
Some of you had requested that we do some – not necessarily you all, but some out in the environment had requested
that we go into our balance sheet early on and buy significant numbers of shares, and I argued then, and I'll continue to
argue now, I don't think that's judicious nor prudent. And I think that this year is a perfect example of why you don't
want to have extended all your bullets in prior years.
Think about us as telling you what we're going to do at the beginning of the year, and doing it and having very, very
reliable results and execution of our capital deployment in the year. So this year ought to look very similar with respect
to what our capital deployment intent is. Free cash flow and a little bit – and some off the balance sheet depending
again on where we are in free cash flow.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Great. Thank you, Phebe.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: And Shantalay, I think we have time for one more question.

<Q - Joe W. DeNardi>: Thanks. Good morning. Phebe, maybe another one on the balance sheet I appreciate your
comments about not wanting to extend all of your bullets, but maybe longer term, once the defense budget environment
were to improve, would that change the way that you thought about using your balance sheet relative to some of your
peers?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hey, now, the way I think about the balance sheet is we have a strong balance sheet that
gives us flexibility and agility and opportunity, both in the year of execution and going forward. And I intend to
preserve that flexibility. I intend to preserve the strength of that balance sheet with some variability in any given year,
but not take enough cash off that balance sheet to change our overall fire power. So as I sit here today, that is our
strategy and we will adapt accordingly in the future as circumstances may change.
<Q - Joe W. DeNardi>: Okay. And then in terms of the fourth quarter guidance, the big fourth quarter, is there any
particular segment that's especially lumpy or are you waiting for any big awards to come in later in the year to hit that
guidance?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: No. The quarterly distribution of EPS that I gave you in my remarks was very typical of
our performance that we tend to start out like, build throughout the year, and have a strong fourth quarter. So that's very
consistent with the ebb and flow of our business. All right?
