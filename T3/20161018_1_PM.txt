MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, and welcome to the Philip Morris International Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call
is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the
question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Media representatives on the call will also be invited to ask
questions at the conclusion of questions from the investment community.
I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications.
Please go ahead, sir.
Nicholas M. Rolli
Welcome, and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our
2016 third quarter results. You may access the release on our website at www.pmi.com or the PMI Investor Relations
app.
During our call today, we will be talking about results for the third quarter of 2016 and comparing them to the same
period in 2015, unless otherwise stated.
A glossary of terms, adjustments and other calculations, as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S.
GAAP measures are at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted on our website. Reduced-Risk Products, or
RRPs, is the term we use to refer to products with the potential to reduce individual risk and population harm in
comparison to smoking cigarettes.
Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results, and I direct your attention to the
forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the
various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements.
Now, my pleasure to introduce Jacek Olczak, our Chief Financial Officer. Jacek?

Jacek Olczak
Thank you, Nick, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. Following the comprehensive business review that we provided
during our recent Investor Day event, I will focus today on a brief summary of our 2016 full-year outlook and third
quarter results and highlight some important developments in select geographies. A detailed discussion of our third
quarter and year-to-date September results can be found in our earnings release.
Let me begin with our full-year outlook. As announced this morning, we are reaffirming our 2016 reported diluted EPS
guidance at prevailing exchange rates to be in a range of $4.53 to $4.58. Our guidance includes $0.35 of unfavorable
currency and continues to represent a growth rate, excluding currency, of approximately 10.5% to 11.5% compared to
our adjusted diluted EPS of $4.42 in 2015.
As a reminder, in the fourth quarter, we anticipate strong currency-neutral net revenue growth, driven primarily by the
annualization of price increases and the growth of RRPs. We also anticipate the favorable cost comparison, driven by
the significant investments that we made in the fourth quarter of 2015 behind iQOS and our cigarette brand portfolio,
including those related to the implementation of the EU Tobacco Products Directive.
Moving to our third quarter results, net revenues and adjusted OCI increased by 3.6% and 4.3%, respectively,
excluding currency, reflecting favorable pricing, partly offset by negative volume mix, particularly in the EEMA
region. Adjusted diluted EPS increased by 4%, excluding currency.
Our favorable pricing variance of $440 million in the third quarter was driven by positive contributions from all
regions, notably EEMA. During the quarter, we announced or implemented price increases in a number of markets,
including those shown on the slide, which should further support favorable pricing in the fourth quarter.
We recorded currency-neutral financial growth in the third quarter despite an organic cigarette shipment volume
decline of 5.4%. The decrease was due mainly to lower cigarette industry volume in Argentina, Indonesia, the
Philippines and Russia, as well as lower cigarette market share, notably in North Africa, the Philippines and Russia,
partly offset by market share growth in the EU region.
Year-to-date September, our cigarette shipment volume declined by 3.9%, consistent with the year-to-date August
decrease that I referenced at Investor Day. We continue to anticipate a similar decline for the full-year 2016.
Our shipment volume for heated tobacco sticks reached 2.1 billion units in the third quarter, an increase of
approximately 900 million units compared to the second quarter of this year. While principally driven by Japan, all
iQOS launch markets contributed to this growth.
While our cigarette market share, excluding China and the U.S., declined by 0.6 points in the third quarter, due notably
to North Africa, the Philippines and Russia, Marlboro cigarettes share increased by 0.3 points, driven by the EU and
Asia region.
Let me now move to select geographies, beginning with the EU region. Regional cigarette industry volume declined by
1.4% in the third quarter, contributing to a year-to-date September decrease of 0.2%. For the full year, we continue to
expect a decline of around 1%.
Our regional cigarette share in the quarter increased by 0.4 points, driven by the continued strong performance of
Marlboro, which grew share in four of the region's top six markets by cigarette industry volume, notably Germany and
Spain.
In Indonesia, we recorded sequential market share growth in the third quarter, driven by our strong performance in the
full-flavor machine-made kretek segment, notably following the geographical expansion of U Bold in June.
To further enhance our position in September, we launched Marlboro Filter Black kretek in 25 cities. Although it is
early, we strongly believe that this offer will set the standard for the full-flavor machine-made kretek segment.

In addition, this month, the Indonesian Ministry of Finance issued its 2017 excise tax regulation, which will result in a
weighted average excise tax increase of approximately 10% industry-wide. As you may recall, the weighted average
increase in 2016 was approximately 15%.
In Japan, our cigarette market share continued to stabilize and was essentially flat compared to the third quarter of last
year. This performance is notable given the impact of HeatSticks cannibalization on our cigarette share and was
supported by recent Lark and Marlboro launches.
iQOS continues to perform exceptionally well with HeatSticks market share reaching 4.3% in the last week of
September. In the third quarter, HeatSticks market share was 3.5%, an increase of 1.3 points compared to the second
quarter of 2016. Importantly, these share gains have been achieved despite the limits we have placed on iQOS device
sales since June.
PMI's total combined market share, including cigarettes and HeatSticks, was 27.9% in the third quarter, reflecting an
increase of 2.5 points compared to the same period in 2015.
In North Africa, our third quarter market share was 24.6%, representing a sequential increase versus the second quarter.
This growth was driven by the improving performance of Marlboro in Algeria, highlighting the early success of the
initiatives that we shared during the Investor Day.
In Russia, the Ministry of Finance submitted a proposal earlier this month to rise the specific and minimum excise tax
levels for 2017 by approximately 10% above what is currently in the tax code. If the proposal is approved by the Duma
and signed into law by the President, it will result – assuming full pass-on – in a total tax pass-on of approximately
RUB 11 per pack in 2017. The ad valorem rate of 13% remains unchanged in the proposal.
I will finish my discussion of important developments with an update on the cigarette market in Argentina. While
cigarette industry volume continues to be impacted by the significant excise tax-driven price increases in May,
declining 14.1% in the third quarter, adult smokers appear to be adjusting relatively quickly to the higher retail prices
given the broader inflationary environment. The average monthly decline in August and September was 8%.
We continue to expect a full-year cigarette industry volume decline of around 12% in 2016 and a return to its
low-single-digit historical decline rate during 2017 once the May 2016 tax increase has been lapped.
In conclusion, our third quarter results were in line with our expectations, and our full year outlook remains strong.
Thank you and I will be happy now to answer your questions.

Thank you. We will now conduct the question-and-answer portion of the conference. [Operator Instructions] Our first
question is from the line of Michael Lavery with CLSA.
<Q - Michael Lavery>: Morning.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Hi, Michael.
<Q - Michael Lavery>: Could you just talk about Russia for a minute? We've seen the consumer there be pretty
resilient in the past. You're now calling out some share pressure from pricing ahead of competitors. Are you seeing a
change in the consumer approach and is there any change in their willingness to spend? And especially if so, could you
give any sort of estimate of what you think the impact of the proposed tax increase might be as well?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: I'll start with the last part. I mean, the impact, as I said, is about RUB 11 that's pass-on, so it's
around the same level as we had last year. Despite...

<Q - Michael Lavery>: I'm sorry. Could I clarify? I guess I meant with that increase, do you expect any different
category impact next year versus this year?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: No, not really. Again, this is sort of the same increases we had last year and there was this 1
percentage point change in ad valorem, but I don't think it's going to change the dynamics between the segments.
What you see in Russia on the consumer level is, yes, I mean, the consumer is looking for a value. No question about it.
I mean, at the premium segment, if at least judged by the share of Marlboro and especially Parliament, I mean it will
hold pretty strong, pretty well. There is down-trading with several down-trading in the market, but more between the
mid and the value segments. So this is where the extra price promotions or delays in the price implementations are most
frequent.
We're also launching our own initiatives in this segment. So, I guess, also the share pressure, which we'll have in
Russia this year, I think we should start being on a positive share territory in 2017.
<Q - Michael Lavery>: Okay. That's helpful. And then with respect to Japan, I know it's maybe too early for you even
to know, but do you have a sense with the proposed indoor smoking ban if that might apply to iQOS as well?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Not at this level of detail. I won't go into these discussions. What I can say that we have a
number of places in Japan where the existing smoking bans have been lifted due to the fact that iQOS is not a
combustible product; therefore, there is no burning. There is no smoke.
So, we'll have to see how this is going to evolve. But in a current environment with the restrictions for smoking, et
cetera, as you noticed, I mean iQOS continues to gain the penetrations and the market share so I don't think it's going to
stall the growth prospects of iQOS in Japan.
<Q - Michael Lavery>: Thank you very much
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Good morning.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Good morning, Bonnie.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: My first question has to do with your volume, and I guess I was hoping you could drill down
a little further on the declines in the quarter and then what gives you the confidence that you're going to still be able to
hit the down around 3.9% for the full year. And then curious to hear how that compares with your expectations for the
industry volume for the full year.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: We wouldn't change the expectations for the industry volumes, which we have shared during the
Investors Day. I think the trends are pretty much know at this stage. I think there are some improvements we'll continue
into 2017.
Specifically to us, I think – I don't know, I start maybe with Latin America and Argentina. I think the consumer is
adjusting to the prices pretty fast relative obviously to the price increase. I think this high inflation in environment
somehow helps. So I think sequentially, we should see some less of the pressure from the volumes coming from – or
declines coming from Argentina.
Algeria, which created quite pressure on our volumes and Marlboro – including Marlboro this year, I mean we start
seeing the first signs of the recovery. It's going to take a while, but at least on the trend line, we crossed the lowest
point. So I think already in Q4 and going into 2017, I think the pressure from Algeria, North Africa should ease.

Indonesia, I think the tax proposal, which came from the Ministry of Finance, is manageable. I mean, you're looking for
adjust tax pass-on of about, say, 10% versus the 15% increase, which took place this year. So I think this should be
helpful. In addition to the fact that I think at least judging for the last few quarters' performance of our share there, I
think we should have a less, if at all, a share losses in 2017 than this year and hopefully that beat a stronger market than
we have had in Indonesia this year.
Philippines is a completely different story because it all questions how much we manage our mix to the positive
territory. So far, we are very successful with up-trading the markets to Marlboro, which continues to grow and it's a
very strong growth. And actually, we would likely to enjoy this momentum for a longer while, even if there are some
pressures on the total industry volumes coming from the lower parts of the market. I think we would be fine with this.
Pakistan, which also put a quite a dent on our volume this year, that's presumably the most difficult to predict sort of
the market because the other forces which obviously play a role there. I mean, the contraband I think recently had
reached about a third of the market. So the question is, where is the level of saturation? And I said, so we can expect
worse than this. But again, from a financial perspective, it doesn't have that much of a financial impact.
And Russia, the tax increase is also pretty manageable on the high side but comparable like we had at this year. And as
I said earlier, I think Russia should also turn the corner when it comes to share declines. So, next year, I guess on a
similar sort of the market dynamics, we should have less of a volume leakage due to the negative share performance.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Okay. That was really helpful. I appreciate that. And then, I do have another question, I
guess, on your other brand volume, which was down considerably in the quarter. So, I was hoping you could talk a
little bit about your strategy with some of these brands. You touched on having a greater...
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Yeah.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Remember at the Investor Day, you touched on having a greater focus on a fewer number of
brands going forward. So, I guess I'm assuming that this is consistent with the sharper declines we've been seeing for
some of the smaller brands. And I guess I was also hoping you could confirm that although these brands are declining
rapidly, they're contributing nicely to margins as they're likely promoted less.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Yes. These brands will, in most cases, actually have pretty low margins. I mean, the two big
brands which in other categories is – will be Fortune and very much Jackpot in Philippines. So these are the brands
which have a near zero sort of the margin territory and a lot of consumers are going from these brands to Marlboro. So
we actually, for the positive mix, are improving pretty fast our financial situation there – our financial results there.
You will have also brands in Indonesia in this other category, which not necessary on the higher end of the margin
spectrum.
So I would rather say brand like Jackpot in the Philippines, we would presumably treat or we are actually treating this
more tactically. Fortune is a little bit different. It's a brand, which we do manage and we stay focused. But we do also
recognize that at least at this stage, Marlboro, due to the closure of the price gap, is a more attractive proposition for the
consumer and we're absolutely fine with that.
And in Indonesia, I mean, many of these local brands are the brands which we do support, but we also try to focus on
what is less dilutive to other margins.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Okay. And then maybe my final question, Jacek, you guys definitely walked through iQOS a
lot at your Investor Day, but could you possibly highlight a few possible updates in the last few months on the
improvements you've seen with conversion and maybe cannibalization rates?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Conversion, I don't think I have a fresher number than what we have shared at the Investor Day. I
mean, there may be a few numbers which I still remember because some of these KPIs we're tracking weekly or even
more frequently.

I think that Tokyo, if you might remember, the Tokyo market share, offtake share at the Investor Day which we shared
was 7%. We now stand at 7.3%. So we continued the growth. And the same is for the Japan. I think the national offtake
share the last week of – or third week of September, which we have shared in our Investors Day, 5.2%; now turns to be
5.5%. You could see the pretty rapid share advancement. You're talking 20 basis points, 30 basis points in a span of a
couple – few weeks.
I have the same in Italy, when I think the share in Italy, the [indiscernible] (21:20) was 60 basis points, 0.6%. And now,
I think we lifted this last three of – sorry, first week of October, I think the reading would be 0.8%.
Switzerland, we lifted from 0.4% to 0.5%. The penetration rates, i.e., the number of devices sold continues to grow. So
I think in all geographies, from the top of my head, I mean that there is a continuous growth momentum very much in
line of what we have shared with the investors at the Investor Day.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: All right. Thank you very much.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of James Bushnell with Exane.
<Q - James Bushnell>: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Good morning.
<Q - James Bushnell>: I have two questions, please. The first one's on iQOS in Japan. Clearly, you've limited the
expansion because of the supply constraints you have. I just wondered if you could give us an estimate of what
proportion of consumers don't have access to the product right now and whether the existing users over-index to
smokers of a particular strength or taste of cigarettes. That's my first question.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: We see the less and less of this over-proportional representation of former Marlboro smokers
compared to the underlying share of Marlboro. So, clearly, the iQOS is taking more significant inroads into the
competitive combustible portfolio.
Now, how much really? We have less unhappy consumers in Japan at this stage. I know that they are waiting list. I
know that the consumers have to enroll by name on this list, but to be frank, I don't have a number at this stage. A
number exists somewhere. But we clearly will see how much of that backlog, if you like, of [ph] answered (23:20)
consumers we'll have the moment when we lift the cap, which we estimate to happen somewhere in the end of the Q1
next year when we'll be very comfortable with the HeatSticks supplies. But my gut feeling is we're not talking about a
5% or 10% sort of unsatisfied demand. I think the number is much higher than that.
<Q - James Bushnell>: Okay. Great. Thank you. And then my second question more of a modeling one which is that
your associate and minority lines look to have moved quite a bit since Q2. I just wondered if the numbers we're looking
at at Q3 we could consider as more normalized [ph] as opposed (23:59) to some of the changes you've had in those
areas.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: I think so. I mean, there might be some movement. I think Russia should be, the [indiscernible]
(24:13) should be okay. I think maybe there are some movements in North Africa around some of the structures which
we have in Egypt. But I think we should be pretty much in line of what we could expect there.
There are some currency – the currency movements might have an impact on this line. And as you know, we had some
exposure in Egypt on the – we had to take a dollar exposure on Egypt and there are some limitations in availability on
the dollars in the country, so we might have some distortions of these lines coming from North Africa, Egypt as I
mentioned.
<Q - James Bushnell>: Okay. Great. Understood. Thank you very much.

Our next question is from the line of Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Pamela F. Kaufman>: Hi. This is actually Pam Kaufman on for Matt. I just wanted to ask on pricing, it
improved sequentially to about 6.5%, but needs to accelerate further to reach your benchmark of 6% for the full year
and presumably which helped bridge the gap to strong fourth quarter earnings growth. Can you review where you've
seen incremental pricing recently that would allow you to deliver on this target for the full year?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: We should have in Q4 of this year the strongest pricing variance compared to all the quarters. I
mean we're looking well in the north of a $500 million pricing variance in the quarter. I mean, actually, maybe even
closer to $600 million. We should have – all-in-all in the fourth quarter, we should expect above the 10% uplift on the
revenue quarter-on-quarter, okay, on an ex-currency basis.
So, as I said, the growth in the fourth quarter on the one hand will be coming from the favorable comps, which we have
on the cost, while we still continue spending obviously more behind than iQOS, but this is more on the combustible
part of the spending compared to the Q4 last year. But we also are looking into – we expect to have quite a significant
uplift in the net revenue and corresponding contributions to the bottom line.
<Q - Pamela F. Kaufman>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Thank you. Hi, Jacek.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Hi, Julie.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: So my question is on actually the mix impact. Because in addition to pretty healthy pricing, it
sounds like the third quarter also benefited from strong mix. So how much is this geographic mix impact? And then,
when you think about the impact on iQOS either on price mix, is there a way to kind of quantify how that would have
impacted either the price or mix in the quarter?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: I mean, the raise – I mean EU is doing well. So obviously, due to the margin, geographical
margin split – I mean on a geographical basis, the mix is working in our favor. If you go with the individual countries,
the countries with the worst mix in the quarter were actually Indonesia and if I recall well actually was UK. But overall
– but that's it essentially.
When it comes to iQOS, yes. Obviously, it already starts adding the revenue growth and it's going to be even stronger
in Q4 of this year already.
I guess when we close the year, where we will start talking more about the financial impacts of iQOS at least at the
revenue level, but there is already some volume impact. You know that we have a capacity of about 7 billion available
this year. We sold a bit less than 4 billion, so I think we've been very transparent with what one can expect from the
volumes of iQOS in the fourth quarter and that's going to help lifting the revenue growth quite a bit.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay. So if we think about it, I think iQOS added about 1% to your total volume. So the revenue
impact would have been higher in the second quarter.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: There's the margin...

<Q - Judy E. Hong>: I'm sorry, in the third quarter.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, the pricing is at the Marlboro level as you remember. Plus, remember in the revenue line,
we also have devices, right? Because we're selling the devices as well. So you have an uplift from the volume at the
Marlboro price in a given geography, there's obviously the taxes, and also the price at which we have the volume at
which we're selling the devices to consumers. So they both contribute to the revenue.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay. And then just in Japan, I mean it seems like your obviously contribution from iQOS is
still very strong, but your combustible share has also gotten better. So can you just walk through how sustainable that
sort of area of actually seeing combustible improvement plus the iQOS contribution? Because it sounds like maybe
Japan, your volume would have been up high-single-digit ex inventory if you add the iQOS volume.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Yes. I think if you will take the full-year impact, I mean iQOS clearly is already a significant
contributor to our business there.
Look, I have to actually thank you for raising these questions because I should say how proud we are that one year, we
managed to sort out the share pressure on the conventional business in Japan despite the fact that part of that share we
have today for the cannibalization to iQOS, and in addition, we're so successful with iQOS.
I think the market share – the biggest dynamics now, which you will have in a market, I guess, is the cannibalizations
and the movements between the combustible category including our own portfolio and iQOS. But the share leakage,
which we had, other taste segments and the new taste segments, I mean it seems at this stage that we have very
successfully addressed. So it's pretty remarkable results actually for our Japanese organization.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay. And then just finally on currency, I know at the Investor Day, you talked about currency
in 2017 being less of a headwind versus 2016. But just if we kind of hold spot rates at these levels, is there any kind of
guidance you can give, a little bit more specific guidance on 2017, particularly around the yen just given your hedged
strategy?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Yeah, I guess two questions actually – sorry, two facts which would help maybe better predict
the currency on the other side of the ocean on [indiscernible] (31:21) of elections and Fed decision about the interest
rates. So I am a little bit more remote from this one.
I guess the number of currencies, if I looked at how currencies were playing against us this year, and remember, we
started the Q1 I guess we had like a $0.19; Q2, we were $0.08 on EPS; Q3, we are $0.04. So, clearly, we could see that
the number of currency has started put a less pressure on us.
Our currency, which I singled out during the Investor Day, which many of us sometimes tend to forget, I mean, we
have some exposures in North Africa in particular in Egypt. So Egyptian pound is a little bit of the worry. And I don't
know how they're going to relax the currency rules and how much it's going to translate into the devaluation.
Other than that, ruble is pretty okay. Euro, Japanese yen, some of you know that we hedge – we already hedged some
positions in the 2017. But the yen already started to contribute positively in the last few months, in the last quarter
definitely. So we'll have to wait until February when – post the elections, post the Fed decision and definitely, this topic
of unknown will be removed. We will see how the market price the currencies at that time.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Got it. Okay. Thank you.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Thank you.

<A - Jacek Olczak>: Good morning, Chris.
<Q - Christopher Growe>: Good morning. I had just two questions, if I could. I wanted to ask, first of all, as we think
about iQOS in Japan in particular and just given the constraints you have to your capacity right now, should we foresee
further market share expansion in that market or you're kind of at a limit right now how much you can sell in that
market incrementally?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, we're still selling devices, not to the level where there is a demand for the devices. As you
know, without the device, you cannot trigger the consumption of HeatSticks, but we somehow manage the growth or
limiting the growth to the corresponding growth in the available production volume which we have, right? The
capacity, which we have 7 billion this year, is not the 7 billion divided by 12 in equal [ph] installment (33:47) per
month, right? It's very much adding back. So the peak of this annualized capacity is going to be in December this year.
So, yes, we can add some devices, but we're not satisfying the old demand for the devices from the consumers. And this
demand [ph] is at the fold (34:06) is the newcomers, I mean people who want to leave the combustible category, quit
smoking, and then move to iQOS to heat not burn. But also existing consumers who want now a second device, et
cetera, because they – for the convenience, whatever other purpose is, they want to have more devices. But we're
selling more devices week-after-week, quarter-after-quarter, but not to the extent what the demand is for these devices
in a market.
<Q - Christopher Growe>: Okay. And then my second question was just in relation to volumes overall. There was a
lot of timing differentials in certain markets this year. Did overall sort of timing differential lead to a plus or a minus
for volume this quarter? Do you have a good sense of what volume would have been?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: I don't think a quarter is actually a good way of looking at things. There's always distortions. If I
take nine months this year, year-to-date, I think the total distortions, if I remember, were in the tune of 200 million
units by total volume. So it's a lot of things which will net of over the period of time: the timings of shipments, the
inventories, et cetera.
If I take Q3 on the year-to-date basis versus Q3 year-to-date basis last year, I think that the total due to the shipment,
timing of shipments, inventories would be about 200 million units.
<Q - Christopher Growe>: Units, okay, yeah. Okay. If I could add just one quick one, in terms of like the next 9 or 10
markets you have to announce for the launch of iQOS, should we expect it to come soon or will that be a separate
announcement? But certainly, by the end of the year, you indicated you want to be in 20 markets, correct?
<A - Nicholas M. Rolli>: Yes.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Yes.
<Q - Christopher Growe>: Okay.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: But we've added recently Denmark, right? I mean, I think we added – or about adding Holland,
Canada. I think we talked about this during Investors Day. It's pretty getting dynamic to the point that I think we will be
more giving then updates on a quarterly basis what we have done in a quarter than proactively start talking where we
go because it's becoming a little bit like a map of United Nations, right? I mean...
<Q - Christopher Growe>: Okay. Right. Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Thank you.

<A - Jacek Olczak>: Hi, Adam.
<Q - Adam J. Spielman>: I just wanted to be a little – make sure that I've understood what's happening in the fourth
quarter correctly. If I've understood it correctly, you said first of all there will be pricing variance of close to $600
million. And then, on top of that, there will be benefit to – from reduced costs firstly relating to the European Tobacco
Products Directive and secondly, less spending on Reduced-Risk Products. And then finally, and I'm just checking that
I heard you correctly, your spending on conventional products will not change? Is that correct in the fourth quarter
versus last year's fourth quarter?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: You're almost correct, but not fully correct. So the pricing variance will be up to the $600 million
– $500 million-plus up to $600 million. You'll have about $500 million or so in the comps. Not necessarily it means
that the cost will get down, but in the comps, Q4-on-Q4, you will have in debt $500 million higher spending on iQOS
or RRPs, but less spending in the quarter – in that quarter on our combustibles. But I think for modeling purposes, I
would just think you'll have uplift in the revenue for the price and support of the volume coming from either some
improved trends but very much for the iQOS and a better comps on the cost Q4-on-Q4.
<Q - Adam J. Spielman>: And can you just – I mean, less spent on combustibles. Is there any way of quantifying that,
a sort of percentage change?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: No. But, look, we have taken some costs in – ahead of the Tobacco Product Directive
implementation. There were some related costs in a number of markets in the EU. We accelerated that spending in Q4
2015, and most of this initiatives have already taken place. And in many countries, the Tobacco Product Directive now
is in the physical product implementations in [indiscernible] (38:41) of all infrastructure, retooling of machines and all
the other associated costs have already been incurred. Therefore, optically, it looks like we have a less spending on
combustibles in Q4. But this is in comparisons to Q4 last year.
<Q - Adam J. Spielman>: Okay. Thank you very much
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Thank you.

And our final question comes from the line of Thomas Russo with Gardner Russo & Gardner.
<Q - Thomas Adrian Russo>: Hi, Jacek.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Hi, Tom.
<Q - Thomas Adrian Russo>: Hi. Can you just remind us what the year-end likely capacity will be for iQOS stick
productions end of 2016, end of 2017 and end of 2018, if you can give some measure of those? And did you say that
the production lift that we're looking at, at present, will kick in by the end of January of next year? And if so, when do
you think you release the restrictions on device sales in Japan and other markets if we're up and running by the end of
January?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Okay. I think the release on the cap of devices will happen towards the end of the Q1 next year...
<Q - Thomas Adrian Russo>: Okay.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: ...[ph] going into (39:50) 2017. Capacity, there are always two numbers. To look at the pretty
dynamic situation, there are two numbers to remember. You have available initial capacity this year of 7 billion, but in
December annualized or capacity times 12 is 15 billion, all right?
<Q - Thomas Adrian Russo>: Okay.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: On December, they want to figure it out what is my underlying capacity for the month of
January, for example, the first month after December, it's 15 billion divided by 12.

And then we're adding capacity in January, February and every month after that, so we'll have a commercial capacity
for the full year of 2017 of 32 billion. Hopefully, a bit more than 32 billion. And we will close 2017, i.e., December
with 50 billion capacity. So if you take January 2018, my monthly capacity is 50 billion divided by 12.
<Q - Thomas Adrian Russo>: Perfect.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: But if you remember, we then will be in the mood that we can add 4 billion capacity per month,
if needed, if we start committing that capacity in the early part of 2017.
<Q - Thomas Adrian Russo>: Yeah. Thank you.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Thank you.
<Q - Thomas Adrian Russo>: Perfect.
