We have posted charts on our website today that we plan to address during the call to supplement our comments. Please
access our website at www.lockheedmartin.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts. I
would also note that we're extending the call duration until 12:30 today to enable adequate time for your questions on
our financial results and strategic actions.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Marillyn.
Marillyn A. Hewson
Thanks, Jerry. Good morning, everyone; and thank you, all, for adjusting your calendars and joining us on the call
today. It's a day earlier than planned. So especially given the short notice, we appreciate you joining us.
With today's press release outlining two strategic actions we are implementing to strengthen our competitive posture
and position the corporation for profitable long-term growth, we accelerated the call to enable timely discussion of our
second quarter financial results and the portfolio-shaping items.
Starting with our financial performance. We had a strong quarter, operationally and financially, with all reported results
exceeding our expectations, and we are progressing on achievement of full-year financial objectives. These results
reflect the execution being achieved across the businesses as a corporation operated at a very strong level in providing
critical solutions to customers while returning value to stockholders.
The year-to-date financial performance also enabled us to again increase full-year 2015 guidance for segment and
consolidated operating profit and earnings per share. In addition to these increases to guidance, we reaffirmed our
earlier outlook for full-year orders, sales, and cash from operations. With these strong financial results, we continue to
return value to stockholders in the areas of share repurchases and dividend payments for cash deployment initiatives.
I would now like to discuss the two strategic actions we announced today, and then I'll ask Bruce to cover in more
detail our second quarter financial results and increased 2015 guidance. To assist our discussion, I would ask you to
turn your attention to the charts we provided on our website, starting on chart four: reshaping our portfolio.
The first strategic action we announced is our signing of a definitive agreement to purchase Sikorsky Aircraft. Sikorsky
is a natural fit for Lockheed Martin, and it complements our broad portfolio of world-class aerospace and defense
products and technologies. This action will enable us to extend our core business into the $30 billion annual military
and commercial rotary-wing segments.
The second major action is the commencement of a strategic review of a government IT infrastructure services work at
Information Systems & Global Solutions and of our technical services work at Missiles and Fire Control. The strategic
review will address the changing market dynamics affecting these businesses and will help us determine how to best
position them for future growth and is expected to result in a spin-off or sale of the businesses. These actions continue
our practice of continuously shaping the portfolio to secure the highest value creation for customers and stockholders.
Turning to an overview of Sikorsky on chart five. Sikorsky is well-known as a world leader in the design, manufacture,
and support of military and commercial helicopters. Their international presence is wide-ranging, with operations in 20
countries; and their products are used in over 40 countries. Sikorsky's revenue composition is shown on the pie chart,
with approximately 75% of their work for military customers, and the remaining 25% to commercial users. With
approximately 50% of their annual revenue derived from international customers, they will aid us in moving forward
on our goal to expand international revenues.
The acquisition rationale is outlined on chart six. Some of the important, strategic benefits of this acquisition are that
Sikorsky has familiar customers. This familiarity will assist the integration process through utilization of similar
knowledge and interaction with common customers. They are also extraordinarily well-positioned with an established
brand and a robust backlog of future work.
They also have a 40-year history as a frequent teammate our Mission Systems and Training business area. And today,
we collaborate on the VH-92 Presidential helicopter, Combat Rescue Helicopter, and the naval MH-60 Romeo

helicopter. Their strong aftermarket business is also expected to provide a long-term source of earnings to the
corporation and another lever of value creation.
The opportunity to access capital in today's historically low interest rate environment is another significant contributor
to the rationale and value creation of the acquisition. Beyond the strategic benefits I outlined, another key element of
the acquisition rationale is the Section 338(h)(10) tax election for the transaction, which is expected to provide
approximately $2 billion in net present value for our corporation and stockholders.
Future growth prospects of the acquisition are outlined on chart seven. One of the key elements of our strategic
planning is to secure and extend our core defense business, and we feel confident that the addition of Sikorsky will
contribute significantly to the growth objectives.
As the prime contractor for multiple current development helicopter programs such as the CH-53K, Presidential, and
Combat Rescue, Sikorsky is well-positioned to grow as these programs transition into production scheduled in 2018.
With their extensive presence around the world in over 40 countries, we see further expansion of our international
operations as we will benefit from their international footprint and customer relationships.
Sikorsky's footprint in the commercial aviation segment is well-established, with extensive activities supporting the oil
and gas industry. While this segment has been under recent pressure due to low oil prices, this is expected to recover in
the future and add value to the corporation. We believe these current pressures enables us to make this acquisition at a
low point in the economic cycle.
All of these elements indicate significant opportunities for growth in the future and value creation potential
I'd now like to outline the transaction valuation on chart eight. The agreement announced today outlined a purchase
price of $9 billion and will be funded with a combination of new debt and available cash. It is important to note that our
joint election of a 338(h)(10) tax benefit effectively brings the adjusted price of the transaction to slightly over $7
billion, with an adjusted multiple of 10.3 times EBITDA. These metrics demonstrate that we are purchasing an active
participant in one of the largest areas of DoD expenditures at an attractive price.
I also want to reiterate that this transaction will not change our previously outlined plan to return cash to shareholders
through dividends and stock repurchases between 2015 and 2017, and reducing our outstanding share count to below
300 million shares by the end of 2017.
An overview of synergy is shown on chart nine. While there are multiple elements of synergy that we have identified
from this transaction, the largest contribution will be from the approximately $2 billion that we will recognize through
the election of the Section 338(h)(10) tax treatment. In the area of cost synergies, we expect to achieve a steady-state
level of around $150 million annually after integration actions are completed.
In the area of revenue synergy, we see multiple opportunities by leveraging our relationships with international
governments and our ability to match their security needs with a full spectrum of our security offerings. Sikorsky's
products and capabilities will add to our existing portfolio and enable us to offer an even broader range of solutions to
international customers.
Before leaving Sikorsky, I also want to offer some additional perspective on our new team members. We have similar
cultures. We have a shared passion for innovation, and a commitment to supporting the men and women who defend
our freedom. Together, we will offer stronger portfolio of helicopter and systems engineering solutions to our global
customers as we accelerate the pace of new technology.
At the same time, our commitment to bringing the best we have to offer to our work with our helicopter manufacturers
is absolutely – with other helicopter manufacturers is absolutely undiminished. I'm confident that Sikorsky will be an
excellent fit within our Mission Systems and Training business area, and a strong contributor to the corporation as we
move forward together.
I'll now turn to chart 10 and speak to the second portfolio action we outlined today. The strategic review of IT and
services work in our IS&GS and MFC business areas. Let me start by saying that we have a proud legacy as a

world-leading government IT services and technical services provider. However, market dynamics and trends led us to
believe that these businesses may potentially achieve greater growth, which is good for our employees and create more
value for our customers and stockholders, by operating outside of Lockheed Martin.
The matrix shown outlines the businesses within IS&GS and MFC that comprise the strategic review, as well as those
that will be realigned under other existing business areas. For your reference, the businesses under strategic review are
expected to generate approximately $6 billion in annual revenue this year with mid-7% margin. With the series of
recent wins, the businesses under strategic review are well-positioned to generate value under an expected spin-off or
sale.
As I summarize today's announcements on chart 11, I'd like to conclude by reiterating that the two strategic actions we
announced today represent powerful portfolio reshaping activities and provide strong opportunities for creating
long-term value to shareholders. We believe there are opportunities for significant synergies and are confident that the
risk of execution is low. Both of today's actions will further position the corporation for growth and value creation for
investors and customers.
I'll now ask Bruce to go through our second quarter financial performance and our increased 2015 guidance, and then
we'll open up the line for questions.
Bruce L. Tanner
Thanks, Marillyn. Good morning, everyone. I'll try to keep my remarks brief this morning so as to allow more time for
questions during our session, and my remarks relate to the Web chart addressing just the financial results for the
quarter.
Beginning with chart 14, we have an overview of our second quarter results. Sales for the quarter were $11.6 billion
and were ahead of our expectations. We'll provide more color on our sales results on the next chart. Our segment
operating margin was also better than expected in the quarter at 12% and enabled us to achieve earnings per share of
$2.94.
We generated $1.3 billion in cash from operations, again, a little better than expected; and we'll also discuss this further
in a few charts. Our cash deployment actions increased over the first quarter, with $1.4 billion of cash returned to
shareholders, including nearly 5 million shares repurchased for more than $900 million. And with our strong
operational performance, we are increasing our full-year outlook for both operating profit and earnings per share. So,
we feel good about how we ended the first half of the year, and that positions us well for the remainder of the year.
On chart 15, we compare our second quarter sales results for 2015 with our results in 2014. Sales are higher by about
3% compared with the second quarter of last year. And while most of the higher volume in the quarter was due to
earlier than planned deliveries, we'll be watching this closely over the next few months to see if the higher trend
continues.
Chart 16 compares our segment operating margin this quarter with the second quarter of 2014. Segment operating
margin was 40 basis points lower this quarter compared with the same period last year. But as I said earlier, this was
higher than we had planned for the quarter and enabled us to increase our margin outlook for the year. Mission Systems
and Training drove the higher-than-expected results with margin improving 250 basis points over the second quarter of
last year. Better performance this year, combined with the absence of performance issues last year, led to this
improvement.
Turning to chart 17, we'll compare our earnings per share results this quarter with our results from a year ago. Our EPS
of $2.94 was 7% higher than the results from last year and enabled us to increase our EPS for the year.
Chart 18 provides details into share repurchase activity during the quarter. As we previously mentioned, we had
significantly higher share repurchases in the quarter compared with the same period last year with $937 million spent.
More importantly, we're $300 million ahead of the year-to-date amount from a year ago, and have reduced shares

outstanding by more than 5 million shares. And we are well on our way to achieving or exceeding the $2 billion
repurchase target we established at the beginning of the year.
On chart 19, we discuss our total cash returned to stockholders for both the quarter and year-to-date. With the $1.4
billion in cash returned to stockholders in the second quarter, we returned just over $2.5 billion on a year-to-date basis.
And in both the quarter and year-to-date, we have returned 131% of free cash flow to our stockholders.
On chart 20, we provide our updated outlook for the year. We're leaving both orders and sales unchanged at this time.
About 65% of our orders are planned for the second half of the year; and while we think there is upside potential in our
sales for the second half of the year, we'll have a much better feel for both of these metrics when we get to the third
quarter call.
We are increasing our segment operating profit by $75 million due to our strong performance through the first half of
the year. And as a result of our increase in profit, we are also increasing our earnings per share guidance by $0.15 to a
new outlook of between $11 and $11.30 per share.
Finally, we are keeping our cash from operations guidance unchanged. We mentioned last quarter that our cash would
be significantly weighted for the second half of the year; and while that is still the case, our stronger second quarter
results have reduced that difference between the first and second half of the year.
On chart 21, we have our sales outlook by business area. Again, no change in our outlook at this time.
Chart 22 shows our outlook for segment operating profit. We have a higher profit outlook in two of our business areas
this quarter, increasing Space Systems by $45 million and Mission Systems and Training by $30 million, resulting in
the total outlook increase of $75 million.
Finally, chart 23 provides our summary of the quarter. We had a good quarter building upon our results in the first
quarter and positioning us well as we look forward to the rest of the year. Our cash deployment actions accelerated in
the quarter and we remain committed to the actions we discussed earlier this year.
Our program execution was very good in the quarter and we look forward to adding to our portfolio with some strategic
wins in the second half of the year. And last but certainly not least, our decisions to acquire Sikorsky Aircraft and
conduct a strategic review of our government IT and technical services business makes this quarter strong from both
the tactical and strategic perspective.
And with that, we're ready for your questions. Abigail?

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS. Your line is
open.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Good morning. Congratulations.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Good morning. Thank you, David.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Good morning and thank you.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Bruce, can you just give us – potentially give us some more metrics that you're thinking
about around Sikorsky potential leverage that you see, the deleveraging, and then how you're thinking about intangible
amortization and accretion from the deal as you look out? Thank you.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. Sure, David. Yeah, so as we look to finance this deal, as Marillyn said, we expect to
use some cash off the balance sheet but also do, obviously, the vast majority of it in the form of debt. Currently, we're

thinking that it looks somewhere around $1 billion off of the balance sheet in terms of cash use, and $8 billion worth of
debt.
We think just from sort of a – just to give you a lot of metrics maybe at once here, we think that the debt, the average
coupon for the multiple maturities that we would do, including potentially a little bit of commercial paper in the mix,
would be about a 3.5% coupon. So, you should think of that as somewhere in the order of $280 million-ish a year of
interest, and on an after-tax basis, something like $180 million a year, rounding.
Intangible amortization, I think, was your other question. As we look at this right now, we're probably looking at about
$3.5 billion worth of intangible costs. Think of that as sort of trade name, customer relationships as the biggest drivers
of that intangible level, and that would equate to about $250 million of expense a year. So, again, think of the $180
million after-tax interest intangible amortization, around $215 million a year.
And then on the positive side, obviously, the 338(h)(10), as Marillyn said, almost $2 billion worth of present value.
You should think of that as being about a $450 million a year sort of tax deduction associated with the step-up in assets
that equates to about $160 million a year of benefit going forward. And then as Marillyn said also, we're expecting
somewhere in a steady-state run rate of about $150 million a year in additional earnings.
So, if you add all those up together, a lot of moving pieces there, I realize that your final question was sort of accretion,
when does that happen? So, our intent is to integrate this business as quickly as possible. Marillyn said we expect to
close somewhere end of 2016 – or excuse me, end of 2015, early 2016. So, we would expect to have the integration
costs spent in large part in 2016. We want to get the integration done as quickly as possible in order to generate the
synergies that come from that, so we would be GAAP diluted, if you will, in 2016. We expect to be marginally GAAP
accretive from an earnings perspective starting in 2017 and then to grow from that point forward.
Yeah. Just one maybe last comment on the – that's okay. Never mind, I'll leave it at there and see if there's another
question on it.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Your line is open.
<Q - Finbar Thomas Sheehy>: Good morning and it's Finbar Sheehy for Doug. Just turning to the other side of your
strategic announcements this morning on the services and IT businesses. Can you talk a little more about the criteria
you'll use to decide which ones you'll keep and which ones you'll divest? And as you talk about that, you mentioned
that you have the opportunity to acquire Sikorsky at the bottom of the cycle. Some of these IT and services businesses
have been hurt by the Budget Control Act and sequestration. So, how do you avoid, if you like, divesting these
businesses at the bottom of their markets?
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: So, just to speak to the portfolio, the way that we've gone – we've been looking at our IT
infrastructure services and technical services business for some time now and then quite a bit of analysis, trying inside
the corporation, figure out how we can make it as competitive as we can. As you know, there's a lot more competitors
that have come in to the marketplace. And our customers' priorities are changing and what they're looking at, more –
they're much more price-sensitive.
And so, the elements of our business predominantly will be in the work that we are doing for civil agencies, IT
infrastructure-type services. If you think about enterprise IT services that are done for various agencies, that is the type
of work that would fall into this. And then the technical services work that is in our Missiles and Fire Control business.
In terms of – we certainly want to create value through this process. So, what we believe is if we move it out from
under the business structure in Lockheed Martin, that that will allow it to thrive and grow, allow it to have a business
structure that allows it to thrive and grow. And so, we're willing to separate those businesses to create that value going
forward.

We think it's a very strong business. We have a strong legacy of being the top IT provider for the U.S. Government for
the past 21 years, and this is a business that has strong performance and strong programs. And we've had some recent
wins this year, and we've had some acquisitions in that business. So, we think what we have is a premier asset, and we
think if we can stand it up as a stand-alone company or if it's attractive to a buyer and we can get the right price for it,
then that's the best for that business to go forward.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Richard Safran with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.
<Q - Richard T. Safran>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Good morning, Rich.
<Q - Richard T. Safran>: Marillyn, Bruce, I wanted to know if you think you could be a better owner and operator of
Sikorsky than United Technologies was. If possible, I'd like to know how you might be looking at operating the
business differently than UTX did? How you might think that might be a benefit?
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Well, I'll start out first; and then, Bruce, you can add to my comments.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Sure.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: I think if you look at what is our core business, our core business is doing business with
governments and its platform and systems integration. So, that is the predominance of our business. And I think, in that
sense, bringing Sikorsky into our business is just a natural fit for us, and it's an ability for us to bring our strength in
running programs, in our government contracting, and all of that expertise to the Sikorsky business.
We also look forward to the opportunity to create value on the international side of our business from their footprint
that they have around the world, and the work that they're doing in a number of countries. So, I think if you look at the
potential synergies, we do think we are an excellent owner and a better owner for this business because not only do we
bring our expertise, but bringing in their footprint and their capability around the world is going to – is value that we
can create as well.
Bruce, you want to add some?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Just a thought, Rich. So, in terms of adding value greater than the parent, this is a business
that's been successful for however long it's been in business, 90-something-plus years. So, they obviously are a national
icon in terms of the capabilities that they bring to the rotary marketplace. So, they do a lot of things well already.
Where I think we can create value, I mean, first off, we think this deal has pretty low execution risk from us. I mean, I
like to think of this as we're buying a portfolio of programs versus sort of a new business model and new marketplaces
and new customers that we've never dealt with before. This is all very, very familiar with us.
And I like to think of this as having sort of the power and backing of a $45-billion business focused on government
contracting versus one which was less focused perhaps in total than just on the piece of the Sikorsky business. I do
think there are areas we can improve the business, particularly on the contracting side and maybe to focus a little bit on
the cash flow side.
I think, in particular, the international sales market is an interesting one for us where we – through the combination of
our portfolios coming in and having a discussion about the security needs of our international customers, whether it's
F-35s, littoral combat ships, now Sikorsky helicopters, is a much, much more powerful discussion than what I believe
the current parent could have in terms of bundling products and services together to go into the international
marketplace.
So, I think all of those really add to our ability to help this – better position this business going forward. And look, we –
we're happy to have this business. We think it fits well into our portfolio and this is what we do. And this is our core

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Good morning.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Marillyn, have you had a chance to get initial feedback from the DoD in the
proposed acquisition, particularly as it applies to broader consolidation of the industrial base, realizing the army is not a
huge customer proportionally to Lockheed Martin, maybe that's not as much but at a DoD level, there may be some
issue?
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Well, as we would do on any acquisition, we contacted our customers. So, I've had an
opportunity to speak at senior levels in the Department of Defense and have offered to them to provide whatever
additional information they need as they assess it. They have been consistent through any acquisition of this type to say
that they will assess and ask their questions and give it a detailed review. And so, we stand ready to support them
through that process.
I do think, if you look at this acquisition, we are not reducing the number of competitors at all in this segment, in the
helicopter segment. And so, in that sense, there shouldn't be a concern. And our portfolios are very complementary.
There's very little overlap between our two portfolios. So in that sense, I would expect that that would not be a concern
of theirs going forward.
In terms of the services business, there are many, many competitors out in the services – IT services arena. So, the fact
that we are trying to position this business where it can be more competitive in that arena, I think they would view it
positively. So, between those two elements, it's very positive.
The other thing that I would argue is there are some concern about consolidation, making one entity bigger than
another. When you look at these two strategic actions that we're taking, UTC has reported that they see the sales for
Sikorsky to be about $6.5 billion this year in 2015. And the piece of business that we're looking at doing a strategic
review to spend or sell is about $6 billion.
So, we may find at the end of the day that we're roughly the same size, maybe even a little smaller, maybe a little
bigger, but basically roughly the same size with both of these strategic actions. So, I don't think there's more
concentration at Lockheed Martin in that sense.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Good morning. Congratulations.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Good morning.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Good morning.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Just two quick clarification questions. One on what Marillyn just spoke of, but with
regard to the strategic evaluation at IT, the question there is, you're talking about this as a single $6 billion business or
at least that's my interpretation. But might you consider doing different things with difference pieces, selling some and
spending the other? And then for Bruce, is the $150 million in synergies net of things like profit-on-profit? Thanks.

<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: So, to your question, first of all, this could be – there's a number of possible scenarios.
That's why we want to go through this process between now and the end of the year to really give a strategic review on
what is the best options, strategic options, for these elements of the business.
To your point, it could result in one or more transaction. And our key is how do we deliver more value to our
customers? How do we deliver more value to our shareholders through this process? So, the strategic review is going to
determine what the ultimate outcome, and it could be more than one transaction.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah, Rob, the second part of your question, the $150 million steady-state going forward.
That is considered to be net of fee-on-fee or profit-on-profit, if you will. And just to give you – not to confuse you,
perhaps, but just to give you some insight, the level of sales that we see, the overlap, that would need to be adjusted out,
if you will, once Sikorsky becomes part of the portfolio for our business that's being conducted within Mission Systems
and Training, you should think of that being about $150 million a year.
I mean, there's obviously priced business right now that carries on for some period of time, for things like our work on
the Combat Rescue Helicopter or the Presidential helicopter. That wouldn't have a negative profit impact in the near
term, but would eliminate the sales, obviously, of that going forward. And then – so think of it when we get to the
steady state, that is net, if you will, of that consideration of fee-on-fee.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Your line is open.
<Q - Peter John Skibitski>: Yeah. Congrats, guys, on some bold moves.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Thanks, Pete.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Thank you.
<Q - Peter John Skibitski>: Guys, how do you think about the strategic fit of Sikorsky's commercial helicopter
business?
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Well, I think it's – for us, it's a nice fit in the sense that – as I mentioned in my remarks at
the outset, we – it's predominantly in the oil and gas side which is not an area that we are in. And while we've got some
near-term pressure there just because of what's happened with oil prices, we see an opportunity in a few years for that
to turn, and so real opportunity for growth there as we move forward.
And then the other side would be – on the commercial side would be on the sustainment. There's the commercial
aircraft that are already in the base among these 40 countries that I mentioned, have to be maintained and sustained;
and so that's a good strong healthy business. When you look at it from a Lockheed Martin standpoint, I mean, we sell
our products and services [indiscernible] (34:44) countries. So, they buy both military and commercial platforms and
systems and sustainment activity. So, I think that that is a nice fit where we bring all of that together in our customer
relationships around the world.

you're saying in terms of the profit-on-profit that you'd be getting for the programs if you're a subcontractor to
Sikorsky, that's about $150 million currently or that's where it's going to be in...

<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Okay. And that's because a lot of their programs that you subcontracted to really haven't
started to ramp-up yet?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: That's correct, George. But I'll tell you, the absolute dollars on our side don't deviate a whole
lot from that number for the work that we're doing today and for the near future.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Okay. And then, similar subject, Bruce. How much subcontract work do you do for other
helicopter manufacturers that might be at risk since they may not want to deal with a competitor?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. So, we do quite a bit a work, George. Actually, we sell direct to the U.S. Government.
A lot of the work is not directly to the helo manufacturers themselves. So, a lot of our integration activities is actually
done direct to the government as opposed to direct to the other helo manufacturers, if you will.
We have relationships with everyone, domestically and internationally, in the helo marketplace. Our intention is to
maintain those relationships going forward. That's something that we would obviously have to consider relative to our
discussions with the DoD as far as going forward this incorporation of the business, and that's something that we would
intend to do just out of pure economics perspective, if nothing else; but that's just the right thing for us to do going
forward.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Your line is open.
<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: Hi. Thank you. I want to turn to the boring things of talking about the business for a
moment now, and you've had a couple of nice positive developments in terms of operations. Were there some things
that you can address, both in Space and frankly in aircraft that either you brought to bear the – change the profit
trajectory?
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Well, just to speak to our major program, the F-35. I mean, we have made really good
progress over the past quarter on that program. I had the opportunity to attend the CEO conference in Norway for the
F-35 program, where all the international partners participate and it's chaired by Secretary Kendall – by Under
Secretary Kendall, and we have very strong support for the program itself and the fact that Secretary Kendall would
come out after that to discuss potential block buy for the program which would be for at least 450 to maybe 500
aircrafts from FY 2018 to FY 2020. I think it was a very strong statement about the stability of the program and the
outlook for the program going forward.
The second thing on that is we've been tracking the performance of the program and moving toward the Marine Corps
initial operating capability. The Marines have finished their operational readiness. They're now in the midst of their
assessment of their operational readiness and is on track – they appear to be on track to announce their IOC this month,
and we look forward to that. That's a huge milestone in this program [ph] win. (39:01) There is one – the first service to
come out to declare that aircraft combat-ready, I think, sends a strong message to everyone that this program is on
track.
We delivered 11 aircrafts in the second quarter. We're on track to deliver 45 in 2015, and we've already gotten our long
lead for LRIP 10, so that's for 94 aircraft. So, program is ramping up in that sense. I think it's well-supported in the
budget proposals that are out there. And so, in that sense, production's ramping up; software completion, and all of
those things are on track. And so, that's what I would say on F-35.
You mentioned the Space program. I mean, we're performing well on our government satellites. MUOS, for example,
just launched the third MUOS satellite; and that program is moving forward. And then on SBIRS, if you've seen the
reports out that we have put forth a more cost-effective approach going forward and was greatly embraced by the U.S.
Government on SBIRS. And so, we'll continue our path along SBIRS.
And then in the missile defense arena, I hope you saw that Germany has announced their intent to – they've selected
MEADS for their air defense system, and that's truly a strategic win for us. I mean, their legacy systems are aging.

They need replacement. They went through a very thorough assessment of what system would best fit their needs, and
they selected MEADS, and I think it sets the tone for other countries. We'll be looking at this important selection by
Germany, and we expect other countries to look at MEADS as their choice for the most modern, the most capable
missile defense system for their countries.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi with Stifel, Nicolaus. Your line is open.
<Q - Joseph W. DeNardi>: Hey. Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Good morning.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Good morning.
<Q - Joseph W. DeNardi>: Bruce, I wonder if you could talk about the – I guess, it's maybe tough to talk about, but
the proceeds from the spin or the sale at this point, is that additive to your capital deployment plans or should we think
about that as going towards the balance sheet?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: So, you're right, it is hard to predict. I mean those are obviously two completely different
scenarios in terms of the cash that we would receive from that versus spin versus a sale. Spin, obviously, being a lot
less. We've got a fairly low tax basis in that business, at least as we look at it. Not unlike what UTC was probably
looking at with Sikorsky, you've got a low tax basis. So, your ability to get cash out on a spin basis is limited from a
tax-free basis – or from tax-free perspective to what that is in terms of a tax-free dividend.
So, we get a lot more cash back from a sale perspective. I hate to speculate what that could be. And we'll get into
further detail as we get into the later part of this year and early part of next year, as far as when we sort of close on our
decision as to which path we go down. I would suspect, in terms of cash deployment, the near-term cash deployment
would probably be paying off some – I mentioned, as far as some of the debt that we're doing to do the Sikorsky deal,
would likely come in the form of commercial paper. We'd probably pay that off pretty quickly and bring that down.
And then the rest, Joseph, we'll wait and see what we've got and what needs we have at that time. And as usual, we'll
try to be opportunistic in all our cash deployment actions as we always are.

<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Thanks, Pete.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: [ph] A quick (43:06) clarification, Sikorsky, will that be an independent segment or are you

move forward. Bruce?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: So, Peter, just talking about deliveries, as you said, the 45 this year. That's about what we're
expecting to have for the year. I think we've delivered 19 on a year-to-date basis. So obviously, that ramp rate picks up
in the second half of the year.
Just going down the entire portfolio, the C-130. Again, we talked in the past about that being a very steady build rate of
about 24 aircraft a year. We had 10 deliveries in the first half of the year which would obviously imply 14 in the second
half. Right now, those are more weighted, just for FYI purposes, towards the fourth quarter than they are for the third
quarter. I like to think there are some potential to move some of those aircraft into the third quarter, though, that's
actually making our sales. If we just were to profile our sales for the rest of the year, it makes our fourth quarter look a
little bigger than I think it actually is going to be as we sit here today.
C-5 deliveries, we expect about nine for the year. We've had five on a year-to-date basis. So, four for the rest of the
year unless we pull in one for next year. And these aircrafts are getting to be a very good pattern from a performance
perspective. We were actually earlier on the deliveries all throughout the first half of this year. So, we're going to be
watching that, but that's not what's in our current plan; it's not what's in our current guidance.
Next year, I don't have the numbers off the top of my head, Peter, but definitely, the aircraft deliveries on F-35 are
going up. I'm sorry. Let me back up for a second. I didn't talk F-16, I apologize. F-16, 11, 12 aircraft in the year. We
did six in the first half of the year. Five, six in the second half. So, let me maybe start with the easy ones: C-130J, 24
next year; F-16, similar levels of sales in terms of quantities next year; F-35, greater than the 45 now, I don't have that
number off the top of my head, but it's a pretty good increase, Peter, from what I've got in my memory there; and then
C-5s, a very similar number to what we're seeing in 2015.
Hopefully that helps with the question there.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob (sic) [Ron] Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Your line is open.
<Q - Ronald J. Epstein>: Yeah. Hey. Good morning, guys.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Good morning.
<Q - Ronald J. Epstein>: [ph] Just wondering (46:44) if you could just quickly go through, if possible, in a little more
detail, where you expect to pick up the $150 (sic) [$150 million] of cost synergies? Are you going to be moving
facilities? Is it just back-office takeout? How are you thinking about that, Bruce?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. So, it's a combination of probably all of the things that you would think would happen
in this sort of transaction. So, some of the bigger abilities that we believe get some long-term synergies are in the
supply chain particularly with the overlap of the procurement activities especially within our Aeronautics business
activities but also within MST as well in terms of systems overlap there. So, you should think of the synergies coming
in the form of supply chain synergies. A little bit of facilities perhaps rationalization, and some head count
rationalization as you would expect as well.
And collectively, that adds up to more than $150 million. We think the $150 million is sort of what sticks to the bottom
line after consideration of priced business and disclosing under cost and pricing data on our government business. The
thing that interested me or that caught my attention when we looked at this business is more of it stays with us longer
term.
I think because this probably has a longer tail of priced business than I would have expected before we went into this –
the diligence phase, I mean about $16 billion worth of priced business. So obviously, you get the keep it on that part of
the business. And also the commercial and the sustainment particularly on the supply chain savings, the head count

savings and the like. Obviously, those are less cost-based driven in terms of pricing and more of the synergy you get
from a cost side there stay for longer as well.
So that's sort of how I think of it, those three buckets: facilities, supply chain, head count. And for the reasons I just
said, they stay with us for longer than you might otherwise think. otherwise think.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
<Q - Hunter K. Keay>: Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Good morning.
<Q - Hunter K. Keay>: So, as you think about the evolution of Lockheed here over the next 12 months, how should
we think about how IRAD will maybe move around a little bit, getting rid of the some of the short-cycle stuff and
layering in Sikorsky, already in a little bit of an upward trajectory year-over-year. Should we think about maybe R&D
trending at or above the 2% of sales level once everything is kind of done with?
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Yeah. So, I'll take that on, Hunter. So, it's an interesting swap. Marillyn talked earlier
about sort of big picture perspective. We're losing $6 billion worth of business on our IT tech services side which you
should think of being much, much, much significantly lower IRAD-intensive than the rest of the business. And this, I
think, just speaks to the need for that business to have as cost-efficient a structure as is possible in order to survive in
the environment that we're currently operating in there.
Sikorsky operates in a much more IRAD-intensive environment, but not unlike what the rest of the portfolio of
Lockheed Martin looks like when you exclude the IS&GS and tech services piece. So, I actually tried to do some quick
math myself, Hunter, and I think we get close to 2% or so of R&D when you kind of get to the new sales level of the
combined company minus that which is spun or sold, and you add in the IRAD for all of the remaining businesses plus
the Sikorsky; it's actually probably a little bit north of 2%.

<Q - Rob Stallard>: Thanks so much. Good morning.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Good morning.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Good morning, Rob.
<Q - Rob Stallard>: Bruce, you mentioned there were some franchise wins you were looking to achieve in the second
half of this year. I was wondering if you could give us an update on those, and which ones you think your chance are
best at?
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Sure, Rob. So, when I talked franchise wins in the second half of the year, I'm really
talking the Long-Range Strike Bomber and JLTV. We're watching, as are our partners, I'm quite certain Boeing,
watching very closely; the expectation that that will probably be decided sometime in the August-September
timeframe. We still like our offering there and we feel good about that. We've had lots of discussions. I think we're
good partners for each other. We bring very, very capable, collaborative skill sets to the fray. And so, that's the first one
that we're looking at, Rob. And again, I think we like where we sit there.
JLTV is the other one. JLTV is, maybe in some people's views, a little bit tougher [indiscernible] (52:11) because they
don't necessarily associate Lockheed Martin with being in the combat vehicle business. But I think we've got a
tremendous offering there and it would put us into a new segment within the DoD that we don't have a lot of business.

Other than sort of putting some of our weapon systems on top of combat vehicles, this would be actually building the
contract – or the combat vehicle itself. So, it's sort of exciting to be able to have that opportunity.
Again, we think we've got a great offering. They look different in terms of the orders this year. The Bomber would be a
bigger order. Initially, the JLTV would be as much, much smaller order initially in the current year. But both of them
have very long – think of it as decades long sort of production tracks once you get passed the development side.
In terms of just sheer dollars that we're looking for, not so much in the franchise wins. But we've got big dollars
associated with primarily two Aeronautics programs that we're needing to close and definitize those contracts; finally
the C-130J multi-year and LRIP 9 for the F-35 program. Both of those are big dollars in the second half of the year in
terms of orders.
As I still sort of look out for the rest of the year, even though we're light, and I know there was an earlier question about
where we are, sort of, orders from a year-to-date basis, but I still think we're marching towards about the $80 billion
that we set at the start of the year and getting all the puts and takes we see going forward.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Yes. Thank you and congratulations on the Sikorsky transaction.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Thank you.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: So, a question. I was surprised that you only have $150 million of inter-company sales given
your participation on CMH, Naval Hawk, Presidential and Combat and Rescue. So, could you give a sense as to where
that number goes in the future? And then maybe give us – two sort of mini questions, where – what the cash flow of
Sikorsky looks like given they have a very heavy near-term development mix, and whether you expect to use contract
liability amortization for accounting of Canadian Maritime Helicopter? Thank you.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hell, what a mouthful, Cai. You threw a lot in there. You got your money's worth, to say the
least. So, yeah, we're talking back to the $150 million of inter-company. It's not quite intercompany yet. I'll remind you
that. But that's primarily for the Combat Rescue Helicopter and the Presidential helicopter. That's about – that stays –
you shouldn't think of that as, this is starting off low and it's going to grow to some larger number. That's a fairly
consistent number. I'm trying to do this from recall, but that's a pretty consistent number going out for every year, not
just the near term but the long term as well.
I think maybe where some of the confusion is, is on the MH-60 helo, that's the Romeo work that we do there. And
there, we're sort – think of us as co-primes on that. We do not subcontract under Sikorsky for that work. That's actually
sort of two prime contracts. So, that may be where some of the confusion is. So, think of us again as CRH and the
Presidential helicopter are VXX-related. And those just aren't as large maybe as people think they are in terms of our
size of the business there.
Cash flow for Sikorsky, I think you hit it right. I think at least for a couple of years, you should think of them adding
some inventory build-up. And by the way, I should get into disclosing going forward Sikorsky [ph] business, (56:13)
but what I'm expecting to see is as inventory build-up, some working capital build-up for some of the new programs
that I just talked about, both the Combat Rescue Helicopter and the Presidential helicopter. I know they've also got a
[ph] loss (56:27) contract on the Canadian Maritime Helicopter contract, which obviously can't be strong for cash flow.
So, I wouldn't expect near-term cash to just knock our socks off. I mean, this is a long-term business. We're not buying
this business for the next three years; we're buying this business for the next three decades, and it's very much the way
we look at it in terms of a long-term acquisition cycle for us.
I think your last question was, you asked about the accounting treatment on the Canadian Helicopter. We will go with
the convention of Lockheed Martin, and this will all get settled out in the conforming accounting and the purchase

accounting adjustments. And whatever loss we think is there will be reflected at the time of the acquisition and that'll
be reflected behind us, if you will, and essentially zero going forward from an accounting perspective.

business into Mission Systems and Training but it will be a stand-alone line of business. And we like that model. We
like that kind of a co-prime model like we have on MH-60 Romeo, as a good approach going forward.

<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Good morning.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Good morning.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: I'm going to see if I can sneak two in also. But the first one is just can you – Bruce, can you
talk about what the cost will be to extract that $150 million in savings especially in 2016? And then, secondly, on the
IT side, I just wanted to understand what's changed? It seems like some of the areas like commercial cyber, you were
still making acquisitions. Last year, you made healthcare IT, Systems Made Simple acquisition late last year. Is it have
to do with Sikorsky that you're now looking at other parts of the portfolio, or did something else changed about the
business that [indiscernible] (58:34)
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. So, Sam, let me try the first one and I may take a shot at the second one but, Marillyn,
correct me later on. So, the cost to extract in 2016 – if we close the deal end of this year, obviously, I like to think of
the cost here as sort of transaction costs, integration costs. You got the intangible amortization; you got interest on that
debt. I think I talked most of those but I haven't necessarily talked the integration costs. So, if the deal gets closed by
the end of this year, obviously, hopefully, most of the transaction costs will be behind us in 2015. Whenever it does
close, 2015 or 2016, that's when the bulk of the transaction cost will hit.
As I said earlier, we intend to rapidly integrate Sikorsky into our business, that would require some acceleration made
from what you're thinking in terms of the integration costs. I don't know that we've got those totally nailed down at this
point in time, Sam, but you should think of those $80 million, $100 million a year kind of level in 2016 is the – just the
integration cost there. Again, hopefully, it gets that behind us, gets them integrated and enables us to have the synergy
impacts happening that much quicker.
The second question, as far as the IT and what changed. It's funny; I think it's as you continually go through the process
of competing for new business even after we acquired some of the companies we acquired; for instance, SMS. Some of
the new competitions that SMS we're competing for, we saw some different acts on the behalf of some of our
customers than we had been expecting. Things like splitting out parts of the contract, things like splitting out procured
costs from the contract that frankly were another sort of twist to that business going forward that was sort of a
culmination over a number of years of how that business and the dynamics of that business has changed.
When Sikorsky became available and when we looked at that and said, that's a business that's probably more down the
middle of what the rest of the corporation is. Frankly, we didn't think – again, just to reiterate what Marillyn said that
we could necessarily compete in the environment with the sorts of expectations that customers had in the IT and
government services business successfully and in the interest of creating value for the corporation and actually giving
our employees the greatest chance for growth in the business that they love, that's the reason for the separation. So, I'll
say it's not one or the other; it's probably the combination of the two that led to that.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: The other thing I would add to that is we've looked at – on what we are putting under
strategic review, we've looked at very closely relative to the rest of what's in IS&GS, for example, and recognize that
what we're putting under strategic review is work that is just increasingly difficult for us to be competitive in, and under
our standard business model.

It's not – I mean, the work that they're doing is good work for our customers. It's important work that they're doing
every day, but it's just – our standard business model, it's difficult for us to compete. And we are – and then the
commercial cyber would be an example in what area it operates in. We are not exiting the cybersecurity business that
we do for the U.S. Government and for governments around the world. That's an important element of business. It's an
element that we bring value to with our robust multi-layer cyber defense capability, and we provide some of the most
advanced cybersecurity solutions.
So, in that regard, we're staying in those businesses that we think really fit well with where – what is – that is our core
market and that we can be competitive in. Much of the business that we're looking at – or all the business that we're
looking at putting under strategic review has become extremely price-sensitive, and our customers will – we may be
performing at the top of the heap on the work we're doing, but if somebody comes in with a little price and then
recomplete, they'll move to a new player, a new and tested player. And that's just the environment that we're operating
in.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
<Q - Seth M. Seifman>: Thanks very much and good morning. As you guys sort of mentioned, Sikorsky has won a
number of key DoD programs that should support sales growth in the future. But maybe – I know this might be a little
difficult to do, but if you could just lay out kind of a back-of-the-envelope trajectory, because you do have those new
programs, but at the same time, you have some pressure on legacy programs and a new multi-year contract coming up
on Black Hawk. So, maybe the trajectory over the next few years from an earnings standpoint. Where things kind of
bottom out and then how the drivers come in to push that up as we head into the end of the decade?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: So, Seth, welcome to the call, by the way.
<Q - Seth M. Seifman>: Thank you. Thanks.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Just a couple of thoughts there. And I'll probably talk more top line and say – and let you
figure out maybe what's happening on the bottom line there. But the top line in terms of sort of valuation, the way we
looked at it at this business. And it has been mentioned before, the commercial helo market associated with the oil and
gas industry has really – not just for Sikorsky's business but for the market at large, has really gone down quite a bit.
So, from where the peak in 2014 of sales to where we expect going forward, we think that number is going to drop just
on the commercial sales. I don't have these numbers exactly committed to memory. But I think they did $1.5 billion or
so worth of commercial helo work in 2014 or so. And I don't know what the expectation is in 2015 off the top of my
head, but I do know in the valuation that we put going forward, we think that number comes closer to sort of $0.75
billion worth of business. That's our view.
So, you should think of that as creating some top-line pressure, at least, in our view on the current level of revenue
from 2016 going forward for a couple of years. And the commercial market obviously is the more profitable market as
well, so that puts pressure on the bottom line there.
Where we see that starting to turn around is some trickling of the commercial market getting better and the oil and gas
market getting better, say, in the late 2018, 2019 timeframe. And that's also coincidentally when we see the transition
from a lot of these developmental firms into production, particularly the 53K [CH-53K]. So, that's when we would
expect to see sort of a rebound on the other side both from a top line as well as the bottom line. The margin will kind of
sort out the way they will; depending on the commercial market, but that's the way we should view that in our
judgment.

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS. Your line is now open.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Thanks for taking my question again. Bruce and Marillyn, you've talked about this Sikorsky
deal, seen as relatively low execution risk. But obviously, Sikorsky has run into some problems with CMH, with 53K
[CH-53K]. Can you just talk about your comfort with the execution risks that you're taking on here? Thanks.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: So, I would say, as Bruce commented earlier, I mean we run government programs. We
run platforms and systems programs across our entity. I've never seen our company performing better in terms of how –
of the programs that we're operating on today. And so, in that sense, similarly, Sikorsky has a long track record of
success.
And in new development programs, there are times when any company – the complexity of it is going to – we're going
to have some challenges on the front end. But I think we bring to this strong program management expertise, and
coupling that with Sikorsky's performance and their innovative technology, that's where we think this is low risk. I
mean, it is right in our core market. We know how to build. We both design and build platforms, and so it fits right in
our sweet spot.
Bruce, you want to add anything?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: The only thing I would add, David, is this is nothing new. I mean, what I believe – and I'm
not there on the ground, obviously, but there's no technical showstoppers that we saw. This is just the hardcore fact of
going from development into production. We, of all companies, probably empathize with that more than anyone else on
the planet, probably.
But you look at what we've done in our history, where we are finally at on the F-35 program, going from development
to production; where we've taken the THAAD from an infant position of trying to figure out this hit-to-kill air missile
defense, at the levels we're talking about actually work or not, to where it's now a production fielded facility
application; just taking the PAC-3 missile to its next generation with the MSE; taking satellites, MUOS, Advanced
EHF, SBIRS, from development to production.
We've got the scars. We know what this is like. So, this is not a surprise to us. And look, we think when we get
Sikorsky into the fold, we have people who have sort of been through this a lot of different ways who can help with that
process. And we have really, really good production people. And not to say that Sikorsky does not, because we're very
impressed by the production team there, but we think we have some synergies coming out there as well.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Thanks. Just a follow up on the overall long, long-term, you mentioned you're
buying over three decades, you're on the Joint Multi-Role helo effort today with Bell, and then Sikorsky is on team
with Boeing. Is there anything, when the companies are combined, that's going to preclude you from being on both
teams or is this effectively improving your odds obviously?
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Well, our intention is to continue relationships that we have today on those programs. We
want to bring the best solution to our customer. We have some good partnerships that we're working on and we intend
to continue those partnerships going forward.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah, Myles. The other thing I would add is that program, especially the – the Future Vertical
Lift, not JLTV, the Future Vertical Lift is so far out in the future. You tell me when it's going to happen, the quantities
and so forth. There's a lot of chance between now and then for people to change ideas, thoughts, requirements, et
cetera.
So, whether that ends up being the program that we think it is today or not is anyone's guess. And so it's hard for me to
get just too excited about where we sit today with something that's probably not going to come at a full rate production

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Your line is open.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Yeah, Bruce, on the F-35, was there a margin pick-up there because you mentioned that
you had $30 million higher profit on about $280 million in sales, which obviously would be a higher margin in what
you're currently booking on that program?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah, George, there was. This is the second straight quarter where we brought up the booking
rates on some of our LRIP contracts. I think this is just recognizing the progression we're going through. I believe this
one – I'm trying to think – recall from memory, George, I believe this was on LRIP 6. And you should think of that as
being associated with the completion of deliveries over this period of time.
So, we're starting to get a cadence there. I like to think – I mean I think 6 is on an uptick or was on an uptick. I think lot
7 is also an uptick. We need to see that cadence sort of continue going forward. But I feel really good about where we
are on the production. Back to my earlier comment, going from transitioning from development programs to
production, we're right there, and I think we're doing pretty well on that right now.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: And on the C-5, Bruce, you've been booking near zero, with your comment that delivery
seems to be running a little better than expected. What's the outlook for getting better profitability on that program?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. So, George, we have a planned step-up in the second half of the year reflecting the
good performance that we've seen today. I hope that that's something that we can actually do better then, even than
what we have planned in the outlook there. And I know you and I have talked specifically, George, about the
potentiality of a claim associated with the over and above work we have on the C-5 program.
That's still – just to be clear, that's still not considered within anything that I've talked about up to this point in time.
And again, that's something we feel very, very strongly about in terms of entitlement, and we'll see how that plays out
down the road but that's not a factor in anything that I just said earlier.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is
open.
<Q - Ronald J. Epstein>: Yeah. Hey, Bruce. Just a real quick accounting question for you. So, the $2 billion in tax
savings that you guys get, is that straight line over 15 years?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: It is. It is, Ron, but it's...
<Q - Ronald J. Epstein>: Okay.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: It's high degree of certainty because the tax benefits can be used for the combined company.
So, those are take them home, I mean, those are benefits that are going to accrue to the corporation.
<Q - Ronald J. Epstein>: Okay. Great. Thanks.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah.

<Q - Peter John Skibitski>: Yeah, I might have missed these, guys. But with all the puts and takes on the Sikorsky
deal, are you expecting to be free cash flow accretive in 2016?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. I think it's going to be a little bit neutral. It's probably the way I would describe it in
2016, as our expectation, Pete. And then, we probably get plenty of time to start talking about the years thereafter. But I
think for near-term purposes and obviously some of that depends on whatever it happens at the end of this year, or early
next year, or a little bit later. But I think if it were for the whole year, we think of it as being fairly neutral for us next
year.
<Q - Peter John Skibitski>: Okay. Got it. Thank you.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: You bet.

I'm showing no further questions at this time, I'd like to turn the call back to management for further remarks.
Jerry F. Kircher
Okay.
Marillyn A. Hewson
Thank you. Well, let me just conclude. I appreciate all of you being on the call today and I want to just conclude by
saying we had a strong quarter of financial results and these strategic actions that we've announced are expected to
position the corporation to deliver even higher value to our customers and stockholders in the future. So, thanks again
for joining us on the call today. We look forward to speaking with you in October in our next earnings call.
Abigail, that concludes our call today.
