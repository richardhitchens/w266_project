Nancy R. Christal
Thank you, Maladon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I'm here this morning with Larry Merlo,
President and CEO, who will provide a business update; and Dave Denton, Executive Vice President and CFO, who
will review our first quarter results as well as guidance for the second quarter and year; Jon Roberts, President of PBM;
and Helena Foulkes, President of the Retail Business, are also with us today and they'll participate in the Q&A session
following our prepared remarks. During the Q&A, please limit yourself to no more than one question with a quick
follow up so we can provide more callers with the chance to ask their questions.
Just before this call, we posted a slide presentation on our web site. The slides summarize the information you'll hear
today as well as some additional facts and figures regarding our operating performance and guidance. Additionally, our

Form 10-Q will be filed later this afternoon and it will be available on our website at that time. Please note that during
today's presentation we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. By
their nature, all forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from
those contemplated by the forward-looking statements for a number of reasons as described in our SEC filings
including the Risk Factors section and cautionary statement disclosures in those filings.
During this call, we'll also use some non-GAAP financial measures when talking about our company's performance
including free cash flow and adjusted EPS. In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find the definitions of these
non-GAAP items as well as reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of our
website. And as always, today's call is being simulcast on our website and it will be archived there following the call
for one year.
And now I'll turn this over to Larry Merlo.
Larry J. Merlo
Okay. Thanks, Nancy, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us to hear more about the strong first
quarter results we posted this morning. Adjusted earnings per share increased 12.2% to $1.14 per share and that's $0.05
above the high-end of our guidance range. Operating profit in the Retail business declined 1.3% in line with
expectations, reflecting the tougher comparison due to the tobacco exit. Operating profit in the PBM increased 14.6%,
well ahead of our expectations. We generated approximately $1.6 billion of free cash during the quarter and we
continued to return significant value to our shareholders through our disciplined capital allocation practices.
Now it's still early in the year but given our outperformance in the first quarter, we are narrowing our adjusted EPS
range for 2015 to $5.08 to $5.19 and Dave will provide the details of our guidance during his financial review.
So let me turn to the business update and I'll start with the 2015 PBM selling season. The expected revenue impact for
2015 has grown since our last update. Gross new business currently stands at $7.5 billion with net new business of $4.1
billion, and that's up about $0.5 billion on both the gross and net lines from our last update. The increase was driven
primarily by the growth in membership within some health plan clients as well as some additional wins.
Now turning to the 2016 selling season. I would describe pricing in the industry as competitive yet rational and to-date
we've completed about a third of our client renewals, which is typical at this time of year. And while it's too early to
give you specific data points for 2016, I will note that the selling season is off to a good start. Our integrated model
allows us to provide differentiated products and services that continue to provide savings for our clients while
providing better health outcomes and convenience for our members. These unique products and services continue to
resonate strongly in the market and as we typically do, we'll provide a more quantitative update on our 2Q call in
August when we have a more complete picture.
Now our recently released Insights report highlights our efforts to manage trend for our clients. In 2014, gross trends
was 12.7% and that's up from 3.8% in 2013. Importantly, the report demonstrates that there are solutions to bend the
cost curve. With brand price increases, the accelerating growth in specialty, we are finding more clients receptive to
these types of solutions. Our report identifies high-performing clients, what we call our trendsetters, and the solutions
that they are using to improve the cost trend. Now we shared these results with our clients at our recent Client Forum
last month and let me take a minute and give you just a couple of examples.
First, formulary management solutions. Our trendsetter solution, we call it the Value Formulary and it promotes lower
cost generics and provides limited access to brands. We employ category-specific management using drug exclusions,
step therapies, prior authorization and quantity limits, and with a 12.7% gross trend for our overall book of business,
our clients using the Value Formulary achieved a gross trend of only 0.5%, more than 1,200 basis points better than the
overall book.
A second example is in managing specialty. Our book of business trend in specialty was 32.4%, nearly half of which
can be attributed to the surge in prescribing for the new Hep C therapies. Our underlying principles for our

management solutions include condition level management, a broader approach to clinical care, and a breakthrough
specialty patient experience. Our trendsetter solutions for specialty include our Advanced Specialty Formulary,
Specialty Connect, and Specialty Guideline Management, and you'll recall that Specialty Connect provides choice to
receive a member specialty script at CVS/pharmacy or through our mail channel while preserving the central clinical
expertise that leads to better health outcomes. The trendsetter result, 23.9% specialty trend, nearly 1,000 basis points
better than the overall book. So as I said, there are solutions and we expect more clients to adopt these cost
management tools.
Now speaking of specialty, our specialty revenues continued on a very strong growth trajectory in the quarter,
increasing 46%, and that was driven by volume, new products, inflation, and the impact of Specialty Connect. Our
infusion capabilities through Coram are another significant differentiator with clients and we're experiencing healthy
growth in the business. In fact, the number of infusion patients we serviced in the quarter jumped 15.7% from the prior
year and that's after adjusting for the timing of the Coram deal close. Site of care management, another important
component of managing costs for specialty patients, and we offer clients solutions to effectively manage these costs.
As we previously discussed, we've been using our leading formulary strategies to effectively manage the high cost Hep
C category and we envision employing similar tools to manage the anticipated new PCSK9 inhibitors, which are
expected to enter the market later this summer. However, given the significant number of people being treated for high
cholesterol that can be treated quite successfully with lower-cost statins, we envision robust prior authorization
guidelines to help control costs while ensuring that the appropriate population gets access to these newer therapies.
Before turning to Retail, let me touch a minute on biosimilars. With the first biosimilar approved, this is just the
beginning of a pipeline that could unlock additional savings and provide options to our clients. We expect discounts to
be available, but they will likely vary by product. And for the foreseeable future, we expect biosimilars will behave
more like brands than the traditional generics. And as a result, we expect to employ our formulary strategies to generate
savings for our clients.
Our Retail business, it produced results that were in line with our expectations. But pharmacy same-store prescription
unit volumes increased 5.1%, and that's on a 30-day equivalent basis. And we continue to gain pharmacy share. Our
Retail Pharmacy market share was 21.5% in the quarter, and that's up about 50 basis points versus the same quarter a
year ago.
Pharmacy same-store sales increased 4.2% and reflect a positive impact of about 70 basis points related to the
incidence of flu. Pharmacy same-store sales also include the negative impacts of about 280 basis points due to recent
generic introductions and another 190 basis points from the implementation of Specialty Connect, which as I
mentioned earlier transfers specialty scripts from our Retail to our PBM segment. Our initiative to unlock adherence
continues to make good progress, and we anticipate launching some new products later this year that will be available
to both patients and their caregivers in order to help patients stay adherent to their medication.
Turning to the front store. Our performance in the quarter was very solid. And while front store comps were down
6.1%, if you adjust for the tobacco impact, front store comps would have been up about 2%. The impact of the tobacco
exit was around 800 basis points, and that's about 100 basis points less than originally anticipated. We saw solid growth
in our core health and beauty categories, including the strong cough/cold season, and we gained share in health and
beauty in both the drug and multi-outlet markets. And while we experienced a decrease in front store traffic, that
decrease was partially offset by an increase in the average customer basket.
Our front store journey to position ourselves as a leading health and beauty destination continues. This year we are
launching phase one of our healthy foods rollout, offering customers more healthy choices in a select group of stores.
Our beauty elevation program is also launching in several thousand stores. And we continue to test a multitude of
changes to further enhance our front store clustering efforts, including a number of store resets that leverage the
knowledge that we're gaining from the Navarro acquisition.
ExtraCare continues to be an important driver of profitable front store growth, as about 80% of our sales now go
through our loyalty program, providing us a longitudinal view of the customer. And we've developed new internal tools

to ensure that promotional investments are driving the right economics, while delivering value for our customers. And
these tools have allowed us to further develop our personalization efforts.
Digital and specifically mobile are also important tools in powering up our personalization reach. And just as one
example today we know that customers using our mobile app with ExtraCare are spending four times more than our
average customer. So we're encouraged by these results and believe that there's more opportunity for further
innovation.
Our front store margins in the quarter continued to benefit from these efforts as well as the tobacco exit. On a
comparable basis to last year, including adjusting for the tobacco elimination, front store margins improved notably.
And this underlying improvement in the front reflects our highly personalized promotional strategies, along with the
continued growth in store brand sales.
In fact we made good progress in store brand penetration in the quarter with store brands increasing to 20.9% of front
store sales. And that's up about 330 basis points from last year. Two-thirds of the improvement reflecting the removal
of tobacco from our mix, and one-third of the improvement reflecting underlying progress in our store brand
penetration, as we continue to make progress toward our 25% goals.
Turning to store growth in the quarter. We opened 38 new stores, relocated 12, closed 10, resulting in 28 net new
stores. And we plan to add about 150 net new stores for the full year, equating to an anticipated increase in retail square
footage growth of around 2%.
As for MinuteClinic we opened 15 net new clinics in the quarter, and we ended the quarter with 986 clinics across 31
states plus the District of Columbia. And continuing on its very strong growth trajectory, MinuteClinic's revenues
increased about 21% versus the same quarter last year. And 84% of MinuteClinic visits were paid for by third parties,
with MinuteClinic included in most payer networks as an accessible and cost-effective provider.
The rollout of the EPIC electronic medical record system remains on schedule. We're expected to be complete with that
by mid-year. Additionally, we've now seen more than 13,000 patients since the initiation of our TeleHealth pilots in
California and Texas with very high levels of customer satisfaction. And we're continuing to test various uses for
TeleHealth and believe it can be part of a care model that improves access and lowers overall healthcare costs.
Just a quick note on Red Oak Sourcing, our venture with Cardinal Health. We continue to be extremely pleased with
the progress the team is making. They continue to execute very well.
The expertise that Red Oak provides along with the simplicity of the business structure has enabled Red Oak to make
great strides. They've been working with suppliers on strategies that create value for all parties and have now
transitioned nearly all suppliers to Red Oak within a relatively short timeframe. So we couldn't be more pleased with
their performance and results.
And with that let me turn it over to Dave for the financial review.
David M. Denton
Thank you, Larry. Good morning to everyone. Today I'll provide a detailed review of our first quarter results, followed
by an update on our guidance. However before I do that and as I often do, I want to highlight the ways in which we are
using our strong free cash flow to enhance shareholder value through our disciplined capital allocation program. During
the first quarter we paid $399 million in dividends. Our dividend payout ratio now stands at 28.7%. And we remain
well on track to achieve our target of 35% by 2018.
Additionally in January we entered into a $2 billion accelerated share repurchase program. At that time in exchange for
$2 billion we received approximately 16.8 million shares at a price of $94.49 per share, which represented 80% of the
notional amount of the ASR. The program concluded yesterday, and we expect to receive approximately 3 million
shares today, making the average share price of the ASR $100.64 per share. For the full year we still expect to complete
$6 billion of share repurchases.

Page 5 of 17
So between dividends and share repurchases we've returned more than $2 billion to our shareholders in the first quarter
alone. And we continue to expect to return more than $7 billion for the full year, more than a 30% increase over last
year's levels.
As Larry mentioned we generated approximately $1.6 billion of free cash in the first quarter. And we continue to
expect to produce free cash of between $5.9 billion and $6.2 billion this year.
Now turning to the income statement. The adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations came in at $1.14 per
share, $0.05 above our guidance range and up a solid 12.2% over LY. GAAP diluted EPS was $1.07 per share. The
Retail segment performed within expectations, while we saw strong results from the PBM segment, which posted profit
growth above the high end. The outperformance in the quarter was primarily driven by stronger-than-expected
prescription volumes, as well as favorable purchasing and rebate economics in the PBM segment.
On a consolidated basis revenues in the first quarter increased 11.1% to $36.3 billion. In the PBM segment net revenue
growth surpassed expectations, as revenues increased 18.2% to $23.9 billion. This growth was driven by specialty
pharmacy, as well as increased volumes in pharmacy network claims largely from the addition of new clients. Partially
offsetting this growth was an increase in our generic dispensing rates, which grew approximately 150 basis points
versus the same quarter of LY to 83.5%. We saw strength on the top line versus our guidance, due primarily to
higher-than-expected volumes, drug price inflation and mix, including the new Hep C drugs.
In our Retail business revenues increased 2.9% in the quarter to $17 billion at the high end of our guidance. This
growth was driven primarily by solid pharmacy same-store sales growth despite the transition of specialty revenues into
the PBM segment due to Specialty Connect. Higher volumes in the pharmacy were fueled by a strong flu season and an
uptake in 90-day prescriptions.
Now turning to gross margins, we reported 17% for the consolidated company in the quarter, a contraction of
approximately 120 basis points compared to Q1 of 2014 and, again, consistent with our expectations. The decline is
due in part to a mix shift in our business as our lower-margin PBM business is growing faster than our Retail business.
Within the PBM segment, gross margins declined approximately 35 basis points from Q1 of 2014 to 4.3%. This was
primarily driven by price compression, which was partially offset by the improvement in GDR as well as favorable
purchasing and rebate economics.
Despite the decline in gross margin rate, gross profit dollars were up 9.8% year-over-year given volume increases and
mix. Gross margin in the Retail segment was 31.2%, down approximately 20 basis points from LY. The continued
pressure on reimbursement rates as well as the continuing mix shift towards pharmacy were partially offset by a
number of positive factors. These positive factors include a 150 basis point increase in Retail GDR to 84.4%, the
benefit to front store margins from the tobacco exit and the increased store brand penetration. And while gross margin
rates were down, gross profit dollars increased 2.1% in the quarter. Total operating expenses as a percent of revenues
notably improved from Q1 of 2014 to 11.1%.
The PBM segment's SG&A rate improved by approximately 25 basis points to 1.2%, with operating expense dollars
coming in a little lower than expected despite the over-delivery of revenues. As reported, SG&A as a percent of sales in
the Retail segment increased by approximately 20 basis points to 21%. However, the increase continues to be driven by
the reduction in Retail sales, which is directly related to our decision to exit the tobacco category as well as the impact
of Specialty Connect, again shifting sales from our Retail segment to the PBM.
It's important to note that on a comparable basis, SG&A as a percentage of sales at Retail actually improved
approximately 50 basis points. Within the Corporate segment, expenses were essentially flat to LY at $189 million and
lower than expected. Operating margin for the total enterprise declined approximately 35 basis points in the quarter to
5.9%. Operating margin in the PBM declined approximately 10 basis points to 3.1%, while operating margin at Retail
declined by approximately 45 basis points to 10.2%. As Larry noted, Retail operating profit decreased 1.3% in the
quarter and was within our expectations. On a comparable basis, excluding tobacco, Retail operating profit increased
approximately 1.7%. PBM operating profit increased 14%, greatly exceeding our expectations.

So now going below the line on the consolidated income statement, net interest expense in the quarter decreased
approximately $24 million from LY to $134 million, due primarily to lower average interest rates on our debt.
Additionally, our effective tax rate was 38.9%, slightly lower than expected. The tax rate drove less than $0.01 of the
EPS beat. Our weighted average share count was 1.1 billion shares, again in line with our expectations.
So with that, now let me update you on our guidance. I'll focus on the highlights here. You can find the additional
details of our guidance in the slide presentation that we posted on our website earlier this morning. As Larry said, given
our outperformance in the first quarter, we are narrowing our 2015 EPS range by raising the bottom of the range by
$0.03. While we are pleased with where we are year-to-date, it is still very early in the year. Our core business is
performing well.
We now expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share in 2015 in the range of $5.08 to $5.19 per share, reflecting strong
year-over-year growth of 13% to 15.5% after we remove the impact in 2014 related to the loss on the early
extinguishment of debt. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $4.80 to $4.91
per share.
Consolidated net revenue growth is still expected to be 7% to 8.25%; however, we narrowed our top line outlook in the
PBM. We now expect PBM revenue growth of 11.25% to 12.25%, 25 basis points higher than our prior guidance on
the low-end. This revised guidance reflects our expectations for stronger growth within specialty, fueled by a
combination of inflation and new product mix as well as the impact of the higher net new business. We continue to
expect Retail revenue growth of 1.25% to 2.50% year-over-year. And intercompany revenue eliminations are now
expected to be approximately 10.8% of segment revenues.
Given the narrowing of the PBM's top line as well is the favorable purchasing and rebate economics that we've seen,
we are also narrowing guidance for operating profit growth in the PBM segment. We now expect PBM operating profit
to increase 7.75% to 10.75% year-over-year, an increase of 100 basis points on the low-end. Retail operating profit
growth expectations remain in the range of 4.75% to 6.50%. And as I said before, our free cash flow guidance for the
year remains in the range of $5.9 billion to $6.2 billion.
So with that, now let me provide guidance for the second quarter. We expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the
range of $1.17 to $1.20 per share in the second quarter, reflecting growth of 3.25% to 6% versus Q2 of 2014. GAAP
diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $1.10 per share to $1.13 per share in the
second quarter.
Within the Retail segment, we expect revenues to increase 0.5% to 2% versus the second quarter of LY. Adjusted script
comps are expected to increase in the range of 4.25% to 5.25%, while we expect total same-store sales to be down
1.25% to up 0.25%. The impact of the move of specialty scripts to the PBM via Specialty Connect will be very muted
this quarter given that we began this shift in May of last year. Additionally, recall that we expected the tobacco exit to
have approximately 800 basis points negative impact on front store comps in the second quarter. In the PBM, we
expect second quarter revenue growth of between 11.25% and 12.5%, driven by continued strong growth in specialty
and volumes.
We expect Retail operating profit to decrease 2% to 4% and PBM operating profit to increase 5% to 9% in the second
quarter. Keep in mind that margins in last year's second quarter benefited from the finalization of California's Medicaid
reimbursement rates. Recall that this finalization of the benefits benefited Retail gross margins by $53 million in the
quarter and PBM gross margins by $16 million in the quarter.
After removing the impact of that from last year's results, operating profit growth in the PBM would be approximately
200 basis points higher. And on a comparable basis, excluding the California Medicaid impact from last year's results
as well as tobacco, Retail operating profit growth would be approximately 490 basis points higher.
And again, starting with the Analyst Day, over the past several months we have been highlighting several timing
factors that affect the cadence of profit delivery throughout this year. The timing of break-open generics, our tobacco
exits, and the investments that we've made in the PBM's welcome seasons were the factors expected to impact our
cadence the most. And while we delivered a very strong first quarter, the cadence of profit growth is still expected to be

back-half weighted. All things considered, we expect a strong back-half of the year.
So in closing, let me leave you with three key thoughts. First, we posted solid comparable growth this quarter, and
we're off to a very good start for the year. Second, our 2015 outlook for both businesses as well as the enterprise overall
is strong and we continue to benefit from the unique solutions we are delivering to the marketplace. And finally, we
expect to continue to generate significant free cash and we are committed to use this capability to maximize the value
we return to our shareholders through a disciplined capital allocation program.
And so with that, let me turn it back over to Larry.
Larry J. Merlo
Okay, thanks, Dave. And again, we are very pleased with our solid start to the year and our strong competitive position
and our distinctive channel-agnostic solutions are resonating strongly in the marketplace. Before we open up for your
questions, just a couple comments that we've all witnessed the unfortunate events unfold in Baltimore over the last
several days. And I think as you know, we operate countless stores in major cities and urban centers all across the
country.
And despite these acts of violence, we remain committed to these markets. We look forward to working together with
community and business leaders in the rebuilding process. And I want to take a minute and pay a special thanks to our
colleagues who have worked tirelessly this past week to ensure that Baltimore residents continue to have access to
needed medications and prescriptions. I think we're – all of us are very proud of the job that they've been doing in a
very difficult environment.
So with that, let's go ahead and open it up for your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of George Hill, Deutsche
Bank. Go ahead.
<Q - George R. Hill>: Hey. Good morning, Dave and Larry, and thanks for taking the question. I guess where I would
start off first is with the cost containment in SG&A and the PBM has been pretty impressive and the cost cuts are pretty
good. How much room should we think is left there to do considering the growth in the higher-touch specialty
medications and, I guess, how should we think about how much lower SG&A can go?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: George, I'll start and I think Jon will jump in as well. But keep in mind that we had embarked
upon a pretty sizable initiative as part of our platform consolidation that was targeted to deliver well over $200 million
in annual SG&A savings and we have largely completed that initiative. And, obviously, we're always looking to be
more efficient and identify opportunities. And I'll let Jon pick up from there.
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Yeah, George, so the way we're thinking about our cost structure in the PBM is
continuous improvement. So how can we leverage automation, technology, streamline processes to make those
processes more predictable and deliver them faster and at a lower cost. I think specialty is an opportunity as we look
forward. PCSK9s are coming to the market. They're going to be lower cost than typical for the average specialty drugs
in the market today. So we're actually looking at a delivery in a more efficient way than generally specialty which is
higher-touch, higher cost than what we see in mail. So it's – we're continuing to focus on it and we make progress every
year.

<A - Larry J. Merlo>: No, that was for 2015, George, that was a true-up of the 2015 selling season and, as I
mentioned, it's up about $0.5 billion from our update on our fourth quarter call. And there were some late new wins that
got added to 2015 and probably, for the most part, mid-year introductions.
<Q - George R. Hill>: Okay. I wrote that down wrong. And then the adjustment for the California Medicaid comp,
that was combined Retail, PBM? Or just the Retail side?
<A - David M. Denton>: On the Retail side between California and tobacco is about 490 basis points just in Retail,
and it's about 200 basis points as it relates specifically to the PBM in the quarter of operating profit – of operating
profit.

And our next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly, Credit Suisse. Go ahead.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Yeah. Good morning guys. Nice quarter. I wanted to ask a question actually about the PBM
and EBIT growth. I mean you meaningfully exceeded your guidance this quarter. Could you maybe just talk a little bit
more about the drivers outside there relative to your expectation?
And then just a question on the outlook, because you only raised the low end of the outlook in the PBM, as well as for
the company in terms of EPS. Is that just conservatism? Is there something else that we should be thinking about there?
<A - David M. Denton>: Yeah, hey, Ed, this is Dave. Maybe I'll touch upon that. As you know we obviously had a
very solid – we're off to a very solid start of the year, quite frankly in both businesses, and certainly within the PBM
versus our expectations.
Just a couple things. Obviously volumes in the PBM continued to be strong, and we continue to be pleased with that.
Secondly, we've worked hard both from a cost of goods sold perspective in some of the buy-side economics, as well as
the rebate yield has been productive for us. And as you know the vast majority go back to our clients in the form of
lower cost into their pharmacy benefit. And so that has really produced the over-delivery in the first quarter.
As we look through the balance of the year, it is very early. We've gone through a quarter, we've had a great quarter. I
think our core businesses are performing well and nicely. I think there's – as you know we have a philosophy of
looking through the full year. We're still focused on delivering a very solid year. Continually there tends to be shifts in
the marketplace as relate to timing of certain aspects of our business, primarily the introduction of generics. And so
we'll continue to monitor that as time goes on.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Okay great. And just one quick follow up. You did mention reimbursement rate pressure in
the release this quarter. I don't think you typically put it in there. Is there something new or different or more intensive
about that? Or is it just reading too much into that?
<A - David M. Denton>: Yeah, Ed. This is Dave. We continually talk about that. So there's nothing new or unique
about that at this point in time.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Great. Thank you.

<Q - John Edward Heinbockel>: So, Larry, a strategic question. Obviously you have the financial wherewithal to do
a lot of things, but when you think about the footprint in the U.S. versus where you are globally, is there a priority
you'd like to fill in? And I'm thinking different kinds of businesses. But fill in in the U.S. as opposed to accelerate the
global footprint? Or they're of equal priority?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Well, John, I think it – as you know we've talked a lot about – we feel very good about the
opportunities that we still have here domestically. And we've been talking about that for the last couple years. And we
continue to feel good about it.
And as you think about international, again as we've alluded to in the past, we wanted to understand and build some, I
describe it as muscle, in terms of what it takes in terms of being successful as a global operator. And that's what led to
the Brazil decision. And we've been at it about two years now. We've gotten some very good learnings. And I think it's
– any next steps there would be pursued with the same financial discipline that I think we've demonstrated in the past.
<Q - John Edward Heinbockel>: And just going back to the PBM EBIT issue, most of the time here, right in the last
2.5 years you've exceeded expectations. There has been the rare quarter where you haven't, you've been in line. But
have exceeded pretty significantly. And that sort of dovetailed with volume. Is it really sort of that simple that if you
can beat on the volume side, you'll handily beat on the bottom line? And does that speak to I guess the incremental
flow-through margin is simply that high?
<A - David M. Denton>: John, this is Dave. I don't know that that's exactly true. As you know within the PBM
business, obviously volume certainly helps. But there's a lot of factors that drive profitability in that business.
And I'll just take a good example, Medicare Part D. Within our insurance company additional volume in some
categories there actually hurt the profitability from an insurance perspective. So there's a lot of different levers there. I'll
just conclude with saying that we've had a great first quarter. I think our outlook for the year remains extremely strong
within the PBM and quite frankly within Retail.
<Q - John Edward Heinbockel>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Thanks, John.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of David Larsen, Leerink. Please go ahead.
<Q - David M. Larsen>: Hi. Congratulations on a very good quarter. Can you just talk about the 2016 and 2017
selling seasons? Where are you? Is the 2016 selling season, are you largely through it? Have most health plans made
most of their decisions? And what are they looking for this year that's maybe new relative to last year? Thanks.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Dave, it's Larry. I'll go ahead and start, and then I'm sure others will jump in. But, Dave, I think
we've mentioned this in the past that if I start with our renewals, we said that this 2016 renewal season was typical,
recognizing we didn't have the big FEP contract. We said it was around $14 billion to $16 billion. And as I mentioned
in our prepared remarks we're about a third of the way through the renewal process, which is typical at this time of the
year.
I would say the selling season again has gotten off to a solid start. We're seeing RFP activity pretty similar to what it
was last year, which was a big increase over the prior year. Recognizing two years ago I think there was kind of a
lockdown, as people were preparing for all the administrative responsibilities of the Affordable Care Act. So we
certainly have a long way to go in the 2016 selling season. And we'll have a lot more to talk about on the second
quarter call.
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: And, Dave, just to build on what Larry has said – this is Jon – we're through most of the
health plan, large health plan opportunities. Probably halfway through the large employer opportunities. And then you
move into the balance of the market.

And as far as what people are looking for, they're obviously looking for us to be competitive on price, and we have to
be delivering good service to our members and clients. So the fact that we've had two very successful welcome seasons
has helped us from a service reputational standpoint. And obviously we continue to be competitive yet rational on
price.
And then you add to that all the things that we can do that are unique to our model that quite frankly supports our
clients with where healthcare is going. The fact that we've integrated assets and can deliver capabilities like
Maintenance Choice, Specialty Connect, MinuteClinic, our leadership position in specialty. So our ability to manage
specialty spend, not only under the pharmacy benefit and the medical benefit. This this is, as we've talked about, a very
fast growing part of the overall spend.
And then, third, our leadership in consultative services and Medicare Part D. So, yeah, as I'm out talking to clients,
they're looking for somebody that they know can deliver great service, deliver savings. And then all these unique
offerings we bring I think has really had a lot to do with our success. 2017, we're beginning to see some activity in
2017. Again, large health plans, but I'd say we're very, very early with any 2017 opportunities.
<Q - David M. Larsen>: Thanks a lot.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: And, David, I'll just emphasize one other point. We had our Client Forum back in April. We
had record attendance. There was an extremely high level of engagement recognizing, as I mentioned, clients have seen
cost trend go from around 4% to double-digits. So we have – to Jon's point, we have solutions for them. And there was
an awful lot of engagement and education and understanding in terms of what that can specifically mean for their
respective business. So there's certainly a lot of follow-up work from the Client Forum, but I think we feel very good
about the tools and products and services that can be an important part of the solution for our clients.

And our next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler, Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Hey. Thanks for taken my question, and great quarter. I was wondering if there's any update
you can give us on whether Specialty Connect has led to an increase in volume? Are people responding? I know you're
talking about everybody – the customers liking everything you're doing, but can you identify anything specific from
Specialty Connect?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Well, Meredith, if you look at our specialty revenues, we are growing faster than the market,
even after adjusting for Coram. So we believe Specialty Connect is delivering additional share, and it is outperforming
our initial expectations. And we already have more than 50,000 patients, new patients that are utilizing the Specialty
Connect product.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Great. And then I was just wondering if you could talk about what the benefit so far if you've
seen anything from eliminating tobacco? Have you seen a meaningful change in either the partnerships or the dialogue
you're having with physician and hospital groups?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Well, Meredith, the answer to that is, yes. I mean, it's – I've sat in some of those meetings
where we're talking about things we can do and then, historically, the question would come up about, you guys sell
tobacco products, don't you, and it literally would suck all the energy out of the room. So I think it's reflected in the fact
that since the announcement just over a year ago now, we've been able to accelerate the partnerships that have been
established with leading health systems across the country. I think we're approaching 60 of those affiliations and, while
it's a category of one at this point, and it did get some publicity, we've talked about pharmacy networks migrating to
more performance-based networks. And we had one particular client, City of Philadelphia, that decided to – as a
nucleus of that performance network tied around pharmacy providers that do not sell tobacco products. So I think we
see some tangible benefits that they're probably more qualitative than quantitative at this point in time but I think we all

And our next question comes from the line of Priya Ohri-Gupta with Barclays. Go ahead.
<Q - Priya Joy Ohri-Gupta>: Hey, thank you so much for taking the question. Dave, you guys have been pretty clear
about your lease-adjusted leverage target and continue to have come capacity in the balance sheet to manage towards
that. But can you just remind us about sort of how much flexibility you might have around moderating some of your
future share repurchase activity, were you to engage in some sort of strategic activity that might temporarily take you
above that leverage target in order to maintain your current rating?
<A - David M. Denton>: Yeah, hey, that's a great question. We, as you know, have been very focused on our leverage
target at 2.7 times adjusted debt to EBITDA. We currently have been cycling a bit below that target so we have
additional capacity as we sit here today. We, as you know, have continued to have many dialogues with the rating
agencies. We're very focused on maintaining our BBB rating status. We do think we have flexibility, over time, to
move our leverage target if strategically it made sense to be a tad over that as long as we commit to get ourselves back
down to that level. We'll be very focused, over time, to make sure that our balance sheet maintained its leverage target
at 2.7 times and we work aggressively to get there, we think it's important that we maintain that rating.

And the next question is from the line of Lisa Gill, JPMorgan. Go ahead.
<Q - Lisa Christine Gill>: Thank you, and good morning. I just wanted to follow up on a couple of things. First, you
had talked about – earlier, Larry, about the formulary management and the trend there. Can you or Jon just give us any
indication as to the penetration that you have currently with your client base around these kinds of programs, just to get
an idea of how much future opportunity there is?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Yeah, Lisa, that's a great question. And, today, we've got about, probably about half of our
book that is in our formulary program. Now, at the same time, there are – and by the way, that's largely in the employer
space. There are health plans that adopt components of the formulary program. So, I think there is certainly white space
for that to grow and I think as our program continues to evolve and further develop and drive additional savings, I think
that there is already additional dialogue on those programs.
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: And then, Lisa, this is Jon. Larry talked about our trends for 2014 at 12.7%. About 60%
of that trend is really driven by branded inflation, and the best way for our clients to manage overall trend in branded
inflation is through formulary. So we believe the marketplace is going to get much more aggressive. Our clients are
going to get much more aggressive in adopting even more aggressive formulary strategies beyond what they already
have. It's probably the best way to manage their benefit.
<Q - Lisa Christine Gill>: And so would you expect that uptick as we go into 2016? I know, I saw Jon recently, we
talked about your Client Forum and people really focused on where costs are going and what we're seeing as far as
price increases go from the manufacturers. So should we see some kind of inflection in 2016 if you're having the
conversations today? Or is it – you think it's going to be a several-year play out around increase in penetration?

<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Yeah, I mean, Lisa, that's a good question. Yeah, as Larry said, our employers, which is
half our book of business, the vast majority of those, 80% of those have adopted our template formulary strategy that
we introduced back in 2012. So they've actually taken a big step forward and then there are other opportunities for them
to even get more aggressive. With health plans, the majority of our health plans have adopted our Med D formulary
strategies, which again are very tightly controlled. So the market, I think, is primed and I think coming off this
double-digit trend year of 2014, I have never seen people more open to understanding what opportunities they have to
manage.
And as I said, formulary is going to be a big part of that. So we're talking to people now. I think we'll see – I do think
it's going to take a few years to play out, just like everything in our space, so I don't know that there's going to be a
single inflection point. But I do very strongly believe that this is going to be a significant lever for our clients to
manage this trend.
<Q - Lisa Christine Gill>: And if I could just understand, Dave, on the – if you think about – you called out rebates in
the first quarter. If I remember correctly, it's usually on a lag. So should we expect rebates to get better as we move
throughout the year based on the programs that Jon's talking about? Just trying to figure out the timing. So the rebates
we saw in the first quarter, was that primarily from things you initiated in the back-half of 2015? And is that part of the
driver for the back-half results? And then I'll stop there.
<A - David M. Denton>: Yeah, Lisa, that's a great question. I'm not going to get into too much detail there, I will just
tell you that as we think about the long-term view of our business, we've been very focused on – from a buy-side
economics perspective what can we do to further reduce the cost to our clients and think about that as our procurement
efforts around generics. And then secondly, how do we reduce cost and continue to control costs in the branded
category and that continues to be a focus from a rebates perspective in the formulary management. I expect those to be
continued to be drivers for this business at some level in the longer term.
<Q - Lisa Christine Gill>: Okay, great. Congratulations on a great quarter.
<A - David M. Denton>: Thank you.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Thanks, Lisa.
Operator
And the next question comes from the line of Robert Jones, Goldman Sachs. Go ahead.
<Q - Robert P. Jones>: Thanks for the questions. I guess maybe just move over to the Retail side. David, I know you
walked through the Retail gross margin pushes and pulls in your prepared remarks, so I wanted to make sure I
understood the dynamics in the quarter, especially relative to your full year guidance for this margin to be flat. So I
know tobacco would have been a good guy year-over-year for the margin, so I was hoping you could maybe just walk
through again what weighed on the margin in the quarter? Was there anything abnormal with pharmacy reimbursement,
promotional activities? Just looking for a little bit more insight there.
<A - David M. Denton>: No, I don't think there's anything that's really unique in the quarter from that perspective. As
we've said many times is that the cadence of profit delivery would be back-half weighted versus front-half weighted,
and most of that ties to obviously the tobacco exit and how we overlapped that, the California Medicaid comparison in
Q2 of 2014, but probably more importantly the delivery of break-open generics and the timing of that, driven really
more back-half weighted versus front-half weighted.
<Q - Robert P. Jones>: Okay. And then just one more on the timing, technical side, I was wondering if there was
anything between 1Q and 2Q that maybe pulled 1Q up as far as the timing around EPS? I know the force of that
headwind from the California Medicaid reimbursement benefit a year ago will make 2Q a little bit worse off, but
anything else that we should be aware of as far as timing between 1Q and 2Q?
<A - David M. Denton>: No, I don't think there's anything of any material nature there.

And our next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin, Wolfe Research. Go ahead.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions. So I wanted to follow up a little bit on John
Heinbockel's question on – but a little bit different take on it, not necessarily acquisitions. But, kind of, looking
internally, Larry, when you look at opportunities in front of you with your current assets, where do you think there is
the biggest potential to, kind of, improve what you're already doing? I mean, obviously, the business is humming along,
but where do you see some of the levers to get things even better?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Well, Scott, we're always looking to do better whether it's to be more efficient with our
business in terms of attempting to deliver high levels of service at the lowest possible cost and we're always focused on
opportunities there. And we continue to be focused on share growth opportunities. And I think we've gotten some
tractions in terms of some of the things that we've been able to do through our partnerships, whether it's with health
plans or other providers. Obviously there's a lot we can do when we happen to be the PBM but those opportunities are
not limited to employers or health plans where we have to be the PBM and we've gotten some traction there.
<A - David M. Denton>: Hey, Scott, this is Dave. We talked – we've been talking a lot on the call about the PBM and
some of the growth engines around pharmacy, maybe we'll just spend a minute, I'll ask Helena to talk a bit about what
we're doing to drive growth in the front of our business, the Retail business.
<A - Helena B. Foulkes>: Yeah, I think that one of the things that I'm encouraged by and it goes back to Meredith's
question as well is, since we announced our exit of tobacco, I think the marketplace is seeing the real focus that we
have around driving health and beauty, and we talked about this at the Analyst Day in December, but the journey that
we're on to really reposition ourselves as a leading health and beauty destination. So when we met in December, we
talked about five key themes as part of that growth, one was better health made easy, elevating beauty, our customer
driven personalization, myCVS store and digital innovation and I'm really pleased we're making a lot of progress on
each of these areas. Just a couple of examples, this year we're launching phase one of our healthy food rollout, so we've
got expanded fresh offerings and healthy snacks.
We also have a beauty elevation program which is launching across several thousand stores this year and really there
we're in the process of repositioning CVS as the leader in beauty, we've always had a leading market share but we're
really sort of doubling down on the in-store experience and differentiating for our customers. We talk a lot about
personalization, Larry mentioned it in his speech, but I think there's even more opportunity there to grow share and be
more relevant for consumers and ultimately drive traffic and profitable sales. And then we have a focus this year, we're
refitting 500 stores with something we call [ph] take high higher (57:55), and these take several of these elements
together. We have expanded beauty, we've got this healthy food set. And so this really starts to take the old photo
department out and put in healthy food and give customers a very different feel. Those stores are performing well.
We've also within this myCVS store piece really been looking at different clusters. And I think the thing that we're very
excited about is the Hispanic dominant cluster. We're starting to learn from our Navarro experience. And we've actually
started to reset some CVS stores to take those learnings into place.
And then we continue to invest in digital and innovation. See a lot of opportunity as Larry mentioned there to drive
adoption and have people using both our stores and digital assets.
So a lot of things happening that we really haven't talked about so much since December Analyst Day, but I think I'm
really proud of the team. I think both the merchants and the operators have a very strong focus on how we want to be
unique and different and really own health and beauty.

And the next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette, UBS. Go ahead.
<Q - Steven J. Valiquette>: All right, thanks. Hi. Good morning.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Morning, Steve.
<Q - Steven J. Valiquette>: How are you, Dave? So I guess just for me the – obviously the 46% revenue growth in 1Q
in specialty is pretty impressive. How do you think that stacks up versus your estimation of industry growth in specialty
pharmacy in early 2015? And also beyond Hep C are there any other therapeutic categories worth mentioning that were
growth drivers?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Well, Steve, we actually see it outperforming the market growth. And I think as I mentioned
earlier in one of the questions, even after adjusting for Coram's – acknowledging that Coram was not comparable for
the full quarter. I think we closed towards the end of January. So we're pleased with the results that we're seeing. And
some of it's coming from new customer growth. Some of it's coming from our unique products. And I'll ask Jon to
comment on therapeutic classes.
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Yeah. What we have seen over the last three years is over 100 new indications for
existing specialty drugs. So we're seeing growth really across all categories. Obviously Hep C is the poster child for
growth. But we're seeing growth in RA and oncology as an example.
And the other factor is as the population gets older, the older population uses six times as many specialty drugs as the
balance of the population. So we're just seeing really tremendous growth across the entire spectrum of specialty. And
that's going to be fueled even further by new drug introductions, 88 new drugs over the last three years. We're going to
see the PCSK9s be introduced later this year.
While we think that's going to be a slow ramp, we think one in four people that are on statins today could be candidates
for these new therapies that are quite frankly more expensive than the generic statins that are available today. So we
really view specialty as a growth driver as we look forward.
<A - David M. Denton>: And, Steve, I'll just conclude this question a bit with just maybe just a data point. As you said
specialty in the first quarter grew by about 40% – 46%. It's not just Hep C. If you take away Hep C, and you look at our
underlying growth in specialty, it's in the mid-30s%. So we continued to perform well at the core in this business.
<Q - Steven J. Valiquette>: Okay that's helpful. The one quick tie-in to this, I forgot if you disclosed this at the
Analyst Day or not, but within the PBM, I forgot. Are you disclosing just a rough range of what percent of the total
PBM sales that you categorize as specialty? I'm guessing it's somewhere maybe in the 20%, 25% range. But is that just
a good approximation?
<A - David M. Denton>: There is a chart in Jon Roberts's presentation and/or Alan Lotvin's presentation that shows
that number, last year's number, which I believe is around...
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: $31 billion, Steve.
<A - David M. Denton>: $31 billion moving to $37 billion was our expectations for this year.
<Q - Steven J. Valiquette>: Got it.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: And, Steve, just to add onto that, because those are a couple important slides. We talked about
the addressable specialty market. We described it as excluding infused oncology. And I think in 2014 we estimated that
market at $86 billion, growing to more than $150 billion by 2018. So we see a lot of opportunity for growth, even
without including the oncology space.

And our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser, Morgan Stanley. Go ahead.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: Yeah hi. Good morning and thank you for taking my question. I have two follow up
questions here. First of all about the membership growth, the script growth. Obviously very strong claim growth. What
percent of the growth is coming from your PBM members?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Ricky, are you talking about on the Retail side?
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: No, I'm talking about pharmacy network claims.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Yeah. Ricky, maybe we're not following the question, because we would...
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: So I...
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: [ph] Not quite as asking if... (63:32)
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: I think that in the past you kind of like you gave some details on Caremark membership
accounting for 34% or 35% of your pharmacy scripts.
<A - David M. Denton>: Yeah.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: So when you think about kind of like the growth that you've seen year-over-year, obviously
it's pretty impressive. What percent of it is coming from kind of like your PBM clients?
<A - David M. Denton>: Yeah.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: I was trying to assess kind of like the share gains within Caremark versus the rest of the
market?
<A - David M. Denton>: Yeah. Yeah. We kind of report that on an annual basis, because we monitor it, but we report
on an annual basis. Because when we win a client typically we then – the work begins in the sense of understanding
how to help that client become more productive and manage their costs better. And part of that might be narrowing or –
introducing a product and/or narrowing a network into one of our channels. And so that kind of grows over time. So
we've chosen to do that on an annual basis because of that.
I will say just from a Caremark perspective, one thing that we do disclose, and you can see it in the press release and
you'll also see it in the Q later today, is that we do talk about just the network claims volumes that we process on a
quarterly basis. And so you can see that kind of within those releases.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: But, Ricky, we had shown in the past that if you looked at on the Retail side of the business, if
you looked at the script growth and the share growth, about half of it was coming from the Caremark book of business
and the balance from the rest of the marketplace.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: Okay that's very helpful. And then one follow up on the specialty side. When you think
about kind of like your membership, what percent of your PBM clients manage their specialty spend through you? And
what percent carving out? Just to kind of like understand the opportunity there in terms of penetration?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Yeah, Ricky, it's about – today it's about 60%.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: Okay. And that's 60% of the employers or 60% of the total?

And our next question comes from the line of Mark Wiltamuth, Jefferies. Go ahead.
<Q - Mark G. Wiltamuth>: Hi. Good morning. I wanted to dig in a little bit on the generic drug margin swing factors
you see over the next couple years. And maybe if you could let us know how you feel relative to your December
analyst pronouncements, because it seems like Nexium launched earlier than you expected. And I'm curious where you
stand on Abilify, and just in general, how you're feeling about the break-open pipeline?
<A - David M. Denton>: Mark, this is Dave. I think obviously as we discussed a little bit earlier, the generic launch
dates continue to, obviously, move around a little bit. I'll just characterize this, it's not a matter of if these drugs are
going to be productive for us from a break-open status, it's just more an issue of when they become productive for us
from a generic break-open status. Our main thesis, as we talked about kind of the three categories of drugs, be it
branded drugs, limited-supply generics, and break-open generics, our thesis over the long-term continues to hold as you
increase both savings to customers and clients when you move down that spectrum but also increase profitability to us
as you move down that spectrum.
<Q - Mark G. Wiltamuth>: Okay. And just on generics, maybe give us an update on Red Oak. You said you'd
transfer the sourcing over to Red Oak, and where do you stand on, I guess, achieving cost savings there?
<A - David M. Denton>: That's a great question. We have transitioned all of that into Red Oak. We now have virtually
all of our generic manufacturers on our program. And we continue to be very excited about where we are but also the
opportunity over time to continue to drive value from that program. But kind of beyond that, we don't disclose much
more than that from a buy-side perspective.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Mark, I'd just reiterate, we've talked about this, the three ways in which value is extracted from
Red Oak. One is the fixed payment schedule from Cardinal, which began in Q4 of last year. The second ability is
through some established achievement of milestones that have been established between the two parents. And then the
third is just further reductions in our overall cost of product. So – and as Dave mentioned, we've kind of – we've framed
it up under that umbrella, but we haven't gotten more granular.
<Q - Mark G. Wiltamuth>: And on that third point on the achieving of actual cost savings, is that something that
ramps over like a two-year to three-year period, or does it happen pretty quickly?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Well, Mark, you're never done, okay, in terms of how to make the supply chain more efficient.
So I think it's something that will be ongoing.
<Q - Mark G. Wiltamuth>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Okay, thanks. We'll take one more question, please.

And our final question comes from the line of Ross Muken, Evercore. Go ahead.
<Q - Ross Muken>: Thanks, guys. I'm going to ask a big picture question to close. So, Larry, lots going on in your
industry. So one of your competitors is attempting to mimic your model at a smaller scale. Another one of your

competitors is moving more in the direction of retail and beauty. And one of your PBM competitors was acquired,
another is declaring its independence. As you think about CVS's positioning and strategy and how you continue to
evolve the model, what are the things you're kind of looking for as the industry changes to kind of give you further
confirmation that the share gains you've enjoyed are sort of sustainable and that you have all the assets and the pieces
you need to continue to do what you've done, which is put up tremendous results for many years here?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Ross, you did a really good job of summarizing the marketplace. But, we have always believed
that the integrated PBM, Retail model, we think is the optimal model and I think that gets further highlighted by the
fact that we're entering an era of, we've been describing as the retailization of healthcare, others are talking about it in
terms of an era of consumer-directed healthcare. And you think about our model, it's really the only one that has deep
connections and expertise in dealing with both payers of healthcare as well as consumers of healthcare. And we've
talked about and reiterated it on the call today, all the different ways in which we can help solve this cost quality access
conundrum that our healthcare system faces. I think as I mentioned earlier, we believe that we're in a great place and, at
the same time, we're always looking for ways that we can be more efficient and speak to payers and customers in a
more surround-sound fashion and I think we see opportunities domestically to continue to do that.
<Q - Ross Muken>: Great. Thanks, guys.
Larry J. Merlo
Okay, thanks, everyone, for your ongoing interest in CVS. And as always, if you have and follow up questions, you can
