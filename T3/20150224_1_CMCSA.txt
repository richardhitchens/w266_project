Brian L. Roberts
Thanks, Jason, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today.
It's an honor to lead this wonderful company, and 2014 was no exception. As you'll see, we made very strong progress.
Last year was a great year strategically, operationally, and financially. As our history has shown, we take prudent risks
and invest for profitable growth. Overall, we grew revenue 6.4% in 2014 and operating cash flow by 6.9%. We
generated over $8 billion in free cash flow and increased cash return to shareholders by 64%; all in all, a terrific year.
As we reviewed these results and outlook with our board, we made the decision to raise our dividend by 11%, marking
the seventh consecutive annual increase. We've also increased our stock repurchase authorization to $10 billion, and we
plan to repurchase $4.25 billion of stock in 2015. In addition, following the close of the Time Warner Cable merger and
related divestiture transactions, we intend to add in excess of $5 billion in incremental buybacks to this share
repurchase total.
It's an incredible time in media and technology and for Comcast in particular. There's no shortage of change occurring
in the competitive landscape, the breakneck pace of innovation, and shifts in the regulatory climate we must navigate.
That's why I keep coming back to how proud I am of the team's focus and execution in 2014. So let's talk about some
of their achievements.
In Cable, we had another strong year of profitable growth. We increased revenue 5.5% and operating cash flow 5.3%.
We added 358,000 customer relationships, a 67% improvement compared to the prior year, and product innovation
continues at a very rapid pace. We believe we have the absolute best products on the market thanks to our X1 platform,
our content lineup, Cloud DVR, the fastest in-home Wi-Fi, voice control remotes, and the list goes on. 2014 was a year
in which we started to take these great new products to scale. The reaction to X1 from customers has been fantastic,
resulting in lower churn, more outlets connected, and an increase in overall viewership, led primarily by higher
on-demand and DVR consumption. And it's bearing fruit in our operating results, as video subscriber trends were the
best in seven years.
In Broadband, we added over 1 million subscribers for the ninth year in a row and now have a Wi-Fi network that
includes over 8 million hot spots. In addition, Business Services remains a critical and profitable growth driver for us,
with revenue increasing 22% in 2014 off of a large base and ending the year at over a $4 billion revenue run rate.
At NBCUniversal, the magnitude of the improvement has exceeded all of our expectations, and the acquisition has
already proven to be one of the best in our company's history. Operating cash flow is up about 80% since we first
announced the deal. And 2014 was another year of strong progress, as we grew revenue by 7.5% and operating cash
flow by over 18%.
In Broadcasting, we generated over $730 million in operating cash flow, which more than doubled year over year. The
network maintained its number one ranking in primetime and saw terrific success in The Voice, Blacklist, and Sunday
Night Football, as well as the highly successful launch of the new Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and, of course,
the Sochi Olympics, which spanned our broadcast and cable networks and was highly integrated into our cable
technology platforms, really demonstrating the unique capabilities of our combined company. And we're thrilled to
have extended our rights deal with the International Olympic Committee in a deal that will make NBCUniversal the
home to the Olympics through the year 2032.
Speaking of Cable Networks, they remain our largest source of operating cash flow at NBCUniversal and demonstrated
another year of growth thanks to a diversified portfolio across sports, news, and entertainment. USA and Bravo are
both top-10 networks, with USA ending the year at number one in total viewers for the ninth year in a row, and we
successfully launched CNBC Prime. There's no doubt that times are changing for Cable Networks, but we believe our
portfolio of channels is well positioned.
In Film, Universal Pictures produced the most profitable result in its over 100-year history on the success of Neighbors,
Ride Along, Lucy, and Unbroken, amongst others. The team, including Jeff Shell and Ron Meyer and Donna Langley,
have done a terrific job.

And last but certainly not least, we had a terrific year with our theme parks. We grew revenues 17% and accelerated
our growth every quarter during the year, pacing at nearly 30% in the fourth quarter thanks to the enormous success of
our new Harry Potter attractions in Orlando and the tremendous demand for Halloween Horror Nights in both Orlando
and Hollywood.
Now turning to 2015 and beyond, obviously there has been a lot of discussion around broadband and the regulatory
environment. So let me just say that our past comments on the unnecessary risks associated with applying 1930s style
regulations to something as dynamic as the Internet remain the same. We are absolutely for a free and open Internet.
We even agree on what President Obama and Chairman Wheeler say should be in the rules, transparency,
non-discrimination, no blocking, no throttling, and no paid prioritization. And we've been consistent in communicating
our agreement with those principles.
The disagreement boils down to what legal authority the FCC should use to put in place these rules. We think that Title
II regulation is antiquated and has real downsides. So our attention, just like everyone else, is on the actual text of the
order, the upcoming vote, the strength of forbearance, and ultimately the commission's focus on preservation of
incentives for the private sector to continue to invest aggressively in broadband.
Let's not lose sight of the fact that Comcast NBCUniversal is a wonderfully dynamic and diversified company,
uniquely positioned at the intersection of media and technology, and we're off to a good start in 2015.
In Cable, we are aligned around a few critical top priorities. The first is to transform the customer experience. In short,
we want customer service to be our best product. We have not always lived up to that. But if we can reinvent and
improve customer service, we can make it easier for our customers to experience what we are confident is the best
platform and the best content on the fastest network. We will continue to push the pace of innovation in Cable, and we
will also remain focused on preparation for the integration of Time Warner Cable. We're excited about the merger and
our ability to add value to customers and shareholders through the acquisition. Our integration planning is on schedule
as we continue to work towards regulatory approval.
At NBCUniversal, we feel great about our media portfolio. In Broadcast, we're off to a strong start, most recently airing
the Super Bowl to the highest ratings in history, and SNL's amazing 40th celebration. We're excited about several new
launches, including A.D. and Odyssey on NBC and Dig and The Royals on our cable networks, as well as the return of
NASCAR.
Our 2015 film slate is off to a terrific start with Fifty Shades of Grey, and the rest of the year is packed with exciting
releases, including Fast 7, Minions, Jurassic World, Pitch Perfect 2, and Ted 2, just to name some.
In parks, the new attraction pipeline is robust, especially in Hollywood, with Fast & Furious and Harry Potter. We are
continuing our work on a very large theme park in China. So altogether, this is an exciting time at Comcast, and we're
looking forward to another great year.
Michael?
Michael J. Angelakis
Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone.
As you can see from our results, 2014 was a year of outstanding financial and strategic performance for the company.
And we are very pleased with our fourth quarter and full-year results, which demonstrate consistent execution, a focus
on profitable growth, and the fundamental strength of our businesses. Let's review our performance for 2014 in more
detail and begin with our consolidated financial results on slide four.
For the full year, consolidated revenue increased 6.4% to $68.8 billion and operating cash flow increased 6.9% to $22.9
billion, reflecting healthy organic growth in both our Cable and NBCUniversal businesses. For comparison purposes,
when you exclude the $1.1 billion of revenue and $105 million of operating cash flow generated by the Sochi Olympics

in the first quarter, the $237 million of year-to-date transaction-related expenses, and the pension termination costs in
2013, our consolidated revenue increased a healthy 4.7%, and our consolidated operating cash flow grew 7.2%.
For the full year, our earnings per share increased 25% to $3.20 per share. However, excluding adjustments, our
earnings per share increased 18.6% to $2.93 per share. Free cash flow for 2014 modestly decreased 3.8% to $8.2
billion, and free cash flow per share decreased 2.2% to $3.12 per share, as our growth in consolidated operating cash
flow was offset by increased capital investment and cash taxes as well as increased working capital related to additional
spending for our film and TV production.
Now let's review the results of our individual businesses, starting with Cable Communications on slide five. Cable
Communications delivered another year of strong financial results and customer metrics. Revenue increased 6.1% in
the fourth quarter and grew 5.5% for the full year to $44.1 billion, reflecting solid growth in our residential business,
driven by strong high-speed data results, continued strength in Business Services, and higher advertising revenue,
fueled by political spending.
Total revenue per customer relationship and our total number of customer relationships are two important metrics that
we use to evaluate our business, and we are pleased with the positive trend in our results. Our objective is to focus on
profitable growth by striking the right balance between financial growth and customer growth, and 2014 was no
exception. Total revenue per customer relationship reached $140 per month in the fourth quarter, a nearly 5% increase
that reflects a higher contribution from Business Services, customers upgrading to higher levels of service, customers
subscribing to additional products, and rate adjustments. During the year, we increased customer relationships by
358,000, a 67% improvement over the additions in 2013, and bringing our total number of customer relationships to
more than 27 million.
We also continue to focus on bundling our products to provide the most value to our customers. At year-end, 69% of
our customers subscribed to two or more products, and 37% subscribed to three products, compared to 35% at year-end
last year. We have an intensified focus on customer retention, growing our customer relationships, and driving our
value-added bundling strategy, and our results reflect these approaches.
With the assistance of our best-in-class X1 platform and industry-leading TV Everywhere and on-demand services, we
continued our positive momentum with our video product. During the fourth quarter, we added 6,000 video customers,
the third time we have gained video customers in the last five quarters. For the full year, we reduced video losses by
27% to 194,000, the best result in seven years and during a period where the competitive environment has greatly
expanded and intensified.
In high-speed Internet, we added 375,000 new customers in the fourth quarter and 1.3 million for the full year, the ninth
year in a row that we've added more than 1 million high-speed Internet customers. Our investments in our network and
CPE are proving successful, as our customers are recognizing the value we offer with speed enhancements, the fastest
in-home Wi-Fi, and our growing Wi-Fi footprint.
Voice also remains a valuable component of the bundle. And we continue to grow our voice customer base, adding
123,000 new customers in the fourth quarter and 470,000 for the full year. The slowdown in voice net additions
reflected the X1 availability that was specifically focused on triple play customers in 2013, making for a somewhat
difficult comparison.
In reviewing our product categories in more detail, video revenue increased 1.2% for the full year, reflecting modest
rate adjustments and an increasing number of customers subscribing to advanced services. High-speed Internet revenue
increased 9.5% for the year, reflecting continued growth in our customer base, rate adjustments, and an increasing
number of customers taking higher speed services. At year end, 58% of our residential high-speed Internet customers
received speeds of at least 50 megabits, a meaningful increase compared to 2013.
With regard to Voice, revenue increased 0.4% for the full year, as growth in the customer base was largely offset by a
modest decline in ARPU.

Business Services was again a large contributor to cable revenue growth, with revenue increasing 21.9% for the full
year to $4 billion. The majority of that revenue is generated by small businesses with less than 20 employees, but the
contribution from mid-sized businesses is rapidly increasing and accounted for nearly 40% of Business Services
revenue growth for the year. Business Services continues to have positive momentum and represents a large and
attractive opportunity for the company.
As I mentioned previously, cable advertising also performed well, as fourth quarter revenue increased 18.9% and
full-year revenue increased 11.5%, including political revenue of $110 million in the fourth quarter and $224 million
for the full year. Excluding the impact from political, core cable advertising revenue increased 4.4% during the quarter
and 3.5% for the full year.
Please refer to slide six. Full-year 2014 Cable Communications operating cash flow increased 5.3% to $18.1 billion,
resulting in a stable margin of 41% as we continued to effectively manage higher programming costs and absorbed
additional expenses to support an accelerated deployment of X1, Cloud DVR, and wireless gateways to our customers,
as well as the continued investment in new business areas. Programming expenses increased 7.8%, slightly below our
original estimates but nonetheless reflecting meaningful increases in retransmission consent fees, higher sports
programming costs, and step-ups for certain long-term agreements.
As we look to 2015, we expect program expense to grow at a similar level to 2014's growth, driven by continued
increases in retransmission consent fees and higher sports programming costs. In addition, we continue to be very
proactive in expanding our rights to our on-demand and TV Everywhere platforms. We believe we are leading the
industry by offering the most robust on-demand and TV Everywhere services, providing us with a meaningful
competitive advantage. We once again believe that we have appropriately planned for these programming expense
increases in 2015 and are confident we can effectively offset these costs. As a result, we expect to maintain relatively
stable margins during 2015.
To wrap up the Cable segment, our growth in overall performance in 2014 clearly demonstrates that we are executing
well and competing effectively with our innovative products and services that provide a great value to our customers.
We are focused on improving the customer experience, having a best-in-class innovative product, and continuing to
deliver strong financial and customer results.
Now let's move on to NBCUniversal's results, which are highlighted on slide seven. NBCUniversal delivered
impressive results in 2014, as full-year revenue increased 7.5% and operating cash flow increased 18.1%. Excluding
any impact from the Sochi Olympics, NBCUniversal revenue increased 2.9% and operating cash flow grew 15.3%,
which was driven by strong results at Broadcast Television, Filmed Entertainment, and Theme Parks, as well as solid
results at Cable Networks.
Now let's review the individual segments at NBCUniversal. For the full year 2014, Cable Networks generated revenue
of $9.6 billion, an increase of 3.9%. Excluding the Olympics, revenue increased 1.1%, driven by a 4.6% increase in
distribution revenue. If adjusted for the closure of the Style Network, distribution revenue would have increased 6% for
the year. This revenue increase was partially offset by a 3.5% decline in advertising revenue, as increases in price and
volume were impacted by ratings declines. However, when adjusted for the closure of Style and the movement of
Fandango from Cable Networks to our Film group, the Cable Networks advertising revenue would have essentially
been flat. Cable Networks operating cash flow increased 2.5% to $3.6 billion in 2014. And excluding the Olympics,
operating cash flow increased 2.2%, as the increase in distribution revenue and cost controls was offset by advertising
pressure and our continued investment in original and sports programming costs.
With regards to our Broadcast Television segment, full-year 2014 revenue increased 20% to $8.5 billion. And operating
cash flow increased from $345 million in 2013 to $734 million in 2014, driven by growth in advertising revenue,
retransmission consent fees, and content licensing revenue. Excluding the impact of the Olympics, revenue increased
8.1% and operating cash flow increased $272 million or 78.6%. Advertising revenue increased 4.6% for the full year
and 3.1% for the fourth quarter. These results reflect the success of our primetime lineup and the highest CPMs we
secured during the upfronts as well as our impressive performance in late night.

Moving to Filmed Entertainment, 2014 revenue decreased 8.2% to $5 billion, reflecting a decline in theatrical and
home entertainment revenue due to difficult comparisons with the strong performance of Despicable Me 2 in the
second half of 2013. Despite the difficult revenue comparisons to last year, full-year 2014 operating cash flow
increased 47.3% to $711 million, driven by the very successful 2014 film slate, with the majority of the films delivering
strong cash-on-cash returns and the successful carryover performance of the 2013 slate.
Switching to our Theme Park segment, 2014 was a terrific year. Full-year revenue increased 17.3% to $2.6 billion and
operating cash flow grew 16.4% to $1.2 billion. Even more impressive, fourth quarter revenue increased 29.9% and
operating cash flow grew 37.6%, driven by the continued success of Orlando's Harry Potter, Hollywood's Despicable
Me, and the success of Halloween Horror Nights at both parks.
Let's move to slide eight to review our consolidated and segment capital expenditures. We strongly believe that
operational excellence and strategic differentiation drive profitable growth and shareholder value, so we have an
operating strategy that is execution focused and a financial strategy that is focused on risk-adjusted investment returns.
Our strategies support these goals by investing in our businesses where there are attractive opportunities, maintaining a
strong balance sheet, and providing consistent and sustainable return of capital to shareholders. Our top priority
remains generating strong and sustainable returns by investing in our businesses. In both Cable and NBCUniversal, we
are investing to strengthen our competitive positions and to support attractive organic growth opportunities.
As we had planned, 2014 capital expenditures were $7.4 billion compared to $6.6 billion in 2013, reflecting increased
investments at Cable and slightly higher spending at NBCUniversal. At Cable Communications, full-year capital
expenditures increased $751 million to $6.2 billion, equal to 13.9% of Cable revenue and in line with the plan we
outlined at the beginning of the year. This increase primarily reflects higher spending on CPE, including the
deployments of X1, Cloud DVR, and wireless gateways, continued investment in network infrastructure to ensure our
leadership in video and high-speed Internet, as well as continued investment to expand Business Services and launch
new services such as XFINITY Home.
We are very pleased with the success of the X1 rollout. We have completed year one of a three-year plan to roll it out
to a majority of our customers, and at year end X1 accounted for nearly half of our video connects. Even as our X1
customer base expands, now representing a quarter of our triple play base, the customer benefits we have previously
highlighted continue. More customers are subscribing to DVRs in more additional outlets. There is increased video
on-demand usage, and we continue to see reduced voluntary churn levels among these X1 customers. Based on these
positive customer results and strong returns, we will continue to aggressively deploy X1 in 2015.
In addition to X1, we plan to continue the deployment of Cloud DVR to our entire base, deploy additional wireless
gateways to enable our customers to receive the fastest in-home Wi-Fi, and continue to invest to expand Business
Services. As a result, our 2015 Cable capital investment plan represents a growth-oriented strategy that will generate
attractive returns. It will modestly increase it to approximately 14.5% of Cable revenue.
At NBCUniversal, capital expenditures increased $61 million or 5.3% to $1.2 billion during 2014, primarily reflecting
increased investments in theme parks. In 2015, NBCUniversal's capital investment plan remained relatively stable at
2014's level, with over half directed to our Theme Park segment as we continue to invest in attractions, including Harry
Potter and the Fast & Furious attractions in Hollywood and a King Kong attraction in Orlando. Investments in our
theme parks are clearly generating strong returns as we drive increased attendance and per capita spending. We are
transforming our parks into must-see destinations and are very enthusiastic about their potential.
Please refer to slide nine. As we have said in the past, we remain committed to delivering a consistent and sustainable
return of capital to shareholders through a combination of dividends and buybacks. In 2014, we returned a majority of
our free cash flow, or over $6.5 billion, to shareholders, including $2.3 billion in dividends and $4.25 billion in share
repurchases.
Earlier today we announced our 2015 financial strategy, including an 11% increase in our dividend to $1.00 per share
on an annualized basis, an increase in our stock repurchase program authorization to $10 billion, and a plan to
repurchase $4.25 billion of our shares, consistent with our 2014 share repurchase plan. Our 2015 share repurchase plan

includes the remaining $1.25 billion of the $2.5 billion buyback we committed to repurchasing before the close of the
Time Warner Cable transaction.
Our expectation today is that when the series of transactions with Time Warner Cable and Charter close, we will
generate additional liquidity. As we have previously stated, we are committed to a leverage-neutral transaction,
meaning that any excess capacity that results from the cash proceeds and debt reduction will be returned to
shareholders and will be in addition to the 2015 repurchase plan announced today. Our current expectation is that the
additional return of capital will be in excess of $5 billion, and that this is in addition to the value of the Greatland
Connections and Charter equity distributed in the spinoff. We will provide more specific details following the
completion of the Time Warner Cable merger and the divestiture transactions.
In the meantime, we are very focused on regulatory approvals and remain optimistic that the deal will close in early
2015. We continue to make great progress with the integration planning of the Time Warner Cable merger and related
divestiture transactions, remain excited about the opportunities and the value they will create for our customers and our
shareholders.
In summary, 2014 was a successful year for the company. In an environment with plenty of room for distraction, our
teams across the company remained focused on execution, and it shows in the results. As we begin 2015, we are
optimistic and feel confident about our ability to execute, our financial strength, and our positive operating momentum.
Now let me turn the call over to Jason for Q&A.
Jason S. Armstrong
Thank you, Michael. Regina, let's open up the call for Q&A, please.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America
Merrill Lynch. Please go head.
<Q - Jessica Jean Reif Cohen>: Thank you, I have two questions. The first is an NBCUniversal question. You've had
such a stunning turnaround, as Brian mentioned. I was just wondering if Brian or Steve could talk about what some of
the biggest levers are over the next three years. And have you changed your views at all on Cable Network upside?
<A - Stephen B. Burke>: So we're very – NBCUniversal is a very diversified company. We're in really 15 different
businesses. And obviously, some of the businesses will be running from a financial point of view and some of the
businesses will be not running as much. Right now what's really running are the theme parks, broadcast. The movie
business is on a roll, and it looks like that roll can continue with a very, very strong slate in 2015. But we still think
there's a lot of upside. Our OCF is up something like 75% since we did the deal four years ago, and we still believe that
we have significant upside, and that upside resides in a lot of our businesses. But right now, I think one of the big
drivers is theme parks, and film is a driver as well.
In terms of the Cable Network business, I think what we're finding, and it's true of the entire industry, is that the ratings
pressure is greater than it was a year or two ago, which means it's going to be a tougher business to grow. We still think
it is a growable business. It's a very healthy business. You've got a lot of different revenue streams. You've got affiliate
fees. You've got SVOD. You have international. You have other digital businesses in addition to the advertising. But
whereas that was a double-digit growth business, I think it's probably more a single-digit growth business in the future.
Still a good business, but the growth prospects, as we mentioned in the last call, are unlikely to be as good in the next
five years as they've been in the last five. But as a whole, we feel very comfortable that NBCUniversal is a segment of
Comcast that has tremendous growth potential in the future.

<Q - Jessica Jean Reif Cohen>: Great. And then my second question was just on the buyback, can you maybe give us
a little more color on why – we understand that you're going to come back with an incremental buyback post the deal,
but why no underlying increase in 2015? I mean, our estimate is that you'll be levered at roughly 1.6 times with the new
buyback adjusting for CapEx, the increased CapEx. So how should we think about your views on leverage, and why
hold back?
<A - Michael J. Angelakis>: I think our target leverage has not changed for a long time, Jessica. We've said we would
like our target leverage to be between 1.5 and 2 times, and it would take us quite a few years to get to that range. When
you look at 2014, we actually increased the buyback by $1.25 billion to deal with the Time Warner Cable side. As we
look at 2015, we're at $4.25 billion. That does include the $1.25 billion. But what we're really looking forward to is
getting Time Warner Cable closed and the other divestiture transactions. And we think the buyback for the full year
2015 could come in at close to $10 billion.
In addition, if we do get Time Warner Cable closed, our leverage will pop up because we said this will be a
leverage-neutral transaction, which will probably put us in the 2.2, 2.1 range, which is slightly above what our target
has been. So we're really looking at this somewhat as a two-stage process for us, and that's really what the focus of our
buyback has been. In addition, from a dividend perspective, we look at it both in terms of our company today and, if we
are able to get the merger complete, obviously we'll be issuing some shares, and those will have dividends as well. So
we feel very good about our return of capital. We think it's pretty aggressive for 2015.
<Q - Jessica Jean Reif Cohen>: Thank you.
<A - Jason S. Armstrong>: Thank you, Jessica; next question, please.

Your next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Philip A. Cusick>: Hey, guys, thanks. So given the announcement from Cablevision on Freewheel and recent
chatter about Google's plans, I wonder if you can give us updated thoughts on how you think about just Wi-Fi, both on
the existing business where you're ramping that out, where does that go, and then the potential for mobility later – over
the next couple years. Thanks.
<A - Neil Smit>: Hi, Phil. We think Wi-Fi is a great asset. We have 8.3 million hotspots now, including the in-home
and outdoors. We think – we're working on how we monetize that asset and bring it to market. As you know, we have
MVNO [Mobile Virtual Network Operator] relationships with Sprint and Verizon, and the use of Wi-Fi continues to go
up. About 70% of in-home and office goes over Wi-Fi. And I think, given the recent spectrum options, it shows that
wireless seeks wired just from a cost perspective. And so we do believe in the asset, and we'll be working on ways to
bring it to market over the coming months.
<Q - Philip A. Cusick>: Can you give us any idea what that might look like versus what's out there today?
<A - Neil Smit>: No, I think we're still assessing possibilities, and we'll announce when we've got the product well
refined and developed.

<Q - Craig Eder Moffett>: Hi, two questions, if I could. First, just in terms of timing on the transaction, can you just
elaborate on whether you have entered the negotiation phase on conditions with either the DOJ or the FCC, or is that
just an ongoing dialogue that happens all the time?
And then second, if you could, just talk about the capital intensity for a minute, Michael. Have you changed your view
at all about the long-term capital intensity on the Cable side of the business? Charter is moving to a much more set-top
box light model. It sounds like with your capital intensity still rising a bit that that presumably is not part of your plan.
So I just wondered if you could elaborate a bit on that issue.
<A - Michael J. Angelakis>: So why don't I take the CapEx side? The reality is I know we call it capital intensity, but
not all CapEx is actually bad CapEx. If you go back to 2012 and look at our capital investment plan compared to 2014,
about 75% of that increase has gone into what we call growth capital, and that growth capital has just terrific return on
invested capital for us. We look at it on a risk-adjusted basis. We look at it on CLV. We look at it on just pure
cash-on-cash. And we are investing pretty heavily in some offensive areas like expanding Business Services, great
returns; deploying X1, great returns; putting additional Wi-Fi and wireless gateways, as Phil mentioned, which have
great returns on their own and I think seed us for different businesses which are attractive going forward. So we really
look at where is the capital going. Is the capital going to areas that are defensive, or are they going to areas that are
offensive and have terrific cash-on-cash returns?
That being said, there are some trends in our favor. We don't give guidance long term where you could see equipment
costs coming down. You could see how the household architecture becomes less expensive. But what we're really
focused on right now is Business Services and X1 and a variety of areas that we think have just great cash-on-cash and
great growth areas for us going forward. So to go from 13.9% to 14.5%, with the vast majority being success oriented
and growth oriented, we're pretty excited about making those investments, which also have some similar aspects to
NBC or on the theme parks. We are delighted to make the investments in theme parks, and the results speak for
themselves.
<A - Brian L. Roberts>: Let me just finish on that with one other thought that I think the hardware costs in household
are coming down over time. We're seeing terrific capability increases. We're putting very capable devices. And what's
happening is then fantastic response from consumers. In fact, when I go to New York and LA, people say how fast can
I get X1? I wish I had had it.
And that takes me to your second question – or your first question, which was the regulatory process. And all we can
say is it's pretty much as we've said all along, which is the shot clock at the FCC is due to expire at the end of March.
Lots of information gathering has been taking place. And we continue to believe this is an approvable transaction. And
this week they'll be dealing on the open Internet order, as everyone knows, and hopefully they'll be able to turn their
attention to our transaction right thereafter.
<Q - Craig Eder Moffett>: Thank you, Brian.
<A - Jason S. Armstrong>: Thanks, Craig; next question, please.

Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Benjamin Daniel Swinburne>: Thank you, good morning. Brian, going back to your comments on Title II, I'm
curious. Some of your telecom competitors have talked about the implications of this regulatory approach to the
appetite to invest, how they think about the returns of the business. Maybe for you and Michael, do you see any major
implications based on what we know today? I realize we'll know more in theory in a few days. But based on what we
know today, does this change how you think about the Broadband business return profile or your willingness to spend
capital on that business?

<A - Brian L. Roberts>: Look, I think – and Michael can comment as well. My view is until we see the order, it's
premature to speculate. Obviously, my comments I just made about our view that we don't believe Title II was the right
answer. But if that is indeed what happens, we'll have to appropriately adjust and reflect on what the words are, what
the specific details are. We're heartened that there is at least the desire to forbear from things that would be a
disincentive to invest. But until we see the fine print, I think we have to reserve judgment.
<A - Michael J. Angelakis>: The only thing I would add, Ben, is obviously the uncertainty that Title II may provide I
think does provide us with the opportunity for a higher degree of scrutiny on capital and broadband. We really, as Brian
said, need to look at the details, but there will be some internal scrutiny here in terms of what our investment plans look
like with broadband.
<Q - Benjamin Daniel Swinburne>: If I can just ask one follow-up, you mentioned customer service I think first as
one of your key areas of focus for 2015. Maybe, Neil, if you want to comment, what have you seen so far recently on
your initiatives there? Is that paying off in lower churn? What should we be looking for in the business results in 2015
to say that your investments are paying off?
<A - Neil Smit>: Ben, we're very much focused on the onboarding process, where the churn is two to three times
higher the first 90 days, and we want to get that experience right for the customer. We're making things more
convenient for the customer, so we recently announced the UPS deal. And I think boxes have been returned now to
90% of their 4,400 stores, so consumers are using that convenience. And we're improving the tools that our employees
are using, so we rolled out Tech Finder. We've got a Customer Effort index where we can look at how many times
customers called or had service calls. So we've got a lot of efforts going.
The good news was in Q3 that our video results were driven primarily by reduced – retention, in Q4, excuse me. So
we're seeing retention go up, improving, and we're going to keep driving the customer experience as our top initiative,
and it will be our best product.

The next question comes from the line of Vijay Jayant with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
<Q - Vijay Jayant>: Thanks. Just continuing on the Title II front, obviously, it appears that it's probably going to get
challenged legally. So I think some investors are concerned that as part of concessions on the merger that you may give
up your legal right to challenge that. Is that any risk at all in your thinking? Thank you.
<A - Brian L. Roberts>: I would defer until we see the order, but I think we do not want to be different than any other
company in the industry. And one of the things that we've said from the beginning is that the right place to have a
review of broadband, even if we don't agree with the outcome of that review in all cases, would be to affect all
industries and all providers so that we are on a level playing field as we go forward. So in our view, our business is not
in the same geography as Time Warner Cable. We're in different markets. And the right way to look at the business I
think is to look at the whole industry and look at all providers.
<Q - Vijay Jayant>: If I could add one more, please, which is with the new definition allegedly on broadband speeds
of 25-megabit download by 3-megabit upload and allegedly the concentration that Comcast pro forma for Time Warner
Cable will have, can you talk about – does that matter especially in an environment where the regulators are telling you
how you manage both at the interconnect and at the customer level? Does concentration matter in your mind?
<A - Brian L. Roberts>: My understanding of 25-megabit download is an aspirational goal. It's something that we
have been fortunate to be investing all these years to bring fantastic broadband. I think our results today and for the last
several years have shown that that investment pays off. And we're hoping that when it's all said and done, there's going
to continue to be incentives to want to make new investments. And I think our motive has never been for some

aggregation benefit actually in the broadband business, but rather to continue to give consumers more and better uses.
So when you go to the Consumer Electronics Show, what you see are Internet of Things, Internet of Devices. You hear
all the consumer electronics companies say I'm going to make smart devices that attach to intelligence in the cloud.
And if we can continue to have more bits be demanded by consumers, that's a great thing for those of us who are in the
business of trying to innovate and build more capacity. And I think that's the aspiration and I think that's what our
company has done well, and we're going to continue to invest in that way if we're able to.

The next question comes from the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brett Joseph Feldman>: Thanks for taking the question. I'm going to try to follow up to what Phil was asking
about earlier. I know you're not prepared to roll out what the big wireless strategy is, although it sounds like we'll get
more color on it later this year. But maybe just bigger picture as you work on the strategy behind the scenes and assess
what the opportunity is, are you ultimately looking at mobility as something that might end up being an attractive
feature, meaning it would be cool if you can mobilize products you already offer? Or are you looking at this more
holistically to think that this could be a business and that investors should be thinking more about Comcast getting into
a new business potentially through mobility?
<A - Neil Smit>: I think it could be either one or both. We think it's, as I said, a great asset. Clearly, the world is
becoming more mobile. We have our apps, our video apps out in the mobile space, and they're getting a lot of usage.
Our My Account app for customer service had 41% of our customer relationships visit it in December. So we view the
mobile world expanding as well as we're assessing the business opportunity. Clearly, Wi-Fi is a great asset. It's got a lot
of carrying capacity. And as Brian just said, the more bits that are traveling over a network, the more viable that Wi-Fi
network connected to a wired network becomes. So it could be both of what you stated.
<A - Michael J. Angelakis>: The only thing I would add, Brett, is when you think about all the investment we've made
in Wi-Fi over the years and everything on our Cloud DVR and our TV Everywhere platform, the real goal has been that
our customers can access their video anytime, anywhere, whether in the home or outside the home. And we think Wi-Fi
is a great delivery mechanism to expand that product. If Wi-Fi can also develop into a different type of service, then
that's an added benefit to the Wi-Fi investment.
<Q - Brett Joseph Feldman>: Great. And just to clarify, is it safe to assume that your CapEx guidance for the year
incorporates whatever extent you're investing in the wireless business this year?
<A - Michael J. Angelakis>: That's correct. Our CapEx guidance includes our Wi-Fi deployment.

Your next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: I just have a question for Mr. Burke. There is a view on the buy side that because of

<A - Stephen B. Burke>: Well, I think there clearly is room for improvement in terms of measurement. As more and
more people watch in more different areas online, and often those areas are unrated, there's also a catch-up in terms of
monetization. I'll give you an example. We think about 70% of the views of Jimmy Fallon and The Tonight Show
occur online, and the majority of those views are unmonetized, completely unmonetized. So here you have one of the
hottest shows on television, where 70% of the views are in an area that we don't get credit for. That's not going to last
forever. So clearly, there's going to be an improvement.
That having been said, cable ratings are under pressure because there are so many new shows. So many people are
watching SVOD; so many people have DVRs. There are a whole variety of reasons why cable ratings are under
pressure, but I do think at the same time there's reason for cautious optimism that both measurement and monetization
is going to get better.

Next question comes from the line of Marci Ryvicker with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
<Q - Marci L. Ryvicker>: Thanks, I have two. The first, it feels like Time Warner Cable is a lot stronger today than
when you announced the transaction initially. Is that what you're seeing as you go through your integration process?
And then the second question is really for Steve. I know, Brian, you mentioned a theme park in China. At what point do
you start building that out, and does that impact the financials?
<A - Michael J. Angelakis>: I'll take the Time Warner Cable one. I mean, I think that the team over there have a plan.
Obviously, we diligenced that plan a while ago, and it appears to us like they're trying to execute that plan. So,
obviously, we don't have as much insight as we would like. We hope they are successful on executing their plan.
<A - Stephen B. Burke>: So in terms of Beijing, we're talking many years out. We're talking about after 2020 a park
that opens. We haven't even completed the final design process and much of our arrangements with Beijing. So I think
we're a ways away before capital becomes anything that you would call material.

Your next question will come from the line of Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kannan Venkateshwar>: Thank you, just a couple from my side. The first is on the Wi-Fi side. You guys are in
a unique position given that you have broadcast spectrum, especially with the incentive auction coming on next year.
So when you look at your Wi-Fi deployment plans and the wireless plans that you have, how much does the spectrum
that you own fit into that plan in addition to the MVNO agreement that you have with Verizon and Sprint?
And then secondly on the dynamic ad insertion front, there's been a lot of conversations about how that'll become more
important over the course of the year. But is it fair to say that a big part of the back end is actually owned by the cable
distributors when it comes to inserting these ads dynamically? And how do the economics work for dynamic ad
insertion in that case? Thanks.
<A - Michael J. Angelakis>: Why don't I take the first one? I know we've had a couple questions related to Wi-Fi or
wireless, and really I don't think this is the point that we would want to be too open with what our wireless plans are
going forward. We are investing in Wi-Fi. We think Wi-Fi has many benefits to our customers, and we'll be pursuing

that. Whether it can be mobile or how we think about the broadcast spectrum, I think that's still very much a work in
process in our organization. I think we have a lot of work internally to do to appropriately evaluate that. So I don't want
to spend too much time on it because from our standpoint, we are working through all those issues and technologies
internally.
<A - Neil Smit>: And concerning DAI capabilities, the back end that inserts the ads dynamically was actually built by
a cable consortium called Canoe. The rates they charge are fairly immaterial because the primary objective was to get it
to be used across all the networks. So we currently have the majority of the networks involved in it, and it's gone very
well, and it's kind of found inventory where we can insert ads pre, post, mid-roll. And we'll continue to focus on
improving DAI and getting more programming through it.

Your next question comes from the line of Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael L. McCormack>: Hey, guys, thanks. You've talked about margin stability on the cable side as we go
into 2015. I'm assuming the programming expense offset would be some sort of rate adjustments. I'm just trying to get
a sense for your thoughts on price elasticity, where you might be able to take some price. And then also maybe a
comment about AT&T U-verse; it seems like they've been pulling back. Have you seen a change in the competitive
landscape? Thanks.
<A - Neil Smit>: I'll take those in reverse. I think the competitive landscape remains generally the same. There's quite a
bit of promotional activity going on, but we feel we're very competitive, and I think our results show it. And we're
competitive in terms of product we're offering as well as the offer itself, and we're very focused on the retention end.
Concerning the price increases, I think there will be modest price increases in line with previous years. I think in terms
of maintaining margin, a bigger factor is the mix of products where we get higher mix of business services, HSD, and
those are higher-margin products. So we feel we can offset the programming increases by improved mix and modest
rate adjustments.
<Q - Michael L. McCormack>: I guess, Neil, just thinking about subs in 2015 between DIRECTV talking about
going negative and maybe U-verse pulling back, even though you say it's competitive, what is your view on sub counts
as you look out on 2015 for video?
<A - Neil Smit>: We don't put out numbers on what we project for subs. But we'll continue to try and balance the sub
volume mixture with the rate increases. And I think that's the delicate balance we're always trying to maintain, which is
rate and volume, and we think we're doing a pretty good job of it. I mean, video losses decreased 27% this year, and
we're going to keep focusing on balancing rate and volume.

other half.
And secondly, on Business Services, can you talk about how much of growth is footprint expansion at this point versus
increased penetration of the footprint you already have and the customers you already have? Thanks.
<A - Brian L. Roberts>: Neil, do you want to take – or Mike, Business Services for a second?
<A - Neil Smit>: Sure. Business Services we don't put out what the mix is of network expansion versus just growth on
the network. But we're penetrated about 25% in SMB and 5% in mid-market. Mid-market is growing at an increasing
rate relative to SMB. And we continue to expand the network, as Michael said, because it's a great investment. And
then we try and put as many businesses on the network as we can to get it denser. So overall, we'll continue investing in
Business Services expansion and continue driving our mid-market and SMB.
<A - Michael J. Angelakis>: But as you can imagine, it's a combination of both, James. Probably 18 months ago, we
had literally zero penetration in the mid-size sector. So we invested in that area, and now we're still pretty small at 5%
but growing nicely. So it's really a combination of both.
<A - Brian L. Roberts>: On the OTT out of footprint, I think what we've said previously we don't have any new news
today, which is our focus is in footprint, investing in networks, having direct relationship with customers, having tens
of thousands of people in the field who come to your home and service you, and then add devices in your house and
grow that relationship over the years.
If you step back on the year 2014 and you think we grew cash flow close to 7% as a full company, 18% at
NBCUniversal, outstanding year, over 5% – 5.5% at the cable division while, as Neil just said, increasing customer
relationships by 358,000, which is a big increase over 2013. And then when you roll it up financially, being able to
have an 11% dividend increase, $10 billion authorization buyback from the board, setting us up to continue the
momentum that I think this company has, and investing in capital areas where we are excited by the opportunity, led
principally by Business Services and the X1 rollouts and some of the theme park activities. So all in all, we're really
pleased. We stayed focused, good solid strong year and a great beginning to 2015 and thank you all. Jason?
