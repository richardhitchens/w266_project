MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Welcome to the Time Warner, Inc. first quarter 2016 earnings call. My name is Mike, and I will be your operator for
today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer
session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.
I will now turn the call over to Michael Kopelman, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Kopelman, you
may begin.
Jeffrey L. Bewkes
All right, do we have a line?
Michael Kopelman
We do. I think we're actually on now, sorry about the delay with that.
Jeffrey L. Bewkes
How do we ask if anybody can hear us?

Michael Kopelman
Hopefully, if people can hear us, then please go ahead and e-mail us.
Jeffrey L. Bewkes
Are you going to tell them about our merger with St. Jude Medical?
Michael Kopelman
That was our big news, and now you all know why we moved our call to 8:30 in the morning. Good morning,
everyone. Sorry about the delay there. Obviously, we've got some time, so hopefully you can all stay with us for the
duration of the call.
I just got a text message saying that you can hear us. So thanks, everyone, and good morning. Welcome to Time
Warner's first quarter earnings conference call. This morning we issued two press releases, one detailing our results for
the first quarter and the other reaffirming our 2016 full-year business outlook.
Before we begin, there are two items I need to cover. First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures.
Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP
financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on
our website at www.TimeWarner.com/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also
included in the business outlook release that is available on our website.
Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current
expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various
factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent Annual Report on
Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Time Warner is under no obligation and in fact expressly
disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information,
future events, or otherwise.
I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Bewkes, Time Warner's Chairman and CEO, who will be followed by Howard Averill,
Time Warner's CFO. After their prepared remarks, our divisional CEOs, John Martin, Richard Plepler, and Kevin
Tsujihara, will join us for our Q&A session. Jeff?
Jeffrey L. Bewkes
Thanks, Mike, and thanks, everybody, for listening in and staying on the call through our medical report at the
beginning.
We told you on our last call that we expected 2016 to be another standout year for Time Warner. And in recent years,
as you all know, we've been investing aggressively in the very best content while moving quickly to take advantage of
new distribution opportunities that are emerging around the world. At the same time, we've maintained our disciplined
approach to cost controls and capital allocation in order to maximize shareholder returns, and we anticipated that that
combination would allow us to continue to deliver industry-leading performance. That's exactly what you're seeing in
our first quarter results.
Revenues increased 3% to $7.3 billion, and adjusted operating income grew 11% to $2 billion. Adjusted earnings per
share grew 25% to $1.49 per share, and we also returned over $1 billion to shareholders in share repurchases and
dividends.

In addition to strong financial results, we're off to a tremendous start this year from a content perspective. In just the
past few weeks, we've had the buzzer-beating final game of March Madness on TBS, CNN's must-watch election
coverage, a global hit from Warner Bros. in Batman v Superman, and the return of HBO's epic series Game of Thrones.
Those are just a few examples of how our investments are translating into great content that deeply engages audiences
across platforms and around the world.
But there are many more. Let me start with Turner. Once again, Turner had three of the top 10 basic cable networks in
the U.S. and it continued to make progress on a multiyear transformation of its brands. The first quarter marked the
start of TBS's repositioning as the place for young, fresh comedy, with the successful premieres of Angie Tribeca, Full
Frontal with Samantha Bee, and Separation Anxiety. We followed those up last month with our new hit, The Detour.
It's the biggest new comedy on cable this year.
The early results are very encouraging, with TBS ending the first quarter ranked as the number one ad-supported cable
network in primetime among adults 18 to 49. And we have a number of additional distinctive shows on tap this year,
including Wrecked, which will debut next month.
The first quarter also marked the start of an acceleration in Turner's domestic affiliate revenue growth, which we've
been talking to you about now for some time. That acceleration underscores the strength of the Turner brands and the
investments we've been making in them in recent years. One of our most important investments was March Madness.
And last month, Turner brought the championship game of the tournament to cable for the very first time. This year's
tournament was another great success, delivering both a stirring finale and record revenue. Recently, we agreed to build
on that success by partnering with CBS to extend our television, digital, and marketing rights to the NCAA Tournament
all the way through 2032.
Marquee live sports continue to grow in importance both to consumers and to advertisers. And combined with our
extensive multiplatform rights, that gives us a lot of confidence we'll be able to generate a very attractive return on our
investment in this unique property.
As March Madness wound down, the NBA Playoffs were just getting started. The NBA on TNT grew viewership
double digits in the first quarter. And with the playoffs underway, we have a great platform for TNT's own
drama-focused brand refresh, which starts with Animal Kingdom from Warner Bros. in June.
Nowhere is Turner's transformation more evident than at CNN, which more than doubled its primetime audience in the
first quarter. CNN's ratings benefited from its own reliable coverage of the U.S. presidential race as well as from its
continued success with original series. Those two areas overlapped in Race for the White House, which premiered as
the most watched CNN original telecast ever.
Over at Home Box Office, I mentioned Game of Thrones already, which grew its opening night viewership double
digits versus a year ago on a cross-platform basis. But it doesn't stop there. That same weekend, HBO was host to
Beyoncé's headline-grabbing visual album, Lemonade, also the television premiere of Jurassic World, a world
championship boxing match, and the return of our two hit comedies, Veep and Silicon Valley. It was a great example
of the range and quality of the content that HBO delivers to its subs.
We're just as excited for what's still to come this year at HBO, including the second season of Ballers. That's our new
series, started last year; a new series, Divorce, with Sarah Jessica Parker; and our limited series, The Night Of, which
just previewed to a tremendous reception at the Tribeca Film Festival.
At Warner Bros., Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice set a record for a March opening weekend, and it's already
Warner's biggest ever first quarter release. Even better, it's only the opening chapter of an exciting slate of DC
Entertainment films that we think will captivate audiences globally for years to come. Next up is Suicide Squad this
summer, followed by LEGO Batman, Wonder Woman, and Justice League, all in 2017. And as you know, these
franchise films are the cornerstone of a strategy that's making DC a growth driver across film, television, digital,
games, and consumer products.

Warner's has a lot more on deck, including J.K. Rowling's return to the big screen this November with Fantastic Beasts
and Where to Find Them. Judging by the huge crowd since the opening last month of the Wizarding World of Harry
Potter attraction in Hollywood, there are plenty of fans who are just excited as we are for the next installment of this
great franchise.
In television, Warner's has built on its leading position in broadcast with three of the top five new series this season.
That includes not only scripted series like the number one new show, Blindspot, but also unscripted series like Little
Big Shots, which has already been picked up in two major international territories. Given the performance of Warner's
current shows, with a record 21 renewals ahead of the upfront this year and a strong slate of pilots, Warner's is in a
great position to once again lead the industry in broadcast series programming this coming season.
Now we're also expanding our production for cable and over-the-top [OTT] services. We have twice the number of new
series orders for next season. So across the company, we're continuing to lead the way in producing groundbreaking
content.
And to capitalize on the rapid shift to on-demand consumption and broadband delivery of video, we're focused on
innovation both in the type of content we produce and how we get it to consumers. For example, on May 24, Turner is
launching ELEAGUE. That's our professional competitive gaming league in partnership with WME | IMG.
In addition to its telecasts on TBS, ELEAGUE will have a significant digital component in partnership with Twitch.
ELEAGUE reflects Turner's commitment to creating and delivering content for multi-platform audiences. That
commitment is also reflected in Turner's other efforts to grow its presence outside the traditional television ecosystem,
particularly in news and sports. CNN finished the quarter as the leading digital news brand in multi-platform video, and
Bleacher Report remained number two online sports destination. We'll be ramping up investments in both of these
properties over the next couple of years to further expand on their leadership positions.
HBO is also investing in content geared toward digital audiences by bringing on board talent like Bill Simmons and Jon
Stewart. Any Given Wednesday with Bill Simmons does not debut until next month, but Bill is already making his
mark with HBO's first after-show, After the Thrones. Like Animals, After the Thrones is debuting first on HBO NOW
and HBO GO. We continue to see significant growth in both users and usage of our digital platforms, and we expect
that to continue with our recent expansion of HBO NOW to Microsoft's Xbox and to Samsung's smart TVs.
We're also expanding the reach of HBO's OTT products internationally. In the first quarter, HBO LAG [Latin America
Group] launched an OTT service in Mexico, and HBO announced plans for OTT launches later this year in Spain,
Brazil, and Argentina. That's all part of a broader push across the company to develop new services and capabilities.
We talked to you previously about Warner's SVOD [Subscription Video On Demand] investments in Asia. In February,
Warner Bros. announced the acquisition of DramaFever to further bolster our OTT capabilities. And just last week,
Turner announced its first domestic SVOD service, FilmStruck, which will build on the curation expertise of TCM to
target enthusiasts of independent, foreign, and art house films.
At the same time, we're deeply committed to strengthening our core networks and to helping our traditional distribution
and network partners improve their products to satisfy consumers' desire for on-demand content. HBO and Turner have
been at the forefront of providing on-demand and multi-platform rights to our partners. And in March, Warner's
announced a new deal granting ABC Network in-season stacking rights for its new series.
So we're making progress on many fronts both inside and outside the traditional ecosystem. We're seeing the benefits of
strong execution of our strategy and how that can continue to deliver superior returns for our shareholders. We've also
ramped up our investments and our pace of innovation to meet the high expectations of today's and tomorrow's
consumers. And that's why we're so confident about the rest of 2016 and beyond.
Thanks for listening, and let me turn it over to Howard Averill.

Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on
our website.
Starting with consolidated results, we're off to a terrific start in 2016, with growth across each of our divisions. And
that resulted in a quarterly record for adjusted operating income, which reached over $2 billion, and a 25% increase in
adjusted EPS. Total revenues grew 3%, and adjusted operating income was up a very healthy 11%, with margins
expanding 200 basis points. And we did that while continuing to grow our investments in programming and marketing
at HBO and Turner. That was balanced by lower costs at Warner Bros., mainly due to the timing of our theatrical slate
in light of continued company-wide focus on constraining growth and overhead costs.
And we were able to once again leverage our positive operating results into even faster growth in adjusted EPS. That
was partly due to our ongoing share repurchase program. During the quarter, we bought back $700 million of our
shares. And combined with our dividend, we've returned close to $1.3 billion to shareholders year to date. This
morning, we reaffirmed our guidance for 2016 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $5.30 to $5.40. So we're pleased with
how we're executing and have significant operating momentum across our businesses, which gives us great confidence
in our outlook for the rest of this year and beyond.
Now turning to the segment highlights, I'll start at Turner, where the benefit from our domestic affiliate renewal cycle
and continued strong advertising performance resulted in our best quarter of revenue growth in almost three years and
record adjusted operating income. Subscription revenues were up a strong 11% in the quarter, and that included a close
to 300 basis point headwind from FX. Domestic subscription revenues grew close to 15%, as we benefited from the
higher rates we achieved in our recent affiliate agreements. Excluding a 15 percentage point drag from FX,
international subscription revenue growth was in the high single digits. While there may be quarter-to-quarter
fluctuations due to a variety of factors, domestic sub revenue growth is on track to be in the low teens for the year, and
we expect total subscription revenue growth through the rest of the year to be similar to the first quarter.
Advertising was up a solid 5%, despite approximately 150 basis points of headwind from FX. Domestic advertising
grew in the mid-single digits. That was due to double-digit growth across Turner's linear and digital properties for both
news and sports, including strong growth from the NCAA Tournament. International advertising was also healthy in
the quarter, up high single digits excluding a close to 15 percentage point drag from FX.
Looking to the second quarter, scatter pricing at our domestic entertainment networks continues to be up well in the
double digits versus the upfront and will benefit from the NCAA Championship Game, while FX remains a headwind.
As a result, we expect total advertising revenue growth to be in the mid to high single digits. And with a healthy ad
market, the continued rollout of our industry-leading advanced advertising products, and momentum at many of our
brands, every indication points to a very strong upfront this year.
Adjusted operating income increased 10% and margins expanded 100 basis points. And we achieved that even as we
continued to invest in programming and marketing, as Turner kept all other expenses close to flat in the quarter.
Programming expenses increased 4%, mainly due to our investments in sports and election coverage. And marketing
costs were up well into the double digits to support the TBS and TNT rebrands.
So Turner is off to a terrific start in 2016 and is well positioned for another strong year, and we're confident the
investments we're making across our brands will enhance our competitive position and allow us to sustain strong
revenue trends and attractive financial results in the future.
Turning now to HBO, where we continue to see very strong global demand for the product in the form of both
subscriber growth and content licensing, domestic subscription revenue growth was in the mid-single digits, and that
included a sequential increase in the benefit from HBO NOW. However, despite year-over-year subscriber growth, we
continued to experience headwinds from fewer revenue-generating subscribers at certain MVPDs [Multi-channel Video
Programming Distributors], which has been partially driven by M&A activity. Over time, we actually see an
opportunity to help those partners grow their businesses while accelerating our own revenue growth.
Content and other revenue increased 23% in the quarter. That was mainly due to higher international licensing
revenues, as HBO continues to benefit from its ability to effectively monetize its original content around the world.

Across HBO's international networks, including unconsolidated JVs, revenues were up in the double digits excluding
the impact of FX. And international subscriber trends remained strong, with healthy growth across all regions,
especially LatAm and Europe.
Adjusted operating income was up 6% in the quarter, and that was despite a double-digit increase in programming costs
as well as continued investments in marketing and technology related to HBO NOW. The increase in programming
expense is related to new original programming like Vinyl and Sesame Street as well as programming charges related
to series in development.
Overall, HBO is off to a great start to the year. We're excited about our upcoming programming lineup. And with
continued investments in the brand and product, we're in a great position to capitalize on the significant global
opportunities for premium services.
Moving on to Warner Bros., where we posted record first quarter adjusted operating income, on the TV side, we
benefited from higher international licensing revenues. And at our Games business, the continued success of our LEGO
and Mortal Kombat franchises helped drive another quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Despite the strong box
office opening of Batman v Superman late in the quarter, total revenues were down modestly due to the difficult
theatrical comparisons from last year's release of American Sniper and carryover from the final installment of The
Hobbit.
Across theatrical and TV, home entertainment revenues were down 12%, as last year's quarter benefited from the home
video release of the final Hobbit. Despite the difficult comparisons, EST [Electronic Sell-Through] revenues were still
up mid-single digits in the quarter, and we expect our home entertainment trends to improve in the back half of the year
as a result of a stronger theatrical slate.
Adjusted operating income grew close to 30%. In addition to our strong Games performance, we also benefited from
lower P&A spending as a result of fewer releases this quarter.
So Warner Bros. has great momentum, and we're just getting started on the theatrical side with Suicide Squad and
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them leading what should be a very strong lineup for both the remainder of this
year and many years to come. Along with our strength in television and video games, that gives us great confidence in
Warner's ability to continue delivering attractive growth well into the future.
Turning to the next slide, free cash flow totaled over $700 million, which was down from a year ago due to a
significant increase in working capital. That was largely related to increased production spend at Warner Bros. as well
as the performance of its theatrical product in the fourth quarter of last year and the related impact on accounts
receivable. Even so, we still expect very strong cash flow in 2016, driven by strong profit growth and another year of
high conversion.
Now looking at our balance sheet, we ended the first quarter with $22 billion of net debt, up $500 million compared to
the end of 2015. That's primarily a result of our ongoing commitment to direct returns to shareholders, which is a key
component of our balanced approach to capital allocation. We ended the quarter just above our target leverage ratio of
2.75 times, but we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment-grade credit ratings and
are on track to return to our target by the end of this year.
With that, let's move on to the final slide, which looks at our outlook for 2016. We got off to a strong start in the first
quarter, delivering growth across each of our businesses and setting us up for another very good year. That's reflected
in our outlook for adjusted EPS of $5.30 to $5.40, which we reaffirmed this morning. And based on current rates, that
includes an estimated $0.10 headwind from foreign exchange.
Looking ahead, we still expect growth in adjusted OI to be weighted toward the back half of the year. Specifically in
the second quarter, we continue to see positive trends in both advertising and subscription revenue, and global demand
for our content remains very strong. But there are several items that we expect to weigh on adjusted operating income,
including the timing of content licensing revenue, the comparison to strong video games profits at Warner's in last
year's quarter, and programming investments at Turner.

Despite that, we're on track for another year of very healthy growth in adjusted operating income and solid double-digit
earnings growth, extending our history of delivering consistently strong operating and financial performance. And with
Turner's revenue trends accelerating, HBO positioned to accelerate its subscription revenue growth over the next
couple of years, and Warner's in the early stages of an exciting theatrical slate, we feel we're in a great position to
continue delivering strong results for many years to come.
With that, I'll turn it back to Mike to start the Q&A.
Michael Kopelman
Thanks, Howard. Operator, can we please open the queue for questions?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson. Your line is now
open.
<Q - Michael B. Nathanson>: Thanks. I have one for Kevin and then one for Richard. I'm going to hold off my St.
Jude's questions for later. Kevin, as Jeff just said, ABC and Warner's announced a deal in March that gives ABC
in-season stacking rights to all new series. So I wonder, can you talk about whether or not that's going to be a standard,
do you think, for other networks going forward? And then how do your back-end economics – are affected by giving
people more early window rights? What does that mean for your SVOD windows and maybe the second and third
windows after that?
<A - Kevin Tsujihara>: We don't think it impacts the back-end value of the rights. We've given Turner stacking
rights. We sold stacking rights to FOX last year on Lucifer. And we feel really good about the deal we did with ABC. I
can't speak for the rest of the industry, but I know that we are having a number of conversations with all the networks
about stacking rights and think that it's certainly a good thing for consumers.
<Q - Michael B. Nathanson>: And will you only sell rights going forward with stacking rights included? Is that your
template, or are you flexible depending on what the networks need?
<A - Kevin Tsujihara>: I think each conversation with every network is an individual conversation with them, and so
I can't speak for every single show we're going to sell.
<Q - Michael B. Nathanson>: Okay. And then, Richard, we've had a lot of questions about the timing of your next
round of affiliate fee negotiations. Can you remind us what percentage of your footprint is coming due over the next
few years? And is there any one year in general that's a bigger year for your next round of negotiations?
<A - Richard L. Plepler>: Michael, look, as we've said before, a large percentage of our deals are up in the next
couple of years, some of them toward the end of this year. We think that's a huge opportunity for us because some of
the poorer performing affiliates are being acquired by some of the higher performing affiliates, and obviously we see
that as a big opportunity going forward for revenue growth. And some of the better performing affiliates, those deals
will come up in the next year or so, and we see an opportunity to monetize some of those subs as well. So you can look
for the next 18 months to two years for the vast preponderance of our affiliate fees.
<Q - Michael B. Nathanson>: Thanks, Richard.
<A - Michael Kopelman>: Thanks, Michael. Operator, next question, please.

It comes from the like of Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
<Q - Alexia S. Quadrani>: Thank you. My question is on Turner. You've increased your investments in some of the
original programming, which I know you highlighted in your opening comment, with some of these premieres coming
out recently. How are you trending I guess on this front? How have they been doing versus your plan, and I guess do
you have any overall commentary on the upfront?
<A - John K. Martin>: Thanks, Alexia. It's John. Listen, I think we are proceeding exactly on pace with our internal
plan. And so if you think about it, Kevin Reilly, as the head of our entertainment networks, has been on the job for
about a year, and it's really his new programming slate that's just beginning to roll out.
We did view 24 new seasons of owned original series on our domestic networks in the first quarter alone, and we have
20 more slated for the second quarter. And these new series hopefully give you a small sense for the bold, high quality
and engaging programming that you can expect from Turner going forward. And we're very happy with the critical
acclaim and the performance that these new shows are demonstrating across, frankly, all platforms, TV, digital, and
social.
And just to add a little bit more flavor to that, premiering Angie Tribeca in a very new and unique way with a 25-hour
commercial-free marathon brought about 36% new young audiences to network. Median age was about 10 years
younger than our TBS median. And it continued its success in its regular season run, and it ranked number one on
Monday nights across all of cable sitcoms.
I think it was Jeff that said we couldn't be more pleased than with the success of The Detour, which recently premiered
and is reaching over 5 million viewers per episode across all of our TBS platforms, and it's ranked number one of the
new comedy releases in adults 18 to 49. Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, huge critical and commercial success across
all platforms. We're reaching around 3.5 million viewers and we're driving 30 million views on the show's YouTube
channel. And that's really just TBS.
During the first quarter, we had new seasons of Impractical Jokers. And for those who can't actually DV, We Bare
Bears and Steven Universe on Cartoon Network, and The Race for the White House and The Eighties on CNN. So
we're driving, I think, a general improvement in the quality of our original programming across all of our networks, and
we've got a lot more to come. And most notably, the TNT rebrand will begin later this year, and Jeff mentioned some
of the shows that we're really excited about.
With respect to the upfront, I just would reiterate the enthusiasm that Howard suggested, which is that given the strong
scatter where we're seeing some of our inventory sell for upwards of 30% to 50% higher than last year's upfront levels.
And given low cancellations, we think all signs point to, frankly, the best upfront we will have seen in years. And we
think our networks stand to gain at least our fair share of what happens in the upfront. And we think it spells very, very
well for just television in general, as television is experiencing resurgence in the minds of brand advertisers, as we're
delivering reach and increasing targeting and audience capabilities. So we're very, very optimistic.
<Q - Alexia S. Quadrani>: Thank you very much.
<A - Michael Kopelman>: Thanks, Alexia. Operator, next question, please.

It comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson from UBS. Your line is now open.
<Q - Doug Mitchelson>: Thanks so much, two questions. One, Richard, you noted a lot of affiliate renewals coming
up. Can you talk about how the environment for distribution renewals might have changed over time, what the
give-and-take in negotiations might be in this next cycle? It seems like you're going in asking for an uplift with all the
promotional subs at a higher level than you might have been in the prior cycles.

And for Kevin Tsujihara, Kevin, it seems you've got a pretty good line of sight on 2016 at this point. When you look
out the next few years, do you still see continued strong growth from Warner's, and what are the key drivers of that?
Thank you.
<A - Richard L. Plepler>: It's Richard. Look, I think as I said earlier, a huge opportunity for us going forward because
in the higher performing affiliates that are acquiring the weaker affiliates, the blended penetration is below industry
average. That gives us an opportunity with our partners to grow together up to the better performing affiliates'
penetration levels and beyond. So we see this as an opportunity for them and we see this as an opportunity for us. And
listen, all negotiations are difficult, but we think this is going to be a win-win.
<Q - Doug Mitchelson>: Okay.
<A - Kevin Tsujihara>: We feel great about our – can you – let's move the mic so you can hear. We feel great about
the long-term growth of Warner Bros., and we continue to feel that way. We're going to continue to grow, as we said in
the past, our leading television business. We have 21 shows, as Jeff mentioned earlier, coming back, and there are still
three or four more shows that might also get picked up, and we feel great about our pilots so far.
We're going to continue to build on the theatrical slate. We love the pipeline, and the foundation is going to be the
franchises that we've talked about, DC, Fantastic Beasts, and LEGO. And we're going to continue to focus on margins.
We think that we've done a very good job in reducing costs, but we think there's still work to do. So we feel really good
about the long-term growth of Warner Bros.
<Q - Doug Mitchelson>: Thanks, Kevin.
<A - Michael Kopelman>: Operator, can we have our next question, please?
Operator
It comes from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
<Q - Jessica Jean Reif Cohen>: Thank you. I have two separate questions. The first is for John or – I guess John. But
following up on something Howard said, which was Howard mentioned the advanced advertising array of products,
could you talk a little bit about what you're planning to do this year in terms of targeted or advanced advertising? And
how different is it for television versus over-the-top? I know this is a long one question. But on over-the-top, will you
participate in Hulu or not?
And then the separate second question is for Kevin. Do you think the sale of DreamWorks Animation will spark
mid-size or other studio consolidation? And if yes, will Warner Bros. participate in consolidation?
<A - John K. Martin>: Thanks, Jessica. I guess I'll start just taking it in the order that you asked the questions, and I
appreciate the question. We're spending a lot of work, a lot of time, investment in increasing our capabilities in
advertising. And frankly, we're holding ourselves accountable to lead the charge to modernize TV advertising by
combining the unparalleled reach of television and the engagement of TV with the measurement and targeting
capabilities of digital. And we are quickly evolving the advertising industry to simultaneously benefit our advertisers as
well as improve our overall consumer experience, and we don't see these goals as being mutually exclusive. Frankly,
what we're trying to do is combine the best of both TV and digital, uniting scale and targeting with top tier content, and
that's one of the reasons why we're very bullish about the upfront.
In terms of our own new products, we've discussed before that we have built Oracle into Turner Data Cloud, which is
the central repository of all of our consumer information. And that's helping us launch new innovative products that
focus on analytics, targeting, and ROIs. So just the names of the products, of some of them, we've got individual
products called Targeting Now, Audience Now, ROI Now, Provable ROI. And what all that means is that it's going to
be targeting audience-based selling coupled with our data cloud and client insights. And I think there are going to be
increasing opportunities over time, and that's going to be a major, major focus in our upfronts.

And then I think you asked specifically with respect to OTT. I think the opportunities to develop advanced targeting
capabilities in OTT are absolutely there. They're available. That is assuming that the OTT offering is, in fact,
ad-supported. FilmStruck, which is our first domestic offering, is going to be non-ad-supported, which is consistent
with Turner Classic Movies. So I think the targeting opportunities will only grow over time, and we're still in the very
early stages. So we believe that TV advertising has to evolve, but it's going to remain the most effective option for
brand advertisers to convey their message at scale. And that's why we expect a resurgence in TV advertising, beginning
at this year's upfront.
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: So you had a question, there were several points. Is there a Hulu question, Jessica?
<Q - Jessica Jean Reif Cohen>: Yes.
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: What was it?
<Q - Jessica Jean Reif Cohen>: Sorry, obviously, Hulu announced this week – and it can potentially be a really
compelling product. And I was just wondering if you envision yourself participating in Hulu and the Hulu over-the-top
service.
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: I see. Okay, let me start. And, John, you may want to fill in. Just maybe, maybe we want our
networks in every one of these packages. I think we ought to include that in a larger view of how the industry is
evolving. And if you think about subscription VOD, it's been an opportunity that started with the first SVOD service,
which is called HBO, a long time ago.
And what we're watching happen, and I think it probably did start with HBO a decade ago, is consumers want, they
expect, they're going to demand SVOD access to all their favorite networks, all their favorite shows. And what we've
been seeing as an evolution is the on-demand functionality and better guides are sprouting up, first at HBO, then at
some of the broadband delivered services. And increasingly, you're seeing more full on-demand offerings of current
exhibition networks and better interfaces, guides, and recommendation engines at places like Comcast, Verizon. Sling
has one.
And for us with our networks, whether it's the Turner networks or the HBO networks, we've long said that we'd like our
networks and their programming, including the debuts of current first season exhibitions like what John is talking about
and what Richard has been building for years at HBO. We want them to be on-demand. And we would like to see most
of our networks, whichever exhibition window, first run or syndication, to be on-demand. And we're basically in an
enviable position that our networks, Turner and HBO, are among the most desired networks for consumers and
therefore to be included in all these packages.
So you will hear I think increasingly of different packages with different network offerings that consumers can choose
between at different price points available from existing cable, satellite, and telco distributors, increasingly from new
virtual distributors, whether it be Hulu, whether it's Amazon, Apple, whoever comes in and creates packages for
consumers. So I think what you're seeing is a very vibrant rebirth of the strength of TV networks and TV programming
across all of these distribution platforms. And because of our – we've always taken the position, being the first to
launch VOD, that we think more of it is better for consumers, and therefore we're going to try to be available in all the
packages consumers are interested in.
<A - Kevin Tsujihara>: As it relates to the DreamWorks Animation transaction, I don't think you're going to see
significantly more consolidation. That being said, the business is getting more and more stratified. Big franchises are
more valuable than ever. But I don't think there's a lot of those that are actually available at this point in time. And so I
don't think that that's going to be a precursor to a lot of transactions.
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: One thing I should add; I should have said it. Let's not limit the VOD transformation to the
United States. You're seeing very strong SVOD proliferation all over the world. And whether it's the Warner Tencent
venture in China, whether it's some of our HBO overseas VOD services, whether it's companies like Sky and others in
the UK, and in South America they're launching VOD, whether it's networks or programming, we're seeing our stuff
going into all of these new platforms. And it's raising the value not only of our content if you think of it show by show,

but also of our networks.
<Q - Jessica Jean Reif Cohen>: Jeff, one last follow-up, but is it all television, or do you think this is film-based as
well?
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: You mean SVOD exhibition of films, because you have certainly have had that for more
than a decade on HBO.
<Q - Jessica Jean Reif Cohen>: But not so much outside the U.S.
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: Yes, you do. Kevin, you can add. You've got film licensing on SVOD all over the world.
<Q - Jessica Jean Reif Cohen>: Okay.
<A - Kevin Tsujihara>: Yes, I think you're seeing – it's a critical component of any SVOD offering that wants to be at
scale, be it either movies and television.
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: And let's remember, and we've tried to make this point over and over. The SVOD exhibition
– or the VOD exhibition is not just on what you think of as an SVOD service. It's also in what used to be thought of as
traditional TV services that become on-demand services.
<A - Michael Kopelman>: Thanks, Jessica. Operator, can we have our next question, please?

That comes from the line of Michael Morris from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.
<Q - Michael Morris>: Thank you. Good morning, guys, two Turner-related questions. First on the affiliate fee
growth, several of your peers see impact from the distributor consolidation and some rate resets dragging on their
growth. Obviously, you're putting up great growth right now. Do you expect to have any impact in the future from
consolidation? Is any impact of consolidation already in your results, or perhaps the way you're structured you won't be
impacted by that?
And then my second question is on ELEAGUE, specifically most strategies we see as taking linear content and finding
new digital avenues. This is a case where you're taking something that's done well digitally and you're bringing it to
TV. Could you just talk a little bit about why you think that's the right strategy, what your hopes are for that product?
Thanks.
<A - John K. Martin>: Sure. Thanks, Mike. Look, with respect to our affiliate fees, I think the forecast or the
guidance that we provided for this year and next year where we expect domestic subscriber revenues to be in the low
teens, I think it's fair to say that that considers the current environment of the number of distributors and what's
happening in the marketplace. So when you have a highly concentrated portfolio of must-have networks, which we do,
where we've got 85% of our affiliate revenues in four networks, I think it's a really advantageous place to be. So I think
I'll leave it at that because obviously we're not going to specifically comment on any particular consolidation.
And then with respect to ELEAGUE, look, this is one of the innovations with respect to content that I think we're
particularly excited about and proud of. And it's really not necessarily by design that we're looking to take digital
content and move it to the TV. It's more just really trying to position the company to be where consumers are. And in
looking at secular growth areas and in looking at areas where particularly young people are spending tremendous
amounts of time, you obviously have to pay attention to the gaming industry. But this whole notion of a very significant
population of individuals who are really excited to sit and watch professional gamers and some of the best gamers in
the world, that's already happening. It's happening globally. In some countries, it represents some of the highest levels
of consumption of video content. So in some respects, having ELEAGUE be aired on TBS is somewhat of an
experiment. I think we're going to learn a lot this year. And I look forward to hopefully building a big franchise and a
big asset along with our partners on both TV and digital platforms.

Your line comes from Vasily Karasyov from CLSA. Your line is now open.
<Q - Vasily Karasyov>: Thank you, good morning. John, I have a couple quick ones for you on Turner. I think in
Jeff's remarks, he said that sports was up in advertising and news. Can you tell us what the advertising for
entertainment at TBS ex-sports is with Turner?
And also, my question is you spoke in answering Alexia's question about what went right at Turner. Is there anything
that you think will be changing in the next TV seasons and how you approach things? Thank you.
<A - John K. Martin>: Terrific, let me start with the last part. Listen, I think, to be completely candid, not everything
goes right in any of our businesses. But...
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: Wait, really?
<A - John K. Martin>: But I have to say we are off to a terrific start. And at this moment, I can't think of a thing that
if we were to look backwards that we would do differently, and really excited about looking forward. I think you
should expect us not only to continue to produce high-quality compelling programming, but to try to rebrand these
networks into – continue to be must-have distinctive destinations for original programming, acquired programming,
and sports. And so I couldn't be more proud of the team under David [Levy] and Kevin's direction and where we stand
today and where we're going. So the simple answer is really pleased, wouldn't really want to change a thing.
<A - Howard M. Averill>: In terms of advertising...
<Q - Vasily Karasyov>: And advertising and ratings for entertainment ex-sports and news?
<A - Howard M. Averill>: Yes, so I would say across the portfolio most of the growth did come from both news and
sports, which is why we have that diverse portfolio. Ratings on the entertainment networks, the audience levels were
down a bit, and the scatter pricing was not enough to offset that. But in aggregate, overall domestic entertainment
advertising was fine.

It comes from the line of Vijay Jayant from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
<Q - Vijay Jayant>: Thanks, just a question for Richard. I just wanted to understand. As HBO NOW is a stand-alone
product, trying to be an all-encompassing product for a consumer, is there an optimal amount of content you expect in
terms of new originals every year, split between comedies, dramas, kids? And as you go international, how much local
content do you need to make that a viable or a successful product rather? And where are we on that transition, if there is
one? Thank you.
<A - Richard L. Plepler>: In terms of how we aggregate our programming decisions, I think as you look at the
network right now, you see a textbook example of how we break up different genres, documentaries, mini-series,

half-hours, hours, original films, sports programming. And as I've said before, the mission of programming is to build
as many addicts as we can out there in the consumer base. And different people love different things. So you have huge
Silicon Valley fans, huge John Oliver and Bill Maher fans, huge sports fans. So we like the way we're breaking up our
choices. And a lot of this of course is informed by the talent that comes through the door. If somebody comes in with a
brilliant idea for an additional half-hour, we're not going to say no to it because we have a certain number that we think
is a ceiling. That's not how we make choices.
In terms of HBO NOW, what we have done is we've augmented our programming with decisions like Jon Stewart and
Vice News and I think Bill Simmons will work across all platforms. So again, that opportunity to not be constrained by
schedule is opening up a lot of creativity on the part of our talent who are coming in literally every week with new
ideas. So you're going to see more and more of that going forward.
So listen, we like our mix. We think if you look at just the Emmy nominations and the Emmy wins of last year, I think
the thing that was most rewarding for us was that they were across all categories, a wide range of categories, and I think
that's what makes our programming mix so special.
<Q - Vijay Jayant>: If I can try my luck, any update on HBO NOW subscriber numbers?
<A - Richard L. Plepler>: I'm not going to get into numbers other than to say that we've had a good start with sub
growth this year, both in terms of the traditional ecosystem and NOW, and we're very encouraged by what we're
seeing. And as we learn more and more about our subscribers and our marketing becomes more precise, particularly
with NOW, I think we're going to do even better.

<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my question, just one question for Howard.
Howard, the company had a really strong quarter across the board, beating Street estimates by a lot. But just on the
outlook, you didn't raise the outlook. So totally hear you on the 2Q items you mentioned in your prepared remarks. But
is this just a little bit of conservatism, or has the visibility around the rest-of-year expectations changed at all as you
look segment by segment? Thanks.
<A - Howard M. Averill>: We had a terrific first quarter, again, with a double-digit OI and the 25% EPS growth. We
are really pleased with how we're executing, and we see that continuing across our businesses. But look, it's still early
in the year. We did mention, and you just mentioned back, the fact that we are making some investments across the
business. And look, we're also mindful that FX can move around. So at this point, we're still comfortable with the $5.30
to $5.40, and we are on track clearly for that.

offerings. From your perspective, how do you think about the potential for them to expand or stabilize the pay TV

sight or confidence in improved sub trends as a result of new entrants or offerings?

<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: I think it's important to look basically to de-aggregate the performance in the
cable/telco/satellite world. So you do have affiliates, cable affiliates who are growing subs and penetration. And the
reason basically is they're offering very effective packages of VOD. They've got various packages at different prices
with different network bundles for consumers. They've got good guide interfaces. And so you have a fairly large
disparity in performance between distributors. And I think if you look at the high performers, you see where the future
can go. And the fact you that now have more VOD offerings and different packages and price points is basically, I
think, and we've seen it happen, it's going to increase penetration because consumers are going to find more packages
that suit what they want. And in most cases, that will be the biggest and largest packages of the big networks, but not in
all cases.
And so I think you're going to see – and remember, to the extent have you some marketing of VOD products, think of
broadband delivery with good navigation, it basically increases consumer demand, consumer recognition for powerful
networks like CNN, TNT, HBO. All of that has a national effect of increasing the presence of TV networks because all
age groups increasingly now are finding their favorite programs offered the way they want, and they find their way to
the networks if we sell them in the right distribution offering.
<A - John K. Martin>: Can I just say one thing? There are too many networks in the United States. And we've been
saying for years that there's going to be a rationalization of those networks. So as you think about subscription trends
going forward, I think there are going to be increasingly differentiated subscription trends, meaning that marginal or
lesser-valued networks are going to find it very difficult to keep their footing and keep pace with the best networks.
And I think further to what Jeff just said, as affiliates, whether they're traditional or non-traditional affiliates, put out
packages – smaller packages of better networks at lower economic price points, we're going to be able to attract back
households into the multi-channel ecosystem that have frankly moved away because they don't see the value of the
uber-bundles. That will be good for us.
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: Yes.
<Q - John Janedis>: Thanks. And then maybe separately, just back to HBO for a second, with Game of Thrones
premiering a week or two ago, can you talk about your confidence in the slate's ramping and accelerating subscriber
growth the rest of the year, and to what extent maybe the programming budget is locked in or may need to move
higher? And on HBO NOW, that you're a year in, can you share some data on how the subs are different from
traditional linear subs from either maybe a churn or engagement perspective? Thanks you.
<A - Richard L. Plepler>: Sure, the second first. Obviously, it's a younger demo. It's about a decade younger than our
traditional HBO sub.
In terms of the programming slate, look, we're very excited about what's coming, Vice Principals with Danny McBride,
Sarah Jessica Parker's Divorce, our co-production with Warner Bros., Westworld, just an extraordinary varied and
dynamic slate of stuff coming. And Game of Thrones also has a couple of years left as well before they finish out their
story.
<Q - John Janedis>: Richard, do HBO NOW subs churn more, or is it negligible?
<A - Richard L. Plepler>: Look, as we saw in the Nordics, churn was a bit elevated initially. But as you would expect,
the churn has been coming down as our subscriber base has aged. And I think as we continue to drive churn down over
time, we improve the service, we improve our UI and UX, we roll out more of the programming that I spoke of earlier,
I think we'll learn and we are learning how to better serve our customer and continue to effect a decline in churn.
<Q - John Janedis>: Thank you.

<Q - Bryan Kraft>: Hi, good morning. I had a question for Richard and for John. Richard, just a question on HBO,
following up on John's question. How do you gauge what is a successful show on HBO versus an unsuccessful one? Is
there a minimum audience level that you're looking for?
And then for John, John, I'm just curious. How is the reduction in ad loads at truTV going to impact pricing and
audience levels for advertising on the network? Do you see the increase in CPMs and ratings offsetting the reduction in
ad loads? Thank you.
<A - Richard L. Plepler>: On your question of how we gauge a successful show, look, it's largely about whether we
think something is elevating the brand, and that's obviously a subjective judgment that we make all the time. It's not so
much about rating as whether or not it's serving what we think is its design purpose to affect resonance with a particular
part of our consumer base. So as I said earlier, it's all about developing a kind of engagement with our subscriber. Some
people are going to look at Real Sports with the same degree of passion that other people look at Bill Maher or John
Oliver. Some people are going to look at Veep with the same passion that other people will look at Silicon Valley.
So this is a very subjective determination. We've been doing it for a long time. We think we have pretty good instincts
about how to build a large variety in our slate which appeals to a huge part of our consumer base. There's no exact
science to it. Obviously, critical acclaim plays a role. But we have a very good collective instinct inside the company
when we think something is resonating with a particular part of our audience. And we give our creative teams an
opportunity to stay with it and develop story and continue to build the show, as we've shown over many years.
<Q - Bryan Kraft>: Thanks.
<A - John K. Martin>: Thanks, it's John. With respect to – for anybody who's unaware, because you made reference
to truTV and ad loads, we had announced a number of months ago our intention that beginning in the fourth quarter of
this year, we're going to essentially take the number of minutes per hour on truTV dedicated to advertising, and we're
going to essentially cut it in half. And that again is consistent with our desire to evolve the industry. That's going to
simultaneously benefit our advertisers and improve the overall consumer experience.
I will tell you we are not doing it to lose money. So we fully intend to provide increased value per inventory unit that
we sell. And now it's up to you to us to demonstrate that, but we are actively going to be moving beyond the 30-second
spot business to create innovative new ad products for our advertisers and marketers. And we made a number of
announcements a number of months ago at CES, including Native Plus with longer-form brand ad breaks, and
Launchpad, which is a social tool, and Courageous, which is our own in-house ability to develop branded content in the
form of advertising. Again, I would say we're going to learn a lot, but we absolutely believe that this experiment is not
going to result in us taking a step back.
<Q - Bryan Kraft>: I just wanted to see if I could follow up on that. John, how are you thinking about the ad loads on
the other networks? Do you first do this with truTV, see what you learn, and then start thinking about the larger
networks, or is there anything that you're doing now in terms of ad load reductions on TBS and TNT?
<A - John K. Martin>: We're not doing anything material today. And one of the reasons why we are starting with this
commitment on truTV is obviously it's a network where we have less advertising exposure than some of our larger
networks like TBS and TNT. Having said that, the type of approach and ideology that we have with truTV, which we
think will succeed, we're already beginning to plan for on some of our other networks, and I believe it was Kevin Reilly
at TCA [Television Critics Association] that mentioned that on some of our new original programming, we're actually
going to be making more minutes of content, with the expectation that on a number of those new original scripted
series, we'll probably be running fewer ad commercial breaks. So this is going to be an evolution, but it's something
that we're planning now for what's going to take place in the future.
<Q - Bryan Kraft>: Thanks to you both.

I just want to thank everyone for hanging in through our medical section and hope you can all see how we're so excited
about not only our prospects for the business this year but in the years out beyond that. We think the company is very
well positioned, and the evolution at the networks, at Warner's is going global, is proceeding as well as I could have
hoped. And I'm also seeing a lot of encouragement in industry developments. I think the industry around the world is
finally starting to catch up to the innovation speed necessary to take this huge value that's resident in all the network
offerings, not just ours, and bring it to consumers in the way that consumers increasingly want. So we're quite
encouraged about the environment that we're operating in and particularly our strength relative to the others.

Thanks, everybody. Have a great day.
