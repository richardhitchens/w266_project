Inge G. Thulin
Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Overall, this was a good quarter for
3M, marked by broad-based organic growth and margin expansion. We continue to operate in an uncertain global
economic environment, which softened growth. At the same time, we grew organically in all geographic areas,
expanded margins a full percentage point and increased net income. Most importantly, we maintained our commitment
to managing 3M for the long term with strong investments in our portfolio.
Let's go through a few of the second quarter's numbers. Earnings per share rose to $2.02, a 5.8% increase
year-over-year. Our team posted local currency sales growth of 2% company-wide. On an ex- Electronic basis, growth
was 2.2%, the same as Q1. And I will talk more about our Electronics business shortly.
Organic growth was positive in all geographic areas, paced by the United States at 4%. Four of our five business groups
grew organically, led by Safety and Graphics at 5%, followed by Consumer and Healthcare businesses at 3%. Growth
in Industrial slowed a bit to 1% as we experienced channel inventory adjustments in the general industrial markets. And
Electronics & Energy declined 3% organically in the quarter. This business will face the tough year-on-year
comparison and we also saw somewhat softer consumer demand in the electronics markets. However, even in softer
market condition, we increased margins in Electronics & Energy to more than 21% for the second straight quarter.
As you recall, last year, we consolidated a number of businesses within Electronics & Energy to better align to
customers and generate efficiencies, and that portfolio work is paying off. I'm pleased with the progress of this business
and going forward, the team is focused on driving spec-in wins, increasing productivity and advancing our technology's
capabilities. In the second quarter, we saw continued strength of the U.S. dollar, which reduced company-wide sales by
7.3%. As a result, total sales declined 5.5% to $7.7 billion.
We increased 3M's operating margins to 23.9%, up 1.1 percentage points. This marks the seventh consecutive quarter
of year-on-year margin expansion, company-wide. Our margins remain strong and broad-based as all business groups
posted margins greater than 21%. This is a testament to the strengths of our portfolio and business model and our
business teams around the world driving productivity each and every day.
In the second quarter, we also continued to actively deploy capital in order to improve the business and return cash to
shareholders. We returned $2.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And just last month,
we announced the acquisition of Capital Safety. Capital Safety is a leading global provider of fall protection equipment
and will bolster 3M's Personal Safety business, which is a strategic priority in our portfolio. This acquisition builds
upon a number of out-of-portfolio actions we have taken to strengthen our portfolio.
Please turn to slide number four. Portfolio management is one of our three strategic levers and is vital to our success.
To succeed in the long term, we must constantly evolve to meet the changing demand of our customers and the global
economy. Back in 2012, we began a comprehensive review of 3M's portfolio and started to make changes to better
align our portfolio to our long-term strategic objectives. This includes reallocation of resources to our best
opportunities. It also means taking actions to create greater value such as combining businesses within our company to
increase customer relevance, scale and productivity; acquiring businesses that align with 3M's fundamental strength
and strategic objectives; and divesting businesses that no longer align with those strengths or objectives.
In the first half of 2015, we took action on all fronts. Earlier this month, for example, we combined two of our
healthcare businesses. Our Dental and Orthodontic businesses, which are both recognized for their strong technology
and brands were merged to form a single oral care solution business. Now, through a seamless and single partnership,
we can offer customers an entire suite of oral care innovations, thus increasing our relevance and generating efficiency.
In fact, since 2012, we have consolidated businesses with each of our business groups. As a result, we have moved
from six business groups to five and from 40 businesses to 26.
Next, our acquisitions. Earlier, I talked about last month's announcement of Capital Safety. In February, we also
announced a $1 billion acquisition of Polypore's Separations Media business, which will enhance 3M's core filtration

platform. And in March, we acquired Ivera Medical, a strategic addition to our Healthcare business group. At the same
time, in January, we sold our Static Control business after thorough strategic review. Because of our team's work, 3M is
now leaner, more focused and better positioned to win big opportunities and create greater value for customers and
ultimately, for our shareholders today and even more so in the future.
Thank you. And now I will turn the call over to Nick for more details on the quarter. Nick?
Nicholas C. Gangestad
Thank you, Inge, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin on slide five, where I will describe the elements of
second-quarter sales growth. We generated organic local currency growth of 1.8% with volumes contributing 0.8% to
our growth and selling prices adding 1%. The sales impact from acquisitions, net of divestitures, was neutral in the
quarter. Positive growth related to the Ivera Medical acquisition was offset by our divestiture of the Static Control
business.
Foreign exchange impacts reduced sales by 7.3 percentage points in the second quarter. The most notable currencies
impacting sales were the euro, yen and Brazilian real, which devalued versus the U.S. dollar by 20%, 17% and 28%,
respectively. In dollar terms, worldwide sales declined 5.5% versus second quarter of 2014.
On a geographic basis, the United States led the way with organic local currency growth of 4.1%. U.S. growth was
broad-based, led by Safety & Graphics and Consumer at 6%, Healthcare at 4% and Industrial at 3%.
Latin America/Canada posted organic growth of 0.8% in the quarter. Growth was positive in our Healthcare and
Industrial businesses while Safety & Graphics and Electronics & Energy both declined organically. Mexico delivered
another outstanding result with 17% organic growth in the quarter and Brazil turned positive with 1% growth. The
impact of year-on-year sales declines in Venezuela reduced organic growth in Latin America/Canada by four
percentage points in the quarter. This headwind is behind us starting in Q3.
Organic local currency growth in Asia-Pacific was 0.5% in the quarter with Healthcare and Safety & Graphics each
growing 9% and Consumer growing 3%. Electronics & Energy declined 4% organically in Asia-Pacific. Organic
growth was down 2% in China/Hong Kong in the second quarter. Healthcare delivered strong growth, which was offset
by declines in Safety & Graphics, Electronics & Energy and Consumer. We continued to see the Chinese economy
adjusting to new growth levels and we saw channel adjustments in some key end markets which impacted our growth.
For the full year 2015, we now expect organic growth in China/Hong Kong to be in the mid-single digit range versus
mid to high single digits previously.
Japan delivered another good quarter with second-quarter organic growth of 2%, or up 7% excluding electronics.
Healthcare and Safety & Graphics posted strong organic growth followed by steady growth in our Consumer and
Industrial businesses.
Turning to EMEA, organic growth was 0.4% in Q2 with West Europe declining 1%. Organic growth in Central East
Europe increased high single digits while Middle East/Africa was down mid-single digits. Organic growth in EMEA
was led by Safety & Graphics at 4%. Healthcare was flat, and Industrial, Consumer and Electronics & Energy each
declined 1%.
Please turn to slide six for the second-quarter P&L highlights. Second-quarter sales were $7.7 billion. Operating
margins improved by 1.1 percentage points year-on-year to 23.9%. Strong gross margin improvements along with
productivity drove the second quarter operating margin performance. Let me cover the primary components of the
change in margin. On the positive side, the combination of lower raw material costs and higher selling prices
contributed 150 basis points of margin expansion. Pricing performance in the second quarter remained steady driven by
continued new product flow across our businesses and price increases in select countries to help mitigate the impact of
currency devaluations.

We continue to benefit from lower raw material costs and expect this trend to continue throughout the year.
Commodity prices remain favorable and our global sourcing teams continue to generate additional cost reductions.
Productivity remained strong in the second quarter, adding 50 basis points to margins driven by Lean Six Sigma efforts,
returns on past portfolio actions, and continuing to prioritize investments. Strategic investments reduced margins by 30
basis points. This includes our ERP and business transformation effort, increased R&D investments and the disruptive
innovation along with portfolio management actions. These investments will strengthen 3M for the future.
Finally, higher pension and OPEB expense reduced second quarter operating margins by 60 basis points. As a
reminder, this year's pension expense increase is due to the adoption of new mortality tables along with a lower
discount rate. For the full year, we continue to expect operating margins to increase by approximately one percentage
point.
Let's now turn to slide seven for a closer look at earnings per share. Earnings per share for the second quarter was
$2.02, a year-on-year increase of 5.8%. Organic growth and margin expansion contributed $0.12 to the EPS increase in
the quarter. This result includes a negative $0.05 impact from higher year-on-year pension and OPEB expense.
Foreign currency impacts net of hedging reduced pre-tax earnings by $110 million or the equivalent of $0.12 a share.
The second quarter tax rate was 28.1% versus 29.5% in last year's comparable quarter, which increased earnings by
$0.04 per share. The reduction in the tax rate versus last year's Q2 was driven by adjustments to tax reserves, which
were partially offset by geographic profit mix. Reserve adjustments were anticipated in our tax rate guidance. Finally,
average diluted shares outstanding reduced – declined by 3% versus last year's second quarter – which added $0.07 to
second quarter earnings per share.
Let's now review cash flow. Please turn to slide number eight. Second quarter operating cash flow was $1.3 billion,
down $300 million year-on-year. The majority of the year-on-year decline was due to higher cash taxes. We invested
$370 million in capital expenditures during the second quarter, up $29 million year-on-year. For the full year, we
continue to expect capital expenditures in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. Second quarter free cash flow was $1
billion, and we converted 74% of net income to cash. For the full year, we continue to expect free cash flow conversion
in the range of 90% to 100%. Cash dividends paid were $646 million in the second quarter, up $90 million
year-on-year. As reminder, we increased the per share dividend by 20% this past February, which marks the 57th
consecutive year of dividend increases.
Gross share repurchases were $1.7 billion in the second quarter, up $269 million compared to Q2 2014. Through the
first half of 2015, we have repurchased $2.6 billion of our own shares. We now expect full year gross share repurchases
to be in the range of $4 billion to $5 billion versus a prior expectation of $3 billion to $5 billion.
Let's now review our second quarter performance on a business by business basis, starting with our Industrial business.
Please turn to slide number nine. Industrial posted sales of $2.6 billion in the quarter with organic local currency
growth of 1.4%. Industrial's organic growth was led by 3M purification and aerospace and commercial transportation,
each generating double-digit growth in the quarter. The automotive OEM business posted mid-single-digit growth in
the quarter versus a slight year-on-year decline in global car and light truck builds. We continue to improve our market
share in this large and important market. We also delivered positive organic growth in automotive aftermarket in Q2,
while the Industrial Adhesives & Tapes business was flat.
On a geographic basis, the U.S. and Latin America/Canada set the pace with each posting organic growth of 3%.
Asia-Pacific was flat, while EMEA declined 1%. The Industrial business delivered operating income of $609 million in
the second quarter. Operating margins were a strong 23.1%, up 120 basis points year-over-year, boosted by positive
price, raw materials.
Let's now turn to Safety and Graphics on slide 10. Second quarter sales in Safety and Graphics were $1.4 billion,
increasing 4.9% organically. All businesses within the portfolio grew organically, led by the roofing granules business,
which posted strong double-digit growth in the quarter. Personal Safety, one of 3M's heartland businesses, grew
mid-single digits in the quarter. This business is a strategic priority for 3M for several reasons, including our strong
product portfolio, fast growing end markets, and increasing regulatory standards across developed and developing

markets. As Inge mentioned, the Capital Safety acquisition will strengthen this business even further.
Geographically, organic sales growth in Safety and Graphics was 9% in Asia-Pacific, 6% in the U.S., and 4% in
EMEA. Latin America/Canada declined 2%. Operating income was $364 million, and operating margins increased 1.8
percentage points to 25.4%. Margin improvements were driven by price, raw material benefits, along with productivity
and portfolio management actions.
Let's now turn to Health Care. Please turn to slide 11. Health Care delivered sales of $1.4 billion in the second quarter
with organic growth of 3.4%. We continue to see broad-based organic growth across much of the health care portfolio
including food safety, health information systems, oral care, critical and chronic care, and infection prevention. Drug
delivery systems, which is a project-based business, declined year-on-year. The Ivera Medical acquisition added 70
basis points to Health Care sales growth in the quarter.
Geographically, organic growth in Health Care was led by Asia-Pacific at 9%, with strong contributions from both
Japan and China/Hong Kong. Latin America/Canada grew 5%, the U.S. was up 4%, and EMEA was flat. Health Care's
operating income was $440 million and margins rose 160 basis points to 32.3%. Primary drivers of margin expansion
included strong productivity and price raw material benefits.
Next we will look at Electronics & Energy on slide 12. In Electronics & Energy, sales were $1.3 billion for the quarter,
down 3% in organic local currency. Operating margins increased 60 basis points to 21.2% and operating income was
$277 million in the quarter. Our portfolio management actions in this business continue to yield benefits for our
customers and improve productivity, which is leading to strong operating margin performance. Organic local currency
sales declined 2% on the electronics side of the business. As Inge commented, we experienced softer conditions in the
electronics market for the quarter. The business remains focused on continuing to drive successful spec-in wins with
electronic OEMs. In our energy-related businesses, organic local currency sales were down 3%, consistent with first
quarter growth patterns.
On a geographic basis, organic sales growth in Electronics & Energy increased 1% in the U.S. EMEA declined 1%,
Asia-Pacific was down 4%, and Latin America/Canada declined 7%. The divestiture of the Static Control business
reduced sales by 70 basis point in the second quarter.
Please turn to slide 13. Second quarter sales in consumer were $1.1 billion with organic growth of 3.4%. We grew
organically across the portfolio with particular strength in the do-it-yourself business led by strong growth of Scotch
Blue Painter's Tape. Our stationery and office supply, home care and consumer health care businesses also delivered
positive organic growth in the quarter. Second quarter is typically when we begin to see the impact of the
back-to-school season. Growth has been encouraging to this point, most notably in our line of Scotch brand home and
office tapes and command solutions, which eliminate the need to pound nails into walls when hanging pictures,
decorations, or other items.
Looking at the consumer business geographically, organic growth was led by the U.S. at 6% and Asia-Pacific at 3%.
Latin America/Canada was flat and EMEA declined 1%. Operating income increased to $259 million and margins were
23.3%, up 2.2 percentage points year-over-year. Margins were boosted by lower raw material costs, portfolio
prioritization, strong productivity, and timing of promotional programs.
That wraps up our review of the second quarter business results. I will turn it back over to Inge for an update on our
2015 planning estimates.
Inge G. Thulin
Thank you, Nick. Overall, 3M delivered a good second quarter performance. Organic growth remained broad-based
and we continued to generate premium margins across the portfolio. Looking across 3M's entire team, I'm very pleased
with our execution and discipline in an uncertain economical environment, which is evident in our strong productivity.
Going forward, we expect that economic uncertainty remains through the year. In fact, external growth forecasts have
continued to moderate over the last several months.

As a result, today, we are updating our guidance for the full year. We now expect organic growth of 2.5% to 4% versus
the prior expectation of 3% to 6%. With respect to earnings, we now anticipate EPS in the range of $7.80 to $8.00
versus the prior range of $7.80 to $8.10. The rest of the guidance remains in place. As you can see, we still expect
currency to reduce sales by 6% to 7%. Our tax rate guidance is unchanged to 28.5% to 29.5%, and we continue to
expect the free cash flow conversion rate of 90% to 100%.
Like always, our 3M teams are focused on executing our plan, making investment for the future and managing those
things within our control; in other words, controlling the controllable. As I described earlier, our portfolio is strong and
getting stronger as a result of our recent investments. Going forward, each of our businesses will continue to be
bolstered by 3M's four fundamental strengths – technology, manufacturing, global capabilities, and our brand. Those
strengths are leveraged across our company and will allow us to gain market share, maintain world class margins and
generate efficient growth in the future.
Thank you for your attention, and we will now take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Please limit your participation to one question and one follow-up. One moment please while we
compile the Q&A roster. And our first question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed
with your question.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: Thank you, and good morning, everyone.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Joe.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: Inge, maybe just touching on organic growth for a second. You're kind of tracking towards
the lower end of the full year guide so far year-to-date and there still seems to be a lot of uncertainty in the
environment. And so I'm just wondering, how are you thinking about your base case for the rest of the year just given
what you are seeing geographically and across your product portfolio?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah, well, as you recall, we saw – all of us, right – saw a slow economic environment coming
early in the year. And after the first quarter, we thought it was too early for us to change the guidance for the year. And
I think now as we moved in and saw the second quarter coming through here, I think it's the right thing to make sure
that we adjust that guidance. And the way we now, you can see, basically the industrial production index came down
even here a couple of weeks ago from 2.6% to 2.1%. So based on that and based on our portfolio, we think it's prudent
for us to take it now to 2.5% to 4% versus what we had earlier.
I would say, if I just comment on the organic growth for the quarter, the thing that changed for us in the quarter was
basically the electronics. Electronics was two things. One was a tougher comparison versus last year. We had 10%
organic local currency growth a year ago, and then that became some softness in that segment. So when I look upon it,
the second quarter is very similar to the first quarter in terms of growth excluding that piece, right? And so, I think that
the 2.5% to 4%, I think that's reasonable guidance for us and we should be able to come somewhere in the middle of
that.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: Okay. All right. That's helpful. And maybe I'll just follow-up there on the electronics
business. Typically there's – you see some type of seasonal uptick in the second quarter, particularly from a margin
standpoint – I think very few years have you seen a sequential decline in margins on electronics. And I'm just trying to
get a better understanding on what's driving the weakness. How are utilization rates? How do you view the channel
from an inventory standpoint? And then how should we think about that margin trajectory moving forward?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Joe, this is Nick. The margin, we expanded margin here 60 basis points year-on-year
against a quarter that was fairly strong second quarter of last year. What's been enhancing our margin and will continue

to enhance our margin is some of the portfolio management actions that we've been taking in that business that increase
our cost competitiveness. That's what's been driving it in the last few quarters and we continue to see that driving it in
the next few quarters, Joe.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: Okay. And then, I guess just a commentary on the end market from a utilization standpoint
and from an inventory standpoint? What's your stance for what's happening in the channel today?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Well, I think it's more, as you know, we are spec-in on most devices in the industry. And what
is happening from time to time is maybe a little bit of a delay of a new product introduction. And that will, of course,
then impact us immediately. So I think the way I look upon this is to say we are making the same progress now as in
the past relative to our spec-in. And we didn't see any big change relative to inventory levels, which you maybe then
also can see relative to purchasing, right? So if there was a little bit of delay of some new product introductions, and
they didn't build inventory, right? They kind of slowed it down, and that's impacting us as well.
I will make the comment, though, on that business, if we just put this in perspective and why I am pleased with the
performance there. You'll recall that we started that business with margins around 15.7%, 15.8% or something, and
now moved that up to 21%. And the question was always, is this volume driven? And my answer was always, no, the
action we have taken on the portfolio in order to get the more efficient organization better aligned to customers and
have better asset utilization, meaning if we will have from a quarter that will happen in that business a little bit slower
growth, we will be able to hold margin at the high level, meaning it's not volume related. I think we proved that, in this
quarter, we proved that that model is correct. So volume went down a little bit, and in fact, we had margin expansion in
that business. For that, and on the work we have done in our portfolio, I am personally very pleased with what that
team have done relative to that portfolio work.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: Yeah, it's a fair point. Thanks, Inge and Nick. I'll get back in queue.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Yeah. Thanks, and good morning, guys.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Good morning.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: So I think if we back out Electronics & Energy, which is a little bit choppier around the quarters, I
think the growth is the lowest we've seen since the recovery. So I'm just wondering maybe just, Inge, maybe just some
commentary on the macro environment. Do you view this as a speed bump and we get beyond this and back into that
4% or 5% zone? Or do you think there's something a bit more awry here?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah, well, first of all, I think let's hold it to the year here, when we start talking to 2.5% to 4%,
right, so we don't go ahead of ourselves relative to the future. But I think when I look upon it is to say, first of all,
United States is very solid. We had a 4% organic local currency growth; we grew in all businesses. It is very solid. And
as you recall, hopefully recall, a quarter ago, that growth was slightly lower, and the question were then, are you
concerned about U.S.? Our answer was no, not necessarily, and I think with 4% growth here, that's good.
In Asia or APAC, Japan did well. Japan had 2% growth excluding Electronics, which is the biggest business at 7%
growth. China was slow; it slowed down and they are adjusting to a new growth level there and we are now talking
about mid-single digits for the year. And I think we have to wait a little bit to see what will happen there. It's a big
economy, as you know. We have a strong position, but I think that growth need to pick up more, specifically in the
domestic markets. And there was – Health Care did well for us there – the other businesses went basically sideways.

West Europe, we all predicted that there will be a growth pick-up based on the euro situation. So far, we have not seen
that. And probably will come later in the year, but I think it will be very late in the year.
Latin America is doing fine and as you see again, Mexico had 17% growth; now is the first quarter in many quarters
that we saw a slight improvement in Brazil. And as Nick said, Venezuela is now behind us in terms of comparison as
we go into Q3. And so I think that is my view on it. So I would say I will not talk about higher figures then the 2.5% to
4%, at least that we're doing for this year. And then we have to see how Q3 and Q4 will work out here.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. And perhaps – thanks, Inge – thanks for that commentary. You mentioned here, let's see, in
3Q, you gave some good color on the last call on 2Q trends to-date, which turned out to be pretty prescient. So, how...
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Can you repeat that? On which one?
<Q - Nigel Coe>: I'm just wondering how's 3Q tracking.
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Nigel, we're not really seeing any change in trends from what we saw in Q2. We saw
things pretty stable within Q2 and we're not seeing so far in the third quarter any change in that pattern.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. That's really helpful. And just a quick one on Health Care. You mentioned drug deliveries
being – as being product-based – and that was a factor last quarter. If we back out the impacts of drug delivery, how did
that look? How did Health Care look ex- that?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: That business in total, Nigel, brought down the growth for Health Care by
approximately one percentage point.

<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Good morning.
<Q - Jermaine Brown>: Good morning. This is actually Jermaine Brown filling in for David.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Okay. Good morning to you.
<Q - Jermaine Brown>: Two questions. Good morning. Your gross margins in Q2 expanded only slightly more than
Q1. For H2, should we expect a greater raw material benefit or is Q1 and Q2 a good guide for what we should expect
for margins within the second half?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: We see the raw material benefit being pretty evenly spread between first half and
second half. I would say the first half is a very good guide for the second half.
<Q - Jermaine Brown>: Understood. And my second question is your demand within Asia Pacific, particularly China,
decelerated. I'd imagine that some of that was due to lower electronics demand, but were there any other businesses or
end markets that also contributed to that decline?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Our declines there, we were up in our Health Care business. Electronics & Energy was,
yes, of course, one of the declines. The others in China/Hong Kong were a deceleration from the growth we saw in the
first quarter.

Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Thanks, and good morning, guys.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Steven.
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Good morning.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Could you talk a little bit about, I want to dive into Capital Safety a little bit since haven't
had the opportunity to do much of that. You talked about in the release, 14 times EBITDA multiple. I think that
included synergies. It's clearly a very, at least I think, it's a very attractive company and segment. But maybe talk
through, number one, what was that multiple excluding that impact in that one year timeframe? And how do you think
about pricing in general, given that you're obviously allocating more funds to bigger M&A? I'm just trying to get a
sense for how you thought about the return profile on that one and in general.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah, well, first of all, the Capital Safety is in our view a perfect fit for 3M. Fraud protection,
which is the segment, is among the fastest growing and most profitable segments in the PP industry. And Capital Safety
is recognized as a leader in fraud protection. So you take those things together, there is high complementary synergies
to 3M's global business in Personal Safety, which is a heartland division. So Capital Safety, the thing about it, it
provides accretive growth to us and also margins, both for Safety and Graphics and for overall 3M. And you saw the
result again here for Safety and Graphics which is very, very good, right, and have, as I said earlier, it's the business
group that I thought will have the real breakout as we go. So I think it's a very valued and good acquisition to us.
The compounded annual sales growth have been over 10% for the full last year's, and EBITDA margin is approaching
40%. So you have all those type of things that you lay then back to the portfolio work we did where you say, well, you
know, how can we build out our businesses and make sure that we get more relevance with our customers as we move
ahead and drive synergies? So when I think about it in totality and the figures you are quoting there is correct. It's
actually 12 X based on five year run rate synergies, but I think this is, for us, a terrific acquisition that is building out
our position.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Okay. And so, do you think about it in terms of return on capital over that timeframe as
well?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Certainly, Steve, we're looking at return on capital and looking at the time it takes us to
bring this back to a return on capital. And for us, that's in the fifth or sixth year that we see this meeting, on a cash
basis, our return on capital, our cost of capital.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Okay. All right. And then just on the pricing versus raw, you already talked about the raw's
comment. Pricing was another 1% again this quarter, very strong, obviously, dealing with FX and other issues. Maybe
talk about the sustainability of pricing within that equation going forward.
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Yes. Well, I'll just, on the margin front, just to clarify, of that 150 basis points, about
60 of those basis points are coming from our price growth and 90 basis points from our raw material reductions. As far
as the sustainability of price, we're at about a 1% price increase on average through the first half of the year. We see
that trend sustaining through the second half of the year.

<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Okay. All right. And is that mostly just, again, that's independent of new products? It's just
pure price increases on the existing portfolio?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: On our existing portfolio. I would add the color that if you look at all of our price
growth, the fact that we keep refreshing our product line with our investments that we're making in research and
development, that does enable us through the value we're creating for our customers to be able to sustain pricing
growth. But the other part of our price growth in the second quarter and for the year, is also driven by movements
related to FX. If I look at second quarter standalone, of our total price growth, we estimate 25% of that total price
growth is coming from pricing based on the value we're creating for our customers and 75% based on movements we're
taking directly or indirectly related to FX movements.

Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Hi. Good morning, guys.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Scott.
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Good morning.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: I was a little bit surprised in Capital Safety, you said year five or six, reach your cost of capital
and I am assuming your – I'll ask the question, what you think your cost of capital is, but let's just say for the sake of
argument it's somewhere in the 9% range. I would think when you're buying a business like this in an industry you
know so well and so easily integratable, that you'd be able to earn a higher return on that. On the other side of it, just
indicates that maybe you overpaid. I hate to be skeptical on that stuff, but maybe can you address it a bit?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Part of our portfolio prioritization is we know the assets we want to buy; we know
where we can drive the most value. As we look at this business integrated with our Personal Safety business, we do see
cost synergies that we'll be deriving; we see sales synergies, both of those contributing to get that result. What you're
seeing here, Scott, is a result of us having a clear vision of what we wanted to add to our portfolio and also an asset that
we can see bringing a good financial return to 3M.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: I think that partially answers it. I think what I'm – partially what I'm saying is if you look at
future acquisitions, is this going to be the type of hurdle rate you're looking for going forward? Because from my
perspective, you would probably – if all you can do is earn an 8% or 9% return five years out and there's risk, you
could probably get that just buying your own stock.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: The answer to that is not necessarily, Scott. I think you have to look upon this – first, look upon
this acquisition – first of all, clearly it's strategic in terms of the outcome of the portfolio work, right? So I think that's
an important element. There are certain pieces of the business that can be integrated and where we can drive synergy.
Others cannot. And the reason for that is that there's a high element of regulation and education in that fall protection.
So we need to continue to invest in that and make sure that we do everything that is right.
So there's two elements into it, right? It's some pieces from the commercialization perspective where we can drive a lot
of synergy, and we will. And the other piece, I think we still need to figure out how we can accelerate that to get the
return even faster. It's a highly regulated business, as you know, and then by that, the advantage of that, the barrier to
enter is very high. So you have to think about as you get it integrated and as you move on it, you have to make sure that
you can drive more synergy. But the answer to your question, necessarily not, this was a specific case, right, so this is a
very important strategic move for us in order to build out our position here and it's a high class asset. It's a high class

asset that is very similar to 3M in terms of margins, returns and growth and so forth. So we can...
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: I agree.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Huh?
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: I agree. No, that's – it's, I think more specifically, just trying to get a sense of the future and you
handled that.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Right. But if you – the other thing here, Scott, if you look at our other acquisitions we have
done from Sumitomo to Ceradyne, et cetera, we are not even be close to this, right? But I would say, we can always
argue day-out and day-in of the valuation. Did you pay too much, or whatever. This is a strategic, fantastic move for us
with a world-class asset. So I'm pleased with that piece, and now it's up to us to drive the return even faster back to us.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay. That's a good answer. Just to be a little bit more, dig in a little more detail on that. You
mentioned EBITDA margin of 40% on Capital Safety. Is that something, can that be a 50% EBITDA margin business,
or is it more of a function you can bring Capital Safety in and the rest of your Safety products businesses go up? Or is it
Capital Safety itself can see a margin blip?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: All right, Scott, we see modest gross margin expansion opportunities there. We
probably see more of our cost synergy benefits coming from the back office, SG&A front than on the gross margin
front.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay. That's helpful. So, thanks, guys. I'll pass it on.

<Q - Deane Dray>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Deane.
<Q - Deane Dray>: And let me say congrats to Matt and Bruce on their new responsibilities.
<A>: Thank you, Deane.
<Q - Deane Dray>: Just, sorry to pile on on the Capital Safety deal, but this was the largest deal you've ever done. And
if I'm not mistaken, this was not the first time you had the opportunity to buy this asset, so why did you pass on it
before? And then, you were already in fall protection, because I've been to trade shows where we've had
demonstrations of fall protection. So how does capital safety expand your product line and where might there be
overlaps?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah, you are right, Deane, that we had a small presence in that segment. We were very, very
small, and one thing that I have learned over the years I have done business, if you do not have a reasonable, good
market share position, you will over time lose out, right? So I've been in businesses over time where you think that a
couple of percentage market share will take you to a better position. It's very, very tough. So you need to come into a
leading position. So that was one. So, yeah, we were there. We were, in my view, not relevant enough for the industry.
So very opportunistic.
Now let's go back to your comment, what I think, to why now? I talked about in my speech before, but I have to go
back to it, because I think this is an important element. If you don't have a clear picture of where you would like to go
in the future with your portfolio, you could have a tendency to try to be part of auctions on most things that becoming
available, right? And if you are part of bidding on most things that becoming available, you maybe don't really know if
this is a real important strategic imperative for you and you should go for it. I would say, I was not part of 2008 and

2010, whatever, when there was bid on that assets, but maybe at that point in time it was not clear enough relative to
the portfolio where we should invest for the future. This time was very, very clear for me where we should go. That's
the answer from me.
<Q - Deane Dray>: Inge, thanks for that context. And just one follow-up on the Mexico organic revenue growth, 17%
really jumps out. What was driving that and expectations for the balance of the year?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah, Mexico has now been growing for almost two years, right? Doing very, very well. And
it's, I would say, a combination of both domestic market growing well there, but also the overall Mexican economy in
terms of export specifically into the United States. And we have a very good portfolio balance in Mexico. As you
know, we've been there for a long time and we're able to capitalize on that. So I don't know exactly if I can give you the
– no, no, but his question is about the outlook for the year in Mexico – I think our growth rate here today is around
15%, and I don't expect for the rest of the year that that would slow down. But all business is doing well there, and
specifically, Industrial is growing very, very fast.

<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Shannon.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Hey, on this China expectation for the year, up mid-single digits, China/Hong Kong, it
was up 7% in the first, down 2% in the second. What gets better from here to even get you to the mid-single digits? I
mean, you've talk about the – maybe you said inventory, channel adjustments, maybe just any other color on what you
expect to improve in the current rate.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah, I think that, first of all, I believe that Health Care will continue – very good quarter in
Health Care – Health Care will continue and Consumer will improve specifically. I also think that the Industrial
business, that it is a sizable business for us there, will improve slightly as we go for the year. So when you think about
our portfolio, if we get Industrial slightly better, if we get Consumer up a little bit, which we will, and then Health Care
continuing, that will take us there.
I don't comment on Electronics, because as you know, Electronic is like of a business that is on a regional base.
Sometimes Japan is doing better than China and so forth, right, so let's see how much that will be executed in China.
But it's – I think there is still a time in here that we have to see the adjustment in the Chinese market – but all three
businesses specifically will improve for us slightly as we go for the rest of the year.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: And in terms of those improvements in Industrial and Consumer, I mean, is that based
on just sort of timing or ending of channel reductions, or is this improvement in the economy?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: That – yeah, yeah. No, that is what we are counting on. We cannot count on anything else,
right, but that's what we are counting on.

<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay. And then within the Industrial business, I mean, all the end markets you
commented on sounded reasonably good, but the whole segment grew 1.4%. Was there anything within that segment
that was dragging it down from the decent trends in auto and other stuff?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Yeah, our Industrial Adhesives and Tapes business within Industrial, that's one of the
businesses that was flat, and that helped – that contributed to bringing the total organic growth down. Abrasives is
another business that was down.

<Q - Andrew Obin>: Hey, guys. Good morning.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Andrew.
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Good morning.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Just to clarify on the Safety acquisition, you said it's going to be dilutive from the first – for – in
the first 12 months. When are we expecting to close it, in the third quarter, right? Is that dilution incorporated in the
updated guidance?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Andrew, yeah, we've said that for the first 12 months we expect this to be dilutive to
GAAP EPS by $0.04. I – we expect this to close in the third quarter, in the middle of the third quarter – and our
guidance is not yet including the impact of either the Capital Safety or the completion of the Polypore acquisition.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: And just to clarify, in terms of oil prices have been coming down quite a bit since the end of the
quarter, and I know you've updated what you think the impact is going to be in terms of your inputs. But is that – when
did you update your outlook for oil prices? Is it updated for the decline that we've seen over the past several weeks?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Yes, we – it is updated – and similar to what I said in April, where we see ourselves
now at the high end of the range of $0.25 benefit on raw materials, benefits as well as the margin impact I talked about
earlier. That's reflecting where we are, the most recently with commodity prices. So yes, it is reflecting that, Andrew.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: And just a broader question. As all of a sudden North America U.S. is the fastest-growing
market, right, it has lower margins, emerging markets are slowing. Are you guys thinking about adjusting your
longer-term plan given where the macro is playing out? Or do you think the existing game plan is adaptable to what
you're seeing?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah, the existing game plan is adaptable to what we are seeing. It's no change from that
thinking at that point in time. And as you know, if you think about the five-year plan, we are three years into it and
there's always some changes going in and out in a plan, right, in terms of all metrics. But at this point in time, of course
from an execution perspective on where you invest for manufacturing and so forth, there is some differences now
versus when there was three years ago or where will you invest in international, right? Or will you do it in the United
States? So, I think that's a business call on a day-to-day business, but at this point in time, there is no change from the
overall plan and our playbook is working, right. Our playbook is working.

Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - C. Stephen Tusa>: Hey. Good morning.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Hey, good morning, Steve.
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Good morning.
<Q - C. Stephen Tusa>: So, I guess, just back to Shannon's questions, but a little bit more of a broad sense. Can you
give us a little color on what you'd expect on a core basis for kind of how the third and the fourth quarter play out? I
know that you have a little bit of an easier comp in the fourth and then a little bit – in the third – and then a tougher
comp in the fourth. I'm just kind of curious to see, to his question but more broadly, what gets better here from the
1.8% that you put out this quarter?
<A - Matthew Ginter>: Okay. So, Steve, just to clarify, you're talking total company?
<Q - C. Stephen Tusa>: Total co or core. So the 1.8%. What is the 1.8%, kind of how does that trend in the third and
the fourth quarter? Is it steady? Or little bit better in the third, worse in the fourth?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: In our 2.5% to 4%, I can't say we're seeing a noticeable difference between third and
fourth quarter, if you're looking for some color on that, Steve. In the two – on the low end of the range – it would be a
continuation of the growth rate that we've seen in the first half, that that continues into both the third and fourth quarter.
If we shade towards the middle or the high end of the range, we would start – expect to start to see that occurring in the
third quarter and not all in the fourth quarter.
<Q - C. Stephen Tusa>: Okay. And did things get, how did things trend as you kind of went around the quarter? How
was kind of April, May, June type of dynamics?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: When we look on this on a sales per billing day, we saw virtually no change in our
trends between the three months of the second quarter.
<Q - C. Stephen Tusa>: Okay. And then one last question, just on the pricing dynamics. I guess you said 70% or 75%
of that is kind of forex related. So, I mean, as we kind of lap these forex comps, I guess as we move into next year, I
guess you're going to have first quarter comps. So does that mean that that 1% is probably – since your second half is
probably going to be a little bit less than 7% year-over-year, I guess, on forex – does that mean that 1% kind of starts to
fade in total as we move forward?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: To the extent that there's a portion of that 1% related to FX, over time I see that fading,
but not in the second half of the year. If it does fade, it will be minimal. The logical extension is we see some fading of
that in 2016. Not a material amount of fading in the second half of 2015.
<Q - C. Stephen Tusa>: And then on the 0.2% in U.S., so is that a good kind of reflection on – I guess the U.S. is
probably your most stable market. Is that a good reflection of kind of what you're seeing on the price inflation side? So,
presumably customers will come back, seeing what you guys are doing on the raw side. I mean, are you – is it a little
bit tougher to get price these days because of what's going on with the raw materials? This is more of kind of a macro
question, I guess as well.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Well, you would assume it would be, but I think one of the advantages for us is that often our
product is adding some additional profitability and productivity to our customers. So I would say yes, a little bit
tougher, but as long as you are focused on new product that's adding value into the end market, you're able to demand a

Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Thanks.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Julian.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Yes. I just want to follow up on the Industrial business. You talked about some inventory
issues there in the second quarter. I just wondered how severe those were and if you thought that that inventory had
largely been cleared out, so the third quarter, we should see a better Industrial organic growth rate?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah, I would say that I think it will be cleared out early Q3 is my view. And I think it's – when
you listen to the result for the Industrial – many businesses did well. There's a couple of businesses that I would
describe more as – they are not spec-in, right. Or designing – they are more in the consumable side, like Abrasives and
Tape and so forth. That's where we had a little bit of temper, and I think that then holding to the channels. But I'm more
optimistic as we move forward relative to that front for Industrial.
The other businesses there, when you think about aerospace and commercial and transportation had another 10%
growth, purification another 10%, automotive OEM, as Nick said, had 6%. So many businesses there is doing very,
very well. There was two divisions that had an impact for the quarter, and it was very much what I would describe as
consumables into industrial tapes and adhesives and abrasives.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Thanks. And then my follow up would just be on the free cash conversion. Is it just the
tax normalization in the second half that pushes up the conversion? Or is there something else happening with working
capital, for example?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Julian, there's a few things at play here. First of all, when we pay our cash taxes, there
is some timing and second quarter happened to be heavier weighted. That will moderate for the total year. Second
quarter was also a quarter of higher than normal amounts of our total pension contribution occurring in the second
quarter. And then the last piece is, we did see some increases in our working capital, and we expect that also to
moderate in the second half of the year – all three of those contributing to improvements in our working capital into the
second half. Those are what I'd adjust for. We have normal adjustments where, for instance, for compensation, that
always has a noticeable improvement in our free cash flow conversion in the second half of the year versus the first half
of the year.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Great. Thank you.

And our last question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Laurence Alexander>: Good morning. Two quick ones.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Laurence.
<Q - Laurence Alexander>: Good morning. As you look across your portfolio in terms of where you either have a
stronger new product pipeline or a high degree of confidence about pent-up demand, do you see any line of sight for
acceleration in 2016, 2017 in any of your larger product categories? And secondly, if this choppy, soft demand

environment continues for a few more years, how does that affect, if at all, your balance sheet targets?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Well, Nick will give you some comments on the balance sheet. Let me ask the comment
relative to, let's say, business groups, right? First of all, there is a very robust pipeline of new products in each and
individual business groups. So I don't see from that perspective a difference in between them. But when I look upon it,
we have some businesses here that is – Industrial is 33% of our portfolio and very strong – and we are now adding even
an acquisition into that moving forward. And I think that, what I call the designer spec-in, is very strong, credible
business. So I think it will be strong.
I think, as I said earlier, Safety and Graphics, I've talked about that for over a year now that I believe that Safety and
Graphics is the next breakout business group for us, as Electronic & Energy came earlier, right. The margin has
expanded quite a bit there, and I predicted that Safety and Graphics will follow and maybe do even better due to the
fact of the portfolio there. And I'm confident that that will happen. This Health Care business is usually the fastest
growing, highest margin for us. And 80% that of portfolio is in the developed world, meaning only 20% in the
developing. And that's where a lot of growth for us is coming.
And again, I would say, yes, when I look at one and then try to be active, you see the performance of our consumer
business, again, with very good growth, I would say, and margin expansion and a very strong brand equity. So I would
say for the future for what we are doing here, I'm optimistic, I'm optimistic. And it's been a lot of work on the portfolio
side, get more efficiency in the organization, try to reduce unnecessary barriers internally, and as we say here at 3M,
that the productivity is important and complexity is the biggest enemy of productivity, and the whole team is working
on that big time. So, no, I would not make a distinction in between them. We are in a good position everywhere.
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Laurence, just a follow up to close on the last piece you were asking about the balance
sheet. Our strategy with our balance sheet as far as our capital structure and our allocation of capital, we see that our
strategy there robust enough to encompass a number of business models, including a lower growth scenario. On the
margin, what would change, and again, this would be volatile of exactly why we're seeing that of more a lower growth
world, but for example, CapEx, our capital allocation strategy, I think it would be natural to assume there would be less
of our capital going into our CapEx capacity building.
In terms of M&A, that would depend on our view of the valuation of the opportunities. It could have an impact where
things become more attractive to us, but that's highly driven by the opportunities that we see presenting at that time.
<A - Matthew Ginter>: Laurence, this is Matt. I don't – we wouldn't see anything changing in terms of organic growth
being the primary way in which we grow. We obviously dial CapEx to whatever levels of growth we're seeing, but it
doesn't fundamentally change the way we think about growth, acquisition versus M&A.
<Q - Laurence Alexander>: Thank you.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Thank you.

That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to 3M for
some closing comments.
