Stefano Pessina
Thank you, Gerald. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fiscal third quarter earnings call. The past six months
have been significant progress in delivering on the benefit of the merger, restructuring the business for the future. But
there's a lot more to do.
As you have seen today, I have been appointed by the board as Chief Executive Officer, replacing the interim
appointment that I was previously fulfilling. The board has decided that bearing in mind the pace of change and the
amount that we have still to do. There is a benefit to stability at the senior level in the organization and to focus on the
operational and strategic task before us rather than appointing, orientating and educating someone new to the business
during the period.
The role presents me with certain personal and logistical challenges but with the support of the board and particularly
of Jim Skinner as our Executive Chairman [indiscernible] (3:27) to accept the appointment in the best interest of the
company, my colleagues and of course, my fellow shareholders.
Today, I am pleased to be announcing another strong financial performance, indeed the first quarter to reflect a full
three months of the combined company. Although it may not always appear so from outside the business, it has been a
very busy period for us since I last talked to you. As I have mentioned, our focus has naturally been on putting in place
the changes and the restructuring we need in order to deliver the full benefits of the enlarged company and position the
company for growth in the immediate long-term.
Given that the deal was consummated only six months ago, we are still in the early stages of this process, but we have
been working hard and fast to deliver on our plan, in fact, better than our plan, and I am pleased to say that the benefits
of this work are already beginning to be seen in our results with reasonable results in revenues and margins and
continued strong cash generation. Really, the first areas in which you can see the impact are strict cost control and
disciplined financial management. But I want to assure you that we give our operation the investment they need to
grow and prosper. We have accelerated our cost reduction process and they have reaped certain benefits earlier than
expected in this quarter.
Of course, we cannot extract these benefits more than once. However, the process of identifying benefits is ongoing not
final, so when we have completed this first wave of restructuring we will revisit and review all areas of our business to
identify further potential cost savings. I must commend my colleagues throughout the company for their willingness
and openness to accept change even when it is most uncomfortable in the interest of improving and growing our
company, and I would assure them that change is a sign of life and if embraced in this manner becomes more of an ally
than an enemy. It's a reminder that while we must prioritize our work if we are to achieve everything we want to and
promise to, we cannot ignore any element of the business when it comes to our drive for efficiency and best practice.
I will hand over to George now for him to take you through the results for the quarter and give you some color on what
I have just said. George?
George Fairweather
Thank you, Stefano. Good morning, everyone, and good afternoon to those listening in Europe. Today, I will begin my
remarks by taking you through key highlights of our fiscal 2015 third quarter results. I will then give you some insights

into the performance of each of our three divisions before updating you on progress we have made in implementing our
cost savings and continuing to execute our synergy programs. I will conclude by taking you through our updated
guidance for fiscal year 2015 and comment on our fiscal year 2016 goals.
As Stefano said, the benefits of the work carried out since Walgreens Boots Alliance was formed at the end of
December are already beginning to be seen in our financial results, enabling us to deliver another strong quarter.
Looking at the highlights, net sales for the quarter were $28.8 billion, an increase of 48.4% versus the comparable
quarter in the prior year. Operating income on a GAAP basis was $1.4 billion and on an adjusted basis was $1.7 billion.
The increase in adjusted operating income was driven by the consolidation of Alliance Boots as well as growth in our
Retail Pharmacy USA segment.
GAAP net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.3 billion or $1.18 per diluted share, while
adjusted net earnings were $1.1 billion, or $1.02 per diluted share. This represents an increase of 59.5% in GAAP net
earnings per diluted share and an increase of 22.9% in adjusted earnings per diluted share over the comparable quarter
in the prior year. Net interest expense in the quarter was $151 million and our adjusted tax rate was 30%.
Finally, the average number of diluted shares outstanding for the quarter was 1.1 billion. This includes, of course, the
144 million shares issued on the 31 December as part of the second step consideration for Alliance Boots. It should also
be noted that the third quarter results last year included three months equity earnings as a result of Walgreens' 45%
interest in Alliance Boots compared to fully consolidated results in this year's third quarter.
Now I will take you through the walk from GAAP diluted EPS to adjusted diluted EPS. GAAP earnings of $1.18 per
diluted share for the quarter reconciles to adjusted earnings of $1.02 per diluted share. The net adjustment of $0.16 per
share reflect additions of $0.05 of LIFO provision cost in Retail Pharmacy USA, $0.06 of amortization of
acquisition-related intangibles, and an additional $0.11 of restructuring-related costs from our cost optimization and
store closure program. These additions were more than offset by removal of a $0.29 gain on our warrants to acquire
AmerisourceBergen shares and a net 9% gain from special items, which include the release of a capital loss valuation
allowance totaling $0.12, combined with a $0.01 loss on the sale of Walgreens Infusion Services and $0.02 for an
adjusted tax rate true-up.
So now I will take you through the performance of each of our divisions in the quarter. To remind you, our results are
reported in three segments: Retail Pharmacy USA, Retail Pharmacy International, and Pharmaceutical Wholesale. The
segments we're reporting includes the allocation of synergy benefits including WBAD, as well as an allocation of
corporate-related overhead costs.
Responding to feedback received at our Analyst Day in April, you will see that we are providing additional detail on
segmental performance within the press release and in this presentation. This quarter, we have provided gross profit,
SG&A, and operating profit on a GAAP and adjusted basis for each of our segments. We plan to continue this practice
going forward.
So now, let's start with the Retail Pharmacy USA segment. Retail Pharmacy USA total sales for the quarter were $20.4
billion, an increase of 5.3% over the third quarter in the prior year. Please remember, of course, that we sold the
majority stake in Walgreens Infusion Services on the April 7. With our minority position, our share of earnings in the
company now flow through the post-tax earnings from equity method investments in the income statement.
Sales in the division on a comparable store basis increased by 6.3%. SG&A on a GAAP basis was $4.5 billion and on
an adjusted basis was $4.3 billion. We continued to see strong progress in controlling SG&A expenses this quarter,
including benefits associated with our cost savings program. This was a significant driver of the quarterly year-on-year
performance. As a result, GAAP operating income for Retail Pharmacy USA was $1 billion, while adjusted operating
income was $1.3 billion.
So looking now at the pharmacy part of Retail Pharmacy USA in more detail. Comparable store sales for pharmacy
were up 9.1% for the quarter. We filled 226 million prescriptions, including immunizations, on a 30-day adjusted basis.
That was an increase of 3.8% over last year's quarter, with prescriptions filled in comparable stores up 4.1%. We
continued to see a positive impact and further growth in Medicare Part D scripts along with positive underlying share

trends. Our retail prescription market share on a 30-day adjusted basis increased to 19.3% in the quarter, up 20 basis
points. The benefit of positive sales growth was rather substantially offset by pharmacy gross margin pressure
consistent with our expectations.
Retail product sales increased by 2% in total, comparable store sales increasing by 1.6%. The growth in retail sales was
driven by performance in key destination categories, including health and wellness. We are pleased with our progress
in driving profitable sales growth and margin expansion while at the same time focusing on operating efficiencies and
focusing on working capital efficiencies. Additionally, we continue to enhance our successful Balance Rewards
program by recently releasing Balance Rewards with everyday points. We now provide our active customers with a
more consistent platform to receive loyalty points on most pharmacy and retail product transactions. We also encourage
healthy lifestyle choices by rewarding points for positive health and well-being decisions.
So turning now to the results of our Retail Pharmacy International division. The Retail Pharmacy International division
is a pharmacy-led health and beauty retail businesses in eight countries. At the end of the quarter, we operated 4,565
retail stores, a net increase of six stores during the quarter. As a reminder, our biggest operations are Boots from the
UK followed by Mexico. We also have retail pharmacies in Chile Thailand, Norway, the Republic of Ireland, the
Netherlands and Lithuania.
Total sales in the division for the quarter were $3.3 billion. GAAP operating income was $205 million while adjusted
operating income was $249 million. Adjusted operating margin of 7.6% for the quarter was 1.5 percentage points
higher than in the second quarter, which, remember, included only January and February performance. The margin is
typically lower in these early months of the year, reflecting the seasonality of sales.
So now let's look more closely at the performance for the division. On a pro forma constant currency basis,
comparable-store sales growth for the quarter was 3.1%. This reflects Boots UK growth of 2.4%, complemented by
higher growth in emerging markets, most notably, in Mexico and Chile, where we are making good progress in
integrating these businesses, acquired by Alliance Boots in August 2014. In the UK, Boots retail sales were driven by
good performance in both the beauty and retail healthcare categories. Orders on our UK website at Boots.com, orders
during the quarter were up approximately 50% over the same period last year with approximately two-thirds of our
website orders collected in-store.
At our Analyst Day back in April, we talked about the importance of our product brands. We're very pleased with the
growth in sales during the quarter, No7, our award-winning beauty brand. This was in part due to the May launch of a
new marketing program in the UK, the No7 Protect & Perfect Advanced Serum. We were able to state for the first time
in the UK that this innovative product was the first serum clinically proven to deliver groundbreaking anti-wrinkle
results that get even better over time, as well as developing our existing product brands, we continue to add brands to
our portfolio, which resonate with our customers.
Following on from the acquisition of Soap & Glory last year, we're delighted to announce today that we've acquired Liz
Earle from Avon. Liz Earle is an award-winning premium skincare range that uses naturally active ingredients and is
recognized as one of the leading botanical brands in the UK
So turning now to our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division. Pharmaceutical Wholesale division total sales for the quarter
were $5.7 billion. On a pro forma basis, which assumes constant currency and excludes acquisitions and disposals,
sales increased 0.2%, compared with the same quarter in the prior year. As we discussed in the last earnings call,
Wholesale performance in any quarter is impacted by performance in larger geographies, including the UK, Germany,
France and Turkey as well as by the unique business model.
GAAP operating income for the division was $162 million, while adjusted operating income was $171 million.
Adjusted operating income margin was 3%, broadly flat versus the second quarter, and consistent with our
expectations. Key driver of profit growth continues to be our synergy program. Net synergies in the third quarter
totaled $194 million, making a total of $504 million for the fiscal year to-date. As we've said before, synergies this year
continue to come primarily from our drug procurement activities.

As you can see from the numbers, we're on track to reach our target of at least $650 million net synergies in fiscal year
2015. For fiscal year 2016, we continue to expect at least $1 billion of combined quantifiable net synergies. As we
work increasingly close together as a combined management team, there are, of course, an increasing number of other
synergies being identified in action, many of which are simply not practicable to quantify. Consistent with our prior
reporting, these synergies are allocated across each segments and do not include any benefit from our relationship with
AmerisourceBergen.
At the same time as driving our synergy program, as you know, we are very focused on costs. As previously
announced, we have a target of $1.5 billion of cost savings to be delivered by the end of fiscal 2017. Expected pre-tax
charges associated with this program, as previously stated, are between $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion, of which the cash
component is expected to be approximately 60%.
Good progress was made during the quarter in reorganizing our Retail Pharmacy USA field operations with work
continuing on the optimization of the division's corporate office. Of the approximately 200 planned U.S. store closures
in the program, nine stores were closed in the quarter, with approximately 70 to 80 additional stores planned to be
closed by the end of the fiscal year.
We've also reduced the IT cost structures in the USA to help enable significant store system investments over the
coming years. In addition, during June, we announced the reduction of approximately 700 non-store-based roles in
Retail Pharmacy International. During the quarter, we incurred pre-tax charges of $160 million on the program. These
comprised $102 million of asset impairments, $34 million of severance costs and real estate costs of $24 million.
So moving on now to cash flow and the deployments of capital. GAAP operating cash flow was $1.8 billion in the
quarter and $4.2 billion in the first nine months of the year. Free cash flow was $1.6 billion in the quarter and $3.3
billion in the first nine months of the year. Net debt at the end of the quarter was $11.8 billion.
Investing to drive future growth is our first priority for capital deployment, both in terms of capital expenditure and
selective M&A. During the quarter, we invested $247 million in capital expenditure, making a total of $890 million for
the first nine months of the year. Key areas for capital investments continue to be store investments as well as IT and
digital capabilities, which are vital to building and maintaining a sustainable competitive advantage in our increasingly
omni-channel world.
To some degree, this quarter disproportionately benefited from the imposition of stricter capital investment controls,
and while we expect to maintain a rigid control on capital expenditure to assure appropriate returns of every dollar we
spend, we will clearly not deprive the business of the investment it needs to thrive. You should, therefore, expect to see
future quarters return to a slightly higher level of capital expenditure than we are reporting today.
We remain focused on generating cash through working capital efficiencies, particularly, in Retail Pharmacy USA. The
primary area of focus is inventory management within pharmacy and retail products. For the quarter, we improved our
inventory days of supply in the U.S. by approximately six days versus the prior-year quarter. We continue to see further
opportunity for working capital improvements over time. At the same time, we're working hard to optimize our real
estate assets, including carrying out sale and lease-back transactions. In the third quarter, we executed approximately
$300 million of such transactions.
As we have said previously, our philosophy is to run an efficient balance sheet. As such, we completed approximately
$237 million of share repurchases in the quarter against our $3 billion authorization, bringing the total purchases under
this program to $331 million. The program is ongoing, and we remain committed to completing the plan by the end of
fiscal 2016. In addition, we announced today that in order for us to manage our balance sheet, we're intending to
redeem legacy Walgreens bonds with relatively short periods until they expire for the total principal amount of
approximately $1.75 billion. This redemption will be funded from existing cash resources. You will see that cash and
cash equivalents totaled $4.4 billion at quarter-end, so we have the capacity to do this and continue to exercise on our
share repurchase program.
So turning to the dividend. We announced today a 6.7% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.36 per share. This
raises the annual rate from $1.35 per share to $1.44 per share. We remain committed to our long-term dividend payout

ratio target of 30% to 35%.
So now let me talk about the full-year outlook for fiscal 2015. In our second quarter earnings release, we had issued an
adjusted EPS guidance range of $3.45 to $3.65 for fiscal year 2015. Given our solid third quarter results and increased
visibility, as we look to the year-end, we're pleased to both increase and narrow our adjusted EPS fiscal year guidance
to a range of $3.70 to $3.80. This range assumes adjusted interest expense of approximately $150 million in the fourth
quarter, a full-year adjusted tax rate of approximately 29%, fiscal year diluted share count of approximately 1.05 billion
shares and estimates for foreign exchange rates that reflect current market rates over the balance of the fiscal year.
I'll remind you that when we issued our fiscal year 2015 guidance in April, we viewed the second half of the fiscal year
differently than the first half. Specifically, we indicated that adjusted earnings per diluted share would be lower in the
second half with the third quarter being higher than the fourth quarter. As we update our guidance, this still holds true.
We expect quarter four adjusted earnings per diluted share to be sequentially lower for the following reasons. The
primary component is seasonality, which impacts sales and product mix. The summer months tend to be our weakest,
particularly in our Retail Pharmacy USA segment. Within the U.S., we tend to see sequential declines in the growth of
both pharmacy volume and retail product sales. Also, as we continue to work through our cost plan in the U.S., the
phasing and timing of certain expenses will impact the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter.
So moving on to fiscal year 2016. We are reaffirming our previously-stated adjusted EPS goal for fiscal year 2016,
$4.25 to $4.60. This range assumes an annual adjusted tax rate in the high 20%s, a full-year weighted average diluted
share count of approximately 1.1 billion, and no significant changes to current currency exchange rates.
Please remember, of course, that since we established the goal a year ago, we've seen material appreciation of the
dollar. As you know, we have currency translation exposure based primarily on movements in the pound sterling versus
the dollar. And as a reminder, we estimate that a 1% move in pound sterling versus the dollar at current levels would
impact our adjusted EPS by approximately $0.01 per share. Given the current situation in Greece, where we fortunately
have no business interests, we anticipate a certain level of volatility in the currency markets in the forthcoming months.
So with that, I will turn the call back to Stefano.
Stefano Pessina
Thank you, George. So I hope that you will agree that these are a very solid set of results. [indiscernible] (29:31) and
we are far from being complacent about the challenges we face and the hard work it will take to deliver everything we
want and that promise, but we are making a good progress and traveling in the right direction. And I believe all of my
colleagues recognize that the challenges and the work will be needed to overcome them, but are as convinced as ever
about immense potential of our company as a global pharmacy led health and well-being enterprise.
We are in markets that are changing, here in the U.S. that you are seeing these quite dramatically. But as I have said
many times, we are at the beginning of a new chapter for our company and are actively reviewing every opportunity
that the changing environment offers us, as we work to deliver the true potential of our company. I strongly believe that
we have a significant role to play in shaping the future of our industry. I thank you for your continued support, but also
acknowledge that the best way to thank you is to deliver on our promises, and I can assure you we fully intend to
continue to do so.
With that, I think we will now open it up for questions. Gerald?
Gerald Gradwell
Thank you. Stephanie, do you want to take over?

Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Meredith Adler with Barclays. Your line is open.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Thank you very much, and I'm asking questions for myself and Eric Percher, who is not
available today. I think our main question would be talking about the big difference, the spread between the growth in
pharmacy scripts and the growth in dollars. Maybe you could talk a little bit about what the drivers are. Some of it is
hep C, but maybe you could talk a little bit about inflation in both branded and generic drugs. And then I will have one
other question.
<A - Alex Gourlay>: Hi. Good morning. It's Alex here. Thanks for the question. Yeah, the inflation, we're managing
the effect of that inflation pretty well in the business. We have good plans and team has done a good job to get that
done. So one of the differences in the spread you're seeing is [ph] drug (31:59) inflation, but we're managing that effect
really pretty satisfactorily, and of course, built into our future guidance as well.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Would you describe inflation in branded pharmaceuticals as a positive for the margin?
<A - Alex Gourlay>: I think it's marginal at the moment in terms of that, but again, for example, slight improvements
because of generics coming to market both this year and next year. But again, the key thing here is that we forecasted
this, we're planning it, and it's really consistent with our expectations.
<A - Stefano Pessina>: If I can add something, you have also to take into account that we have different businesses in
our company. And some of these businesses, like the Wholesale business, or like WBAD are really taking advantage of
certain inflation.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you. And then, I just have a follow-up question to talk about,
I mean, the front-end margin improved, and I think you talked about not just the operating margin, but the gross
margin. Maybe you could talk a little bit about changes that you might have made in terms of promotional strategies, or
the way you're marketing that might have driven a better gross margin in the front-end.
<A - Alex Gourlay>: Yeah, Meredith, it's Alex again. Yeah, we've made – we've been really on this strategy now for
five quarters. So we're pleased with the progress we're making. And the key thing that we have done is that we stopped
really promotions that were driving sales, particularly, in some consumable categories, but not really helping the profit
at all. And we're focused much more on the mix and making sure that we're much more focused on really the health and
wellness and beauty care categories and that's really proven beneficial.
And as George has said in the script today, we've launched a new platform called Everyday Points, and that released to
make sure, again, that people, who are coming to us more regularly and are picking up on the destination categories, are
getting a better platform and more reason to come back to Walgreens. It still is early days. We have a lot of work to do
and a lot of opportunity ahead of us. And it will be step-by-step process. But the basic things we're doing is reducing
unprofitable promotions and making sure that we focus more investment in our best customers and more investment in
our destination categories.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator
Our next question comes from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim. Your line is open.
<Q - John Edward Heinbockel>: Hey. Two questions. One on Walgreens USA cost. What would you guys peg the
normal increase – annual increase in SG&A at? Would it be 2% to 3% absent cost-cutting? And then, of the $1.5
billion that you've identified, did you see any of that in the third quarter and how much and what do you think you'll see
in the fourth? And then, just lastly, it did look like pharmacy margin improved a decent amount sequentially, which
was a little surprising. What were the couple of things that may have driven that?

<A - Stefano Pessina>: Alex, maybe you can talk through.
<A - Alex Gourlay>: Yes, there are a number of questions there, John. So good morning again. So starting off with the
cost question, I think as George said really clearly, we've made a solid progress against our $1.5 billion cost program,
and of course, we started a bit earlier in the U.S. in terms of what we announced. And I would say that we're seeing
SG&A in the U.S. business down slightly year-on-year on a comparative basis, which is pleasing, but also really what
we have planned to do.
And I think, as George also said, there's a bit of phasing here between quarter three and quarter four. And importantly,
from a continuation of business point of view, we are – in quarter four this year, we're making sure that we continue to
invest in the things that customers value the most from us to make sure we keep the growth there going forward and
investing more in our customers and more in the things that customers see.
Again, finally, on the cost side, again, as George has said, we started some of the restructuring. We closed, I think, as
George said, nine stores in the previous quarter. And we're on track to close another 80 stores to 90 stores in the period
ahead. Again, that's very much on plan and benefits still to come over the period of the time.
<A - George Fairweather>: I think, John, you also asked a question on the pharmacy margin and really just
reinforcing what I said earlier is we did see in the U.S. the positive sales growth, but that was substantially offset by the
pharmacy gross margin pressure. But that was absolutely consistent with our expectations. So there's no change from
what we were expecting when we last talked to you.
<Q - John Edward Heinbockel>: But did it get better? It looked like it got better sequentially, or no? Right?
<A - Stefano Pessina>: [indiscernible] (37:09)
<A - George Fairweather>: We're talking about here – obviously, we're reporting, John, on year-on-year,
quarter-on-quarter, but it really was, as we expected. I mean, when the renewals come through, and what we're seeing
is what we were expecting.
<A - Stefano Pessina>: The market is – Stefano here. Of course, the market is evolving. What is important is to be able
to anticipate what happens and to take these into account when you budget. And I believe that this year we are doing
exactly this. We are absolutely aligned with what we were expecting.
<Q - John Edward Heinbockel>: Okay. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
<Q - Lisa Christine Gill>: Hi. Thanks very much and good morning. Stefano, you talked about the challenges that the
U.S. market and other markets are facing. We hear CMS talking about 50% of payments moving towards what they are
calling fee for value. Can you talk about strategically where do you think Walgreens needs to be positioned? We're
seeing lots of consolidation, whether it's managed care or other players. Is it that we need to be the biggest retail
provider in the U.S., and therefore, best position to partner with those that are taking on risk? Do you view yourself as
more of a risk-bearing entity over time? How do you think about your relationship whether it's with managed care
PBMs and strengthening those going forward?
<A - Stefano Pessina>: I have said many times that I believe that the American market will go through a substantial
wave of consolidation horizontally and vertically. I have said very clearly that we want to be part of this at the right
time with the right partner. We are open to any kind of combination, which could improve the value of our company,
and we are looking actively around us to understand, which is the best option for us. But, please, don't forget that we
are looking actively not just in the U.S., but even in other countries, because we consider ourselves a global company.

<Q - Lisa Christine Gill>: And would you say that the priorities are more U.S.-driven or globally-driven? Or does it
depend on the specific opportunity that comes across your desk?
<A - Stefano Pessina>: Well, the priority is that the deal that you can do. And it depends where you can fit.
<Q - Lisa Christine Gill>: Okay. Great. And then just my follow-up question would just be around the synergies. You
talked a lot about them coming from the procurement side of things. Can you maybe talk about where you think you
are, George, or Alex, or Stefano, as far as what inning are we in as far as obtaining the synergies that you expected
from WBAD? Or are we close to getting the full benefit from them? Or is there still a good portion of the future
synergies that will still come from the procurement side?
<A - Stefano Pessina>: We are absolutely in line with what we were forecasting, and maybe, George, you can give
more details. But we will do what we were expecting and what we announced.
<A - George Fairweather>: What I would just say add to that is what I said is that we're very much on track to
achieve the target this year and the goal of $1 billion from what I would describe as hard, quantifiable synergies that we
can measure. But what we're really seeing is the – now that we're a merged organization, we're seeing lots of other
areas of best practice and ideas that we're sharing that we're implementing that clearly as we become more and more
integrated, these are simply the types that you cannot quantify to the standard that you can put in a number.
We're very much moving through this – into this phase. And those types of synergies, as we know from previous
transactions, I remember from the merger of Alliance UniChem and Boots. These are important synergies. And we can
see them time and time again. We're moving people around more. And these are really what will help us to become a
much, much stronger organization.
<A - Stefano Pessina>: I would add, George, that as you said, we are thinking of the buying synergies, certain
synergies which are quite evident and that we can easily forecast. But there will be, for sure, as you are saying, George,
many synergies that will appear evident – become evident in future. Because when you put two companies together,
you find a way for years, I would say, for three years, four years, you find new ways to deliver synergies.
<Q - Lisa Christine Gill>: Okay. Great. And congratulations, Stefano, on becoming CEO. I'm glad they named you
so.

Our next question comes from George Hill of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
<Q - George R. Hill>: Yes. Good morning, or good afternoon, guys, based upon where you are, and thanks for taking
the question. First one is for Alex. People have jumped in a bit on what margins have looked like. I guess, we're getting
further along in the year. Can you talk about what payer negotiations are looking like for, kind of, 01/01/2016 contract
restarts? And, I guess, if things are proceeding according to expectations and how that squares with the fiscal 2016
guidance that you guys have provided?
<A - Alex Gourlay>: Hi, George. Yeah, absolutely it does, so really, as we expected and square on as the guidance that
we've given as well. And I think the team has done a good job again in anticipating and making sure that we've
projected well and managed the relationships in a very good way.
<Q - George R. Hill>: Okay. And then, a follow-up, I guess, for George and for Stefano, which is, we're not too far
away now from March of 2016 when the first tranche for the ABC warrants become exercisable. I guess, should we
think about whether or not there's any contribution from ABC equity earnings built into the fiscal 2016 guidance? And
does Walgreens want to be a larger stock owner of AmerisourceBergen? Or should we think of the warrants as a value
creation vehicle for Walgreens? Thank you.
<A - Stefano Pessina>: When we did the deal, we did the deal, of course, to improve our profit, but also for a
strategical reason. Because, as you know, we have always believed that a better coordination between wholesaler and

retailer can create quite substantial synergies. So the reasons for the deal are still there. So we have announced what we
intend to do. And at the right time, you will see the effect of these agreements. George?
<A - George Fairweather>: I have really not a lot to add to that. I mean, we will look at the right time and take the
decision at the time in terms of the accounting. Again, we will have to look at that at the appropriate time. But from
where we are today, were we to exercise the warrants, then we would anticipate being able to account for that as an
equity method investment. But clearly, that will be – it would have to be confirmed and looked at were we to exercise.

Operator
Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: Yeah, hi. Good morning and congratulations on the quarter. Just a couple of questions here.
First of all, just, George, you've highlighted some of the differences between this quarter and the upcoming quarter.
Can you just share with us more details on the headwinds versus the tailwinds that we should be thinking of between
the fourth quarter and third quarter?
<A - George Fairweather>: Well, I think really the first point to come through, as I sort of touched on in the prepared
comments, was the primary component that we've got to think about is the seasonality between the quarters, which
impacts the sales and product mix. I'm thinking about the summer months very much tend to be our weakest months,
particularly, in Alex's business, the Retail Pharmacy USA segment, where we would see, typically, the sequential
declines in the growth of both pharmacy volume and retail product sales. The other factor is around the phasing and
timing of certain expenses in terms of the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter. And clearly, when you go through
the sort of programs that we are, [indiscernible] (46:37) fast as you can. But equally, you need to keep everyone very
focused on the business and driving through all the programs that Alex is working on.
So there's always an element of timing on those where they – eventually as to how quickly we can deliver some of
those. We're clearly going as fast as we feel we can in a straight line. There's other areas I talked about. I mean, clearly,
currency is a factor, as I touched on. But I think increasingly we have – in terms of the internal factors, we've got pretty
good visibility to our forecasting process, and hence, we're confident to both narrow and increase the guidance range
for this year.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: And when we – you talked about, I think, shutting – closing down another 70 stores to 80
stores in the upcoming quarter. So should we see that through the gross margin line or the SG&A line?
<A - George Fairweather>: Yeah. You see that particularly through the SG&A line. Obviously, we lose a few sales,
but most of these sales we've successfully transferred into adjacent stores. I think, as you know, we also closed a
number of stores there last year. And we've got a pretty predictive model now, which we're very confident about. So the
SG&A will come down and overall [indiscernible] (48:00) benefit and we'll lose a few sales and a few bps of margin.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: Okay. Great. And then just one market-related question. We're seeing a lot of kind of like
your competitors making strategic moves around specialty. When you think about kind of like the specialty opportunity
for you, do you think that this is something that you can build internally by leveraging your retail infrastructure in the
U.S.? Or is this something that you think you needed to go outside to add these capabilities? And also, how do you
think about the specialty opportunity U.S. versus ex-U.S. and Europe?
<A - Stefano Pessina>: We don't exclude any opportunity. We are looking around as I – as we have said, many times,
we are analyzing all the opportunities for growth that we have, and at the right time, and if the right opportunities come,
we will be able to face them.
<A - Alex Gourlay>: Yeah, and if I can also add as well, Ricky, that we are very focused on organic growth as well.
We've got a very good model in the USA in community pharmacy, and we're building that out through our
relationships with doctors and with also unique access we get to the pharma manufacturers also so in areas like HIV

important business for us and we've grown organically, particularly in the USA.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<Q - Robert Patrick Jones>: Thanks for the questions, and, Stefano, congratulations on the appointment. Obviously, a
number of moving pieces but just really trying to get a better gauge of the underlying core U.S. business. You guys
talked about making good progress on the restructuring program, but is there any more details you can share with us on
the savings that you've been able to generate to-date? And then any breakdown of those savings, obviously, across the
segments would be really helpful in us being able to track the underlying business a little bit better?
<A - Stefano Pessina>: We have made an effort to be as clear as possible.
<A - George Fairweather>: I really do appreciate how tricky it is with the merger coming through, and obviously
what we said the last time we were – it was not practical for us to work through and try and restate everything on a
comparable basis at the cost side and the margin side. So that's why we've tried to give you the adjusted figures.
Clearly, in terms of the cost saving program, that is the big – it is primarily in Retail Pharmacy USA as we said the last
time, but we are progressing in the International, but that is a much, much smaller part of it – part of the program, but
we are very much on track with where we expect to be. As I said earlier, what's important is always to go in a straight
line and a disciplined structured way.
That's why we've tried to give you a little bit of a feel where you're actually looking at comparability. I tried to touch on
the Retail Pharmacy International margin, which I know some of you felt [ph] we looked across (51:35) a little bit
lower than you were expecting in the second quarter, but it only had two months in, and that is a seasonal business.
And the last quarter was at the time when we seasonally we had lower sales clearly as we come up to the important
Christmas time and we get the leverage of the fixed cost base and therefore the net margins will start, will reflect that
when you look at the seasonality. But I do appreciate how tricky it is to model, which is why we gave the guidance
going forward.
<Q - Robert Patrick Jones>: No. I respect that too and I understand the comparability year-over-year is tough. I guess
I was talking more specifically about just identifying what the cost cutting was in the actual quarter, this quarter itself
and maybe I am missing something, but I wouldn't think that would be that difficult to identify, store closings, head
count reductions.
<A - Alex Gourlay>: If I can maybe help a little bit, I mean, we've done a good review of all of the projects that were
focused on the future, I think we've been really clear within the business that we're focusing back on our core business
of our retail pharmacy front end products specialty, and therefore, all of the other areas where we were building out
maybe potential future products [indiscernible] (52:56) some of these areas to be more focus back on the core business.
So that really has been [indiscernible] (53:04) projects and I'm really very confident, as we said before, on the $1.5
billion in savings that can be achieved.
<Q - Robert Patrick Jones>: Fair enough.
<A - George Fairweather>: To really reinforce what Alex just said, we've been putting a lot of internal work into the
whole process of how we evaluate new initiatives, how we track initiatives that perhaps are not working, and then you
stop them, you don't let them drag on. Yeah. If something really isn't working, you give it a good go and you stop it,
new initiatives, we've got a lot of what I would describe as financial rigor that has been increasingly put in place really
over the last 12 months. Alex, you put a lot in place when you took overall responsibility for the Walgreens business,
and we're continuing to do that. But I think it's that rigor that we're seeing then in terms of some of the SG&A coming
through.

<Q - Robert Patrick Jones>: That makes sense. And I guess just one quick follow-up on Part D networks specifically,
there is a big initiative from your predecessors to get deeper into some of these preferred networks. I am curious how
the economics of those networks have compared to your expectations. I know it's only about six months in. And then
based on that feedback, any thoughts on your continued participation in these preferred networks going forward.
Thanks.
<A - Alex Gourlay>: Yeah, hi. It's Alex again. Yeah, this is really an important customer, a really important market
segment. It's a segment that's growing rapidly, so we remain very committed to this. And in terms of, as I said before,
we are in terms of next year's plans, have almost completed all the contracts and they're to the expectations in terms of
margins that we've planned for. So, very committed to this business. And we are – we've done a good job. We're
pleased with where we are and committed to next year. Importantly for us, of course, we're only at the end of first
stage. The second stage which is how [indiscernible] (55:02) access, how would you make sure that you really look
after the patients and the customers who come to your pharmacy and make sure you get the appropriate level of
[indiscernible] (55:10) and volume through your assets, and that's the bit we're now turning our attention to.

Our next question comes from Alvin Concepcion with Citi. Your line is open.
<Q - Alvin Caezar Concepcion>: Hi. Thank you. Congratulations on another great quarter and congratulations to
Stefano. My question is just really around beauty. I'm just curious how the tests are going in New York and Phoenix?
Are there any findings you could share from that? Particularly interested in if you think you're getting a sales lift in the
[indiscernible] (55:43) and if you're seeing much traction from No7.
<A - Stefano Pessina>: Of course. You know the importance that we give to our brands, and No7 is having a fantastic
trend in the UK and internationally, and it's one of our really hope for the future in the U.S. But maybe Alex, you can
say what you are doing now for No7 and what you are expecting [indiscernible] (56:23)
<A - Alex Gourlay>: Yeah, we've rolled No7 into just over 400 Walgreens and Duane Reade stores in Phoenix and
then in New York City. And the Phoenix market is just over 12 months old, and we'll be able to measure the impact
both on No7 sales, on Boots brand product sales, and also on the beauty categories, and we're pleased with what we're
seeing. So we're now starting to plan for the next stage of evolution of No7 and the Boots brand in Walgreens and
Duane Reade in the USA. And we'll come out with these plans when they're ready, but we are pleased with the results.
Personally, I'm also pleased that we are able to acquire Soap & Glory; I think that happened in the previous quarter and
obviously this morning Liz Earle. But going forward, the more unique products that we're able to get into the
Walgreens beauty and healthcare offer then the more unique it will make our offer going forward in what is a very
competitive marketplace. So again, very pleased with the brand's performance, very pleased with the progress that Ken
Murphy and the team have made and the Global Brands organization is still very young, and looking forward to getting
these unique products in front of our customers in Walgreens in the future.
<Q - Alvin Caezar Concepcion>: And as a follow-up, what were you thinking for the timing of the full rollout?
<A - Alex Gourlay>: Yeah, we'll come back with that. I mean, we're really, as I said before, we're just doing the work
now. We've got to get this right. This is a big estate, it's a fantastic brand, as Stefano said, in Europe and it's growing
really well in Europe. So we'll come back to that when we're ready. But we're in a good position.

<Q - Mark Gregory Wiltamuth>: Hi. I just wanted to inquire how comparable the U.S. SG&A number is on a
year-over-year basis, because it looked like there were some overhead allocations that changed versus a year ago.
<A - George Fairweather>: So I mean they're not directly comparable because clearly the corporate expense, for
example, as I said in my presentation, has to get allocated across the three divisions. Clearly we're also allocating the
synergies which we talked about in terms of where the economic benefit is. So the results, unfortunately, are not
directly comparable, and so they come with that very big health warning. But I think what we have said is we are very
pleased with the progress that we're making in reducing SG&A, and we're very much on target to deliver the program
that we announced in the last quarter.
<Q - Mark Gregory Wiltamuth>: So the numbers that presented were down, but I guess on an apples-to-apples
[inaudible] (59:23) was the SG&A percentage down?
<A - George Fairweather>: On an apples – there isn't an apples-and-apples basis. I guess that's the challenge that we
got and simply, I think we said it at the time we did the deal, our priority was to get the deal done quickly. But one of
the things that didn't enable us to do was to go back and rework everything on an apples-and-apples basis. But we're
making good progress; that's the key message I can see. But I know how [indiscernible] (59:52) that is not getting
everything apples and apples.
<Q - Mark Gregory Wiltamuth>: Okay. And I understand you're not announcing the International segment's year-ago
performance as well, but is there anything you can give us in terms of health indicators for margin and profitability on
those International segments even though you don't have a GAAP presentation for us?
<A - George Fairweather>: I think we can say that we're pleased with the performance [indiscernible] (1:00:16) we
look at Retail, Retail Pharmacy International obviously Boots is the largest component there. We're delivering solid
performance in a market where there are quite a lot of challenges in that market, and you see what's happening in some
of the supermarket sector, for example. But I think this demonstrates the strength of the offer, it's very important of a
differentiated retail offer, particularly in DC where Boots is renowned. We've got a very strong loyalty card program.
Alex talked obviously about the great work that's being done here and taking Balance Rewards forward, the Advantage
Card program equally important in the U.K.
And then the piece that I touched on in my presentation is really omni channel where ordering online through
Boots.com and picking up in store through purchase is important, and of course with the geography that we've got in
the UK and the 2,500 points we can do that. We can actually leverage our Wholesale organization for delivery, we're
able to do that in a profitable way that really meets the expectations of our customers. So that's the key component in
there. In Wholesale in any year [indiscernible] (1:01:44) number of markets, you get markets that perform better, and
markets that are more challenging, it's just the way it always is but the division delivered a solid performance as it's
continued to do for many years.
<Q - Mark Gregory Wiltamuth>: I guess on the International Retail Pharmacy there were some commentary in the
analyst meeting that the margin focus for growth was really shifting away to more of a sales growth story. Was there
gross margin declines as you go through that transition to driving sales?
<A - George Fairweather>: We've obviously not given the specifics on the comparability because we don't have the
numbers on the same U.S. GAAP basis. So, but I continue to say that the business has performed solidly. We're pleased
with the performance in what's been a tough retail environment in the UK. And that's fundamentally important. On the
NHS side, on the pharmacy side, clearly, the government continued to contain growth in health care expenditure, and
so we haven't seen the details of the settlement yet, that's probably going to be towards the autumn. We'll just have to
wait and see on the timing of that. But we continue to see pressure in that area as we've seen for a number of years. But
no real change but that pressure continues.
<Q - Mark Gregory Wiltamuth>: Okay. Well, thank you for the color.

Our final question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore. Your line is open.
<Q - Ross Jordan Muken>: Hi. Good morning, guys, and congrats. So as you think about sort of the M&A landscape
happening around you, obviously, Stefano, you talked about lots of consolidation happening in managed care. We've
seen it in generics. We've seen it in the PBM space. Where do you think in terms of what is happening around you it's
most relevant to kind of your business? Or what are you watching most? And how do you think particularly on the
managed care side any of the changes there, how does that make you think about your longer-term positioning from a
healthcare perspective in this market?
<A - Stefano Pessina>: As I have said, we can clearly see the need or the opportunity for horizontal and vertical
consolidation in our industry, and this is happening. In reality, I believe that this is a good move for us because the
consolidation, the horizontal consolidation will create a clear market and will give us more opportunities in future.
What we will be able to do specifically, it's a little too early to say. But I repeat, we want to be one of the players in this
space, and we see a lot of opportunities. And the opportunities are really open along the chain, along the space of the
healthcare industry.
<Q - Ross Jordan Muken>: And I guess just quickly, just staying on the M&A theme, and I'll keep this to my last
question, but you and your team have been remarkably savvy dealmakers over the course of your long career and have
created massive amounts of value. How much of a challenge of it is it today with where global equity markets are from
a valuation standpoint? Obviously understanding the financing markets are wide open, but valuations are pretty
elevated. And so how do you think about that in the context of your capital allocation goals, particularly on the deal
side? Does it argue to smaller transactions or a certain geography? I'm just trying to get a sense for how that plays into
your thinking and the timing aspects of it.
<A - Stefano Pessina>: As you know, we have been always [indiscernible] (1:06:14) with potential acquisitions, so we
will see if we will have an opportunity, we will analyze this opportunity very rationally and we will do it just if it create
additional value. It's true that the market is now quite bullish, but it's also true that the cost of the money is still quite
low, and there are other ways to create value, not just through the acquisitions. So we are analyzing all the
opportunities. If we will see an opportunity which fits our strategy and which can create value, we will take action.
<Q - Ross Jordan Muken>: Great. Thank you so much.
<A - Stefano Pessina>: Thank you.
