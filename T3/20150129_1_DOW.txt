Howard I. Ungerleider
Thank you, Jack. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.
2014 proved to be a great year for Dow. We ended with a very strong fourth quarter, and even with currency and oil
uncertainty, are moving toward a solid start to 2015. We achieved record results thanks to our decisive and disciplined
approach to executing on our priorities. In the midst of a challenging operating environment, Dow once again
delivered. The fourth quarter is our ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year EPS, EBITDA and EBITDA margin
growth. These results demonstrate our focus in driving targeted self-help, executing on our strategic actions, increasing
return on capital and maximizing our returns.
As a result, earnings per share rose to $0.85 on adjusted basis, a $0.20 per share increase year-over-year. EBITDA
increased to $2.4 billion on an adjusted basis, representing a new fourth quarter record with gains across all operating
segments. We delivered broad-based EBITDA margin expansion, up nearly 220 basis points on an adjusted basis,
thanks to our integration, our end market diversification and our global market access. And we continued our strong
focus on working capital efficiency. Cash flow from operations was up $500 million versus the prior period. All of
these actions enabled us to finish 2014 with strength, which brings me to our full year results.
Earnings per share grew to $3.11 on an adjusted basis, a 25% increase versus 2013. EBITDA rose nearly $1 billion,
achieving a full year record of $9.3 billion on an adjusted basis. We expanded EBITDA margins and improved return
on capital. We also accelerated our portfolio management actions and we made excellent progress on our key growth
projects that are on track to start up this year. And we delivered a second consecutive year of record cash flow from
operations. These results enabled us to continue to increasingly reward our shareholders – $4.5 billion in share
buy-backs completed with the launch of another $5 billion tranche and two dividend increases put into motion. In total,
we returned nearly $6 billion to shareholders in 2014, representing an all-time record.
Earnings, cash flow and shareholder remuneration are each at an all-time high. Our strategic decisions have created a
portfolio that is less volatile and has lower risks due to our integration, global scale and product market diversity,
delivering an earnings base much higher than previous economic cycles with significant financial flexibility. Coupled
with our self-help and productivity actions, which continue to deliver cash and lower our costs, we are well-positioned
to continue to maximize returns in this uncertain environment.
Those are the headlines, now let me provide more detail on the company's operating performance, market trends,
strategic agenda and outlook.
Moving to slide five, sales were $14.4 billion. Our team delivered 4% volume growth overall, with growth across all
operating segments except Infrastructure Solutions. Our price decline was 4%, driven by Western Europe, with half of
the total decline due to currency. Our productivity actions, including our volume growth, was the key driver behind our
EBITDA margin expansion this quarter, as well as our intense focus on our day-to-day commercial and operational
metrics such as price margin and inventory. Revenue highlights for the quarter include Ag Sciences, which grew sales
$82 million, resulting in a fourth quarter record for this segment. Performance Materials and Chemicals increased sales
$172 million with sales growth driven primarily by Epoxy and Polyurethanes with reported double-digit growth, both
businesses showing firm improvement in 2014.

On the bottom line, record fourth quarter EBITDA gains were driven primarily by Ag on an increased sales of
differentiated products and technologies. Performance Materials and Chemicals also drove EBITDA increases through
its ongoing productivity actions, and Performance Plastics achieved its 10th quarter in a row of year-over-year
EBITDA growth.
Let's take a closer look at each segment, beginning on slide seven. Ag Sciences delivered a record quarter. Fourth
quarter sales were up 5% and adjusted EBITDA was up $63 million, reaching $222 million. EBITDA margin
improvement was driven by broad-based sales gains of our innovation-driven technology platforms and sales from new
crop protection products increased 23% year-over-year. From a macro perspective, global projections for food and crop
demand highlight the need for significantly higher yields. Dow AgroSciences and our technologies focus on delivering
products that help growers meet these expectations, and we're working to commercialize our new products as quickly
as possible.
A key example: Enlist. There is real enthusiasm among the grower community for this top-performing system, and in
2014 we made great strides in bringing it to market by gaining USDA deregulation and U.S. EPA registration. We're
actively working with the Chinese government agencies and expect approval for Enlist corn in 2015. We're moving
forward to ensure a successful stewarded launch in the United States for corn in 2015 and a full commercial launch in
2016.
Mix upgrades and the ramp-up of new technologies are expected to drive earnings growth above market. Some
examples in our Crop Protection business are Arylex, Spinetoram and Isoclast. These new products help farmers
address resistance issues and deliver 20% to 30% higher margins than our base Crop Protection products. Dow
AgroScience's innovation engine, combined with our growing presence in Seeds, our ongoing focus to both improve
working capital and optimize costs will enable ongoing margin expansion.
Turning to Consumer Solutions on slide eight, adjusted EBITDA grew by $31 million to $243 million for the quarter
on flat sales, as increases in Automotive volume offset currency headwinds. Margin expansion was driven by higher
volume in North America and Europe. We do expect growth and margin expansion driven by increasing demand in
Dow Electronic Materials, Dow Automotive and Consumer Care.
2014 was a record year for Dow Automotive. Demand for larger and premium vehicles with better fuel economy and
lower emissions is a key growth trend. Our BETAMATE brand of structural adhesives are enabling lightweighting by
bonding dissimilar materials such as aluminum and plastics, and is now in use in about 12% of new cars today,
supplying 60% of this new and rapidly growing application.
Consumer Care delivered EBITDA margin growth in 2014 as well. Here, brand owners are focused on delivering
innovative products that differentiate their brands while increasing their returns. Dow is working alongside our
customers, collaborating to innovate customized profitable solutions via enabling chemistry.
Margins also expanded in Dow Electronic Materials in 2014, primarily due to mix upgrades. Consumers' rapidly
escalating expectations for electronics is driving the need for lighter, brighter and more powerful devices. We're excited
about these trends as we enter 2015. Semiconductor content and display technology demand is also on the rise as
consumers require computing power in their mobile devices. The rapid shift to phablets and hybrid PCs, which have
higher turnover than traditional PCs, is requiring faster innovation cycles.
Moving to Infrastructure Solutions on slide nine, adjusted EBITDA was up $31 million to $244 million and we
delivered margin expansion on self-help productivity actions and improved business conditions at Dow Corning,
despite sales declines of 4% which were due primarily to currency headwinds and from a weaker construction market
in Europe.
Energy and Water Solutions is delivering consistent growth. Customers across the sector are demanding close
collaboration, and Dow's close to customer strategy, placing experts to work hand-in-hand with our customers,
continues to gain traction and has enabled multiple quarters of double-digit increases in demand for our microbial
control technologies.

In the Water sector, Dow's separation technologies are necessary to address the need for sustainable water solutions.
We expect that water technology markets will remain robust and should see an acceleration in growth as global GDP
continues to improve.
We've also increased the profitability of Dow Building & Construction with significant improvement in Europe thanks
to our focused efforts to reduce our structural costs. The U.S. construction market continues to improve, as evidenced
by December housing starts. We're launching new products in Construction Chemicals and Insulation and enhancing
our cost position to drive further earnings improvements.
In Dow Coating Materials, we delivered top and bottom line growth in 2014. We're capitalizing on trends in the
Architectural Coating space, innovating to drive adoption of high-quality paints and expanding our vinyl acrylic
emulsions as part of our tiered product offering strategy. This will enable us to expand our reach in emerging markets
as well as the U.S. contractor market.
Turning to slide 10, Performance Materials & Chemical sales grew 5% and adjusted EBITDA was up $98 million to
$636 million for the quarter. Significant EBITDA margin increases are a result of ongoing sellout and productivity
actions, resulting in higher operating rates and lower, more advantaged cost. In Polyurethanes, these actions resulted in
the completion of the $100 million productivity program we began in 2013. We've also increased production by more
than 15% over the last two years. We're now operating more locally than before, to allow more agile responses to
market dynamics as well as selling into the most profitable regions.
For Epoxy, we've completed more than half of our productivity target and expect to complete the full program in 2015.
The quality of our business continues to improve as we implement to mitigate the impact of continued industry
pressures from oversupply in Asia Pacific. Further actions to enhance efficiency in Performance Materials & Chemicals
should continue to provide tailwind for this segment.
Turning now to Performance Plastics on Slide 11, adjusted EBITDA was up $66 million to $1.2 billion, representing a
fourth quarter record which culminated in a sequential full year EBITDA record. We delivered this achievement even
as sales declined 3%. Falling energy costs, higher volumes and tight supply demand dynamics combined to create
margin expansion in the fourth quarter.
On the topline, demand is steady and our assets are running hard in the United States and globally. Sales were actually
flat year-over-year when we exclude hydrocarbons and energy co-product values, which decline with oil. Our strategy
for this segment has been purposefully built on differentiation, eliminating lower margin and/or commoditizing
portions of the segment and pursuing higher margin, differentiated product lines and markets. As a result, we have built
a portfolio that has been delivering higher and more consistent returns through a variety of economic conditions.
Looking ahead, while there is clearly pricing pressure, demand fundamentals have not changed. Our sales volumes
actually look slightly better than last year as customers' orders remain steady before the late February through June
seasonal typical demand strength, Dow sales in resin markets around the world and selection of the highest return
opportunities. That enabled us to hold fourth quarter non-hydrocarbon sales flat year-on-year in the segment. For
example, margins are improving in our elastomers chain as we sell into the strengthening Automotive market.
Similarly, higher demand in the High Voltage Power Cable market, as more money is freed up for new infrastructure
projects, is helping our Electrical & Telecommunications business.
2014 was another year which Dow progressed on our strategic growth initiatives, and 2015 will be a major milestone
year for Dow with the startup of several of our major investments. Let me give you a quick update on these investments
on slide 13. Our projects on the U.S. Gulf Coast and the Middle East remain on schedule. Sadara will establish a
foundation that we will leverage to compete in the Asian and Middle Eastern markets for the next many decades.
Overall construction is approximately 85% complete with construction for first product assets in the polyolefin value
chain approximately 95% complete.
Falling propylene prices in the United States are improving the competitiveness of our U.S.-based propylene derivative
businesses, while at the same time expanding our integration advantage in our market facing businesses. Our new PDH
unit comes on-stream in the second half of 2015, capturing the propane to propylene spread for one-third of Dow's U.S.

propylene needs, expanding the earnings power of Dow's integrated business model.
I discussed Enlist and the stewarded introduction in 2015. We remain enthusiastic about Enlist along with the entire
suite of Ag Science innovations that continue their steady pace of launches. This business continues to outperform
because it's integrated into Dow's manufacturing and R&D platforms, and we remain on track to once again double the
value of Dow AgroSciences in the next five to seven years.
All of these projects are high-return investments and strengthen Dow's income growth trajectory even during volatile
commodity environments. However, we're not sitting back resting on the returns these investments are bringing and
will bring. We're continuing our drive to take cost out of the organization and maximize the opportunities from the
existing asset. With that lens in mind, let's turn to our productivity actions on slide 14.
We produced and sold more than 3.5 billion incremental pounds in 2014 versus 2013, and we continue to drive to
higher operating rates across the company, yielding lower unit costs, all while remaining a leader in Environmental
Health and Safety performance. In the fourth quarter, Dow achieved an 86% operating rate, an increase of 400 basis
points versus the fourth quarter of 2013 and the highest fourth quarter in the last five years. We also ended the year
with strength. December 2014 came in at 84% versus 79% in December 2013. 2015 has similar opportunity.
In fact, while we've seen a decade of heavy investment in exploration and production which is now resulting in lower
oil and gas prices, those investments significantly outpaced the number of petrochemical investments. Dow has now
experienced accelerating operating rates for five quarters in a row, and when you consider our operating leverage of
more than $200 million for every 1% improvement in operating rates, it's clear that Dow is well-positioned to capture
significant upside in our operating income as we continue to see demand respond to low oil. Low oil price will be a
tailwind for global demand and for our products.
We're also maintaining a constant productivity focus so that we can continue to deliver in a low oil price world. We
have now done this for many years, and our new next enterprise systems architecture is enabling even more opportunity
for further improvements in cost reductions and efficiencies. This focus was a key source of momentum in our results
this quarter and it will also be an important tool for Dow in 2015 and 2016.
One of the other mechanisms to improve productivity is to divest businesses that fall outside of our ROC targets or our
long-term strategic direction. So let's move to slide 16 for a brief update on our portfolio commitments and actions.
Our focus on working capital efficiency and proceeds from portfolio management actions are generating strong cash
flows. At the same time we're driving targeted actions across our portfolio, divesting non-strategic assets and
businesses such as the Angus Chemical Company and sodium borohydride investments which we announced in
November and the carve-out of our chlorine chain, which remains on track for close at the end of this year.
We're also redirecting resources toward more strategic uses and we have been clear on our priorities for uses of cash.
We are and we will continue to invest in our future through organic growth investments and to reward our shareholders
as shown on this slide.
We achieved another record number of patents granted, with 20% of our sales yielding margin differentials greater than
1000 basis points above our non-patent advantaged products. Notably, nearly 35% of Dow's revenue now comes from
new products.
We delivered $6 billion to shareholders in declared dividends and share repurchases. We completed our $4.5 billion
share repurchase program and launched an additional $5 billion tranche and we announced two dividend increases in
the year. Dow's interventions over these last five years have built a more resilient, more stable, higher margin portfolio,
enabling us to more consistently reward and remunerate our shareholders.
Now let's talk about what to expect for the first quarter of 2015 and the year. We see volume growth continuing with
year-over-year growth expected coupled with steady demand. We anticipate Performance Plastics margins will remain
strong, although moderated by lower oil and gas and we see further margin expansion in Performance Materials &
Chemicals driven by ongoing improvements in polyurethanes and epoxy. Equity earnings are expected to be down as
Sadara costs ramp up and MEG prices fall.

We anticipate an increase in turnaround costs in the range of $150 million sequentially and year-over-year. Our
previously announced productivity program will continue to gain traction and we expect to generate approximately
$300 million in improvements by year end, offsetting the impact of inflation. We expect pension to be a headwind in
2015, up more than $100 million on a full year basis, and as our growth projects come online, we expect capital
expenditures to peak at around $3.9 billion for the year.
We anticipate continued near term currency headwinds and expect a range of between 15% to 30% of the change in
revenue to translate to an EBITDA impact. And finally, on tax rate, it's expected to be in the 25% to 28% range for the
year.
Dow had an exceptional 2014, ending the year with a record fourth quarter, delivering a ninth quarter of year-over-year
EPS, EBITDA, and EBITDA margin growth, growing demand for our products, increasing our operating rates,
executing on our strategic initiatives, enhancing our financial discipline, increasing our return on capital and delivering
significant value to our shareholders.
Historically, when Dow has seen escalating operating rates, favorable energy markets, and increasing GDP, it has
boded well for our company's performance in the years that follow. I am excited about where the company is today and
its future.
So with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andrew for a full year view on Dow's performance as well as our outlook
for 2015.
Andrew N. Liveris
Thank you, Howard.
If you can turn to slide 19, I will begin with our vision, our call, the tenet that underscores each and every action that
we take: optimizing long-term value per share. This singular focus was the fuel behind our record performance in 2014
and will propel us in 2015 and beyond. Put simply, we are creating short, medium and long-term value firmly in line
with the strategic actions we have taken and the results that we have delivered over these previous nine quarters.
Moving into 2015, the value and resiliency of our strategy are clear. We are an integrated products company built on
low-cost manufacturing positions with interlinked businesses aligned to attractive end markets and geographies with
decisive growth strategies. We are an interdependent portfolio of assets, and it is through our integrated portfolio in
volatile times such as these that our real strength and our real value are evident.
Leveraging upcycles to capitalize on our cash engines upstream and delivering returns through our differentiated end
market aligned businesses downstream and throughout the cycle, we are proving why it is best to own the full value
chain. We need only to look to the last three months as an example, where markets were volatile and moving fast and
creating uncertainty around 2015 performance and yet these dynamics emphasized the advantages of the Dow model
and strategy.
Pure play North American ethylene producers have faced headwinds from falling oil. That same headwind, which of
course we feel to a much more limited extent, largely represents a tailwind in our businesses aligned to Consumer,
Infrastructure, Performance Materials & Chemicals sectors and indeed, Performance Plastics. In addition, this low oil
price environment is further mitigated by our flexible feed stock position in the United States and Europe, and has
made this new energy environment a net competitive position for Dow.
Our European Plastics businesses in fourth quarter showed this as one clear proof point. Other examples that balance
each other to the positive for Dow's unique business model in this environment is the propylene effect. Even though the
lower propylene prices in the United States is a small headwind for our PDH investment, it is a stronger tailwind for
our acrylics and polyurethanes businesses as it enables margin expansion and an improved competitive position.

For further illustration of the value of our strategy, just look at our record fourth quarter results. Despite plunging oil,
we reported a 15%, $314 million, increase in operating EBITDA with growth in every segment. Let me be clear: I'm
not here to state that there will be no challenges from lower oil; however, we believe the energy supply dynamic that is
ongoing will lead to a long-term lower volatility scenario for our underlying structural positions. The long-term lower
volatility of both oil and natural gas will reduce cyclicality of what have been historically cyclical businesses and more
effectively leverage the potential of our integrated model to deliver value to our shareholders.
Turning to slide 20, and in this context, we are demonstrating that our strategy maximizes value. It leverages our
strengths, advantages rooted in our integration to help mitigate macroeconomic pressures and enable Dow to deliver
long-term sustainable returns. In 2014, we committed to achieving a series of near-term priorities focused on adding
value across our integrated value chains by advancing our key growth catalysts, launching new products, driving
productivity actions, divesting non-strategic assets and businesses and delivering stronger returns. We said we would
do these things and we did. They are fully listed on this slide but let me highlight a few.
We have boosted output from our existing asset base more than 4% behind solid demand and innovation, and we are
primed to bring our key growth projects, such as the first units in Sadara and the PDH unit in Texas online this year,
together with a stewarded introduction of our Enlist program. We accelerated actions across our portfolio with $2
billion in proceeds expected from divestitures signed or completed in 2014. We announced expanded three year, $1
billion productivity program. We delivered record adjusted cash flow from operations and a record $6 billion
shareholder remunerations by our declared dividends and share repurchases. We achieved, exceeded and most
importantly, we executed against the commitments we made. And this is not a deviation from previous quarters or even
years.
We have built the right model for volatile times, and we have the culture and agility to move fast to maximize value in
all cycles, navigating near-term dynamics with our unrelenting focus on streamlining costs and accelerating
productivity.
Turning to slide 21, our priorities for 2015 remain consistent, and as we navigate anticipated headwinds such as
ongoing market uncertainty, we are doing so with a recognition of the value of our investments and our leadership
position in the markets in which we participate. Our team has driven significant and strategic enhancements to our
portfolio to mitigate challenging energy markets in line with those that we have seen today.
2015 is a major milestone year for Dow, with our PDH plant and Sadara coming online, operating rates remaining high
in the Plastics businesses and with new product introductions in Agricultural Sciences, Electronics Materials, amongst
others and maintaining the drive for more production at lower costs, the full value of our entire integrated portfolio will
once again be very evident. The market and world economy will be volatile, although still growing, especially in the
United States and increasingly in China.
We believe we have the portfolio that will continue to win even in this sort of global marketplace as we clearly have
demonstrated in 2014. In short, our integrated, diversified strategy will continue to deliver higher cash flows, more
consistent earnings and most importantly, increased shareholder rewards to you, our shareholders – our singular and
driving focus.
With that, Jack, let's turn to Q&A.

Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question we'll hear from Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Good morning, gentlemen. And, Andrew, do you need to give Andy Grove a royalty every
time you use Intel Inside?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: [Laughter] I know you heard it on the TV, and I don't know, but someone can find out for
me...
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: [Laughter] I think you're fine there. Hey, I appreciate you pointing out that you're not immune
to – that there's no challenges from low oil, but I really didn't hear too much about destocking and the expectations are
– obviously not a lot of impact in Q4. What are your thoughts on customer destocking impact on Dow here in Q1?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Well, thanks, Frank. We obviously watch this very closely. We have our weekly meetings
and our product managers and marketing managers, geographic managers. We clearly were watching for customer
buying behavior as low oil kept occurring through the quarter. And yes, there were some – I actually mentioned it on
TV today – there were some delays in purchasing, but it wasn't due to demand destruction. People were just
anticipating lower prices. We're seeing January orders in line with our expected growth. Demand for February is
firming as we enter the month. We believe inventories in the industrial engines are at lows, and this is basically pent-up
demand based on the view that prices could drop even further.
<A - Howard I. Ungerleider>: I would also say, Frank – good morning – that when you look at Plastics, the industry
operating rates in polyethylene was at 88% in the fourth quarter, and we were running well above that number.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: That's very helpful. And just sticking on the Plastics side, you mentioned that margins are
remaining strong in that business and that's your expectation for 2015. But where do you think that they may decline
to? 2013 levels? What are your thoughts on how the impact of oil might compress Plastics margins?
<A - Howard I. Ungerleider>: I would say clearly in the natural gas liquid world, so the North America world and the
Middle East, you're going to see margins decline. And we saw some of that happen in the fourth quarter for sure and
the pressure is going to continue into 2015. But remember the naphtha world – we have our European assets as well as
our Asian joint ventures, and even in Latin America we're doing very well and we saw margins expand as well as
demand strength in both Latin America as well as significant strength even in the fourth quarter in Europe.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: And I think, Frank, just to elaborate, it's a key question. Remember, 2015 with demand
growth still there as – for your earlier question – as you get into the back half of this year, we believe low oil price is
very good for world demand. And as you get global growth coming back through low oil prices you'll start to see the
beginning of peak economics in the Plastics engine going into 2016 and 2017. So we do believe with tight operating
rates there's a lot of operating leverage here and our value-add strategy actually gives us margin that we just don't get
on the feed stock, we get it in the packaging, elastomers and E&T business.

And next we'll move on to David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Thank you. Good morning. Andrew, I know you don't give guidance, but given the
challenges you and Howard mentioned for 2015, do you think Dow Chemical can grow earnings in 2015 versus 2014?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Thank you for your question. Clearly the path the company is on with a record EBITDA
performance last year. I want you to note how we got there. We had a $900 million increase in EBITDA, on about a
$1.1 billion increase in sales. That tells you that we have a resilient portfolio, but we also have the right mindset around

innovation and productivity. Howard, in his script, talked about the innovation agenda across the company. Just look at
Ag. Q4 on Q4 year-on-year Ag, 23% of their revenues were based on new products introduced just in that one year.
So we have an ability to go after earnings growth independent of commodity environments. We're not a commodity
company, but we use commodity inputs to add value. I think what you'll see from us, a continual drumbeat. We will
have margin pressure across some of the portfolio based on low oil price. In the back half of this year, as demand gets
tighter, I think we have an opportunity to certainly match last year's performance.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: And lastly, Howard – Andrew – just on Sadara. At the current oil price, what's the impact on
the $0.5 billion of equity earnings you put out there for Sadara longer term by 2018?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Look, the old view of forecasting five years out almost seems to be out the door. We
couldn't forecast, all of us, a year ago what would happen to oil today, right? So it's a very hesitant forecaster here that
talks about the impact on Sadara. Just remember that Sadara is more than just a gas cracker, ethane cracker. It's a mixed
feeds cracker that also uses other refinery streams from Aramco, not just naphtha, so please remember we've got ways
to get from here to there even in a low oil environment.
<A - Howard I. Ungerleider>: David, I would also add – this is Howard – that that $500 million was a 10-year
average run rate over the first 10 years. So we're not stepping away from that number.

And next we'll move onto Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Robert Andrew Koort>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Morning.
<Q - Robert Andrew Koort>: Could you help us – I may have missed it, but the size of that Pioneer contract
adjustment? And then does that impair at all your view of the ability to get more than 50 million acres of available
market for the Enlist? How should we think about any ramifications on the value of Enlist from a very large potential
customer?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: We didn't declare it, Bob, so that's your first answer. But the answer to your second
question in short is a firm no. We did not need that agreement and we have our own channels as well as other channels
to more than make up anything that might have been foreshadowed as a loss on that contract.
<A - Howard I. Ungerleider>: I would also say that don't forget we're in the process of closing on our Coodetec
acquisition in Brazil, and that's going to really help our ability in Latin America to grow soybean as well as the regional
players here in North America.
<Q - Robert Andrew Koort>: And, Andrew, I was wondering if you might give a perspective – we've had this reset of
oil prices, I think you've rightly bragged about your operating rates, but as an industry if we look over the next year for
those crackers that weren't advantaged on U.S. ethane, do you think the margin structure for the non-U.S. ethane
crackers of the world will be higher over the next year than it's been in the past year, or do you think the depressed oil
price will just flow through to the customers ultimately?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: We don't believe so. We believe that there's apples and oranges in a question like that.
You've got to go through cracker by cracker. Restarting a cracker that's based on naphtha just because of this current oil
price naphtha scenario is not a given. In fact, we don't believe many of them will restart at all. To restart an idle cracker
takes a lot of money, and it's a big bet in this sort of environment. So we believe supply tightness is in our imminent
future. Operating rates are high across the entire Plastics chain. Those that are advantaged – remember Bob, 70% of our
cracker fleet is in advantaged jurisdictions under oil – all oil and gas scenarios, and we're flexible.

So we're advantaged even in disadvantaged regions like Europe. And in fact we've had margin expansion in Europe
based on our ability to be cracking propane there, and that's also true in North America. So we really believe that what's
going on out here is a net positive, and you're seeing it in our operating rates, you're seeing it in our leverage. We've
returned to operating rates as a company that we had in 2007. How we've done that, we've taken out low-end assets.
We've taken out uncompetitive assets and the rest of the industry's done the same. So we believe that this is all tailwind
as you get into the back half of this year.
<A - Howard I. Ungerleider>: I would also add, just on Andrew's propane or LPG point, rather, in Europe we've
improved that capability from the low-40% range to mid-50s, around 55% in Europe. And in North America, I mean
from a propane standpoint, we do have the most feedstock flexible propane cracking of anyone else in the industry.

And next we'll move on to P.J. Juvekar with Citi.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Yes. Hi. Good morning.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Morning.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Andrew, it seems like you got a big benefit from lower energy complex in some of your
specialties. So is there a giveback this year? Meaning if the specialty complex declines with a lag in the first half?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Well, so the portfolio we've built has obviously lower input prices and as you go through
the propane point is the great example of that, with flexibility, we can take advantage of any input, no matter what the
situation is, whether it's naphtha, whether it's refinery related streams, propane or ethane.
But your main point is we have a portfolio that's doing value-add and the value-add in our strategy, we've been saying
this over and over, we don't have your vanilla-grade plastics business. We have a plastics business that has packaging
value-add; elastomer value-add; E&T, electrical and telecommunications, value-add. We make money in that part of
the chain and that's a specialty lag effect, if you like, because those customers aren't asking for the price decrease at the
pace of the feedstock decrease because they don't see the correlation. But that's especially true in electronic materials,
in our water business, in some of our more downstream businesses in building construction. So that is the portfolio
we've built.
We think we have, in essence, an opportunity here versus a challenge. Everyone else that's more exposed to the price
effect will have margin challenges. We are not that type of company because of the portfolio we have built. We have
exited commodity businesses that had that volatility effect. So there is a dampened effect in our specialties portfolio,
which is two-thirds of the company, and it's integrated to the low cost feedstocks, so it's a win-win for us.
<A - Howard I. Ungerleider>: P.J., this is Howard, good morning. I just want to add on this innovation play, I know
you guys don't typically give us credit for innovation, but we've got a track record now on patents, 2014 was the fifth
year in a row where we applied for over 900 patents. It was another record year of patent applications granted by the
U.S. Patent Office. Look, from a finance perspective, I don't like patents because of the plaque on the wall. The reason
why I'm so focused on it is we get – and I referenced it, I think, in the prepared remarks, we get 1000 basis points
additional margin on a patent advantaged sale versus a non-patent advantaged sale.
So I think you're also starting to see that help our stickiness in price, but I agree with Andrew, we're not going to be
immune to it, but we should be able to be a relative outperformer in that space.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Thank you for that. And then Europe seems like it's not growing. You've got the FX headwinds.
What further steps can you take in Europe to adjust your cost structure? And maybe can Howard hedge out some
currencies there?
<A - Howard I. Ungerleider>: Well, in terms of Europe, you've seen some of the improvements in profitability
continue to show itself through 2014. We had higher operating rates through the quarter. We've been taking out – we

completed the 2012 restructuring program in 2014. A significant number of those 28 assets were in the European area,
so we've done that.
From a currency, P.J., it's definitely going be a headwind. It was a headwind in the fourth quarter. Our price was down
4% in the quarter. 2% of that was currency. If you drive that to the EBITDA line it was probably around a $75 million
EBITDA headwind in the fourth quarter.
And so you'll see that still happen in 2015, but I think it's really important to note that we have our assets in the regions
where we sell our products, fundamentally. And many of our raw materials and many of our end products are either
tied to dollars or are heavily influenced in dollars, so most of our currency impact is really going to be around
translation back to the U.S. dollar on the income statement. And then of course you're going to see some balance sheet
impact, which you certainly saw in the fourth quarter where we have assets in Europe that get translated back on the
balance sheet. And that's why the net debt-to-cap moved up a little bit, primarily because of that and our pension.

And next we'll move on to Aleks Yefremov with Nomura.
<Q - Aleksey Yefremov>: Good morning. Andrew, could you update us on your view on supply of natural gas liquids
in the U.S. in the new oil price environment?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yes. So thank you for your question. We obviously – ethane rejection economics are
playing in the wet fields and certainly the NGL production at $3 gas is much more economic for those guys who are
producing wet gas. So you're going to keep getting production of ethane and propane as it applies. So that's all
advantaged the guys like us who are buying. We don't see that changing any time soon, independent of the oil price.
Clearly the oil price has had an effect on new rigs and new rig counts, and that's all dropped off, well reported. And
clearly if you've got dry gas you've been shut in for a while, so that doesn't help you all that much. But as you know, it's
your question that plays here. And NGLs continue to be rejected but are still the most profitable part of the producers of
wet gas.
<Q - Aleksey Yefremov>: Thank you. As a follow up, do you have any update on the status of Dow Corning JV?
Were there any additional discussions since the investor day?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: So Dow Corning, as much as all of our JV cleanup strategy, we talked about at our investor
day, and clearly we're looking quite long and hard at who are natural owners of our JVs. You've asked for transparency
in how we report our businesses. So going narrower in numbers of JVs is our clear strategy. There's nothing to update
you on, nothing extra to say other than clearly that's one of our strategies and clearly our partners at Corning have to
make their own statements.

And next we'll move on to Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Arun S. Viswanathan>: Thanks, guys. I guess the first question I had was just on the NGL side. You've stated in
past presentations that you can go up to 60% propane, or 55%, and a similar number on LPG in Europe. But what is a
realistic number, and is there anything that precludes you from getting that high? Is there enough supply in those
regions to actually get to 60% or you'll be cracking 30%, 35%?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: There's nothing that precludes us going that high other than – we run a group – Jack used to
run it, so maybe we should let Jack answer it. But in essence what the whole strategy is, is we look at our furnace crack
on a daily basis and we pivot around appropriately where we have the flex capability. So nothing stops us from taking it
to those numbers. Right, Jack?

<A - Jack Broodo>: Yes, Arun. In Europe we continue to expand our capability to crack LPGs, both propane and
butane, and then the length of the season where propane is much cheaper than naphtha continues to grow as U.S.
continues to expand more and more LPG. So U.S. LPG expansions help Europe and they also firm price in the U.S.
which helps production in the U.S., and so it's a double win for us and strategically, structurally, helps us.
<Q - Arun S. Viswanathan>: Thanks. The other question was just a quick update on the chlorine sale. Are you still
sticking to $3 billion to $4 billion in your targeted proceeds and the $500 million in EBITDA in light of recent declines
in EDC and PVC? Thanks.
<A - Howard I. Ungerleider>: Yes. The short answer – good morning – is yes, we're on the trajectory that we laid out
at investor day. That's for a close at the end of – before the end of this year, 2015, and we're still sticking to all those
numbers. Actually we are in the data room. It's a robust auction. There's strategic buyers as well as financial buyers,
and we feel very good about where we are.

And next we'll move on to John Roberts with UBS.
<Q - John E. Roberts>: Thank you. Just first a follow up on that. Could you tell us yet whether it's going be one
transaction or multiple transactions and whether Dow will retain any interests in any of the transactions?
<A - Howard I. Ungerleider>: Yes. The short answer is no. We're looking at it from what's going to maximize value
for Dow shareholders, short as well as long-term, so there's still an option for it to be two transactions or one
transaction. So that'll depend really on who the ultimate buyer will turn out to be based on value.
<Q - John E. Roberts>: And then second, I was thinking the discussions with your partners in EQUATE and
MEGlobal could go quickly, since you're dealing with a limited number of potential buyers of your JV interest. But
now with the drop in oil prices, do you think it might take longer to come to any agreements there?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Well, clearly dropping oil prices affected all the oil producing nations, and Kuwait is not
immune to them. It's less about that, John, and more about the strategic rationale that our partners have for expansion in
the value add, which in their case is petrochemicals. It's a big deal for them, EQUATE and our presence in EQUATE.
So frankly this is not a one-month, two-month conversation. Never has been. It's more what are they going to do with
their expansionary needs. They want to expand into liquids cracking, for example. They have announced that. They've
announced projects in Vietnam and China. So they have a holistic view to their strategy, and more Kuwait ownership
with time on our JVs is something that interests them. So look, it's going at a good pace. Nothing to report. And just a
little footnote, MEGlobal is different than the Kuwait-based joint ventures and can beat to its own drum.
Operator
And next we'll hear from Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America.
<Q - Kevin W. McCarthy>: A couple of questions on cash deployment. In looking at your balance sheet, it looks like
your pension and OPEB liability increased. I assume that's on discount rate and mortality. Can you comment as to the
cash required for pension in 2015 as well as the likely pace of execution against your remaining $5 billion authorization
on repurchases?
<A - Howard I. Ungerleider>: Yes. Sure. Good morning, Kevin. You're exactly right. The pension liability increased
by about $3 billion. About 75% of that was because of the lower discount rate. It was down about 90 basis points.
About 25% was the new mortality tables that got put in.
Your second question was on the stock buy-back. We're still on the same trajectory of what I laid out at investor day,
which is a couple of points. We expect it to be roughly $2 billion of stock buy-back in 2015 timed with the divestitures
from our portfolio moves.

<Q - Kevin W. McCarthy>: Okay. And then a second question, if I may, on polyurethanes. Quite strong results in the
quarter. Can you speak to your outlook volumetrically as well as from a price perspective, and comment on how you
would expect pricing to differ in, let's say, merchant sales of intermediates versus systems, how much stickier systems
might be?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yes. So the noted value creation of polyurethanes that you pointed out really started a
couple years ago when you remember we put that famous diagram, the bubble chart, together and said PU had to be
fixed as did Epoxy.
Glenn Wright and his team have done a sensational job repositioning the value chain. It's occurred at all parts of the
value chain, to answer your question. It's occurred at the propylene oxide end, it's occurred in the polyurethanes
components end and it's occurred at the systems end. And it's been a repositioning plus a productivity drive. They've
achieved their productivity goals but they've also repositioned to end use growth markets like energy efficiency, for
example; high end durables; high end furniture and bedding.
So they've got a technology-driven program that's very focused on the value add and of course the lower input costs.
This should be further enhanced this year when PDH starts up. So we're quite proud of the turnaround in polyurethanes
and it's been both points – productivity and a repositioning.

And next we'll move to Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global.
<Q - Hassan I. Ahmed>: Morning, Andrew.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Morning.
<Q - Hassan I. Ahmed>: Quite a few comments made on flexibility and the whole ethane/propane side of things. And
I guess a lot of them were directed to the European side of things. So my question is more specific to the U.S. side of
things. Obviously the market's a bit fearful that ethane-based margins have come down, call it $0.06, $0.07 a pound
relative to 2014 averages. But if I take a look at U.S. propane-based ethylene margins, they're actually up, even sort of
higher than where ethane-based margins were last year. So my question is how high could you take your propane bias
in the U.S.? And could you actually come up with a scenario that if we were to mark everything to market to current
pricing, year-on-year we could actually have higher margins this year than last year?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Well, firstly, we can go up to 70% of our crack slate here in the U.S. So if you look at the
propane dynamic you just talked about, then clearly there's a scenario here that has us not feeling the effect of the oil to
gas or naphtha to ethane arbitrage as much as others. That clearly is further enhanced by propane dehydrogenation, as
I've already implied in my script. I'm not going to foreshadow – I'll repeat in our Plastics record profits last year and
frankly, the year before, they've been expanding profits quite considerably but our feedstock flex, as propylene
weakens there could be some effect of margins coming down on some of our businesses. But as far as Polyethylene and
Plastics is concerned and mark-to-market, advantage Dow on propane crack.
<Q - Hassan I. Ahmed>: Fair enough. And as a follow up, we've begun to hear about some project cancellations. I
know you talked about on the Dow side of things the projects being on track and the like, but recently we heard about a
Shell project cancellation out in Qatar. And recently, Sasol canceling one of their GTL facilities. What's your view
about some of these newer greenfield ethylene facilities in the U.S.? Do you think there will be more cancellations
going forward? And part and parcel with that, where do you stand today in terms of your cycle view?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Second question first. So we haven't changed our view on the cycle. And since low oil
started last quarter, we've been very clear that we think ultimately six to nine months out, low oil price foreshadows
increased demand, so this should help the world economy, not hurt it. Which I know is a view that not many others talk
about, but I think our results should show that. So we don't have to talk about it, we can just show our results. So that
then says demand is there. Operating leverage is there, to Bob Koort's earlier question, so then you see the cycle

playing out in 2016, 2017, with the back half of this year creating further tightening opportunities based on demand.
In terms of supply, we don't think any of the big ethane crack projects will be affected. I think those economics are still
sound based on excess NGLs as per an earlier question I got. I do think, as you're seeing with some of the projects,
even the one yesterday on Sasol GTL, anything oil-related, anything directly connected to the oil molecule will
definitely be delayed. We're seeing a ton of those being delayed. But that's less about what the U.S. projects will do. I
think those U.S. projects – the ones that we've all foreshadowed, the 2017, 2018 start-ups will be relatively unaffected.

And next move on to John McNulty with Credit Suisse.
<Q - John P. McNulty>: Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So looking back historically, when we
saw big commodity moves down and/or oil prices move down, there was the benefit of pretty significant working
capital benefits for you in the past. But admittedly, most of those were during weak economic periods. We don't have
that this time around. So I guess how are you thinking about the potential for working capital to really drive significant
cash flow for you in 2015?
<A - Howard I. Ungerleider>: Yes. I mean, overall it should be a nice tailwind to our cash flow, and I think you
started to see that show already in the fourth quarter. We're working not only on the raw material or the price cost side
of the equation but also on the volume unit side with our efficiency programs. So our DSI was down by four days in the
fourth quarter versus the third quarter. 60% of that drop was volume and 40% of that was based on price cost. So it will
be a tailwind in 2015.
<Q - John P. McNulty>: Great. And then just with regard to the run rate EBITDA for the projects coming up in 2015,
looks like they've been tweaked a little bit lower from the investor day. Is that an oil reflection? Are you kind of
marking things to the market right now, or do you have other assumptions that maybe we should think about in those
numbers?
<A - Howard I. Ungerleider>: No, John, I don't think we've actually come off in terms of our public position on any
of those projects. I mean, I think if you look at where the specific margins were in the fall, they've come off a bit just
from a market standpoint but they're still well above what we originally laid out. So the PH unit of $450 million, you
look at the implied spread on propane to propylene, that's still well within our guidance that we've given.
<A - Jack Broodo>: Yes, John, at our investor forum we had an example of the prompt value of those projects, but we
did not say that that was a change in what we expected from the run rate numbers we had published.
Operator
And next we'll move on to Duffy Fischer with Barclays.
<Q - Patrick Duffy Fischer>: Yes. Good morning, fellows. Question on Ag. Your commentary seems to be a little bit
more optimistic than what we've heard from others where folks have talked about a decent amount of inventory in the
system, probably some that needs to get worked down, and some areas where you're seeing pricing pressure. So can
you just go through – would you expect or do you see too much inventory in some of your product chains in Ag? And
then would you expect some pricing pressure across your portfolio this year?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Clearly we see the same effect on corn and corn inventories. I mean, there's no question that
the low commodity prices and farmer economics have changed on corn, which is causing the rotation of soy and clearly
we see that same effect. So that isn't any different.
But the thing that differentiates us from our competitors is our product pipeline and what Howard talked about. Bugs
don't see falling corn prices. Insecticides are still being used. We've launched two major classes of insecticides in this
last little while, Isoclast and Spinetoram. Both sales are up year-on-year. New product sales year-on-year, Q4 to Q4, up

23% in one year. This is Dow's AgroSciences product pipeline coming through big time: Arylex herbicide, broad
spectrum herbicide, cereal fungicide – these are not affected by farmer corn economics, so that's what you're seeing in
our result.
<Q - Patrick Duffy Fischer>: Okay. And then just back on the Pet Chem side, if we remain in this type of an oil
environment throughout the year, do you think the more marginal production in Asia is MTO-based or would it be
naphtha based the way you would look at it?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Well, I don't think – firstly, there's a whole scenario around MTO not coming on at the pace
anyone thinks it's going to come on. I think there's an oil recalibration going on because of oil and coal. Remember that
methanol's coming from coal. And so that's going to change a lot in terms of when those projects come online. Which
therefore defaults to your question being answered by saying it's incremental naphtha. But I've already answered the
previous question about there's not many of that that's going to come online. The way we view it is Asia's going to stay
high cost under any scenario. The beneficiary to this low oil scenario is mostly in Europe, especially those that can take
NGL crack by propane.
<A - Jack Broodo>: Duffy, thank you for your question. With that, we're going to stop the questions. And we
appreciate all of your questions. Andrew, would you like to make a few final comments?
Andrew N. Liveris
Well, yes. I would like to say that last year was a record year for Dow and this was a design. We have a strategy that's
working. We have built our business to be standardly high margin and high return in most economic environments. The
key to those has been the progression of actions these last many years. The sale of our most commoditized high margin
products. We've locked in low cost competitive and flexible feedstock capacity and we have technology advantaged
high margin products. These changes are in place now and are producing, and are creating a sustainable business model
that gives us much opportunity in 2015 versus challenge.
We remind you that the driver of volume and price is demand, far more than just feedstock input price. Demand for our
products, and in particular our advantaged products, is very strong. We are very confident our strength will continue
this year.
Jack Broodo
Thank you, Andrew. As always, we appreciate your interest in the Dow Chemical Company. For your reference, a copy
of our prepared comments will be posted on Dow's website later today. This concludes our call for today. We look
forward to speaking with you again soon.
