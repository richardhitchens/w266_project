MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, everyone, and welcome to today's program. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later
you'll have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note
this call is being recorded.
It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. Lee McEntire. Please go ahead.
Lee McEntire
Good morning. Thanks to everyone on the phone as well as the webcast for joining us this morning for the third quarter
2016 results. Hopefully, everybody's had a chance to review the earnings release documents that are available on the
website.
Before I turn the call over to Brian and Paul, let me remind you we may make some forward-looking statements. For
further information on these, please refer to either our earnings release documents, our website or our SEC filings.

One thing before Brian and Paul get into the results, I just want to remind you we filed an 8-K on October 4, giving
notification the company changed our method of accounting for the amortization of premium and accretion of discounts
related to certain debt securities, known by the investment committee as FAS 91. Our change to the contractual
method, which is used by the majority of our peers, will provide better comparability of our results. As a result of that
change, we restated our historical results and provided the historically restated information in the 8-K, and our earnings
materials today naturally reflect those restatements.
With that, let me turn it over to Brian Moynihan, our Chairman and CEO, for some opening comments before Paul
Donofrio, our CFO, goes through the details. Brian?
Brian T. Moynihan
Thank you, Lee. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to review our third quarter results.
Our results this quarter continue our progress on our long-term strategy. We continue to drive responsible growth and
deliver more of the company's capabilities to our clients and customers. This progress is becoming clear with each
successive quarter, and you can see the highlights of that on slide two.
We reported earnings of $5 billion or $0.41 per diluted share, an EPS improvement of 8% from the year ago quarter.
We improved operating leverage across the businesses, utilizing technology to lower costs and improve our processes.
Our pre-tax earnings improved 17% compared to third quarter 2015. This pre-tax earnings comparison is important as it
eliminates the unusual movements in the tax line, like this quarter's tax charge for the U.K. corporate tax rate change.
Like last quarter, I thought I'd address a few topics we're hearing from all of you. To do that, let's look at slide three and
four of the earnings material. The first question is: are we making progress driving our responsible growth strategy?
Yes, we continue to show progress throughout all the businesses. Our revenue growth has more clarity as we move past
the periods of significant impacts from implementing regulations, running off non-core portfolios and divesting
non-core businesses. Revenue grew 3% over the third quarter of last year. The high net improvement is our continued
investment in this great franchise, in our sales teams, in our technology across the board.
These sales teams and the buildup we've been doing there helps us to increase our capacity to serve our customers and
clients. An example of that is in our Consumer business. We are focused on being the core bank to all our households.
This has resulted in fewer checking accounts than we had years ago but the average balance of the checking accounts
we have has doubled, and they are now roughly $60 to $100 per account. You can also see this in the growth of our
Merrill Edge brokerage balances, which now total over $138 billion adding investment relationships to the mass market
customer base. In general, consumers are deepening their relationships with us as they use our straightforward investing
tools to get them started on the path to investing.
For affluent and wealthy customers, our customer progress also continues. Our Global Wealth and Investment
Management teams, U.S. Trust and Merrill Lynch not only managed $2 trillion-plus in investment balances but also
managed nearly $150 billion in loans and more than $250 billion in deposits, and we continue to see net flows of core
assets in that business.
On the Commercial side, clients continue to respond to our universal banking model for a simplified stop for financing,
investing, and advisory services. We will continue to operate with our established risk framework and defined customer
groups, and we aren't reaching for growth. This will drive more sustainable results over a longer period of time for our
shareholders.
And then with our global peers restructuring, including in the markets business, I think this quarter is another great
example of our Global Markets business's importance to our investing and issuing clients. We saw better client activity
driving the best third quarter results we've had in five years in investment banking and in sales and trading. And we're
doing that with a smaller balance sheet, fewer people, and lower value at risk, or VaR. So growth and deepening, al
consistent with our responsible growth strategy, continues across all the customer bases. Paul will talk to you more
about the statistics and these successes.

Another question that we get asked is can credit remain this strong? Many of you asked that last quarter and the quarter
before that and the quarter before that. And this quarter, it still got better again with our charge-off ratio declined to 40
basis points this quarter at an historic low. This was driven by changes we made right after the crisis. Think in 2008 and
2009 and long-term benefit for that effort continue to come through, and by the way, sticking to our responsible growth
strategy even as times have been relatively better.
U.S. consumer health is generally good. Over the past few quarters, exposures in our oil and gas that were causing
industry concerns for commercial losses have improved and charge-offs have receded. Other commercial credit
remains very strong and Paul will touch on these topics later.
Another question we get asked is what can we do to drive earnings even if we stay in this low rate, low growth
environment? We aren't waiting for interest rates to rise here at Bank of America. We're driving our earnings growth
now. We work on the things that we can control, expenses, loan and deposit growth, and steady growth. Long-term
rates are down compared to last year yet earnings have grown. Despite that, net interest income is up 3% from third
quarter 2015, while net interest yield has been stable because we grew core loans and deposits. Paul will take you
through loan growth details later, but I wanted to pause a moment and talk about our deposit growth.
Deposits are a core part of what drives our franchise earnings. We have $1.2 trillion of deposits. That's proof that
customers entrust us to safeguard their money. We are heavily weighted to mix those deposits towards consumers,
whether they're general consumers or wealthy consumers. This, in turn, provides a very stable base of funding for the
company and allows us to be less reliant on the markets we're funding. Nearly $450 billion or 36% of our deposits are
non-interest bearing, a very strong mix. Deposits on average grew $68 billion year over year or 6%. The teams have
done tremendous work here and this quarter wasn't an anomaly. This is the fourth consecutive quarter where we have
grown deposits more than $50 billion over the previous year.
And our commercial teams remain focused on growing deposits also. They're growing deposits that are LCR friendly
and doing great work with our industry-leading cash management capabilities. As a result, year over year, Global
Banking grew their deposits 3% to $300 billion. Our Consumer Wealth Management teams combined have $860
billion in deposits. They grew this large base by 8% in the past 12 months.
For the first time, Consumer topped $600 billion in deposits. These deposits are growing because our capabilities in the
business are the best in the industry and our customers and clients see that, whether it's our 21 million plus mobile
banking customers, our 34 million plus online customers, or the more than five million customers that come into our
financial centers every week. These customers show that they appreciate the capabilities and integration of our
networks.
So when we look at what else we can do to control and drive earnings in a low-growth environment, we get asked a lot
about expenses and can those expenses keep being driven down and go lower. Well, the answer is yes. Last quarter, we
gave you a 2018 expense target, and we continue to make progress towards that.
Our expenses declined 3% from the third quarter of 2015 to 2016. Our efficiency ratio improved to 62% this quarter.
That is a 400 basis point improvement from last year's third quarter. We continue to deliver on expense reductions
while continuing to invest in technology and sales teams and other matters that are important for the future of this
franchise.
After you take into account the additional large bank FDIC assessment that started this quarter, expenses are also down
on a linked-quarter basis, even as we continue to invest and absorb all the severance, regulatory, resolution planning
and other repositioning costs to continue to reduce our operating costs.
We have been innovating in technology and we'll continue to do so to improve processes and eliminate the need for
paper and humans handling that paper. Our Simplify and Improve initiatives continue to help drive those costs down.
And that leads to the question we also get asked: can we deliver and sustain returns above our cost of capital?
As we talked about earlier, we restated our results to change under FAS 91 and reduce the variability to make us more
comparable to peers. As you can see, that makes it a little easier to see the longer-term return on tangible common

equity trends. This quarter, we reported 10.3%. It is now stabilized above the cost of capital, even given our larger and
larger capital base.
We still have work to do here to drive it to our ultimate goals, but this quarter is another strong step in that direction.
And importantly, on slide four, you can see that each business has improved its leverage. They grew their earnings,
have strong efficiency and returned far above the cost of capital, and all that continues to bode well as we look ahead.
So as we look forward, we are driving responsible growth and maintaining discipline on costs, and this has allowed us
to deliver more capital back to you, and we'll keep on doing that.
Now let me turn it over to Paul to cover the numbers. Paul?
Paul M. Donofrio
Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everybody. Since Brian covered the income statement highlights, I will start with the
balance sheet on page five.
Strong deposit growth drove a small increase in the size of our balance sheet versus Q2. Deposits rose $17 billion or
6% on an annualized basis. During the quarter, long-term debt fell by $5 billion. We put cash to work growing
securities in our investment portfolio and more modestly through loan growth. Global liquidity sources rose driven by
deposit growth, and we remain well compliant with LCR requirements. Tangible common equity of $174 billion
improved by $2.8 billion from Q2, driven by earnings.
In the process, we returned $2.2 billion to common shareholders through a combination of dividends and $1.4 billion in
share repurchases. On a per share basis, tangible book value increased to $17.14, up $1.60 or 11% from Q3 2015. I
would note that this increase was driven by both retained earnings as well as share repurchases below tangible book
value as we reduced shares 3% from Q3 2015.
Turning to regulatory metrics, as a reminder, we report capital under the Advanced approaches. Our CET1 transition
ratio under Basel 3 ended the quarter at 11%. On a fully phased-in basis, CET1 capital improved $4 billion to $166
billion. Under the Advanced approaches, compared to Q2 2016, our CET1 ratio increased 40 basis points to 10.9% and
is well above our 10% 2019 requirement. RWA declined roughly $20 billion, driven by reductions in Global Markets
exposures and improvements in credit quality driven by runoff of non-core legacy exposure.
We also improved our capital metrics under the standardized approach. Here, our CET1 ratio improved to 11.8%.
Supplemental leverage ratio for both parent and bank continued to exceed U.S. regulatory minimums to take effect in
2018.
Turning to slide six, on an average basis, total loans were up $23 billion or 3% from Q3 2015, and while up from Q2
2016, growth was at a slower pace. Consistent with past periods, we break out loans in our business segments and in
All Other. Year over year, loans in All Other were down $30 billion driven by continued runoff of first and second lien
mortgages, while loans in our business segments were up $53 billion or 7%.
In Consumer Banking, we continue to see growth in residential real estate and vehicle lending, offset somewhat by
home equity paydowns, which continue to outpace originations. In Wealth Management, we saw growth in residential
real estate and structured lending. Global Banking loans were up $26 billion or 8% year over year. On the bottom right
of the chart, note the growth of $68 billion average deposits that Brian mentioned.
Turning to asset quality on slide seven. We believe a number of factors, including our strategy of responsible growth,
enhanced underwriting standards since 2008, and a healthier economy have transformed the risk profile of Bank of
America as we look forward to future economic cycles. Total net charge-offs of $888 million improved $97 million
from Q2. Consumer losses declined across a number of products and commercial losses also declined driven by lower
energy losses. Driven by these improvements, provision expense of $850 million declined $126 million from Q2. We
had a small overall net reserve release in the quarter as consumer real estate releases more than offset bills and other
products.

On slide eight, we provide credit quality data on our Consumer portfolio. We remain focused on originating consumer
loans with borrowers with high FICO scores, and our asset quality remains strong. Net charge-offs declined $71 million
from Q2. This improvement was broad-based across consumer real estate as well as credit card. Note that credit cards
account for more than two-thirds of losses in our consumer portfolio and within our U.S. credit card book, the loss rate
improved to 2.45%. NPLs improved and reserve coverage remained strong.
Moving to commercial credit on slide nine. Net charge-offs of $110 million improved $26 million from Q2. With
respect to energy, exposures are down, losses improved, oil prices have stabilized and we have $1 billion of reserves.
More specifically, energy charge-offs of $45 billion (sic) [$45 million] decreased $34 billion (sic) [$34 million] from
Q2. While reservable criticized declined from Q2, we did experience an increase in NPLs this quarter, which was
concentrated with two clients, one in metals and mining and one in energy.
Overall, our commercial portfolio continues to perform well. As I shared with you last quarter, the metrics in the
commercial portfolio speak for themselves in terms of quality and performance. The reservable criticized exposure
declined and as a percentage of loans remains low. The commercial net charge-off ratio is 10 basis points. Excluding
small business, it is five basis points and has been around 15 basis points or better for 15 consecutive quarters. And the
NPL ratio remains low at 45 basis points.
Turning to slide 10. Net interest income on a GAAP non-FTE basis was $10.2 billion, $10.4 billion on an FTE basis.
As we mentioned earlier, we changed our accounting method for the amortization of premium or discount paid on
certain of our debt securities from the prepayment method to the contractual method. The contractual method is used by
our peers and should make it easier for investors to make comparisons. Compared to Q3 2015, NII is up $300 million
or 3% as loan growth, higher short-end rates and higher security balances funded by deposits more than offset the
negative impact of generally lower long-end rates over the past several quarters.
Okay. With respect to asset sensitivity, as of 9/30, an instantaneous 100 basis points parallel increase in rates is
estimated to increase NII by $5.3 billion over the subsequent 12 months. This is lower than the sensitivity we reported
at June 30. The reduction was mostly on the long end driven by the change to the contractual method and slower prepay
speeds based upon recent trends in customer behavior. Note that the sensitivity on the short end at $3.3 billion has not
changed significantly.
Turning to slide 11, noninterest expense was $13.5 billion. That's $0.5 billion lower or 3% lower than Q3 2015 driven
by cost reductions across the company. This is the initial quarter of the increased FDIC assessment to shore up the
deposit insurance fund. The increase in expense for us is roughly $100 million per quarter. Compared to Q2 2016,
expenses were stable as good core expense control was offset by the higher FDIC costs and modestly higher incentives.
Q3 litigation expense was $250 million, which is fairly consistent with both Q3 2015 as well as Q2 2016. Most expense
categories were lower year over year. This trend was led by personnel expense, which includes the Q4 2015 expiration
of the fully amortized advisor awards in Wealth Management. The rest of the improvement was driven by reduced cost
of mortgage servicing, coupled with SIM efforts and other initiatives.
Our employee base is down 3% from Q3 2015. While the overall head count is down, it's important to note that year
over year, we added over 1,000 primary sales associates across Consumer, Wealth Management and Global Banking.
Turning to the business segments and starting with Consumer Banking on slide 12. Consumer earned $1.8 billion,
continuing its trend of solid results and reporting a robust 21% return on allocated capital. I would note that pre-tax
pre-provision earnings rose $377 million or 10%. Expense and NII improvement were both notable and together,
enough to more than offset higher provision expense and prior-year divestiture gains.
Revenue was relatively flat on a reported basis compared to Q3 2015 as 4% growth in NII was offset, as I said, by the
absence of approximately $200 million of divestiture gains in Q3 2015. As a reminder, these gains in Q3 2015 result
from divestitures of an ancillary appraisal business, a card portfolio, and some financial centers. Excluding those
prior-period gains, revenue improved year over year, and growth in pre-tax pre-provision earnings was even more
substantial. Falling 400 basis points, Consumer Banking's efficiency ratio of 55% improved meaningfully year over
year.

Okay, turning to slide 13 and key trends, first on the upper left, the stats are a reminder of our strong competitive
position. Looking a little closer at revenue drivers compared to Q3 2015, net interest income continued to improve as
we drove deposits higher. Average deposits continued their strong growth, up $50 billion, or 9% year over year,
outpacing the industry. With respect to noninterest income, service charges were up modestly while card income was
down. Spending levels in issuance were strong, but revenue growth was muted by customer rewards.
We are attracting relatively higher-quality card customers that, on the one hand, have higher spending habits, but on the
other hand, receive more rewards. This has two important benefits to note. First, rewards deepen relationships, helping
to grow deposits and make them more sticky, for example. Second, in our experience, these customers have lower loss
rates and a reduced need to interact with call centers, thereby allowing us to lower costs.
Turning to expenses on the upper right, they declined 7% from Q3 2015 despite the higher FDIC assessment charges in
the quarter. Expense reductions are the result of a number of initiatives. For example, mobile banking penetration helps
to optimize our delivery network while improving customer satisfaction. More chip cards help us lower fraud costs, and
digitalization of processes and statements helps us eliminate paper and related handling costs. One can observe the
impacts of these types of initiatives on the cost of deposits, which continued its march lower, dropping below 1.6% this
quarter.
Focusing on client balances on the left, in addition to deposit growth, Merrill Edge brokers assets at $138 billion are up
18% versus Q3 2015 on strong account flows and market valuations. We also increased the number of Merrill Edge
accounts by 11% from Q3 2015. We now have nearly 1.7 million households that leverage our Financial Solutions
advisors and self-directed investing platform.
Moving across the bottom right of the page, note that loans are up 7% from Q3 2015 on strong mortgage and vehicle
lending growth. As we viewed in previous quarters, we continue to focus on originating high FICO score loans, which
have generally produced low loss rates and strong risk-adjusted returns. Loan growth included consumer real estate
production of $20.4 billion, up 21% from Q3 2015 and in line with Q2 2016, as customers continued to take advantage
of historically low interest rates.
We retained about three-quarters of first mortgage production on the balance sheet this quarter. Average vehicle loans
were up 17% from Q3 2015, with average booked FICO scores remaining well above 750 and net losses remaining
below 30 basis points. With respect to U.S. consumer card, average balances grew 7% from Q2 on an annualized basis,
aided by seasonal back-to-school lending. We issued more than 1.3 million cards in the quarter, and spending on credit
cards adjusted for divestitures was up 8% compared to Q3 2015.
Turning to slide 14 and digital banking trends, as I mentioned earlier, we continue to see strong momentum in digital
banking adoption with use across service, appointments, and sales. Mobile banking is transforming how our customers
bank and reshaping our Consumer segment. Importantly, as adoption rises, particularly around transaction processing
and self-service, we see improved efficiency and customer satisfaction. We continue to improve capabilities, with the
latest example being the launch of our Spanish mobile app, which attracted over 800,000 active users in the first 10
weeks.
We added roughly 1.1 million new mobile users in the quarter. The pace of user growth has increased despite an
already impressive penetration rate of our checking account holders. With more than 21.3 million active users, deposits
from mobile devices now represent 18% of deposit transactions, and 26 million checks were deposited via mobile
devices quarter. That is an average of 280,000 deposits per day, an increase of 27% year over year and the equivalent to
volume of 830 financial centers. Digital sales now represent 18% of total sales, and we now have more than 3,500
digital investors in our financial centers driving further adoption.
Also, as you know, we are a leader in person-to-person and person-to-business money movement through digital
transfers and bill payment capabilities. Consumers moved $243 billion in Q3, up 6% from last year. And while all this
is transformative, I would just remind you that we still have a little less than 1 million people per day walking into our
centers across the U.S. This in-person interaction is important in terms of deepening and retaining personal
relationships, providing more complex financial help, and creating opportunities for further engagement.

Turning to slide 15, Global Wealth and Investment Management produced earnings of $697 million, up 10% from Q3
2015. Now it's no secret that this segment operates in an industry undergoing meaningful change, as firms and clients
adapt to the new fiduciary rules and other market dynamics. The good news is we start from a position of strength, with
$2.5 trillion in client balances. We have market-leading brands and a wide range of investment service offers, from
self-service to fully managed. Plus, we have the resources to continue to invest in market-leading capabilities that
address the changing needs of our clients.
Year over year, revenue was down modestly but expenses were down even more, improving pre-tax margin to 25%, up
meaningfully from Q3 2015. Overall, revenue declined 2% from Q3 2015, as NII growth was more than offset by lower
transactional revenues. NII benefited from solid loan and deposit growth. Noninterest income declined from Q3 2015,
driven by lower transactional revenue that continues to be impacted by market factors as well as migration of activities
from brokerage to managed relationships.
Noninterest expense declined nearly $313 million (sic) [$213 million], or 6% from Q3 2015, with half of that benefit
derived from the expiration of the amortization of advisor retention awards that were put in place at the time of the
Merrill Lynch merger. The rest of the improvement was a result of work across many categories of expense more than
offsetting higher FDIC costs.
Moving to slide 16, we continue to see overall solid client engagement. Client balances approached $2.5 trillion and are
up from Q2, including higher market valuations, $10 billion of long-term AUM flows, and continued loan and deposit
growth. Average deposits compared against Q3 2015 are up 4%, driven by growth in the second half of 2015.
Compared to Q2, average deposits were impacted by seasonal tax payments.
Average loans were up 7% year over year. Growth remained concentrated in consumer real estate and structured
lending. Lastly, earlier this month we announced some innovations to our IRA products and services, which we believe
positions us to better serve our clients given new fiduciary rules. These innovations are industry-leading and address
not only the new fiduciary rules for retirement accounts, but also client preference for more choice and new ways to
invest.
First, we announced the rollout of a new offering called Merrill Edge Guided Investing. This solution offers clients
online investing enhanced with professional portfolio management. With the addition of this solution, clients have three
fundamental choices which they can mix and match to best meet their needs. Clients can invest online completely
self-directed through Merrill Edge, or if they are interested in enhanced professional portfolio management, they will
be able to use Merrill Edge Guided Investing. Or they can choose fully advised, working one-on-one with a financial
advisor via brokerage or fee-based advisory platforms.
We also announced that beginning in April 2017, for clients that choose to have a financial advisor provide advice with
respect to their IRA accounts, we will provide this service through our fee-based advisory platform, Merrill Lynch One,
as we believe this is the best way for us to deliver for IRA clients who choose to have this level of service and advice.
Clients will also have the option to invest their retirement through Merrill Edge either completely self-directed or
through Merrill Edge Guided Investing.
Turning to slide 17, Global Banking earned $1.6 billion, which is up 22% year over year. Q3 reflects good revenue
growth, solid cost control, and solid client activity. The efficiency ratio improved to 45% in Q3. Compared to previous
third quarters, investment banking fees this quarter were the highest since the merger with Merrill in 2009. Return on
allocated capital was 17%, a 300 basis point improvement from Q3 2015, despite adding a couple of billion dollars of
allocated capital this year. Global Banking continues to drive loan growth within its risk and client frameworks,
producing solid year-over-year improvement in NII.
Revenue growth also benefited from roughly $175 million from gains on FVO [Fair Value Option] loans this quarter
versus losses in Q3 2015. Higher treasury fees also added to revenue growth. The decrease in noninterest expense
compared to Q3 2015 reflects good expense control that offset modestly higher revenue-related compensation and
higher FDIC costs.

Looking at the trends on slide 18 and comparing to Q3 last year, average loans on a year-over-year basis grew $26
billion, or 8%. Growth was broad-based across large corporates as well as middle-market borrowers and diversified
across most products. Having said that, as we noted last quarter, the pace of commercial loan growth has slowed over
the past couple of quarters. Demand across the industry appears to have slowed as well. We remain diligent in certain
sectors such as commercial real estate and energy, and we are also closely monitoring certain international regions.
Average deposits increased from Q3 2015, up $10 billion, or 3%, from both new and existing clients. As we grow
treasury services, we remain focused on quality deposits with respect to LCR.
Switching to Global Markets on slide 19, let me start by reviewing what I said last quarter regarding this segment. The
past few quarters are examples of the importance of this segment to not only its clients around the world, but also to the
customers and clients of all our business segments. Again this quarter, Global Markets delivered for clients by helping
them raise capital, buy and sell securities, as well as manage risk. We continue to invest in and enjoy leadership
positions across a broad range of products. We believe this improves the sustainability of our revenue and makes us
more relevant to clients across the globe. We've been there for clients when they needed us across all these products.
Our results this quarter reflect the strategy and continue commitment to clients.
Global Markets earned $1.1 billion and returned 12% on allocated capital. Revenue was up appreciably year over year
and even outpaced typical seasonality by posting modest improvement over Q2 2016. Total revenue excluding DVA
was up 20% year over year on solid sales and trading routes, which rose 18%. It's worth noting we achieved these
results with slightly less balance sheet, lower VaR, and 7% fewer people. Continued expense discipline drove costs 1%
lower year over year as increases in revenue-related incentive were more than offset by reductions in operating and
support costs.
Moving to trends on slide 20 and focusing on the components of our sales and trading performance, sales and trading
revenue of $3.7 billion, excluding DVA, was up 18% from Q3 2015 driven by FICC. In terms of revenue, this was the
best third quarter in five years. Excluding DVA and versus Q3 2015, FICC sales and trading of $2.8 billion increased
39% as we built momentum as the quarter progressed across a host of credit products and continued gains in rates
products. Mortgages showed particular strength among credit products as investors sought yield. Equities sales and
trading was solid at $1 billion in revenue but declined 17% versus Q3 2015, which benefited from higher levels of
market volatility and client activity.
On slide 21, we present All Other, which recorded a net loss of $182 million. This loss includes a previously disclosed
tax charge of $350 million due to the third quarter UK enactment of a tax rate reduction which reduced the value of our
UK DTA. The loss in the current period compares to earnings of $152 million in Q3 2015 as lower security gains and
higher expense litigation offset higher mortgage banking revenue. MBI revenue this quarter includes a $280 million
benefit from higher valuations on our MSR, driven by slower expected prepaid speeds based upon recent observed
trends in customer behavior.
Okay, let me offer a few takeaways as I finish. We reported solid results this quarter that were consistent with our
strategy of responsible growth. We remain focused on delivering responsible growth as well as strengthening and
simplifying Bank of America. Capital and liquidity strengthened. Asset quality remained strong. We grew revenue. We
grew deposits. We grew loans. We delivered for clients in capital markets. We lowered costs. We invested in our future
by adding sales professionals and deploying technology that helps customers better live their financial lives and
improves satisfaction. And importantly, we returned more capital to our shareholders.
With that, let's open it up for questions.

<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Hi, good morning, guys. I wanted to ask about expenses. Could you talk about what
kind of timing expectations you have on the various projects helping to drive down your expenses further in 2017 and
2018? Maybe just remind us what are some of the big items that you're working on and should we still think about $53
billion in 2018 as your hard target that you're shooting for?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Let me start with the last part first. Nothing's changed at all to our thoughts regarding the
2018 target that we discussed in the second quarter call. Again, I would note that year over year, we reduced expenses
by $0.5 billion and I would also just point out to remind everybody that if you look at expenses over a longer term, we
reduced quarterly expenses ex-litigation by $4.8 billion from Q3 2011, that's a $19 billion run rate.
So, if you think about what we have to do between now and 2018, I think we talked about this before, roughly a third of
that is going to come from continued progress on delinquent loan servicing. The other two-thirds is going to come from
a lot of different initiatives across the company. We've talked about SIM, our Simplify and Improve initiative; we're
going to be utilizing technology to digitize processes, eliminating handling costs; we're going to get technology
efficiencies from our data centers consolidation and for more efficient servers; as I said, we're going to continue to
make progress on delinquent loan servicing cost; hopefully see some modest improvement in litigation.
A very important part of this is the shift to self-serve digital channels: mobile, online, ATM. So, that's what the list
sounds like and it goes on and on. I would emphasize this shift to self-serve. We're seeing good momentum with more
than 21 million mobile banking active users and that's growing every week, every month. 18% of our deposit
transactions are now completed through mobile devices, that's better for customers, it's also better for our shareholders,
it's one-tenth of the cost of walking into a branch. So, it's all these things kind of put together, it's initiatives across the
company. It's going to come a lot from support and operations, but there's a little bit in the front office as well as we get
more efficient.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: In terms of the timing, Paul, is it something that we should think of as ramping
throughout 2017, and is it kind of longer tail at the end? Can you give us a sense there?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Yeah. I would say it's going to be fairly spread out throughout the whole process. However,
as you think about one quarter over a next, it's not going to be straight down every quarter. Not every quarter is the
same, there's going to be some lumpiness. If you look at the fourth quarter, for example, we traditionally have some
seasonality in the fourth quarter. So, generally, we'll make progress but don't expect that you're going to see it in every
single quarter.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay, thanks. And then the second question just quickly on net interest income. Can
you help us try to translate your 100 basis point rate sensitivity into something closer to what one Fed hike might do for
your net interest income and what would be the trajectory of NII and NIM if we did get a Fed hike this quarter? What
would you expect more in the near term, next quarter or two, on NII and NIM?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Sure, so let me – yes, I can help you through that. So, if you look at about a 25 basis point of
the one-quarter of our $5.3 billion in sensitivity, if you want to assume that, that 25 basis points increases the long end
by 25 basis points, you know the answer. You can roughly take a quarter of it, perhaps even a little bit more, because
we're probably more asset sensitive on the first 25 bps than the last 25 bps of that 100 bps. But if you don't want to
increase on the long end, just look at the short end, we've disclosed it's $3.3 billion. You could divide that by four and
get a pretty good sense of what 25 basis points would do over the subsequent 12 months.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Great. Thanks.

happen. I'm just curious if you can give a little color on where you might see some of that evidence taking shape,
product, whatever.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: I'll try to do that, but let me just start with a couple of thoughts. First of all, I think it's
difficult to see share shifts in Global Markets in any given quarter. The fee pools are just not as transparent as they are
in, let's say, investment banking fees or other areas. What we know is client activity was up in the third quarter and
that's what drives our short-term results.
Over the longer-term, one, it's easier just to assess what going on with fee pools and share, so I just want to point out
from 2014 to 2015, on declining fee pools, we're pretty sure we improved our share, third parties tell us that. And I
think that share has come from a number of regions and a number of firms and a number of products as competitors
adjust their strategies and capabilities.
More specifically, we've been investing in rates for a number of years. I think we're making some progress there. We
have a very strong credit platform and, as you know, I think we're making progress there relative to competitors around
the world. And I think we're investing in equities, and I think equities revenue was down but I think you will see an
improvement relative to the fee pool in equities as well.
I do want to emphasize, very importantly, that our strategy is to have a diversified product portfolio across both FICC
and equities and globally. That's what our clients need and want from us. And so, you could see gains one quarter in
one place and see something lower in another place, and that's okay with us. That's our strategy; it's about what the
client needs in any given quarter. If we're doing a little bit worse in one place, we're probably doing better in another
place.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Fair enough, nature of the business, I guess. One other one, in GWIM, I appreciate all the color
on the different products and what you're doing in wealth management. The curious move in the quarter was the move
away from the commission-based IRAs. And I'm curious, is that most specifically done to avoid the best interest
contract? I'm just curious based on how we roll forward if the SEC comes in, what that might mean. You talked about
giving customer choice, but this sounds like less choice for the FA.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Look, clients are going to have three ways to invest in their IRAs. They're going – can do it
completely self-direct from Merrill Edge; they're going to be able to do it online, but enhanced with professional
portfolio management through Merrill Edge Guided Investing; and, again, for those clients who want one-on-one
advice and service from their FA, they're going to be able to do that on the fee-based advisory platform. What we
decided not to do is use the best interest exemption to allow IRA accounts to be added to our brokerage platform where
clients pay on a transaction basis.
After reviewing all her options, let's say, if a client chooses one-on-one advice and service on her IRA, we believe the
best way to provide that advice is through Merrill Lynch One on our fee-based advisory platform. We took a lot of time
to make this decision. We took months thinking about this. We did research. We believe this is the best interest of our
clients and our advisors.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: I don't doubt that. I just, I worry about just the execution of it. I mean, I'm assuming that it means
that the advisor has to talk to the client and explain this whole thing. And just...
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: That's right, but the advisor's going to have talk to their clients and explain the best interest
exemption. That's going to be a much harder conversation than the one we're going to have.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Fair enough. Fair enough. All right. Thanks, Paul.

<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Good morning, Betsy.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: A couple of questions. Just one on loan growth. Could you give us a sense as to how
you think you're trajecting there? We talked a little bit about market share and trading. Could we talk a little bit about
how you think you're doing in the lending side of the equation and if there's any legs there?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Look, we feel good about loan growth. The economy feels good, so we're confident that
we can grow. But of course, there's going to be some uncertainty in, as I said, in certain sectors and certain regions
around the world. I would remind you that we're focused on responsible growth. So, in some of those – we're going to
look a little bit different than some of our competitors in some places, but we feel good. Year over year, if you look at
our business segments, we had 7% loan growth.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: So one of the areas that I just want to dig in a little bit more to is on the mortgage
side where you have had some good loan growth, but I'm just wondering if there's more opportunity there as it relates
to either taking some duration exposures, or on credit as you've moved into some wider credit boxes with my first
home, which is insured by Fannie/Freddie, but just want to get some color on that.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Betsy, if you go to page 6 of the materials, you can see that we're continuing in mortgage
area overall, so think both in home equity and first mortgage loan. You can see that we continue to run off some of the
noncore portfolios and overall the balances grow in the business segments, and we expect that to continue. We're doing
about 2,000 applications a day, about 1,000 each plus in each of the products. That has continued to grow. And so, we'll
continue to drive that core capability to the customer.
In terms of expansion of product sets, we have a limited product for – that we built for – similar to 3% down payment
for $0.5 billion a year of production just to give us a more competitive product there but limited to size. And we'll do
some other things, but we'll stick with the core credit. Remember who you're talking to here, Betsy, and our experience
in mortgage is probably deeper than most people, so we will stick with what our customers need and what we think the
right business for the company is.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Okay. So, as you're thinking about your revenue growth from here, which are the
three key legs that you expect are going to keep that revenue growth going?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I think if you think about the growth, you've got the interest side and you're got the fee
side. And if you think about the interest side, it's going to be driven by balance growth between loans and deposits and
I think we keep growing deposits year over year, $60 billion. We're paying four basis points in Consumer and think
about that dynamic and putting that to work in anything we can is important. And we continue to grow loans at less rate
than we grow deposits. So that's going to drive our NIM, it's just a bigger and bigger, lower and lower cost deposit
base.
And on the loan side I think consumers growing better now than commercial in link quarter but, overall, we expect
commercial will kick back in a little bit as the economy continues and some of the uncertainty lifts in the political
season here. So, on loans and deposits, it'll just be grinding out as you've seen year-over-year core growth of 7% on
loans and growth on deposits.
On the fee side, what you're seeing is the dynamic especially consumer fee areas finally turn a little bit stable and then
turning force in the card revenue and things like that, which we've hit sort of the inflection point where the run down in
relative interchange due to selling some portfolios and getting out of noncore portfolios and putting on the core
portfolios with rewards attached to it which helps us generate deposits, things like that, has stabilized and you're
starting to see in the last few quarters card income starting to move up a bit. And on service charges, it's been relatively
stable. So, the fee side will be driven more by wealth management and markets and things like that and consumer is
stable which is good because it had been a drag for a long time.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: And then on the expense side, you indicated all of the various technology efforts that
you've got underway, but is there more that you can do on the comp side as well?

<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: We continue to and we have less people going through our bonus pools and stuff, you can
see the comp continues to drift down. The large part of the comp obviously is the wealth management business which
there's no meaningful changes there but in the other businesses, we continue – as we have less people, we continue to
reduce that as a percentage of revenues.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Okay, thanks.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - James Mitchell>: Hey. Good morning. Maybe you could talk a little bit about the credit cycle. I think one of the
major pushbacks from investors is we're going to start to credit get worse but I think you guys have been pretty clear
that you are not lowering standards to drive growth. So, how do you think about the cycle from here? I guess that's the
start.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I think, I said it earlier, if you think about the last several quarters of earnings calls, it's
been, can it get any better than this and, every quarter, it gets slightly better. And that in part is because we are still
getting the benefits of the changes made six, seven, eight years ago, coming through the Consumer business, i.e. what
we call back-book portfolios or legacy portfolios or whatever word you want to use, continue to run off with higher
credit risk in them and we keep putting on and have put on and continue to put on higher credit quality.
So, I think if you think about overall charge-offs of $880 million (sic) [$888 million] this quarter, that's driven by the
Consumer business and that's driven by the card and some in the legacy home equities. And so, keeping the card
business where we want it is critical and you're seeing us continue even as we start to grow that portfolio both
nominally and rate the charge-off picture strong. And so, when you go back and look at what happened during the
crisis, the charge-offs came abnormally from the edges of credit and we've kept ourselves out of that.
<Q - James Mitchell>: Do you feel like you can keep your lease ratios as you grow pretty stable?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: We have done that.
<Q - James Mitchell>: Right, okay. And just maybe a follow-up on the capital ratios as far as the RWAs dropped
while the balance sheet grew a little bit, so it seems like you reduced risk. I guess where was that and can that continue?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: You're speaking on the Advanced approaches we had a drop. And that drop came, again,
from legacy portfolios running off and from continued work by our Global Markets teams to better manage their
balance sheet relative to those ratios.
<Q - James Mitchell>: Is there any more detail or can you get a little more from here?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Look, there's always more to do and we're focused on a lot of different regulatory metrics.
We're looking at all of them. There are some that may be a little bit more important than others right now. We're
focused on all of them. And I think there's more to come there. Obviously, as we grow the balance sheet, as we grow
loans and deposits, we're going to continue to see some increase, particularly, on the Standardized side. But I think we
can, relative to that growth, I think we can continue make a little bit of progress incrementally.
<Q - James Mitchell>: Okay, great. Thanks.

<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Good morning, Matt.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Can you talk about the strategy within the securities book? You did mention that
you added some later in the quarter and, obviously, deposit growth has been exceeding loan growth to justify that. But
maybe give some color in terms of what you're buying, the duration, and how – make sure it doesn't get too big relative
to the size of the balance sheet?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Matt, you pick up on the core thing that drives – we have a securities portfolio because we
have more deposits coming in than we have loans. So, our view of that portfolio is we don't take credit risk there, and
so we have two alternatives, treasuries and mortgage-backed securities or cash, I guess, is the third. And so, that's how
we invest it. And Paul can take you through his earlier comments a little bit and give you some color on that, but I think
people always have to remember, the reason why we have more is because our deposits grew at $60 billion year over
year and that's more than – our loans grew by quite a bit.
So, Paul, you want to answer – give some color on that?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Sure. Well, just one step back. Obviously, what we're doing every day is managing earnings,
capital, liquidity, and the interest rate risk when we think about that portfolio and where we want to invest things. This
quarter, as you noted, our deposit growth exceeded loan growth and so we did add significantly to the investment
portfolio. Most of that incremental amount we devoted to treasuries. Just as we think about the balance in that portfolio,
we wanted to just add a little bit more treasuries. That's really kind of it.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. And then a little bit related but on the deposit side, obviously, very strong
growth year over year. You mentioned the $60 billion and really little to no repricing despite the one bump in Fed rates
that should impact the year-over-year comps. So I guess the question is, if we do get a rate increase, do you think
you've got more flexibility to limit deposit repricing, given it's basically worked so far and the loan growth is obviously
not enough to absorb the deposit growth you have?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: So just on that, remember that the reason why you don't see much repricing is really two or
three dynamics. One is a full $450 billion of our deposits are noninterest-bearing, so they aren't going to reprice. The
great debate is about how sticky are those. And if you think about that, those are dominated by our Consumer business,
and our noninterest-bearing accounts in Consumer have doubled in size over the last five or six years due to focusing
on primary accounts. We're up to 90% primary accounts in the household where they run their household finances
through our account and therefore they direct deposit their check and things like that.
So the first thing to remember is of the $1.2 trillion, $450 billion noninterest -bearing and the dominant part of that
Consumer and also in the wealth management and the core transactional account of both Consumers. And then on the
business side, similarly, we have driven our deposits to be really LCR-friendly and core operating accounts. And so
those aren't going to move. The noninterest-bearing, they aren't going to move much, and the big debate is how much
balance will be in there, and we feel confident the balances will stay just because of the nature the accounts.
And then when you go to the second dynamic, remember that even with all this deposit growth, one of the things we
continue to do, and the impact is less and less, is we are expecting Consumer business running off CD still at a fairly
decent clip that were historically used to fund prior companies' balance sheets that we don't need the funding – that
cost. So we have some rollover but that continues to decline. That weighted average cost drops off – that cost drops off
and it drives down or holds steady the weighted average cost. And then if you look at money markets and other
interest-bearing, they really haven't moved much.
So we feel good about the Consumer – we feel good about the deposit base overall. We feel very good about the
Consumer deposit base. Just crossed $600 billion for the first time in the company's history in Consumers generally.
And with that, I think if rates rise, we think that it's substantial value for the company, and Paul gave you a way to think
about that earlier with a quarter of $3.3 billion, 25% of $3.3 billion.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay, thank you very much.

We'll take our next question from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Thanks, good morning. I wanted to ask about the card business a little bit. I saw in the deck that you
grew card issuance at the fastest level since 2008, but we're not really – and there's a burden on the fee side with
rewards stuff, balances are still flat. I was wondering if you could walk us forward and help us understand a little bit
better just the ROA and income direction of the card business. When do we start to see that show up in both balances,
and when you expect to see that kind of fee growth come along for the ride, given the good underlying growth that we
haven't quite seen yet in the financials?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Okay. So look, I think you noticing some modest card balance growth in the quarter, which
we think will continue as we add new accounts. And again, we're very focused on adding high-quality accounts there. I
think you probably also noticed that while combined debit and credit card spend was good in the quarter at 5%, 6% if
you include fuel, I'm adjusting for divestitures last year, that the growth in the card income was impacted by, as you
noted, customer reward programs.
However, I think just focusing on the fee income, this is some really key benefits of our strategy, which is to attract
relatively higher-quality card customers and reward them for deepening their overall relationship with us. This strategy
really drives deposit growth and makes deposits stickier. Plus, we believe these customers have lower loss rates, they
use the call center less, which helps us lower cost.
I think when you want to see the effect of this, you have to look at the overall Consumer segment and what's going on
there in terms of growth of profits and improvement in expenses. And just lastly, I'd just point out, look, our
risk-adjusted margins on card are strong at over 9%. This is in no way signaling that we're not going to be able to grow
the card income line. I just want you to get a better sense of how we think about it.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I think if you think about that more broadly, the last divestitures of size we made in this
card business were the fourth quarter of last year and are through the P&L, so they're through the balances and through
the things. So what you're starting to see if you look at the trend this year is you're starting to see movement, positive
movement both in card income and in balances as we move across the year, and we expect that to continue. It will be
strong, responsible growth.
And one of the great debates we have in the company, as people say, why can't you grow this faster or why can't –
we're giving up too much in the interchange for the preferred balance and preferred rewards. The interesting question
is, are you giving up something you'd never have in the preferred rewards; i.e. we're bringing more customer
relationships and depth, and that gets us something.
So incrementally, the net interchange is actually there as opposed to what theoretically you get gross interchange with a
non-customer in an affinity program. So we focus on the entire customer relationship. It is very valuable. It is very
profitable. And believe me, if we could grow it faster responsibly, we would. But the idea is just to grind out the slow,
steady growth. And we're starting to see that come through, and largely it was masked in 2014 – 2015 and behind that
2013, those areas because we were divesting a lot of noncore relationships. And now we have the core affinities we
want and we have the core card business we want.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: And again, if you just – I think you got to – you can see it if you look at the whole segment. I
don't want to start comparing us to peers, but just take a look at our PP&R year over year. It's up 10%.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Understood. Second quick question is you mentioned that you're now achieving the cost of capital
and an ROE above 10% and capital is just still building. Do you think you can continue to hold if not improve the
ROE, as capital will likely continue to grow, presuming that you still will get those benefits going forward and you're
not at the point of returning more than 100% of your earnings yet?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I think embedded in that is the future return of capital, and we now have a significant
buffer above the requirements. And as Paul said, we continue to try to optimize our requirements. So I think you're a

little bit of a horse race between increasing earnings and increasing capital. And as we return more, you expect that the
horse race of increasing earnings would stay ahead of it. But we've got room to go and we're driving at it, but if we
don't hit – if the issue is that our capital continues to grow, that capital is also yours as an investor and continues to go
into our book value. And so it's not going anywhere. It's there to be returned when we can get through the process of
getting from where we are to higher percentages of capital returned and ultimately returning excess capital.

And we'll take our next question from Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Good morning, Mike.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: Hi. You've reduced your branch count from 6,000 to 4,600. Where do you think that count can go?
And on the one hand, we heard you say almost 1 million customers walk into branches each day. But on the other hand,
you have grown deposits $1.2 trillion. You did mention more self-service digital channels. You did mention mobile
banking is 18% of the deposit transactions, and less reliance on the branches might ease any extra pressure to sell more
products in this lower rate environment. So where do you think you might take the branch count to? And I don't think
you mentioned the impact of the cross-selling issues on BankAmerica or if we wake up one day and find out that
BankAmerica did something inappropriate.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Let's go to how we run our Consumer business. So we run our Consumer business
consistent with responsible growth for the company. And what that means is that you focus on deepening relationships,
what we call a stair step, where it's the core deposit account, the core credit card and getting it used, and the core
mortgage, and the core home equity, and the core auto loans. That's what we've been driving at and continue to drive at.
That's the backbone of what we did and how we reposition this company for many years.
In terms of the branches, Mike, you've rattled off all the statistics which Paul talked about earlier, but it is a complex
optimization in it, but it all starts with the consumer. What is the consumer going to do? And so while 18% of deposits
are made by mobile deposits, 82% by their nature aren't. And where do they go? About 50 percentage points of that go
through the ATM machines and about another 30%-odd go through the teller lines still today. And so you have to be
ready and able to serve in all dynamics.
And so what we continue to do is optimize the branch structure, the call structure, the ATM structure, the mobile
structure and the online structure all together. And the way to think about that optimization and why this is an
extremely important business to this company is that we've gone from 300 basis points of the cost of all that to deposits
to about 150 basis points over last six, seven years, and that's by continuing to optimize the physical plant as well as all
these other means.
And so if you ask me – your question is how far can go? You have to also then think about what we want to go on in a
branch. And so if you look back at some of the statistics that Paul had in the deck for Consumer where you see things
like appointments set up are 340,000 in the third quarter, so just think about that. 340,000 times a customer went on a
mobile phone and asked to come to a branch. And so we need those branches to receive those mobile phone customers.
And why are they coming? Usually for a much more important financial transaction to them than handing us a check
for deposit, and so it's a quality versus quantity and making sure we understand that.
So we are optimizing all those. And you can see on page 14 in the lower right, you can see the different moves. I'd say
we went from 7 million visits probably four or five years ago to 6 million to 5 million, but those 5 million are of a
higher quality and we think that's important. And there are certain transactions and certain capabilities that you just
have to have at your branch, that you just have to do face-to-face. Very difficult things like how to get a power of
attorney for a parent that's sick or I want to do a mortgage. It's still difficult to do through the phone, and things like

that.
So we'll have all aspects, we'll drive it down and you can see that we continue to make that progress.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: Just as a follow-up, on slide 14, it's saying BankAmerica were a FinTech company and look how
well we're doing and you're showing some good growth rates, that chart on the upper right. So at what point does that
lead to a greater number of branch reductions? Is it you have the answer and you don't want it to say for competitive
reasons or you don't know, it's kind of a give and take based on the customer experience? I mean, some of your
competitors talk about closing 100 or 200 branches per year. You reduced to 112 over the last year, but it seems to be
slowing. So I'm trying to get a sense of that.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I think I'd say that the point is that we've run this business and we start with the consumer
and their activities and their behaviors, and so what they want to do. And the key is not to get ahead of them because
that can cause you problems, and not to be behind them because that can be cost issues and empty branches.
So even in the 112 we're down, we've added branches in places like Denver. The Denver branch we added are in the
top 10% of performing branches today on relationship building. We've added branches in Manhattan. We've added
branches in Minneapolis.
And so, we're in a sea change in terms of what the branches should look like individually, the new branches are
different. We're adding branches we didn't have and we're closing branches where the utilization isn't there. The nature
of how far a customer will travel is also different now than it was 10, 15 years ago.
So I think you said what all the different reasons, the answer was then – I think you said is we'll follow the customer. I
don't know the exact number because I can tell you eight years ago, we had 6,100. There are people that said there was
never going to be less branches in our system and maybe we should add more, and guess what, we're 4,600 or 4,500.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: All right, thank you.

We'll take our next question from Paul Miller with FBR & Company.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Yes, thank you very much. And you guys took an MSR write-up or hedging benefit. I can't
really – which one it is, about $360 million, but you did write up the MSR from 51 basis points to 60 basis points. Was
that all rate-driven? The 10-year did grow up a little bit. Or was that also some better credit metrics out of the servicing
portfolio?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: You're right. We had a $280 million benefit this quarter and that was from a higher valuation
of the MSR, which was due to slower observed prepayment speeds. So we're just updating our – the way we value that.
We have to monitor our – it's a Level 3 asset, so there's a lot of things that go into that. It's hard to value, and you've got
to continually be looking at that valuation. And we thought it was time based upon observations of prepayment speeds
to make a change in some key assumptions.

We'll take our next question from Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Thanks. I just wanted to follow up on a couple of questions related to the various consumer
lending businesses. First, Paul, just from your response to Ken's question a moment ago on card, I heard everything you
said about the risk-adjusted margin and the credit quality of the portfolio, et cetera. But just to be clear, are you
expecting improving, stable or deteriorating ROA based on the current competitive environment? Because it seems like

many peers are underscoring the near-term risks to profitability from rewards and customer acquisition costs.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Look, based upon how we're growing the business, how we're running the business, we
expect stability.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Stability, okay, great. And with respect to mortgage, I thought there was about $100 million
benefit from rep and warrant release. How much of that reserve still exists? And what would be your expectations
about potentially realizing it at this stage given sort of where we are with respect to that issue?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Yeah. I think the rep and warranties is a contra revenue. So is that what you're referring to?
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Yes, correct. It's the provision line item. You had a negative position in there.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Yes.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Okay.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: So that's going to bump around. That bumps around because...
<A - Lee McEntire>: Hey, Eric. It's Lee. On I think what you're looking at, what Paul is referring to, it's a
contra-revenue item. So it's a negative revenue item when it's a provision expense on the provision, okay?
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Okay. Maybe I'll come back to you in a bit. And just finally on auto, it seems that some
peers were signaling that competitive conditions in auto underwriting were easing a bit after intensifying over the past
several quarters. Are you seeing anything like that across any particular segment of the FICO strata?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Look, we're continuing to see good growth in consumer vehicle lending, the way that we run
the business. We're up roughly 7% – or $7 billion or 17% year over year. Again, we're focused on prime and
super-prime. So originations were down modestly Q3 versus the prior quarter as we accepted a little bit less dealer
flow, but we still feel good about that product offering.
The third quarter average book FICO scores remained at approximately 770. Debt-to-income was at all-time lows.
We're not following the market expansion to 84 months in terms of tenor. We've got a maximum tenor of 75 months
and I think in the third quarter, we were averaging around 67 months. So we're getting the growth within our
responsible growth framework and we feel good about it.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Okay, thanks very much.

We'll take our next question from Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Good morning, Steve.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: So, I want to kick things off with a follow-up to an earlier question on the DOL. Paul, you
had noted that Merrill FAs will no longer be permitted to engage in brokerage activities in retirement accounts, and I
was hoping you could give us an update as to what portion of Merrill client assets are currently in brokerage IRA? And
maybe more specifically, how should we think about the net economic impact from transitioning some of those
retirement assets into some of the other offerings that you highlighted, whether it be fee-based which should generate
higher fees versus robo or self-directed Merrill Edge?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Sure. So the primary affected portion of our business is in the transactional brokerage
retirement accounts. And if you look at our roughly $2 trillion of GWIM client assets outside of loans and deposits, we
would see the DOL rule having an impact on significantly less than 10% of those balances. And again, that's as the
industry works towards the full implementation of the rule in January 2018.

So, as you noted, we're going to see some geography movement on the P&L. There's going to be some shifts. And if I
had a guess today, we might see some modest revenue impact in 2017, but it's really kind of way too early to know how
it's all going to shake out. But we would expect to mitigate that in subsequent years.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I think people – just to – Steven, you're talking about backing up to the fuller trends on
wealth manager. And there's been a constant decline in brokerage revenue over the years largely because the industry
and we have been moving more to a financial advice to managed account execution. And so in that – and that obviously
a limited portion of that's IRA related in both accounts, but the reality is this is against the backdrop that you'll see.
That brokerage number has been – the number has been tough to chase for five years now.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Got it. Okay. And just one other quick follow-up on the same topic. The press articles that
highlight some of the changes that you've made indicated that some clients that would transition to the "higher-touch
advisory offerings" will be rebated some incremental fees. And I was wondering, how are you planning to apply
changes to the fee structure for those brokerage assets that do in fact transition? I'm just struggling to see how a
two-tiered structure might work in practice across the hundreds of billions of assets that would be affected here.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I think the implementation has to be very carefully handled. And the team, Andy and John,
have been leaders and trying to figure this out the right way for the client and we start with what's best for the client. So
what you're reading about is this, there'll be adjustments made to clients by clients based on their circumstances and
what they want from us. And the FAs will have to engage in a lot of conversations about that as we go through the next
several months.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: All right. Okay, thanks, Brian. And then just one more on the topic of capital, just switching
gears for a moment. Following Tarullo's recent remarks, there's – one area of debate has been whether the Collins' floor
would in fact apply to this new capital framework; i.e., whether you'll be forced to manage to capital minimums under
both the standardized and advanced approaches. And now that you've had some time to digest the initial release or
guidance, I was wondering if you can give us any insights into how you're thinking about that potential change.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Okay. Well, that look about – it's obviously pretty technical question and it's not that we
haven't thought about it. But to be frank, it's just a speech at this point and he didn't really address that in his speech. So
we don't know the answer. That's one of the questions we have.
I think once we get the Fed's proposal, we'll have a better idea. But all I can tell you is based upon our current reading
of the speech, in particular some of the changes you mentioned in CCAR around asset growth, we think that the
substitution of the capital conservation buffer with the stress capital buffer would not be a material change for Bank of
America given our risk profile and given how we run the company.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Got it. I recognize it's early days, Paul, so I appreciate you making the effort to answer the
question. And that's it for me.

We'll take our next question from Brian Foran with Autonomous Research.
<Q - Brian D. Foran>: Good morning.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Good morning.
<Q - Brian D. Foran>: I guess you've had a couple good quarters in FICC, both for you and the industry, and I know
volatile business, not really looking for quarterly expectations. But just more broadly, there's an investor debate. Is it
just a couple good quarters or has the business absorbed all the changes in regulation, absorbed flow rates, absorbed all
the restructuring required and kind of the cycles inflecting FICC's at the bottom and has upward pressure from here? So
where do you come out on the debate? Is it a couple good quarters at this point or has FICC bottomed?

Page 19 of 26
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I think the way I'd come out that debate is to go back a long – many years ago and sort of
think through the repositioning that was done in our company. And so the key was to make FICC work. You're talking
more revenue, but we look at profit.
And so to get the profit, we needed to have the fixed income and equities business. We had to take the cost structure
down, which we did in 2010 and 2011. Tom Montag and the team worked very hard at that and got the sort of
breakeven down over $1 billion a quarter. And then, we ran along a number of years and then they've actually taken out
year over year. You can see the costs continue to be managed well despite higher revenue.
So I would say taking the discussion, I'd say that the way our fixed income business generates revenue, a lot of it is
around our capabilities in debt underwriting, our capabilities in all the different variations from high-grade leverage to
everything that goes on, and that's a relatively stable pool of revenue that you see repeated. And what goes up or down
is really the activity around that based on the markets ceasing up in certain quarters in terms of issuance and things like
that.
When you think about the other thing that Tom and the team had to really go after, which is they've broadened our
capabilities in the macro segment a little bit because that was something that traditionally the Bank of America and
Merrill Lynch teams that came together, and he's done that that, so that added some more volume to it.
So we think we've been gaining share, as Paul said earlier. When you look at revenue comparison of some of the top 10
banks without all the league charts, just revenue, and we think that we think it's driven by our fixed income capabilities
and it's driven by our connectivity from the issuer of the bonds and debt to the investor. And we'll continue to drive
that.
And so the team has done a good job. And I'd say that we're at a fundamental level. Well, this quarter feels better than
last year's quarter. It's not a quarter that when you look across four or five years, that we haven't come close to on many
cases and have done better than a few times.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Thank you for that. I guess a similar question on commercial lending. You referenced some
of the strategies you've had in place driving responsible growth and how you felt good about the business going
forward. But we saw this pause across the industry in the third quarter in commercial growth, the Fed numbers, your
numbers, other banks reporting so far. Have you seen signs of customer demand coming back I guess late in 3Q and
early in 4Q? Do you have visibility and confidence that the commercial loan growth cycle more broadly is still in gear?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Look, we feel – I think let me start with what we noticed in commercial in the quarter was
lower industry growth this quarter. And I think that really reflected a slowdown in closed – actually booked closed
acquisition financing for us, which probably maybe – could be different for peers depending on the timing of
transactions. And then, uncertainty around the election and then I think some lingering concerns around certain
countries or regions. That's what I think impacted the third quarter.
When you look at the U.S., when you look around the globe, when you look at GDP growth, we're optimistic. We think
the economy feels good. So, in a good economy, we should be able to grow commercial loans. We'll have to stay
focused on some sectors and some regions, but we think we can grow commercial loans.
There's enough utilization rates and revolvers. They came off their highs, but they're at the higher end of the range,
which also suggests or reflects good commercial activity. We're adding bankers in the U.S. in commercial banking and
small business. We're adding them to regions where we know we have some synergies or some capabilities, some big
MSAs. So there's no reason why we can't grow within our responsible growth framework assuming the economy
continues to chug along here.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Also, if you think about by sub-asset class, in real estate, we modulate our growth there
based on our view of wanting a diverse portfolio and then how we lend in the business. And that – if you see that
number, it was growing and it flattened out a little bit. That relative to others, that was the difference.
But Paul's last point is a key point. There are creditworthy customers that we can do more with and the only way to do
that is because we have a talented world-class commercial banking team, is to add more capacity and that capacity is

starting to build. And it takes a while because we hired commercial banker and we sometimes give them some of the
under-covered names in our portfolio or else, and then they'd go after the prospects that we have, and it takes a while to
build this up. People don't change their commercial banking relationships in an afternoon.
So in our business banking and our middle market, especially across America, we have been adding commercial
bankers and we expect that to rebound to our benefit. Given an environment, which may be solid but okay, we'd expect
to gain share in those markets as those bankers come on stream and become more productive. And Alastair Borthwick
and Katy Knox, the team that's driving that has proven that those bankers do get share and you'll see that come through.

We'll take our next question from Nancy Bush with NAB Research. Please go ahead.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Good morning, Nancy.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Good morning, guys. We are all, of course, very attuned to the issue of fraud after the
recent news that Wells Fargo both on the customer side and on the employee side. And I guess my question to you
would be as you move more to digital methods of attracting customers and keeping customers, et cetera, I mean is fraud
on either side becoming a bigger issue? Or if you could just speak to the whole issue of how you prevent fraud as you
become a more electronic bank.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I think we think about fraud in terms of the electronic side, most people think about credit
card, hope fraud – and fraud as a broad word – arguments about whether the charge was valid with a merchant or things
like that. So there's a long history of adjudicating that.
So as more and more sales go online by the consumer, the techniques for online are continuing to develop. At
face-to-face or point-of-sale, the chip card, when we're largely through all our customers having chip cards, merchant –
what we call chip-on-chip, i.e., our chip card used within merchant chip machine is rising sort of a percent or so a
quarter and is now, as best we judge it, in the high 20%s or something like that, Nancy. So all that being said, we
expect to get leverage in our fraud losses in the consumer business year over year and we expect that to continue to
come down.
And so, yes, that is a major initiative for us to continue to drive that down. Part of it is education of consumers, part of
it is getting the chip cards in the hands and getting the merchants using the chip machines, part of it is the tokenization
and the wallets and things ago on in Visa Checkout and all the variations in MasterCard and getting – because that's a
tokenized better execution and is more secure. And so, our view as a provider has been to adopt all these wallets and
technologies that have these tokenization capabilities and that then drives down the cost of losses due to merchant
complaints and other types of things. So you're absolutely right.
Cybersecurity, theft of cards from other people and sold on the Internet, all that stuff is important to us. And so we
spend, as we said, $0.5 billion a year protecting ourselves, but also part of it is making sure we understand who our
consumers are in terms of lost cards and things like that.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: How about on the other side, the employee side, opening false accounts? If you could just
speak to how you think your methodology is different, what produced the problems at Wells Fargo?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Maybe I'll take that one. Look, I want to take just one step back because to really to answer
that question, you just have to have a better appreciation for how we run Bank of America. And it truly really does start
with our purpose, which is to help customers better live their financial lives. And then from there, you have to
understand what we mean by responsible growth.
So if you ask anybody in the company responsible growth, it's about developing relationships so that we can grow with
our customers over time based upon their needs and goals. It's not about the number of products that we open; it's

whether customers want and need the products and services we're offering and use them. That's how we measure
ourselves.
We've spent years building controls and governance and escalation around this. We're always monitoring them. It's just
how we run the company. So, that's probably the best answer I can give you in terms of how we think about this issue.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Okay. And, Brian, I have what is going to be a difficult question for you. But in response to
the problems at Wells Fargo, we have seen them separate the Chairman and the CEO roles. And while that may have
been due to exigent circumstances, do you foresee another push now either by regulators or by shareholders to separate
those roles?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Nancy, I'd say this. We have dialogue with all our shareholders often and Jack Bovender,
our Lead Independent Director. Obviously, we went through this a year or so ago and that's the shareholders' vote on –
they voted on it. But the key is how we run the company and how we govern ourselves.
So again, Paul's view of when he talked about responsible growth, one of the tenets is to be sustainable and all growth
has to be sustainable, and it involves things like we've got to invest in the future, but it also involves how we govern the
company. And our board, the independence of our board, the experience on our Board, how they approach their
responsibilities I think is very strong and I think our shareholders have understood that and agreed with that.
And so, I think we govern ourselves in a very tough fashion, i.e. the board is demanding on us and understands the
strategy and has helped support the strategy through sometimes when people would challenge it. And I think it's proven
to be the right strategy this point.
And so, if you get to technicalities, our lead independent director duty is as a strong as anybody in the industry. If you
look at all the new governance surveys that have come out, all the words about proper governance and all the different
things you've seen recently, we meet or exceed everything anybody says we go to. So I feel comfortable of that.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: All right. Thank you.

And we'll take our next question from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Good morning. Just wanted to follow up on the fiduciary rule questions before.
So, appreciate that retirement assets are less than 10% of your balances as you've highlighted before. But I think what a
lot of folks are thinking about here is that SEC has been pretty clear that they're working on their own version of this
applying to taxable.
And so, when people watch what you're doing here on the fiduciary role for retirement, people are sort of logical to
assume you'd apply the same policy in the event we see a similar rule come out more broadly. So isn't that the message
that you're basically sending to FAs? And aren't you concerned that FAs might look at your platform versus some of
your competitors that will offer the BIC and think that they might have greater amount of flexibility as some of those
other platforms?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Okay. So, look, when you look at advisor attrition today, it's at all-time lows and we don't
expect significant attrition for the same reasons that attrition is low today. Merrill Lynch is a great place to work and
serve your clients.
So if you're an FA, you're looking at a platform, we have market-leading capabilities, we have breadth of products
across banking and Wealth Management, we have lots of options in terms of servicing clients, we have great
technology that we're investing in, tremendous transparency that's provided to Merrill Lynch One award-winning
research and incredible global execution through global markets. So there's a lot of reasons to be here. This is a great
place to serve your clients.

We're implementing a strategy that creates significant flexibility for our advisors and we're delivering fiduciary best
interest advice to clients. I said it before, we came to this decision not to use the best interest exception after a lot of
months of thinking and research. And this is better for our advisors and it's better for our clients. The best interest
exception is going to create confusion, it's got operational pain for clients, it's going to be inefficient and cumbersome
for our advisors. This is the best solution we believe for our clients and advisors.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: And if you look at the brass tacks financials in the third quarter of 2016, we had $4.4
billion of revenue in our Wealth Management business. Of the $4.4 billion, $500 million of it in total was brokerage.
And so this part of the business has been declining in favor of financial advice to the client and to managed portfolios
that meet the needs of the client and have investment framers and decisions based on the clients' goals.
And so the goals-based method is the dominant method in our business. And so you've seen a constant growth in asset
management fees, net interest income and other sources of revenue, and frankly a constant decline in the brokerage
business across many years. And so the SEC has an obligation in the rules to issue a rule on this at some point and they
will, and we'll adjust to that there, but it's consistent with where we've been taking the business for five or seven years.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Sure, I get it. And there's no question that commissions have been declining. It's
just that when you look at some of the asset classes like alternatives and such, it's hard to get everything to fit into a
fee-based approach, and so that was the gist of my question. But maybe going a different direction or a slightly
different...
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Again, just to be clear, we're not doing away with brokerage. Brokerage is going to be –
unless something changes in the industry and that's going to affect everybody, we're not doing away with brokerage.
Brokerage is a very important part of our advisory relationship. And FAs will work that out with their clients, what's
best for them.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Right. But if we take the logical conclusion that your approach here with
retirement would be similar to taxable under the assumption, and I – look, all of this there. I'm making assumptions
with all of this, but we all have to, that the SEC comes out with a similar rule, then your option to maintain brokerage is
self-direct. And I could see how FAs might dislike the idea of having a component of that relationship move effectively
away from them.
So what has been the response from FAs at this idea that if we want to maintain brokerage, it has to go the self-directed
route? And has that tapped in on any of the worries that some of these brokers have seen much of their book shift over
to discount brokers that would fit in that type of an approach?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I think you've stated yourself that you're making a lot of assumptions. Let's let it play out.
We have the biggest and most capable business in the world, making more money and having better margins than
anybody else. I think we'll figure it out.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Okay, thanks.

And we'll take our next question from Matthew Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.
<Q - Matthew Hart Burnell>: Thanks for taking my question, perhaps a bigger picture question. On your media call,
you were I guess asked a question on Brexit. And it sounds like you do have plans in place for that, which certainly
make sense. I guess given relative to your $53 billion cost target for 2018 and the fact that the negotiations seem to be
starting to gear up early next year, how are you thinking about the costs in the Global Markets and Global Banking
businesses from Brexit if it ends up being a harder Brexit than a softer Brexit?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Look, I think it's just too early to tell at this point. We don't know how it's all going to unfold
in the UK and in Europe. We don't know what the effect is going to be on our clients on the new rules. So as I said on
the press call, we've developed plans based upon various scenarios and we're just going to have to wait and see how

everything unfolds to know what we're going to do. But as I emphasized on that call, today we're focused on our
clients. And as I alluded to, this impacts them too. So for now, we're just working with them, providing them loans,
helping them raise capital, store or move their money, manage risk. That's what we're focused on.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Just remember materiality here. So the Markets business is about 20% of our expense base
today. That's the entire business. So I don't think the impact of Brexit in the overall company, we would manage it
without having any impact of any great magnitude. As it relates to the European business itself, it will have an impact if
it costs us more, but not to the whole company.
<Q - Matthew Hart Burnell>: Okay, and then just a quick administrative question. You mentioned on slide nine that
the nonperforming loans in the Commercial portfolio were increased by $340 million quarter over quarter. It seems like
it's mostly in the energy and related space. Is that a U.S. – or are those U.S. credits? And what's your outlook for those
balances going forward?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: It was two credits, one in Metals & Mining, one in the U.S. And if you look at the ratio, it's
at a very comfortable level, so that doesn't concern us. If you note, criticized assets were down in the quarter. That's
because these two credits that went NPL were already in reservable criticized.
<Q - Matthew Hart Burnell>: Okay, thanks very much.

We'll take our next question from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Vivek Juneja>: Hi, thanks for taking my question, a couple of questions. Paul, your deposits at the Fed declined
pretty sharply, almost 20% linked quarter, even though you had deposit growth, given that long-term rates are still
pretty low, can you talk a little about what drove that thinking?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Yes, we moved some cash into securities.
<Q - Vivek Juneja>: Yes.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: Again, we're always managing the trade-off between liquidity, capital in terms of interest
rate movements, and returns. And we just deployed some of that, as I said, in U.S. Treasuries. So you can think about it
going from one part of the government to the other. We just moved them to get a little bit more yield. We feel good
about that move, and we'll continue to optimize our cash and investment securities.
<Q - Vivek Juneja>: Is that saying that you don't expect rates to go up that much, given that you moved credit chunk
at a time when long-term rates were pretty low?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: I'm not sure we're making any – we're not projecting any view of rates when we made that
move. We're just balancing liquidity, capital, and earnings. It's a big portfolio. We're always looking at it to make sure
that we feel good about where we are at any point in time.
<Q - Vivek Juneja>: One more question. Earlier, you mentioned that in response to a question that Global Markets
was doing a better job managing the balance sheet. Could you give us some more color about what specifically they're
doing?
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: I'm not sure I really want to give much more color than that. They're doing the standard
things you might do to optimize RWA, create compression, looking at returns on various assets and just optimizing.
<Q - Vivek Juneja>: Okay, all right. Thanks.

We'll take our next question from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: Thanks. I wanted to ask you about two strategic balance sheet decisions. One is that there seems
to be a lot more retention mortgages. So when we have these kind of surges, we're not picking up as much mortgage
fees, but growing mortgage loans maybe a little bit faster. That is a shift. And do you think that will hold mortgage fees
down and trade off for further net interest income down the road?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Yes, you've got the dynamic. But the reality is, as Paul just answered in the last question,
we continue to build cash that we need to put to work. These are our core customers, very high credit quality
mortgages, and pipeline has grown quarter over quarter and continues to grow in production capacity and capabilities.
So you've got it right. The technical differences, instead of recognizing the upfront gain on sale of the mortgage and
capitalizing the servicing, you see that come through NII over time. And the other dynamic to remember is the MSR
asset will continue to drift down because we have less and less third-party servicing.
<A - Paul M. Donofrio>: And again, I want point out, we've done a lot of thinking about that. And we think maybe
there's a near-term impact on earnings, but long term we think that's a better strategy for our shareholders given the risk
profile of the mortgages that we're originating and putting on the balance sheet.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: And then in connection with that, you talked about the big question on asset sensitivity, which is
duration expectation on your deposits. As you've gone through this cycle, and initially we all assumed that there was
going to be a lot more volume runoff, then the volume just keep going higher. Have you adjusted that duration? And is
that part of why you're also comfortable putting on more mortgages that have longer duration feel to it?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: In terms of the technical modeling for NII, we still use the same assumptions we've used.
You could have great debate in our company whether we think those assumptions are conservative or not. So in terms
of the NII modeling, we've been very consistent in terms of the what kind of, Marty, deposit beta and what would
change and how it would work.
I think the pragmatic answer is that we are 90% of our customer – consumer checking accounts are core transaction
accounts, primary checking account. Those balances are touching $250 billion-plus. They've doubled over the last
seven or eight years. Those balances are the daily cash flow of a household, and I don't think they are going to change
much. But until you've got experience, it's – the model has to sort of look backwards as we'd say. And so we'll see what
happens. But so far, those of us that take the side that this will be less sensitive have won, let's just say that.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: All right, and then lastly, just strategic utilization of capital. If you look at your allocation of
capital and returns by business segment, you do a weighted average, you come up with close to an 18% return. As
profitability gets higher, that's getting farther away from the overall return, which is still around 10%. How do you
envision trying to clean up either the capital positions or the overhang from overhead expenses that then brings those
two numbers maybe a little bit closer together? Thanks.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: So, Marty, moving expenses down, we talked about that earlier. That helps the returns. But
we always have to remember that there's basically – we decide how the allocation works for the businesses. It works
differently. But when you think about the 10% capital requirements for us, 300 basis points or three percentage points
of that cannot be put to use. It cannot take risk. And so we are earning all our money on the 7%. And so when you think
about the weighted average of that, it comes out over 10%. That means that you're in a lot more on the 7% even across
the whole company. And so that's one of the difficulties.
So how do we optimize that? We make that 10% less dollar volume. If we can keep moving dollar volume down and
keep increasing earnings, you get that. That's by all the discussion Paul had in response to earlier questions about
optimizing the balance sheet. Where we get expenses down, where we grow less risky earnings that can generate
income, but it's a constant optimization. But the basic principle of people that we sometimes forget is that when you
think about 10%, only 30% of capital can take no risk and so basically earns your cost of debt.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: Got it, thanks.

We'll take our next question Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Thank you, good morning.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Good morning, Gerard. Good morning. How are you?
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Good. A question on your digital sales. Obviously, you've had 18% total sales coming through
digital channels and 25% through the mobile. Can you share with us what products you're having the most success with
selling through these channels? How much products prove to be more challenging?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Well, generally, you should think that the products, which are most straightforward like a
card application, we build a nice auto loan execution that's kind of unique and because those things are fairly
straightforward applications, mortgage and things like that really take a lot more process around them. So, I'd say cards
and autos have done their part.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Is there any target of where you can get the sales to as a percentage of your total sales? Can
eventually 50% of sales come through the digital channel?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I think it'll continue to rise in terms of dollar amount, probably rise in terms of percentage.
But remember as sales grow overall in the company, getting it to 50% means they have to win the next race in the
growth overall. But we are becoming more and more capable in delivering this and that's why you've seen the nice
growth. And so, we're applying it deeply where it can really be the primary method, and things like cards and autos are
the easier play.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: And then finally, sticking with digital, is there any application in the digital channel where you
can have success like you're having in the consumer bank in the Merrill Lynch brokerage channel?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Merrill Edge is obviously an across-the-board execution. Their clients utilize that in
Merrill and in U.S. Trust and the broad consumer business. So it's a broad execution and well-recognized as being one
of the leaders by the various authorities.
We believe and one of the things Terry Laughlin and Keith Banks and Andy Sieg and John and others are working on
is to increase our capabilities for both the advisor and the customer and in digital more or less stated in that business.
And so we think there's upside for us.
Again, less customers so the leverage is not quite the same, and that's why we spend a lot of our time around the
consumer. And there's just less leverage in the advisor. You have to think about that business because the advisor is the
core strength that we have to the customer that we have to have an execution, which is universal between the advisor
and the customer. They can all see the same thing.
And so we've got some great capabilities now in MyMerrill, things like that I think, but we plan to continue to enhance
them and continue to integrate them. So when they get to loans and deposits, things like that, they're much more
integrated over time. You can still see it all, but it's not where we want to be.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Great. Thank you, Brian.

And we'll take our next question from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brian Kleinhanzl>: Thanks. I just had one quick question, it's on the $53 billion expense target. I mean, if we've
gotten to an environment where you saw revenues come back more robustly near term, I mean could you still commit
to that $53 billion target, meaning you have enough levers to pull? Or would you see yourself switching to maybe an
efficiency ratio target if all or some of these revenues came back stronger? Thanks.

<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: If you remember, when we made that target, it was in the context of a 1.5%, 2% GDP
growth economy, much like we have now in a rate environment incremental from where we have now. So, I think the
shareholders and this management team would be happy if we were having a discussion about revenue-related
incentives going up faster than that. That would be good news for the company.
