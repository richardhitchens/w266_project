Stephen J. Hemsley
Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. This quarter we are privileged to report continued broad-based
revenue and earnings growth, consistent execution and continuing forward momentum for our enterprise.
We serve people's health and healthcare, a sensitive social and personal domain that we know requires a mission and
value-driven culture and a commitment to a quality experience, getting that experience right the first time for each
individual we serve. We're advancing consciously and steadily in this direction, with more to do to achieve the full
potential and positive impact we could have in people's lives and on access, cost and quality of care.
We work to improve overall healthcare system performance through clinical insight, enabling technologies and
distinctive data analytics, applying those capabilities across our businesses. This long-standing approach consistently
executed, continues to produce distinctive quality outcomes, balanced growth and steady financial performance.
Third quarter revenues of $46.3 billion grew nearly $5 billion over last year or 12%. Our adjusted earnings per share
grew 23% to $2.17 per share. Third quarter adjusted cash flows of $3.4 billion increased 22% over last year. And third
quarter return on equity exceeded 21%.
Looking forward, we expect continued strong performance in the fourth quarter, and into 2017. That performance will
be built on strong customer retention and broad-based growth across our businesses, driven by deeper and more
strategic relationships, and new business awards already received.
To take you deeper, Larry Renfro will discuss Optum's third quarter performance; and then Dave Wichmann will cover
UnitedHealthcare and UnitedHealth Group, overall. Larry?
Larry C. Renfro
Thank you, Steve. At Optum, we are pleased once again to report solid results for the third quarter and the year so far,
with positive business momentum as we head into 2017. The market continues to affirm Optum's distinctive position as
a scaled and broadly-capable health services and innovation company.
We have aligned our resources to address enduring market trends around helping make this health system work better.
We have strengthened fundamental capabilities, deepened relationships across the industry, including unique
collaborations like Optum Labs, and built a reputation for reliable service, even in challenging situations.
And we balance investments in our core capabilities with the expectation that we consistently deliver operating
earnings and returns on capital. This quarter, we again closed several large long-term business awards.
Quest Diagnostics has asked Optum360 to be their partner for revenue management, covering everything following the
receipt of doctor's lab orders through billing and cash collections from health plans, payers and consumers.
In collaboration with Quest, our analytics processing approaches and technology can further modernize their business
processes, improve service, lower costs, improve access to clinical and financial information, and heighten
transparency for our consumers.
Hospitals and acute care facilities continue to move to Optum360's innovative revenue services products. Today, we
serve more than 400 facilities through our patented computer-assisted medical coding technology. The number of

facilities using our computerized documentation technology has doubled in the past year to more than 125. These
represent solid advances in markets with significantly more growth and expansion potential.
A recent BlackRock market research report estimated 85% of care providers are assessing and/or replacing their
approach to revenue management over the next few years. For the third consecutive year, the experts at BlackRock
have ranked Optum360 as the best in the market in revenue cycle management software technology, in revenue cycle
management outsourcing, and in computer-assisted coding and health information outsourcing solutions.
During this coming quarter, Optum360 will reach a run rate of $60 billion in annual customer billings. This quarter,
consulting leader Frost & Sullivan named Optum the top population health management company in the nation, based
on their assessment of the Optum One technology.
Optum One integrates patient clinical information with administrative and demographic data covering millions of
people. Proprietary analytics are applied to help care providers identifying and take action with patients who are at
highest risk of adverse health developments.
Today, nearly 700 facilities, and nearly 7,000 medical clinics are using Optum One; growth of 28% year-over-year. We
see a broad range of opportunities in helping enabling ACOs as this emerging market evolves. The rise of ACOs and
value-based care in the market will only increase Optum One's utility and value.
OptumHealth revenues continued to grow strongly led by OptumCare local care delivery. OptumCare leverages
modern technology and data and analytics to improve clinical care and offer superior quality and value to patients,
payers and physicians. Providing care delivery improves the health of communities at the local level. In fact, perhaps
nowhere else can the potential benefit to individuals be as profound. And while OptumCare already comprises more
than half of OptumHealth's revenues, we are still early in developing this business.
You should expect to see us continue to build out OptumCare market-by-market to emerge as a national platform or
primary care-driven ambulatory care services. We aim to expand our care delivery through owned or affiliated clinics
to more than 75 local markets, where more than 200 million people reside.
This quarter, OptumHealth was honored to receive a multi-billion dollar award from the Veterans Administration to
conduct medical disability exams for servicemen and women for a period of up to five years. This award highlights
some of the unique services we can offer governments as customers, and shows how the diversity of our capabilities
and customer segments drives overall growth.
OptumRx continues to advance our pharmacy care services business. This is another example of how we can help make
the health system work better when we integrate across the Optum platform. We differentiate through the value of
superior data analytics, clinical integration and consumer engagement at the earliest point of care possible.
OptumHealth, with its deep expertise, scaled capabilities and assets and care management, clinical insights and
population health, is helping to enable this transformation to what we call pharmacy care services. The value of this
approach is particularly evidenced in the areas of chronic care and specialty pharmacy, where we generate more value
for benefit sponsors and consumers than anyone in this market; and we are still only in the early stages in the evolution
of this approach. The market is responding to our focus on total cost. OptumRx continues to perform well, and expects
to build on the success seen during 2017 selling season for 2018 and beyond. Our customer retention rate for January
2017 will be in the high-90%s.
OptumInsight's backlog grew 24% year-over-year to $12.6 billion, and script growth at OptumRx and number of
people served by OptumHealth continue to grow, consistent with our expectations.
Optum's third quarter revenues grew 9.4%. Our third quarter operating earnings grew 28% year-over-year to approach
$1.5 billion. Year-to-date, earnings from operations are up 40% to more than $3.8 billion. Our third quarter operating
margin of 6.9% expanded both sequentially and year-over-year led by OptumInsight's margin and offset by continued
investments in the Optum healthcare delivery businesses.

We recognize Optum remains a young company, still in the formative stages in many respects, and requiring continued
investment and improvement. We know we can and should perform better, and in turn help make the health system
work better for more people.
Now, let me turn it over to, Dave.
David Scott Wichmann
Thank you, Larry. We are pleased to report another quarter of strong growth and performance at UnitedHealthcare.
Over the past 12 months, UnitedHealthcare has grown to serve more than 2 million more people, once again with solid
growth across all three domestic medical markets. This continues the remarkable organic growth trend at
UnitedHealthcare.
Over the half decade leading up to 2016, we came to serve 9 million more people with medical benefits in domestic
markets. We are delivering value through a combination of innovative and expansive products and service capabilities,
data driven consumer engagement and decision resources, and modern value-based relationships with care providers
supported by data sharing and physician engagement. These capabilities engage and support consumers while
containing costs for both the health consumer as well as their benefit sponsors. Our full-year commercial medical cost
trend remains solidly in line with our estimate of 6% plus or minus 50 basis points.
The market continues to respond positively to the value UnitedHealthcare employer and individual plans offer.
Excluding individual plans, our commercial group business has grown to serve 775,000 more people year-over-year,
continuing its consistent pattern of growth. In six of the past seven calendar years, our employer and individual
business has grown the number of consumers served with cumulative growth across all products totaling in the millions
of people, all of it organic.
In the seniors market, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement's performance continues to strengthen each year. In the
past 12 months, more than 600,000 additional seniors have chosen our Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement
products. These plans have excellent consumer retention rates and distinctive consumer Net Promoter scores.
The strength in our Medicare business is grounded in the quality of our benefit offerings, the stability of our networks,
and a distinctive clinical engagement and consumer experience approach. This approach directly engages our own
clinical resources when data suggests we need to better coordinate care. These activities improve consumer satisfaction,
or NPS, and strengthen loyalty, customer retention, Stars performance, and the use of healthcare resources, all leading
to better value for seniors.
Our Medicare Advantage plans are increasingly recognized for quality and service. For 2018, factoring in our expected
growth, we expect 85% of UnitedHealthcare's Medicare Advantage membership will be in plans rated four stars or
higher by CMS. For 2017, we expect this metric to exceed 80%.
This quarter, our group retiree call centers achieved J.D. Power's certification, placing them among the highest
performing in consumer services across all industries. This accomplishment reflects the commitment and compassion
of our Medicare team, who seek to serve seniors with high-quality healthcare and flawless service. We expect 2017 to
be another year of strong growth, both in individual and group MA.
We also expect to grow in Part D in 2017 with the introduction of a new nationwide product set targeted to a broader
senior demographic.
Our community and state plans have grown steadily in response to state governments' needs to improve quality for
beneficiaries while ensuring the sustainability of their programs. The increase in Medicaid benefit coverage has been a
clear success of the Affordable Care Act, serving millions of more Americans and using public funds in the most
effective way. Our ability to improve quality and outcomes for all types of Medicaid beneficiaries, including those with
some of the most complex medical conditions, has driven distinguished overall growth for us for a number of years,
including organic growth of 9% or nearly 500,000 people in the past 12 months.

Our commitment to quality care, outcomes, and service have led to our position as the largest organization serving
programs for dual-eligible beneficiaries and those who need long-term services and support. Today, we serve more than
0.5 million of these vulnerable individuals for our state customers, and our growth in these categories continues. This
past quarter we were honored to be selected to proceed to contract in Virginia, in what will be another new state partner
for us. And in just the past few days, we were selected to serve in Missouri, also a new state for our community and
state business. Our new business and growth opportunities for 2017 and beyond are as robust as ever.
Looking at these benefits businesses together, UnitedHealthcare revenues of $37.2 billion grew 13.3% year-over-year
with organic growth again across the three businesses. It has also been organic – that same organic growth has been
experienced over the past several years. Every business grew revenues by a double-digit percentage over third quarter
2015. Earnings from operations of $2.1 billion also grew 13% year-over-year on steady operating margins of 5.7%.
Moving to UnitedHealth Group as a whole, our third quarter revenues of $46.3 billion grew 12% over last year. The
consolidated medical care ratio decreased 60 basis points to 80.3%. Through the first nine months of the year, our
medical care ratio of 81.3% is nearly identical to last year.
The operating cost ratio has improved 60 basis points year-to-date to 15%. The third quarter ratio of 15.2% increased
60 basis points from the second quarter, reflecting the regular seasonal increase in marketing and enrollment costs as
well as increased level of investment across the enterprise to develop and support future growth.
As Steve mentioned, third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $2.17 grew 23% year-over-year and was supported by
distinctive cash flow. Year-to-date adjusted cash flows from operations of $7.4 billion are 1.4 times net income and
adjusted cash flow was 1.7 times net income in the third quarter.
We are increasing our outlook for 2016 adjusted earnings to approximately $8 per share due to the strength of the
results produced by our businesses so far this year. We look to finish 2016 with strong momentum and carry that
momentum into 2017.
At this point of the year, the focus begins to shift to the coming year, and we look forward to discussing our 2017
outlook with you in depth at our Investor Conference on Tuesday, November 29. While we will reserve that discussion
for another six weeks, we will offer that, at this point, we are comfortable with where the consensus 2017 adjusted
earnings per share are currently positioned on the Street.
We remain committed to continually improving our performance. If we finish the year with the momentum we aspire
to, we could potentially see our 2017 EPS view reflect a modestly stronger growth outlook. For now, we will maintain
an appropriately prudent posture. Steve?
Stephen J. Hemsley
Thank you, Dave. I think at this point it's important to acknowledge something we don't do enough of, and that's the
tremendous effort of our employees and the efforts they make to bring our missions into the day-to-day reality of
helping people live healthier lives and helping make the health system work better for everyone. They exhibit the
values we share across this company as they do that work. Values of integrity, compassion, innovation, relationships,
and performance. Our thanks to their commitment and hard work.
As we move towards 2017, our enterprise is well-positioned. You can hear the optimism in Larry and Dave's
commentary today and see it in the consistency of our performance. Our businesses are aligned to important market
trends, and delivering value to the increasing number of customers and people we serve. There's still a long way to go
to serve at the peak of our potential. It is up to us to execute, and we're privileged to have that opportunity.
Thank you for your interest this morning. Operator, we can now take questions. And again, one per analyst, please.

The floor is now open for questions. [Operator instructions] We'll take our first question from Matthew Borsch with
Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Matthew Borsch>: Yes, hi. Thank you. I just wanted to ask on the outlook for the rest of the year for, Optum. Is
it still your expectation that you'll have about 60% of the earnings growth weighted to the back half? And I'm asking
because it looks like that's going to be a pretty big sequential jump implied in the Optum earnings or margins, at least
from how we're modeling it. If you could comment on that, and maybe if there's anything you can tell us about the
organic change that you've seen year-to-date in the Optum non-intersegment revenues just as it's challenging to track
that?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Sure. So, I think those patterns are pretty consistent with prior periods, but – Larry, you
want to take that, and then maybe John Rex will finish off. But Larry, you want to start?
<A - Larry C. Renfro>: Sure. Hi, Matt, it's Larry Renfro.
<Q - Matthew Borsch>: Hi, Larry.
<A - Larry C. Renfro>: Couple of things. I think, past history in terms of how our business is kind of lined up this
way currently shows that the fourth quarter for Optum is always going to pretty much play out this way, and I'll talk
about that in a minute.
So the third quarter, strong quarter for us; it met expectations and we're exactly where we expect it to be right now in
terms of our in line expectations. The fourth quarter always brings to us seasonality, and when we get into the
seasonality, we're dealing with pay for performance. We're dealing with our incentives and our shared savings. What
we're doing from a technology standpoint during the year, a lot of that comes to play and it impacts us during the fourth
quarter; the number of new accounts that we have, as well as AEP kicks-in, some of our coding kicks-in.
So we have a lot on the list side in the fourth quarter, but what I might do is talk a little bit about what our overall
business plan has been. Our overall business plan has been to have these large – well, what I'll call complex
relationships, and when we get into that, and this is all part of how we build this during the year, but we expected to
have around ten of these major relationships. We're probably somewhere around 20 at this point in time and this has
been building over the last few years.
We have three measurements that kick into this as well, and that is our backlog. And I think, I mentioned it a few
minutes ago, on OptumInsight of about $12.6 billion, that's up about 24% year-over-year. We have our qualified sales
pipeline that will also kick-in possibly during the fourth quarter, that's up about two times over last year.
And the third area is our sales for this year, what I'll call our TCV, our total contract value that's up about three times.
So we're confident where we're at right now for the fourth quarter. We believe the fourth quarter will give us
momentum into 2017. So we're right where we expect it to be. I will tell you, that this time next year, if we're sitting
here, we'll be having this same conversation, because it will constantly be a seasonality issue for us to deal with in the
fourth quarter.
<Q - Matthew Borsch>: All right. Sorry, John?
<A - Larry C. Renfro>: Yeah. And it's just the – so yes, absolutely expect those seasonal patterns to continue as we've
seen over the years, if anything, that's just – when you think about where the bias of sales to and growth is within the
Optum businesses, that should be a natural outcome in terms of that seasonality persisting.
So what you want to think about there in terms of businesses that have that type of pattern, you think about some of the
quality solutions businesses, data cells and analytics, the timing and delivery of the large deals, and certainly we've
seen plenty of large deals across the spectrum this year; some of the network solutions businesses. All those businesses
are typically second-half weighted in terms of their performance, and that's – I think that's the pattern that we'd expect
to persist.

<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: So, next question, please.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Justin Lake>: Thanks, good morning. Appreciate the early view on 2017, and you talked to being comfortable
with consensus EPS, which implies about 14% year-over-year growth with the potential for upside, given the business
momentum. When we adjust for the benefit of exiting the ACA individual market for next year, that growth looks
closer to about 9% to 10%, if I'm doing the math right. Just curious, in terms of how think about the main headwinds
and tailwinds year-over-year we should consider when thinking about that growth rate relative to your long-term
growth expectations?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Dave, you want to comment?
<A - David Scott Wichmann>: Sure. Thank you, Justin. So as you said, we'll discuss 2017 at our Investor Conference
in November. I think, the largest tailwind for the business as you're probably picking up is growth; both at Optum,
which you've seen pretty systemically throughout the year with the PBM wins, and then obviously here with the Quest
win, which is an Optum360 win, as well as, what I'll call a lot of the smaller business size wins that occur in that
business every day, a lot of which you'll see in that ramp in the Q4 as well. All those things speak to Optum's growth,
and I think, UnitedHealthcare's growth is statistically well-understood with the pattern of growth, and its membership
across all three lines of business.
The second one I would point out is the reduced loss position on the ACA that clearly will aid earnings in 2017 as well.
On the headwinds front, obviously with that growth, there's a lot of implementation costs that need to occur, and then
as you can tell, we're strategically positioning Optum to have a broader range and serve in more market segments as
well. So there's a lot of de novo startup costs, if you will, in that business, as well as a lot of implementation costs for
us, the substantive business that we've won over time.
The last thing, I guess, I'd point out in 2017, particularly at this distance and maybe a reason why you feel like we
maybe more moderate in terms of our point of view at this early stage; it's really – this organization has a deep respect
for medical costs and trends, and while we expect them to be pretty level, our trends to be pretty level next year, we're
deeply respectful of that, of medical costs, as well as the rating environment. As those things become clearer, that's
when I think that you'll see us clarify our position with respect to 2017, and that could be as early as in the 2017
Investor Conference in November.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: And I'd say that, our commentary today was an attempt to be pretty positive about 2017,
and I think the commentary about, if the momentum continues and we have every reason to believe that it will, that we
could be even stronger. But I really think that whole conversation really should – better had more face-to-face at the
Investor Conference. So our purpose today is to kind of give you some positive body language on 2017, but really defer
the conversation to the Investor Conference. So if you kind of take it in that spirit, that's the right way.
Next question, please.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Dave Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - David Howard Windley>: Hi, thank you, good morning. I wanted to ask a question around OptumRx and drug
cost trend. If you could comment on your views, generally about drug cost trend, and then within your OptumRx
business, are you seeing or are you deploying particular strategies that you think are delivering a competitively better
drug cost trend or should I think about the competitive differentiation being through the synchronization function and
seeing savings elsewhere in medical benefits as you're interacting with pharmacy members? Thanks.

<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: I think the answer to that is really both, and I think the distinctive dimensions of the
OptumRx business is that they are really kind of redefining pharmacy care services to be much more integrated into the
kind of clinical continuum to have impact on medical cost and to engage earlier. At the same time, be able to bring a
kind of leading edge perspectives to the procurements of drugs and supply chains. So Mark, do you want to comment?
<A - Mark A. Thierer>: Yeah, thank you. Good morning, Dave. I appreciate the question, and I would say that, the
one thing our clients are focused on and hiring us to do is to manage their pharmacy costs. And one of the reasons I'm
excited about this business is, there's no one in the industry who has the data, analytic and delivery assets really that
Optum possesses.
And so, you mentioned synchronization, and as you know, this is a data-driven approach. It's been central to the wins
that we posted this year from some very large and sophisticated buyers. And so – this is a new approach, and we do
think we're redefining pharmacy care services; taking pharmacy data, coupling it and linking it to medical data, linking
it to the care delivery process and including lab, behavioral data in a comprehensive data set; we call it eSync.
And the whole business is focused on, now a whole person approach. How can we take everything we know about a
member's medical condition and improve their care, utilizing cost strategies and cost trend management strategies that
you mentioned, but much more than that; delivering care in a more meaningful way. This could include phone calls by
pharmacists, house calls by nurses. This could include adherence programs. It's a full suite of programs, all aimed at
driving down total medical costs.
And so, I'd say that's the one thing that's setting us apart in the market. We're feeling very good about where we stand
in our position, and we can see it in our pipeline in the growth opportunities that we're chasing. So thank you for the
question.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Next question, please.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Michael Newshel with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael Newshel>: Thank you. Good morning. Could you get me, I guess, some more detail on the – on where
you directed the increased level of investments that you mentioned as raising the operating cost ratio? How much
spending was not previously planned and incremental to the third quarter? And also, is there anything incremental
planned in Q4 that you didn't have planned earlier in the year?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Sure, John?
<A - John Franklin Rex>: Yeah. Thanks, Michael. John Rex, here, so a little bit on OCR. So first of all, I'd say that, it
was in line with our view here in terms of how we trended in the 3Q. So the first perspective being from 2Q to 3Q there
was a big sequential increase of about 60 basis points in the OCR. And that is typical, what we see as we move into the
open enrollment period, and the investments and spend to prepare for that season began, so that is a typical move. And
I think you're referring particularly to the year-over-year move, the 30 basis point increase.
So that's, as you stated, primarily driven by increased investments. I've cited few places where we were making
investments in the quarter; things that you may have heard us refer to in the past, and maybe be familiar with; the
ongoing Stars investments, medical affordability and clinical investments; specific businesses that we've been very
vocal on in terms of where we expect to grow and invest such as the OptumCare businesses.
And then, I put up costs related to preparing for the growth we expect in 2017 across a number of the businesses within
our senior businesses, in M&R, some of the Optum businesses where you've seen there have been very – some
significant new business awards for next year, and as we prepare for that. Just the general upward pressure also that we
see from services growth. And then all of this, as you'd expect from us normally, offset partially by the productivity
gains that we've logged. So within our expectations, if I'd sum it up, and those are the types of investments that we're

And we'll take our next question from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ralph Giacobbe>: Thanks, good morning. I was hoping you can maybe just walk through the favorable
development in the quarter. We came off last quarter that had unfavorable development from both sort of current and
prior year, and this quarter obviously had favorable, particularly in the first half. So our estimates last quarter is
essentially, overly conservative on the exchange, specifically, but also sort of the unfavorable development for last
year; just hoping you could kind of flush out all those moving parts, and maybe which end markets are impacted?
Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Dan?
<A - Daniel J. Schumacher>: Good morning, Ralph, Dan Schumacher. So maybe, I'll start broadly on medical costs,
overall. From our view, certainly in the quarter, costs were well-controlled, and as you look at the consolidated medical
care ratio, it was 80.3% in the third quarter this year, and that's actually down 60 basis points year-over-year, so down a
little bit more than we had expected.
So we continue to do well, managing costs across the portfolio within UnitedHealthcare. To the components of
development specifically, so underneath that, we did have prior-period reserve development in the quarter of about
$120 million, and that was favorable. That's pretty consistent with the development we've recorded in the same quarter
last year. As you look at the pieces inside of it, to your question, the current year component was favorable $230
million, and that was partially offset by $110 million of prior-year unfavorable development.
With regard to the businesses, I would tell you that it's really less about the exchanges, frankly, and it's more about our
core businesses across Medicare, Medicaid and our commercial businesses, both the current year favorable as well as
the prior-year unfavorable. And on the prior-year unfavorable, I'd tell you that we do have a host of things that resolve
in any given quarter, and there was nothing in this quarter that was individually material, and that prior-year element
does not influence our current or our future outlook on trends.
So, as we look to the full year and look at our medical costs, we expect a medical care ratio of 81.5% on the full year,
plus or minus 50 basis points. And I'd probably tell you it would likely orient below that mid-point.

And we'll take our next question from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Mr. Costa, please
check the mute function on your phone.
<Q - Peter Heinz Costa>: Hello. Thank you. My question is on the margins in the Medicare business. Last year you
had higher spending for Medicare Star scores that impacted your Medicare performance. This year, did that spending
continue at the same level or has it come down a little bit? And then going into next year, how do you plan to utilize the
HIF holiday given that the health insurance fee comes back in 2018? So what should I think about for a trend in
margins last year to this year to next year to 2018?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Steve, you want to comment on that? Steve Nelson?
<A - Steven Nelson>: Sure. Good morning, Peter. Steve Nelson. I'll start by just giving a kind of broad perspective of
how we think about 2017 as we enter. I think we're three days into our annual enrollment period for 2017; really think

we're well-positioned overall. As you mentioned, we've seen an improvement in our Stars, and when we contemplated
our benefit planning back in the spring, we obviously considered that, had insight into that, and also the insurer's fee
moratorium as well.
And so that allowed us to make some meaningful investments and bring to market some stable benefits that we're really
excited to offer to our seniors. It's meaningful to them, the stability and premiums and co-pays and choice.
And so we think we're really well-positioned. And then, you add to that the capabilities that we've been investing in as
well in terms of our quality, which benefits our members, but also it's something that we're going to stay diligent about.
We also have, I think Dave mentioned in his opening comments some of the distinguished capabilities we have in our
member experience and service.
So all these position us really well for growth, but it's – in terms of the margin specifically, we wanted to position this
business for growth, and we think we have done that. The margins we target between 3% and 5%, and we're operating
towards the upper end of that range at this point and expect to continue to do that in 2017.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: We spent more on Stars, but we also get benefits from Stars. The performance in Stars has
really been a highlight.
<A - Steven Nelson>: Yeah, on the Star-specific investment question, I would say that we – at this time last year,
actually, we were talking about investments, strategic investments we were making in Stars, and we continue at about
the same level looking for more effectiveness, more efficiency, and some productivity gains. But generally at the same
level, don't expect that to necessarily increase, but we are getting really strong returns and very excited about the
performance and the results that we're seeing in Stars.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Very stable. So stability is kind of the order of the day in terms of the approach, and this
was a business that was challenging a few years back and has been kind of brought back into line. So very positive.
Next question, please.

We'll take our next question from Scott Fidel with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Scott Fidel>: Thanks. Interested if you can give us an update on how the net new business pipeline has developed
for OptumRx for 2017. And then also just separately, maybe an update on the commercial side in terms of how the
national accounts selling season ended up shaping up for you guys.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: So that is a two-part question. Mark, you want to take the first part?
<A - Mark A. Thierer>: Yes, Scott. Good morning. Mark Thierer. Well, we feel pretty good about the scorecard for
2016. As you know, we posted some very large wins, what I would categorize as some of the smartest and most
sophisticated buyers signing on with OptumRx, and I think these large wins validated our model. I mean, we put this
business together, we're a year and a few months into it, and I do think the strategic rationale for the combination is
proving out.
I think, at the end of the day, the reason that we're posting these wins is, first of all, we are driving better economics in
the market, that's important when you're trying to save money in drugs. But it is this differentiated model that we're
selling, the pharmacy care services model is resonating with very sophisticated buyers. I think what you're seeing,
Scott, is the convergence of the traditional PBM model which we're trying to rebuild and combining it with the Optum
clinical platform, and here we're talking about OptumHealth and all the care management, data management and care
delivery services.
And so, I think if you start to look at it, we've emerged as a sort of destination platform in this industry and feel very
good about the selling season and the wins that we'll post and bring live in 2017.

<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Jeff?
<A - Jeff Alter>: Good morning, Scott, it's Jeff Alter. Just comment on the national account season. We're wrapping
up that 2017 selling season now, and as we've talked about in the past, this was a fairly light season for active
employees, and it has played out this way. We continue to be able to manage our client retention well up in the
high-90%s, which is a testament to the value and the relationships that we – value that we bring to those clients and the
relationships that we have.
We'll probably wind up with a relatively flat membership result when you take into account the success of our group
MA efforts. So on that front, as I said, it was a fairly light active season, but we saw a very, very robust season for
group MA, and as Mark mentioned, some of the PBM offerings.
And I think what we really showed to the marketplace is that we could take the value of this enterprise to bear on those
opportunities, and really combining the unique expertise of the commercial business, our Medicare business, and our
OptumRx business, and bringing really seamless solutions to the marketplace for our clients. And we produced a very
successful result for the 2017 selling season for both our group MA business and our OptumRx business.

And we'll take our next question from Josh Raskin from Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Joshua Raskin>: Thanks, good morning. Just wanted to talk about capital deployment and specifically, share
buybacks. I know you guys have been intent on reducing your leverage this year, but looks like, it was relatively slow
in the first half and really fell off again in the third quarter. So I guess, I'm curious, one, was there something in the
market that gave you pause around share buybacks, and then how do we think about 2017? Is that a more normal sort
of return to a more normal pattern for UnitedHealth Group?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: I think we're completely in line with our plan and pattern, so I don't think there's – we
don't view this as anything of that nature, and we have reduced debt. So I think it's all in line with plan. John?
<A - John Franklin Rex>: Yeah, Josh, so particularly on share repurchase. So for the year, we had anticipated $1
billion to $1.5 billion in total share repurchase. In the first half, we did $1 billion, so we anticipated that we'd be
slowing meaningfully in the second half of the year.
We repurchased about $140 million in the third quarter. So consistent in terms of our full-year expectation in that $1
billion to $1.5 billion, range. Near-term you're right, we've discussed – we are – been focused on deleveraging our
balance sheet and applying more of our free cash flow to debt reduction. But the pattern that you've seen this year,
consistent with kind of how we approach the year in terms of our share repurchase activities.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: So really, completely in line.
<A - John Franklin Rex>: Yeah.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: So I don't think there's anything that – nor do we plan to stray from that. So our capital
allocation approaches are perfectly consistent. Next question, please.

And we'll take our next question from Gary Taylor from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Gary P. Taylor>: Hi, good morning. I was hoping to get a few more details on your ACA compliant individual
business, and I guess happy that it's not a big topic of conversation for the first time in a few quarters. But one,
wondering if you could give us both your on and off exchange compliant enrollment?

Two, I think in the third quarter, a year ago, almost 20% of the individual compliant enrollment was coming through
special enrollment period. I wonder where that stood this year versus the 20% last year. And then just finally,
presumably, the MLR in the first half the year has been pressured as you booked additional full-year losses for your
ACA compliant businesses, and I suppose we've flipped to a point where the PDR is probably now helping the medical
loss ratio.
So any color you could give on either how much the PDR came down or maybe even just what your MLR looks like in
your ACA compliant business this quarter versus a year ago? Just some help on how that's shaping up versus the
projected losses?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Sure. I think, we can answer those. Dan?
<A - Daniel J. Schumacher>: Thanks, Gary. That was a fulsome question. First to the enrollment, so on the
enrollment front, we ended the quarter with 770,000 exchange lives and another 210,000 off exchange. So on a
combined basis, our individual ACA block was just a shade under 1 million lives at the end of the quarter.
When you look at the performance inside the quarter, I would tell you that, as you pointed out, nothing's really changed
on the ACA front, and that's a good thing. Our third quarter was very much in line with our revised expectations that
we set coming out of the second quarter, and we've continued to maintain our full-year view, to be more specific about
it. So we recorded losses in the quarter of $200 million, and of that, $120 million was offset against the premium
deficiency reserve, and the remaining $80 million flowed through the P&L this quarter. That $80 million of P&L
impact is very comparable to the P&L impact we had in the third quarter last year, so very similar year-over-year.
And from our view, we think that we're appropriately positioned for the remainder of the year. I think you also asked
about the contribution of enrollment from special election versus open enrollment. I would tell you that, we have a little
less orientation towards special election this year as compared to last year. So to your point, we were a little shade
above 20% sitting through the third quarter of the year, and now we're more in the mid-teens as you look at our ACA
compliant membership base. Hopefully that covers the list?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Thank you. Next question?

We'll take our next question from A. J. Rice with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - A. J. Rice>: Thanks. Hello, everybody. Probably just go back to discussion around Optum. If I think about the
announcements you've had this quarter with the Quest announcement, takes you into a new area for revenue cycle
management, the VA contract, certainly dramatically spends the business with the government in that area.
I know, you've talked about DoD contracts, as well. And I think there's been ongoing commentary about discussions
with international governments and NHS, for example. Can you just talk about sort of the expanding opportunities that
Optum has, and what are some of the pie in the sky opportunities looking out two years or three years for Optum?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: I don't think we think of them as pie in the sky, but I think, Larry can respond to that.
<A - Larry C. Renfro>: Pie in the sky. So, A. J., good to hear from you. Let me start with international, and I'm going
to ask a couple of people to help me out. I'll ask Bill to join into this, and I might ask, Amir, to join in from an
OptumCare standpoint. And I think Mark's already covered it, but on the international front, I'd say we spent the last
year and a half building our foundation.
We've been planting seeds, and I would say that, we're strong with the NHS. We're strong with NHS improvement.
We're getting stronger with the Minister of Health as well as the Secretary of Health. As we said here today, we
actually have the Minister of Health with us for the next two days or three days on tour with quite a few of the
Commissioners of the Trust, which will be hospitals, the way we would know it.

I'd say that, as we've gone through this, with the relationship building and where we stand, the pipeline's getting
stronger, and I believe that 2017 will be a year that we will validate, as we've been validating some things here in the
States. So that's where I would say that the international sets within the UK. We are also working with our sister
organization Amil in Brazil, and that's more of a health plan, as you know, the way that we would approach that from
our standpoint.
So we're working day-in, day-out to line up with them. But we are also looking at other emerging markets. We are
looking – probably the way we would go about it is look at Australia, maybe Mexico, maybe Asia, but we're going to
finish out what we're doing with the UK, and have a very solid start as well as in Brazil before we start to pursue other
things.
So again, we talked about that market potentially being a $500 billion market, and we remain focused and confident
that that's the size of that market. You move over into what we're doing on the – what I'll call our large deeper
relationships, and I spoke about that both in the script as well as on the other answer. Instead of me speaking on this,
I'm going to ask Bill to talk about it from an OptumInsight, Optum360 standpoint and some of the large relationships
we're working with. And then, I'm going to ask Amir to do the same on what I'll call the OptumCare side.
I will make one comment myself on what we're doing in the military. We closed the – we were able to get this nice
award with the Veterans Administration on disability exam. So that we won about eight out of 12 regions, exactly eight
out of 12 regions. Four at LHI, that's in La Crosse, Wisconsin, four in California with MSLA that we own. It will
service about 4.2 million servicemen and women and we'll be going strong with that starting in January of this year. So,
Bill?
<A - Bill Miller>: Yeah, thanks, Larry and good morning, A. J. With respect to our revenue management offerings,
we've used this word validation a fair number of times this morning, and I think in the case of the win that we had with
Quest it just validates once again that our boundaries of where we can offer these technology-enabled services is
expanding. And I think Quest represents that as one of the largest, if not the largest lab diagnostic companies in the
world.
And I think, whether it's a health plan, whether it's an employer, whether it's a health system, they all do go through a
rigorous evaluation process. And whether it's Quest or Dignity, which we've talked about in the past, they're looking for
modern technology, modern systems. They're looking for people that can bring in accuracy and the expertise that could
reengineer workflows, that can leverage a worldwide workforce and peppering in all of that is someone who can drive
analytics and insights to really automate and improve the economic performance and the efficiency performance of
their own operations.
And anyone that evaluates us likes to see that, one, we're comprehensive in that approach; two, we pretty much line up
culturally with them and they really enjoy the fact that we drive a performance-based contract with them. So we're very
much focused on aligning ourselves with them, so that they are successful. And that formula is working. It's highly
enabled by a very modern set of portfolios that, as Dave said, people buy every day. But more and more, we're seeing a
trend in the marketplace where any of those constituencies are looking for more of an end-to-end comprehensive
approach to handling some of these most pronounced challenges they have in their environments. And Optum becomes
a pretty formidable and desirable option in those contexts. So with that said, maybe I'll turn it over to Amir.
<A - Amir Dan Rubin>: Great. Thank you, Bill. A. J., this is Amir, nice to hear from you. So, we're continuing to see
great growth on the OptumCare side. As you know, we have laid out 75 strategic markets that we see as important for
ourselves to be in. We are well in over half of those markets, and we continue to see growth into new markets as well
as growth within those markets.
And within those markets we're seeing growth across different payer categories, and we're also seeing growth across a
continuum of care assets. We also continue to grow our MedExpress centers. We see great success in our consumerism
approach there with MedExpress, and we'll continue to expand those assets.
And we also see ourselves addressing more and more complex populations, dual-eligible, of course Medicare
Advantage, Special Needs populations, as well. So we'll continue to see that. And then applying these capabilities,

We'll take our next question from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kevin Mark Fischbeck>: Great, thanks. The quarter looks pretty good overall, so I'm going to go back and harp
on the one thing that I still, I guess just doesn't look right to me, which was the negative prior-year development. We're
not used to seeing that from you guys at all, and now we've seen a two quarters in a row. So just wanted to understand,
I guess, how comfortable you are with the reserves and yet, to get a little bit more color, I understand, there's a lot of
things going on and it was more the core businesses than exchanges this quarter, but any color you can provide there
about what was really driving that, because we're just not used to seeing it. And looks like, at this rate you may be
showing some of the lowest growth development you've seen in the last decade. So just wanted to understand your
visibility into reserves and what's been driving that, recently?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Yeah, I'll commentary before, Dan, gets to it, is that we don't really strive for formula
development numbers. We try to get as accurate as possible, so if we had absolutely no development, it would actually
be perfect. So I think, you shouldn't read anything too much into this beyond the fact that we continue to be very
vigilant in making sure that our trends are appropriate, our reserves are appropriate, true things up in the appropriate
timeframe. Dan, you want to come back and comment one more time?
<A - Daniel J. Schumacher>: Well, Kevin, I would just add that, when you put it in a context of our total medical
spend, what you're seeing, as Steve mentioned, is greater accuracy. So last year we had north of $100 billion of medical
spend across the platform. This year we'll be north of $115 billion, and what you're seeing is, as we bring more rigor,
better analytics to a better system, connectivity, we tie in more real-time to delivery partners.
You're seeing improvements in the accuracy of those estimates. And as you look at it on a year-to-date basis, we're
sitting at $190 million of prior-year favorable development. That compares to $230 million for the three quarters last
year. So from our perspective, there's vagaries that happen quarter-to-quarter, but on balance it's – we continue to get
more accurate, and for us that's our aim. And as I mentioned at the outset, our medical costs continue to be
well-controlled, and they're coming in a little bit better than we expected in aggregate. So that's great.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Next question, please.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Michael Baker with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael J. Baker>: Thanks a lot. With the Section 1332 waivers going into effect January 2017, do you expect
any states to meaningfully alter their approach to either addressing the broken public exchange or in managing
healthcare costs?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: So I would say that we'd be – we should be a little bit retrospect with respect to our view
of how states will approach exchanges and how exchanges will play out in a new administration. So we're really not
interested in commenting on that.
What I would say is, is that our agenda here has been very focused on solid opportunities for access around simplifying
the environment in total, about going into managing costs and keeping the affordability of these programs more
relevant to the marketplace, and to really kind of lean to the programs that have really worked extremely well.
Medicaid has been a very significant success of the ACA, and wherever that has played out, those environments, those
markets have actually been more stable and better performing.

And Medicare continues to be a core program of the country, and that funding for both Medicare and Medicaid is
something that we have been advocating the consistency and stability of it. Kind of those themes are what we have
stayed with. And I think commenting beyond that, particularly as the new administrations take hold and so forth, our
posture is to be very constructive about making the marketplace work most effectively in serving the most number of
individuals and making that system simpler and more useable for everybody. So I think beyond commenting on that
level, I don't think we are going to get into what's going to happen going forward on either a state basis or federal. Next
question, please.

And we'll take our next question from Christine Arnold with Cowen. Please go ahead.
<Q - Christine Arnold>: Hey there, thanks. [indiscernible] (01:00:51) here because a lot's been asked. On Medicaid,
what are you seeing in terms of the rate outlook and the kind of margin outlook there? I know some of the expansion
states are coming through with some pretty hefty rate cuts. You continue to gain business, so you're going improve
margins on some of the business that's new to you, but how do we think about that?
And then with respect to OptumRx, you've won – you're going to be growing Medicare Advantage, you're going to be
growing PDP, you've got these new contracts offset by minor losses of membership relative to all of that in individuals,
so top line looks like it's going to be up a lot. But did you have to give up margin with this new business? How should
we think about the Optum margin next year – OptumRx?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: So, I thought you were going to Medicaid, so we'll start that way with Austin, and then
we'll finish with respect to the OptumRx.
<A - Austin T. Pittman>: Great.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Austin?
<A - Austin T. Pittman>: Thanks. Thanks, Christine, good morning. So there's really not a lot different in the
Medicaid rating environment today than there has been over the past several years. As you know, states continue to be
challenged to balance their budgets while continuing to develop new high-quality programs to care for, as has been
mentioned already today, larger and larger populations and many of those populations with much more complex needs.
We're honored to play a role in helping them do that and give consistency to both the quality delivery and the
consistency in cost for their programs.
We continue to see rates in the low-single-digits, keeping pace with medical. And really, you've got to look at this
pluses and minuses in line with the specific economic situation of a particular state. So again, nothing particularly
different. We continue to see things come out in line with our expectations.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Mark?
<A - Mark A. Thierer>: Yes. Good morning, Christine. So it is true that we've seen good membership growth in MA,
PDP, and obviously the performance in UnitedHealthcare's been strong as has a number of other health plan clients that
we service. And so, we're not going to get into the 2017 outlook. As we've said, that will be covered in the 2017
Investor Conference coming up.
I will comment, though, on the margin profile. I think that we're very comfortable with the current margin profile.
We've talked about performing in the 3% to 5% range, and so we've not had to underwrite business at a deficit and
we're comfortable that the business will perform at that level for the foreseeable future.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Next question, please.

And we'll take our next question from Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial Group. Please go ahead.
<Q - Chris Rigg>: Hi, good morning. Most of the big questions have been asked, but just two clarifying questions on
Optum. When you talk about the growth in the healthcare delivery business and the behavioral services, one, on the
healthcare delivery side, is that primarily MedExpress, and can you give us a sense for how the units have trended since
you acquired it in the spring of 2015?
And then on the behavioral side, when you say expansion into new Medicaid markets, does that mean you're layering
sort of a specialty service into existing Medicaid managed care contracts? Or it's completely a new sort of business line
at the Medicaid level? Thanks a lot.
<A - Amir Dan Rubin>: Chris, this is Amir Rubin. I could take both of those. So, yeah, we're continuing to see a lot of
growth on the OptumCare side, both on the local care delivery, our medical practices, as well as on MedExpress.
MedExpress, I think you asked specifically, we now have over 180 centers in 16 states, and we're planning to grow to
over 200 by year-end, and we're continuing to see investments into the future there on that platform, which has been
very successful.
In OptumCare, we're now managing approximately 20,000 physicians, serving over 8 million consumers. As I said, in
almost now 51 geographic markets, and so we'll continue to see growth there. We also serve through our Special Needs
Programs in OptumHealth and our Complex Care Management, over 2,000 specialty nursing facilities. So we'll
continue to see growth there.
On the behavioral side, we're seeing growth both at the Medicaid level and having success with some wins in states as
well as on the commercial side selling more business to employers and through to health plans as well.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: But nothing that's actually structurally integrated into these new proposals and things like
that.
<A - Amir Dan Rubin>: Correct.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: And basically operated on an open market integrated basis.
<A - Amir Dan Rubin>: Correct.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: So we'll take about two more questions, I think. And so next, please.
Operator
Okay. We'll take our next question from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ana A. Gupte>: Yeah, thanks. Good morning. So it sounds like with that 80.3% on the loss ratio, your
commercial group underwriting spread seems like it's pretty stable. You sound confident on the cost trend. Any
thoughts the trends you're seeing in the selling season on pricing as the Blue Cross/Blue Shield seems to have to
expand on exchanges, so maybe sustaining more losses. Is that influencing their pricing posture? And then secondly on
the self-insured side, what are the mix shifts doing and is that in any way impacting the price competition in fully
insured?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: I'm not sure I can piece that question together fully. I think it's really around pricing.
<Q - Ana A. Gupte>: Yeah.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: We're not going to comment really about others or what others might be experiencing, but
we can kind of give you some commentary with respect to what our pricing philosophies are, and I think we're in pretty
good shape in really the coming years. So, Jeff?

<A - Jeff Alter>: Good morning, Ana. I'll comment on what we see in the marketplace in general, and I would say,
what we see in the marketplace in general is affirming of pricing, particularly in the fully-insured, which has helped us
to grow because of our remaining sort of – our historical discipline and pricing continues.
We always price our businesses to our view of our forward cost trends, and as you look back into our 2014 year, that –
we took some losses because of that discipline; and now as those markets begin to firm again, we are growing in those
marketplaces. So, I think the general tone in the marketplace right now is, it remains a competitive environment, and
we believe that we'll continue through the 2017 season in small business and key accounts. But most importantly, what
we focus on is making sure our products add value to our clients and are priced appropriately for our forward view of
cost.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: And we're not seeing anything unusual in terms of the pricing environment?
<A - Jeff Alter>: No, if anything it's a pretty benign environment right now.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Both on the insured and self-funded level?
<A - Jeff Alter>: Yes.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Yeah. Okay, one last question, please.
Operator
Okay, we'll take our final from Sheryl Skolnick with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Sheryl R. Skolnick>: So there have been a couple of criticisms of late, which I think your quarter results –
congratulations to everyone – kind of put to bed, but I'm going to ask this question anyway, because it comes up from
time-to-time. And that is, so obviously it's not possible for UnitedHealthcare to win all of this business on its merits,
but rather it must be underpricing and therefore must be crushing its margins.
So in view of the fact that you didn't do that this quarter, and it seems from your seemingly well based enthusiasm for
your momentum and the strength of your business and customer relationships that you're unlikely to crush your
margins off the new business in the several coming quarters. How much of this new business win is actually related to
the – and also the ability to preserve margin, especially within UHC is attributable to the integration of all of the
business units, not just in OptumCare, within OptumHealth or not just the UHC with OptumInsight, but all of it
together.
So I'm asking the same question I asked, basically in third quarter of 2011 and 2012 and beyond, which is how much of
your results is as a result of the transformation of United itself to a better, smarter integrated business with Optum and
UnitedHealthcare, never mind the transformation of the marketplace?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Well, as usual, Sheryl, your questions almost don't need answers. We are a profoundly
different value proposition. We are – we try to bring value to the marketplace through a much more diversified
proposition, and that each year gets more effective, more integrated, more mature. And I think that, as Dave said in his
commentary, six years or seven years of steady growth in the UnitedHealthcare business, the growth across all of the
platforms, it is a different proposition, and I think that's kind of really just sums it up, I won't go further than that.
And again, we just have to prove that every quarter in terms of our own performance, our execution, the consistency of
our growth and the consistency of our financial performance as we continue to grow and expand the business and there
are still a lot of opportunity. We are far from our full potential, and generally, when we conclude these sessions with
you, we have an internal meeting talking about how much better we should be doing and could be doing, if we perform
to full potential.
So we are going to continue on that path and pleased to perform consistently this quarter. Expect to do it into the – to
finish of the year, have a positive attitude on 2017 and we're just going to keep working on that level, so that's, I think a

good way to close out the call.
Stephen J. Hemsley
So we thank you for the conversation today. I think we've delivered a strong third quarter. We reported solid growth in
virtually every business across both Optum and UnitedHealthcare. We are going to leverage this forward momentum
and expect to close 2016 with real energy and drive strong and sustained performance into 2017.
We'll continue to elevate the quality of our service; I think, that's really important for us. We are very focused on NPS
and quality performance to bring that to customers and to bring it to providers, improve the healthcare experience for
consumers, and we look forward to talking to you again next quarter.
Our Investor Conference in November is just a few weeks away, and we have held back a number of things this
morning so that we can have a robust conversation with you in November, and we look forward to that. So thank you
for your participation this morning.
