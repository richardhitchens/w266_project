MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to Medtronic's Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. At this
time all participant lines have been placed in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a
question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Jeff Warren, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir?
Jeff Warren
Thank you, Maria. Good morning, and welcome to Medtronic's fourth quarter conference call and webcast. During the
next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Gary Ellis, Medtronic Chief Financial
Officer, will provide comments on the results of our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2015, which ended April 24, 2015.
After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions.
First, a few logistical comments; earlier this morning we issued a press release containing our financial statements and
a revenue by business summary, which finalizes the preliminary revenue we issued on May 19, 2015. We also updated
our combined historical Covidien/Medtronic financial statement presentation to include FY 2015 comparable revenue
as well as combined P&L for the past eight quarters.
You should also note that some of the statements made during this call may be considered forward-looking statements
and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional
information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports filed with the
SEC. Therefore, we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement.

In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on the Investors portion of our
website at medtronic.com.
Finally, unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly or annual results increasing or decreasing are on comparisons
with the fourth quarter and full year 2014, respectively, and all year-over-year revenue growth rates are given on a
comparable constant currency basis, which includes Covidien plc in the prior year comparison and aligns Covidien's
prior year monthly revenue to Medtronic's fiscal quarters.
With that, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak.
Omar S. Ishrak
Good morning, and thank you, Jeff, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. This morning we reported fourth
quarter revenue of $7.3 billion, which represents growth of 7%, and Q4 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.16.
Before providing more detail on our Q4 performance, I'd like to recap the fiscal year. FY 2015 was a transformational
year for our company with the announcement of the Covidien acquisition in Q1 and the subsequent closing of this
transaction in Q4. We believe the combination of our two companies meaningfully accelerates our strategies,
diversifies our growth profile and increases our long-term financial flexibility. I will cover the Covidien integration in
more detail in a moment.
Our FY 2015 revenue grew 6%, which was at the upper end of our mid-single digit baseline goal and represented a
230-basis point improvement from FY 2014. FY 2015 was a strong year for therapy innovation at Medtronic with our
new therapies growth vector contributing 410 basis points to our full year growth, well above our stated goal of 150
basis points to 350 basis points. All four of our groups launched meaningful innovations in FY 2015, including those
that make advances into new disease areas, innovate in our existing market-leading technologies or enhance our
diagnostic therapy and monitoring products with key wrap-around programs. Gary will discuss the technologies that
drove our results as well as our future pipeline in more detail shortly when he recaps our business results.
Revenue in emerging markets, our second growth vector, grew double digits again in FY 2015 and contributed 150
basis points to our full year growth. Our third growth vector, services and solutions, nearly doubled in revenue in FY
2015 and added 30 basis points to our full year growth. While legacy Covidien businesses will no doubt contribute to
this vector in the future, we feel for FY 2015 it is more appropriate to look at this vector using the legacy Medtronic
revenue as the base, given all of the revenue in Q4 came from legacy Medtronic businesses. Under this methodology,
the services and solutions growth vector contributed 50 basis points within our FY 2015 goal of 40 basis points to 60
basis points.
We continued to add additional services and solutions offerings. In addition to our existing Cardiocom and Cath Lab
Managed Services platforms, we were excited to add Diabeter in Q4, a unique diabetes integrated care solution. We
also initiated our first pilot of our operating room managed services which combines the capabilities we have
developed in the Cath Lab together with Covidien's breadth of operating room technology and expertise to provide a
full service OR offering to hospitals. All of these efforts are focused on addressing the evolving needs of our customers
regarding delivery system efficiency and more integrated connected care models for patients around the world.
We feel we are well-positioned to demonstrate the role medical technology and related services can play in improving
system efficiencies and care integration in key disease states and to serve as a key partner and collaborator with
healthcare systems, payers, governments, and governments who are working to deliver better patient outcomes at lower
costs.
Looking at the FY 2015 P&L, non-GAAP diluted EPS was $4.28. While it is difficult to compare EPS to the prior year,
given the acquisition of Covidien, we are looking at some key operating P&L line items on an approximate combined
constant currency basis in order to better assess our operating performance. We also feel that these will be the
appropriate P&L metrics to evaluate our operating performance as we move through FY 2016.

In FY 2015, our operating margin percentage improved by 60 basis points, including an 80 basis points improvement in
SG&A, offset by 50-basis point decline in gross margins, all on a combined constant currency basis which corresponds
to 200 points of operating leverage and was in line with our baseline expectations. While Gary will cover our earnings
guidance in a moment, it is clear that FX is a major headwind in FY 2016. Despite that headwind, I want to emphasize
that the management team is focused on driving significant operating leverage this year.
Looking now at free cash flow, we had a very strong year in FY 2015 and met our commitment to return 50% of our
free cash flow in the form of dividends and share buybacks. Our FY 2015 results ultimately reflect the dedication and
passion of over 85,000 employees collaborating with our partners in healthcare to deliver therapies and services to
millions of patients around the globe to fulfill our mission of alleviating pain, restoring health, and extending life.
Now moving to our Q4 performance; Q4 was another strong quarter, the first quarter as a combined company with
Covidien. Our 7% revenue growth was a result of solid performances across all of our groups and geographies.
Geographically, we had double digit growth in emerging markets, strong upper single digit growth in the U.S., and
mid-single digit growth in developed markets outside the U.S. CVG had another quarter of impressive double digit
growth. Diabetes delivered strong upper single digit growth and both MITG and RTG had solid mid-single digit
growth.
In RTG, we recently reorganized the structure of our sales teams, aligning sales management to disease states. We
expect this to further optimize our focus on our neuroscience, integrated pain solutions and Surgical Synergy strategies.
In particular, we believe this should help our performance in Spine as we believe it will allow us to take better
advantage of our overall breadth.
Q4 was the first quarter of integration with Covidien. While it has only been one quarter, I am proud that our combined
organization is staying focused and delivering on our commitments, avoiding any distractions during this transition
period. As I've stated several times before, our first objective with the Covidien integration is to preserve the stated
growth objectives of both companies. As we look ahead, we believe that our baseline goal of delivering mid-single
digit constant currency revenue growth on a consistent basis is still appropriate and reasonable over the long-term.
Although similar to this quarter there could well be times when we exceed our baseline expectations.
We continue to focus on executing on our three growth strategies; therapy innovation, globalization, and economic
value. These strategies are designed to create a competitive advantage for Medtronic by capitalizing on the three
long-term trends we see playing out in healthcare, namely, the desire to improve clinical outcomes using technology,
the growing demand for expanded access to healthcare in developing countries, and the optimization of cost and
efficiency in healthcare systems including the move to value-based healthcare.
In therapy innovation, we continued to deliver above-goal performance in Q4 as the new therapies growth vector
contributed 560 basis points to our total company growth. This is a result of strong execution on product launches as
well as decisions we have made over the past few years to select the right products that solve not only our customers'
clinical needs but meet their economic needs as well. And as we look ahead, our pipeline remains full with a number of
new therapies and services expected to come to market over the next few years.
In globalization, emerging markets delivered 140 basis points to our Q4 total company growth, just below our stated
expectations. We continued to implement changes aimed at improving our emerging market growth profile, including
making progress in our public and private partnerships. On my most recent visit to China, I met with several private
hospital CEOs and discussed potential opportunities to work together.
In addition to partnerships, all of our emerging markets are focused on our channel optimization strategy, strengthening
our customer relationships to better meet our customers' needs while also recognizing the unique challenges of the local
healthcare systems. In countries like India and China where we have a vast number of distributors, we're consolidating
logistics to platform distributors in order to meet more stringent supply chain policies. In the Middle East, we're
building strong joint venture partnerships with local distributors to accelerate therapy adoption in the local markets.
In economic value, our services and solutions growth vector contributed 50 basis points to our growth in Q4 on a
legacy Medtronic basis within the goal of 40 basis points to 60 basis points. In Cardiocom, we signed an additional 14

commercial contracts in Q4 and continued to increase patient enrollment in our existing hospital and home care
provider accounts.
In our CRHF Diagnostics business, we've begun penetrating the Mobile Cardiac Outpatient Telemetry and event report
markets using our unique SEEQ-based diagnostic service. We have now started adding the Heart Failure Diagnostic
Data provided by CRHF implantable devices into Cardiocom creating a comprehensive heart failure management
service. We also started offering Cardiocom as part of a broader bundled offering to our CVG customers.
In Cath Lab Managed Services, we're generating rapid growth as we are fast becoming the ideal partner for hospitals
that seek to drive operational efficiency. While this business started in Europe, we are now expanding our Cath Lab
Managed Services business globally. At the end of Q4, we had 50 long-term agreements with hospital systems
representing $1.1 billion in revenue over the life of these contracts, which have an average age, average span of about
five years to six years. And we also have a full pipeline of potential contracts at various stages of negotiation with
providers around the world.
Turning to the P&L, Q4 non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.16. Despite the incremental moving parts due to the Covidien
transaction and increased headwinds from foreign exchange, our operating results were in line with our expectations
with our organization controlling spending effectively as we ended the fiscal year. Our gross margin continues to
reflect ongoing elevated levels of spending to improve our quality systems in Neuromodulation.
This quarter, we entered into a consent decree with the FDA, which provides a path to resolution of our issues in this
division. We take the responsibility that has been entrusted to us to provide quality products very seriously and
ensuring the highest level of quality and regulatory compliance has and always will be a personal priority for me and a
central focus of everything that we do at Medtronic.
We delivered $1.7 billion of free cash flow in Q4. We remain disciplined in allocating our capital with a focus on
creating long-term shareholder value. As a result of the Covidien acquisition we have increased ability to deploy our
cash in the U.S., solidifying our commitment to return 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders. With this increased
financial flexibility, we're in the process of reevaluating the mix of share buybacks and dividends. As an S&P Dividend
Aristocrat, we remain focused on delivering dependable long-term dividend growth.
In addition, we remain disciplined when evaluating potential M&A opportunities. Any investment we make must be
aligned with and ultimately strengthen one or more of our three growth strategies while at the same time offer high
return metrics and minimize near-term shareholder dilution.
As we look ahead to FY 2016, we remain focused on delivering on our baseline financial expectations as we continue
to integrate Covidien into Medtronic. We have four clear priorities guiding this process; preserve, optimize, accelerate,
and transform. I mentioned preserve earlier, our first and highest priority, and we expect to continue to meet the
financial commitments of both companies. Our second priority, optimize, is focused on achieving the detailed cost
savings plans that are expected to result in a minimum of $850 million in cost synergies by the end of FY 2018.
Our third priority, accelerate, is related to assessing and prioritizing the numerous revenue synergy opportunities which
today include leveraging Covidien's Peripheral Vascular sales force to drive sales of drug-coated balloons, as well as
leveraging Covidien's Neurovascular division to enhance our neuroscience strategy in RTG. We are creating the
industry's first true comprehensive stroke management business, leveraging our transformative therapy innovations, the
Solitaire mechanical thrombectomy product in Neurovascular, and CVG's LINQ Insertable Cardiac Monitor with its
clinically proven role in the management of cryptogenic stroke patients.
Our fourth and final priority is transform. As we observe and interact with healthcare systems around the world, we
continue to see a push for experimentation with new models of delivery system operations, new payment schemes and
integrated patient care as a critical mechanism to balance their costs and access challenges. Each of these efforts seek to
drive higher levels of patient and system value. To move to these value-based healthcare models around the world
presents a unique opportunity for Medtronic because we believe medical technology can play an increasingly larger
role in delivering higher levels of value in healthcare. The proper application of medical technology and the adept use
of data and information associated with these technologies can be paired to help bend the cost curve in healthcare and

produce better clinical outcomes at the same time.
This is pushing our organization to develop technology offerings, services, and business models that bring new forms
of value across a given patient care continuum and within the delivery system itself. This continues to drive our
organization to move beyond medical devices to create integrated health solutions that complement and enhance our
devices' value through additional wrap-around services and solutions. By addressing these trends now, we believe we
will also uniquely position Medtronic to participate in the emerging bundled payment and risk sharing models, focused
on very specific disease states.
We are actively partnering and collaborating with hospital systems, payers and governments who are working on these
new models and we intend to continue to do so as a leader intent on leveraging our industry-leading products, deep
clinical and economic expertise, global footprint, and financial strength. Ultimately, we believe this is what will
differentiate Medtronic and uniquely positions us to succeed in the ever-changing global healthcare marketplace.
Gary will now take you through a more detailed look at our fourth quarter results. Gary?
Gary L. Ellis
Thanks, Omar. Fourth quarter revenue of $7.304 billion increased 60% as reported, or 7% on a comparable constant
currency basis after adjusting for a $483 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency. Legacy acquisitions and
divestitures from both Medtronic and Covidien contributed 80 basis points to growth.
Q4 revenue results on a geographic basis were as follows; growth in the U.S. was 8% and represented 55% of our
overall sales. The non-U.S. developed markets grew 5% and represented 32% of our overall sales, and growth in the
emerging markets was 11% and represented 13% of our overall sales.
Q4 diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis were $1.16, a decrease of 2%. We were breakeven on a Q4 GAAP
earnings basis after several significant charges, primarily related to the Covidien acquisition. In addition to the $362
million adjustment for amortization expense, the Covidien-related non-GAAP adjustments on an after-tax basis
included a $455 million charge related to the inventory purchase price step-up, a $286 million (sic) [$268 million]
charge for acquisition-related items, and a $157 million net restructuring charge. We also had a $349 million charge
related to certain tax adjustments, the majority of which related to the proposed agreement reached with the IRS,
resolving all proposed adjustments associated with the Kyphon acquisition. A $61 million CVG product technology
upgrade commitment charge and a $27 million net litigation charge primarily related to provision for additional infused
claims.
In our Cardiac and Vascular Group, revenue of $2.596 billion grew 10%. This was the result of strong performance in
all three divisions; Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure, Coronary & Structural Heart, and the Aortic & Peripheral
Vascular. In Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure, or CRHF, revenue of $1.398 billion grew 11%. This performance was
driven by low teens growth in Low Power, mid-single digit growth in High Power, strong growth of over 30% in AF
Solutions as well as nearly doubling our revenue in services and solutions, which includes Cardiocom and Cath Lab
Managed Service revenue.
We estimate that the global CRHF market is growing in the low single digits to mid-single digits and the strength of
our new product introductions is resulting in share gains and generally improved pricing dynamics. Low Power growth
continues to be driven by the global adoption of Reveal LINQ, which resulted in diagnostic revenue growth of over
20% sequentially as well as solid pacemaker implant growth in the U.S. LINQ is resulting in not only increased
diagnostic sales but also pacemaker pull-through as LINQ is resulting in more bradycardia diagnosis and syncope
patients.
Looking forward – looking ahead, we look forward to the launch of the Micra Transcatheter Pacing System in
international markets this summer, followed by a U.S. launch in FY 2017. In High Power, we continued to see stronger
market adoption of our Attain Performa CRT-D system with its differentiated next-generation Quadripolar Technology,
AdaptivCRT algorithm, and time-saving vector express programming. High Power also had a strong quarter in Japan,

where we have now gained over 20 points of ICD share since the launch of our Evera MRI SureScan ICD in Q3. We
expect to launch the Evera MRI ICD in the U.S. in this fiscal year. Our AF Solutions business continues to take share
in the AF market on the continued strong growth of our Arctic Front Advance CryoAblation System which is growing
at more than double the overall market growth rate.
Turning to Coronary & Structural Heart, or CSH, revenue of $792 million grew 9%. Our Coronary business grew in the
low single digits, driven by solid mid-single digit growth in drug-eluting stents. In Europe, our launch of the Resolute
Onyx resulted in 400 basis points of DES share gain sequentially and a sequential slowing of pricing declines. Resolute
Onyx features enhanced visibility and thinner struts to improve deliverability. We began the U.S. pivotal trial for
Resolute Onyx in March and are currently forecasting an FY 2018 FDA approval. In our broader Coronary product
offerings, we are also seeing increased strength particularly in balloons, where we gained 400 basis points of share on
the successful rollout of our differentiated Euphora PTCA balloon family.
In renal denervation, we announced in April the initiation of the SPYRAL HTN Global Clinical Trial Program, which
includes two global, prospective, randomized sham-controlled trials studying uncontrolled hypertension patients both
on and off medication. Based on the outcome of these two initial studies, we will then evaluate next steps for our
pivotal study.
Our Structural Heart business grew in the upper teens, driven by another strong quarter in Transcatheter Valves which
grew nearly 50%. In the U.S., our continued rollout of CoreValve is driving growth and resulting in both sequential and
year-over-year share gains. We added approximately 40 additional new centers in the quarter and now have more than
275 U.S. centers trained since launch. In late March, we received FDA approval for the use of CoreValve in a failed
bioprosthesis, also known as valve in valve implantation, and this further contributed to our U.S. growth. As CoreValve
is the only TAVR product approved for this indication, it makes CoreValve an indispensable offering for every
practicing TAVR center.
In international markets, our business took share sequentially due to the strong adoption of our CoreValve Evolut R.
We are seeing strong customer enthusiasm for this next-generation, self-expanding platform with its options to
recapture and reposition the valve during the procedure. It's differentiated 14 French equivalent delivery catheter
allowing access to smaller anatomies and its redesigned inflow and skirt to help promote annular sealing. Evolut R is
receiving tremendous feedback on its clinical outcomes, overall ease of use, and procedural efficiencies. The FDA
submission of Evolut R is complete and we are targeting the first half FY 2016 approval and U.S. launch.
The FDA also recently allowed us to begin implanting Evolut R in our SURTAVI trial and to reduce the enrollment
requirements for the trial to 1,400 patients, which we believe brings in the timeline for the U.S. intermediate risk
approval by at least a year. We have already enrolled approximately 1,250 patients in SURTAVI and we expect to
complete enrollment over the next several months. And in Japan, we received PMDA approval for CoreValve in March
and plans are underway for a full launch this fall following anticipated reimbursement approval in October.
In our Aortic & Peripheral Vascular division, or APV, revenue of $406 million grew 9%. The Aortic business grew in
the low single digits and the Peripheral Vascular business grew in the mid-teens, driven by the successful U.S. launch
of our IN.PACT Admiral drug-coated balloon. We estimate that the IN.PACT Admiral is the leading DCB in the U.S.
market in just its first quarter of launch. This leadership position was attained without the benefit of having a full
quarter of a combined Medtronic and legacy Covidien Peripheral sales force. We expect this DCB to drive growth in
our APV division over the coming quarters through both its individual revenue contribution as well as its ability to
drive share across our broader Peripheral Vascular product line through the use of multi-line contracting.
Looking at our DCB pipeline, we expect to obtain FDA approval for our 150 mm IN.PACT Admiral balloon in Q4 FY
2016 or early Q1 FY 2017. In addition, we expect to file for expanded indications for IN.PACT Admiral with a PMAs
U.S. filing in the second half of FY 2016 for In-Stent Restenosis indication, as well as a CE Mark filing by the end of
FY 2016 for AV fistula indication. We are also finalizing bench testing now on our redesigned DCB for use
below-the-knee which we expect to submit for CE Mark in FY 2016.

Now turning to our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group, which consists of the majority of legacy Covidien businesses,
revenue of $2.387 billion grew 6%, which included a net 140-basis point contribution from acquisitions and
divestitures. MITG's revenue performance was driven by double digit growth in Surgical Solutions and low single digit
growth in Patient Monitoring & Recovery.
Surgical Solutions' revenue of $1.293 billion grew 10% with high single digit growth in Advanced Surgical, low single
digit growth in General Surgical and growth of over 40% in Early Technologies. Advanced Surgical had a strong
quarter with a balanced low double digit growth in both Stapling and Energy. Stapling results benefited from the
continued rollout of new products, including the Endo GIA Reinforced Reload. In Energy, we are seeing strong
procedural growth, particularly in Vessel Sealing.
Our Early Technologies business also had solid growth across all three product lines; GI Solutions, Advanced Ablation,
and Interventional Lung Solutions. Geographically in Surgical Solutions, both the U.S. and China had strong quarters,
delivering double digit growth. Surgical Solutions continues to focus on driving minimally invasive surgery adoption
globally. Patient Monitoring & Recovery revenue of $1.094 billion grew 2%. The division was led by strength in the
Patient Monitoring business, which grew in the mid-single digits as well as both Nursing Care and Airway &
Ventilation, which grew in the low single digits. This offset low single digit declines in Patient Care. Growth in the
Patient Monitoring business resulted from a strong U.S. flu season, which drove pulse oximetry sales.
Now moving to our Restorative Therapies Group; revenue of $1.854 billion grew 5%. Results were driven by growth in
Surgical Technologies, Neuromodulation, and Neurovascular, partially offset by modest declines in Spine. Spine
revenue of $743 million declined 2%. Low single digit growth in BMP was offset by low single digit declines in Core
Spine and Interventional. Both the global and the U.S. Core Spine markets grew in the low single digits, consistent with
last quarter and our Core Spine business, both PL and Cervical, declined. But both of these businesses are expected to
improve as we continue to launch innovative technologies into the market and these new products become a larger part
of our sales mix.
In PL, we are expecting FY 2016 rollouts of new technologies for our OLIF25 and the OLIF51 Procedures, our new
[ph] ELEVATE expandable cage (29:48) and SOLERA VOYAGER, our new minimally invasive lumbar pedicle screw
system. In Cervical, we continue to see adoption of our PRESTIGE LP Cervical Disc and innovative ANATOMIC
PEEK PTC interbody spacer. We are also now beginning the launch of our DIVERGENCE Stand Alone Interbody
Cage and ZEVO Anterior Cervical Plate System.
Our Spine division also continues to develop and deploy our differentiated Surgical Synergy program, which integrates
our enabling technologies, surgical tools, spinal implants, and expertise to improve the surgical outcomes and
efficiencies. This includes utilizing O-arm imaging and StealthStation navigation in Spine procedures, and a strong
growth from these two enabling technologies is recognized in our Surgical Technologies division.
In Neuromodulation, revenue of $518 million increased 6%, driven by double digit growth in DBS and mid-teens
growth in Gastro/Uro. In DBS, our global growth focused on the neurologist referral programs and the strength of their
early stim data in international markets continues to drive solid growth. In Gastro/Uro, we continue to see strong
growth in sales of the InterStim System.
Our Pain Stim business was flat this quarter, reflecting a continued decline in the U.S. market, resulting from a negative
reimbursement change that affected trialing activity and new implant growth. However, we grew our global Pain Stim
share sequentially on the strength of our RestoreSensor SureScan MRI spinal cord stimulation system with its
proprietary AdaptiveStim automatic stimulation adjustment feature and access to MRI scans anywhere in the body.
Turning to our Surgical Technologies division, revenue of $461 million grew 9%, driven by solid balanced growth
across all three businesses. Neurosurgery grew in the mid-single digits reflecting record worldwide O-arm surgical

Advanced Energy, strong adoption of our proprietary Aquamantys tissue sealing and PEAK PlasmaBlade technologies
drove upper teens growth.
In Neurovascular, revenue of $132 million grew 23%. The division, formerly part of legacy Covidien, had strong
double digit growth across foils (sic) [coils], stents, flow diversion and access. In stents, we saw strong adoption of our
Solitaire FR revascularization device following the presentation of four meaningful clinical trials at the International
Stroke Conference in February and subsequent publication of three of these studies in the New England Journal of
Medicine. These studies provided the evidence that the standard-of-care for the treatment of stroke should be changed
to include stent thrombectomy as a primary treatment in addition to IV-tPA.
In our flow diversion portfolio, we also saw strong growth as a result of continued U.S. launch of the Pipeline Flex
embolization device.
In our Diabetes Group, revenue of $467 million grew 8% with solid upper single digit growth from the continued
adoption of our CGM sensor-augmented insulin pump systems in both the U.S. and non-U.S. developed markets.
In the U.S., we continued to see strong adoption of our MiniMed 530G with the in Enlite CGM sensor. In non-U.S.
developed markets, growth was driven by the launch of our next-generation MiniMed 640G System with the enhanced
Enlite CGM sensor in Australia and Europe. In addition to incorporating a brand new insulin pump design and user
interface, the MiniMed 640G System features SmartGuard technology, which can automatically suspend insulin
delivery when sensor glucose levels are predicted to approach a low limit, and then resume insulin delivery once levels
recover. We continue to make progress in bringing this technology to the U.S. and plan to submit the PMA for this
system later this calendar year.
In Q4, we continued to advance the development of artificial pancreas technology through a minority investment in
DreaMed Diabetes, which included licensing their MD-Logic artificial pancreas algorithm. We also continued to make
progress in our Diabetes Services & Solutions division with three business development announcements in Q4. First,
we made a minority investment in Glooko, a developer of a Unified Platform for Diabetes Management. Second, we
announced a partnership with IBM Watson Health to develop a new generation of personalized diabetes management
solutions. And third, we acquired Diabeter, the Netherlands-based diabetes clinic and research center which has
developed a truly unique integrated care model for people with diabetes that we intend to expand globally over time.
Taken together, these announcements signify that we are focused on transforming our Diabetes Group from a
market-leading pump and sensor company into a holistic diabetes management company focused on making a real
difference in outcomes and cost.
Turning to the rest of the income statement; after adjusting for certain non-GAAP items mentioned earlier as well as
the 10-basis point negative impact from foreign exchange, our Q4 operating margin was 29.6%, which included
non-GAAP operational gross margin, SG&A, and R&D of 70.8%, 32.6%, and 6.9%, respectively, demonstrating the
leverage we normally see in the fourth quarter in SG&A and R&D. Also included in the operating margin was net other
income of $20 million, including net gains from our hedging program of $139 million. We hedged the majority of our
operating results in developed market currencies to reduce volatility in our earnings from foreign exchange. In addition,
a growing portion of our profits are unhedged, especially emerging market currencies, which can create some modest
volatility in our earnings.
Based on current exchange rates, we expect FY 2016 net other expense to be in the range of $215 million to $275
million, which includes an expected impact from the U.S. medical device tax of approximately $205 million. For Q1
FY 2016, we expect net other expense to be in the range of $65 million to $75 million based on the current exchange
rate. It is worth noting that in Q4, we hedged the majority of the expected FY 2016 legacy Covidien operating results in
developed market currencies, consistent with Medtronic's practice at recent market rates.
Overall, we expect FY 2016 operating margins to be in the range of 28% to 29% on an as-reported basis, which
includes over 100 basis points of improvement or approximately 400 basis points of operating leverage related to cost
synergies offset by an expected FX impact of approximately 70 basis points. The majority of the operating margin
improvement will come in the SG&A as a result of the realization of cost synergies from our Covidien acquisition as

well as continued execution on legacy leverage initiatives of both Covidien and Medtronic. We would expect operating
margins in the first half for the year to be below this range, improving into the back half for the year as the foreign
exchange headwinds lessen and cost synergies accelerate.
Below the operating profit line, Q4 net interest expense was $186 million, a significant increase from prior quarters as
we are now including the incremental interest expense from our December 2014 $17 billion bond offering used to fund
that Covidien acquisition. At the end of Q4, we had approximately $19.5 billion in cash and investments, and $36.2
billion in debt. In Q1, we expect to retire $1 billion of maturing debt using existing cash.
Based on current rates, we would expect FY 2016 net interest expense to be approximately $750 million, including
approximately $210 million in Q1. Our non-GAAP nominal tax rate on a cash basis in Q4 was 15.4%. This was lower
than expected due primarily to the finalization of profit mix by jurisdiction, which resulted in a favorable catch-up as
we reduced our annual tax rate. We would expect our FY 2016 non-GAAP nominal tax rate on a cash basis to be in the
range of 16% to 18% as we expect to be at the higher end of the [ph] risk range until the (39:13) presently expired U.S.
R&D tax credit is reinstated.
In Q4, we generated $1.7 billion in free cash flow. We remain committed to returning 50% of our free cash flow
excluding one-time items to shareholders. In Q4, we repurchased $300 million of our common stock and paid $435
million in dividends. While a portion of our dividend paid in April was treated for U.S. tax purposes as a return of
capital, our expectation is that we will increasingly accumulate profits at the Medtronic Plc level and move over time
toward a dividend that is treated completely as return of their earnings.
As of the end of Q4, we had a remaining authorization to repurchase approximately 30 million shares. Fourth quarter
average daily shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1.441 billion shares. It is important to note that the cash we
received from stock option redemptions, which was $172 million in Q4, will also continue to be used to repurchase
shares on the open market, to partially offset the dilutive impact. These share repurchases are incremental to our
commitment to return 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders. For FY 2016, we would expect diluted weighted
average shares outstanding to be in the range of approximately 1.433 billion shares to 1.437 billion shares including
approximately 1.439 billion shares in Q1.
Let me conclude by commenting on our initial fiscal year 2016 revenue outlook and earnings per share guidance. We
believe that underlying operational revenue growth in the range of 4% to 6%, plus incremental expected revenue from
our Q1 extra selling week of 100 basis points to 150 basis points all on a comparable constant currency basis is
reasonable for FY 2016. This operational revenue growth expectation is consistent with our stated baseline financial
goal of consistently delivering mid-single digit revenue growth. Our revenue outlook assumes that CVG, MITG, and
RTG grow in the mid-single digits and Diabetes grows in the upper single digit to low double digit range, all on a
comparable constant currency basis and including the expected benefit of the extra week.
While we cannot predict the impact of currency movements to give you a sense of the FX impact if the exchange rates
were to remain similar to yesterday for the remainder of the fiscal year, then our FY 2016 revenue would be negatively
affected by approximately $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion including a negative $540 million to $600 million impact in Q1.
Turning to guidance on the bottom line, we believe it is reasonable to model cash earnings per share in the range of
$4.30 to $4.40, which includes an expected $0.40 to $0.50 negative foreign currency impact based on current exchange
rates and approximately $300 million to $350 million of targeted value capture synergies from the Covidien
acquisition.
As you think about your FY 2016 models and quarterly gating, it is worth noting that this FX impact to earnings per
share is $0.10 more negative than the estimate given on our Q3 earnings call as well as the fact that a higher percentage
of the negative FX impact is in the first half of the year while more of the value capture synergies occur later in the
fiscal year. As in the past, my comments on guidance do not include any unusual charges or gains that might occur
during the fiscal year.
I will now turn it back over to Omar.

Omar S. Ishrak
Thanks, Gary. And before opening the lines for Q&A, let me briefly conclude by stating that Q4 was another strong
quarter, a good finish to a successful and transformative year. As we look ahead, while we are facing increased
headwinds from foreign exchange, we must remain focused in the operations of the company, striving to reliably
deliver on our baseline financial model, mid-single digit constant currency revenue growth, EPS growth 200 basis
points to 400 basis points faster than revenue on an operational basis and returning 50% of our free cash flow to
shareholders. To achieve these goals, we continue to execute on our three primary strategies, therapy innovation,
globalization, and the economic value. We expect our efforts to deliver consistent and reliable performance combined
with the disciplined capital allocation will enable us to create long-term dependable value in healthcare.
With that, we will now open the phone lines for Q&A. In addition to Gary, I have asked Mike Coyle, President of our
Cardiac and Vascular Group; Bryan Hanson, President of our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group; Chris O'Connell,
President of our Restorative Therapies Group; and Hooman Hakami, President of our Diabetes Group to join us. We
are rarely able to get to everyone's questions, so please limit yourself to only one question and only one follow-up. If
you have additional questions, please contact our Investor Relations team after the call.
Operator, first question, please?
Q&A
Operator
Our first question comes from line of Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Good morning, and thanks, everybody, for taking the questions. So, Omar, as a starting
point if I look at your U.S. business, this was certainly one of your better quarters in quite some time at the company.
And I was hoping you could touch on your view of the health of U.S. medical device end markets. You obviously have
at Medtronic a number of products that are driving specific Medtronic growth from LINQ to CoreValve across the
portfolio. But how do you feel about the health of the overall U.S. medical device market? Do you think that it's picked
up over the last few quarters?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Yes, of course it has, because if you just look overall at the number of procedures, look at what
hospital systems are reporting in terms of their procedures and our own experience, certainly the market has picked up.
But I would add like three factors, some of which you mentioned already, which has sort of contributed to our
performance. First is that there's an overall pickup and a stabilization in fact of the market and now I think sort of
correlating directly with the increased expectation from demographics. So that's certainly there.
I think in addition, like you pointed out, convergence for our new products coming all together at roughly the same
time has given us a boost, there's no question about it. And finally, we haven't fully quantified it yet but there is a
pull-through effect of some of our implantable devices from very strong diagnostic monitoring sales or LINQ device
sales. We don't know how much that is but I think the three of these put together are probably the main factors driving
this increased growth in the U.S.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Gary, let me get to the FY 2016 guidance. So the incremental impact on EPS from FX,
that $0.10, is that in part because you hedged intra-quarter the Covidien exposure what at some point were less
favorable rates? And then I assume from your commentary just about the timing of the impact of FX, the timing of the
benefit of the synergies as well as your tax rate, just one more item, that as we think about the earnings cadence over
the course of 2016 that we probably should expect it to be more back half loaded? Thanks.
<A - Gary L. Ellis>: Yes, Mike, back to the – on the issue on the foreign exchange, yes, the majority of the $0.10
change from what we had previously estimated on the FX is primarily related to the fact that as we hedged Covidien in
the fourth quarter, the rates were even lower than where we provided guidance originally on the $0.30 to $0.40.

So, yes, I mean, the fact is we did get Covidien into our hedging program, but unfortunately by the time we got them in
our hedging program, we were at probably – the rates are similar to where we're at currently. And that generated an
additional loss from the standpoint of foreign exchange overall. So that's the majority of the $0.10. The rest of it is
there's some slight impact just from the standpoint that we don't hedge up to 100% of our even the Medtronic earnings.
It's more like 80% of it and so there was still some impact on the foreign exchange getting a little bit worse since the
earning call previously even on the Medtronic and the hedge component.
But the majority of it was locking in Covidien under the contracts that basically increased the potential negative hit
going forward. Now, the good news is they're locked in, so any further change as we go forward, obviously, which
should be minimized as a result of that. As you indicated, as we look forward, yes, I think right now from what I've
seen out there for some of the models, I think some people have it probably a little bit too much front end loaded. There
is going to be more based on the results as we go forward here, foreign exchange has clearly much heavier hit in the
first half of the year and assuming the rate stays the same would be less in the back half.
As you said the tax rate is going to be a little bit higher in the first until we get the R&D credit approved. And the value
capture is going to occur as we go through the year. So that's clearly going to be escalating and we'll have more benefit
on value capture in the back half of the year. So I think some of the models need to be shifting probably a little bit more
from the first half to the second half on the earnings per share guidance.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Okay. Perfect. I'll let some others jump in. Thanks, guys.
<A>: Thanks, Mike.
<A - Gary L. Ellis>: Thanks, Mike.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Thanks, Mike.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of David Roman of Goldman Sachs.
<Q - David Harrison Roman>: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I wanted to just start with some of your
comments toward the end of the call regarding capital deployment. I know in the February call you had started to talk
about a potential shift as it related to the mix of dividends and buybacks with the anticipation of a dividend update in
June. I guess, A, is that still the case, and, B, any additional color you could provide around the magnitude of that shift
at this point in time?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Well, first, yes, we clearly have more flexibility, as we've talked about several times, with
increased access to overseas cash. And I think also our increased sort of operating productivity that we will get from
synergies is a factor that we have to consider. And so based on that, we're examining our overall capital allocation
strategy, and we're going to update you shortly on this in a pretty short timeframe. That's I think all I can say at this
point.
<Q - David Harrison Roman>: Okay. And then maybe just a follow-up on Spine; I mean, this is a business that has
ebbed and flowed over the past several quarters but it does look like the overall end market has shown some signs of
improvement at least over the past, call it, 12 months, so that's not something in which Medtronic has necessarily
participated. Could you maybe go into a little bit more detail on exactly what the turnaround plan is for Spine and at
what point you start to think about more significant changes in that business either at the senior management or sales
level?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Well, there are a number of points. So, first of all, from an overall perspective, you're right, the
business itself, Spine taken in isolation hasn't quite kept up with the way the markets have trended at least in the last 12
months I'd say. But there's a short-term strategy to this which is further related with timing of some of the new
products, which we'll see it play through in the coming quarters here in the short-term. There is a longer-term aspect of
this and that we've always said that our strategy in that space is really an integrated strategy that uses our overall

capabilities in capital equipment and in surgical tools together with Spine to give us the competitive advantage.
And to that effect, we've reorganized our commercial teams at the regional management level. That's already in place.
We've done that both in the U.S. and in Europe, and we're going to definitely see how that plays out. I think that's really
our strategy, and we're going to monitor how we deliver on these two aspects in the coming quarters very closely.

Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart of Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Gary, I was wondering if you could just go into a little
bit more on the tax rate you had mentioned. During the quarter you had settled some related to Kyphon, I'm not sure if
that's all of the IRS settlement that you were referring to at the Investor Day last year? And then also just on the
guidance for the full year of 16% to 18%, maybe just walk us through how you get there just given the fact that at least
I was expecting the tax rate to be a little bit lower given some of the commentary that you had with Covidien post close
with the rate dropping by about 200 basis points. Not sure if it's related to the settlement there with the IRS?
<A - Gary L. Ellis>: Yes, okay. With respect to, first of all, the Kyphon aspect and the charge we took in the quarter
related to Kyphon, this relates to an issue we've had that was raised by the IRS related to our acquisition of Kyphon
several years ago, and which we used a combination of basically OUS cash and U.S. cash to accomplish. And there was
a dispute on how much of that was taxable, et cetera. So as you recall we used about $3.3 billion of OUS cash to do that
transaction. What we ended up agreeing with in a preliminary decision, the board still has to approve it, but we agreed
basically on a settlement with the IRS where we ended up paying about $275 million to settle that and then interest on
top of that gets you to the charge we took for the quarter overall.
This is not the transfer pricing – part of the transfer pricing issue that we've talked about in some of the other previous
meetings which will have a significant impact on the cash flow going forward. This is kind of more of a one-off item
related to the acquisition, but it was a major outstanding issue we had with the IRS and we were happy to get this one
settled and move beyond it. As far as the tax rate going forward, 16% to 18%, that is basically in line with what we've
expected, if you went back and looked at Medtronic previously, and remember, this is all now on cash earnings and so
it's actually a lower rate if you put in the amortization impact so you've got to make sure you're looking at
apples-to-apples when you look at this, Kristen.
But overall, I mean, Medtronic previously was kind of – we've been in that kind of 18% to 20% range, Covidien had
been kind of in that 16% to 17% range, and then as we basically pull this all together, you leverage those and as we
indicated as we were going to get about a 200-basis point drop as we come forward related to that. So as a result, we
end up on that 16% to 18% range. I mean is it 15.5% to 17.5%? I mean, that's kind of how we get to the overall
numbers.
So it's in line with what we've expected and been guiding towards overall. Obviously, there is still a lot of moving parts
with respect to the tax planning and strategies as we go forward, but we think that range is right in line with kind of
what we saw here in Q4 as we went forward. It all depends on R&D tax credit getting renewed, all those types of
things.
So as we go forward, we feel confident that we're kind of in that range and we'll have to see where it ultimately ends up
but that's kind of our current expectation. And it's in line with what we've been saying previously.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: So what's the impact on the R&D tax renewal for that number, and what is the updated
timeline on resolution on the transfer pricing issue?

<A - Gary L. Ellis>: Well, the R&D tax credit probably has an impact of 50 basis points or so to the overall rate as far
as where that is. So it's not huge, but it does have an impact on it, and it all depends obviously when it comes in, how
much – how it plays out as far as how much catch-up you have when it occurs. On the transfer pricing issue with Puerto
Rico, the court heard the case. We're waiting for the judge's decision on that, and that will be whenever the judge
decides. It's probably going to be towards – closer towards the end of FY or fiscal year before we hear anything on that.
But it's all based on their timing.
<A>: So the judge decides what they want. At least a year they'll review it.
<A - Gary L. Ellis>: Right. So it's all based on their timing. Thanks, Kristen.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis of Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Good morning. Just two quick questions. First, for Bryan, Surgical Solutions business
continues to remain above market growth even though you're getting a much more concerted effort from your chief
competitors. So you keep on getting these questions of sustainability in that business despite very consistent
performance. So I guess you could focus on what's driving that success and what gives you the confidence in above
market growth going forward? And I had a quick follow-up.
<A - Bryan Hanson>: Yes, I appreciate the question. Yes. I feel pretty confident. You've got to first kind of reconcile
though the fourth quarter. It was very strong for Surgical Solutions, but we did have some portfolio moves in that. If
you pull that out, we are more in the 7% growth range organically, which is still very strong versus market. And we
have noticed a little extra effort by our chief competitor, but we have a lot of confidence in our plan as well. So I feel
that we can continue with that above market growth. We've got strong momentum, as you've already referenced. We
have what I believe to be very-differentiated technologies, both in Advanced Stapling as well as Advanced Energy, and
we continue to launch products in both of those areas.
As a matter of fact, if I look across the Surgical business, somewhere in the neighborhood of 30 products that we're
going to launch in FY 2016 and that will drive somewhere in the neighborhood of $60 million to $70 million of
revenue just in those products launched in FY 2016. So the momentum is there. We're not getting lackadaisical on our
approach though just because we've been winning. We're very intent in launching products that matter and executing
flawlessly when we do.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Okay. And then, Omar, I guess for you, you've been very focused on this three-pronged
strategy and I guess as I think about certain business lines within Patient Monitoring & Recovery, they seem a little less
strategic or perhaps not fitting with every piece of your strategy. Do you see these businesses as kind of important to
the Medtronic strategy? And can you comment on sort of the likelihood of targeted divestitures now that you've got the
deal at least closed?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Look, the way we look at these businesses, is first, are they in line with our mission or not?
And second, if they are, and in this situation, the way we define that is that these businesses collectively impact patient
outcomes through alleviating pain, restoring health or extending life. Second thing we look at is, is there room to
improve that further? Is there a technology capability there that can help us drive the outcomes, better outcomes in a
more meaningful way? Then we look at is the market space attractive? Can we grow it? And is our team capable of
delivering?
And then finally, we look at that in combination with everything else that we have from a broad value-based healthcare
perspective. So we're going to have to let this thing play out. We're just beginning to put this new structure together
with that kind of thinking in the business groups. And then over time, we'll evaluate what fits or not. We are constantly
looking at our overall portfolio, and we do divestitures of certain items that we feel does not fit into that overall

give us a sense as to what you expect for 2016 global free cash flow? And then maybe also an update on the percentage
of that free cash flow that you think you'll have access to. I think from some of your slides recently, you suggested
between $7 billion and $7.5 billion of free cash flow in 2016 but just wanted to confirm that.
<A - Gary L. Ellis>: No, I mean I think the free cash flow, if you just take and even use our fourth quarter free cash
flow here of $1.7 billion and kind of talk – we'll use that and annualize that, you're kind of more in that $6.8 billion to
$7 billion range, is kind of what we've been talking about overall. Now, the reality is, however, foreign exchange has a
big impact on that free cash flow also. And so if you just looked at kind of our annual rate overall, that's kind of where
we'd be at, and then you have – as back to Omar's point earlier, you have some synergies coming into play, the constant
value capture synergies benefited. But FX is going to be a headwind on cash flow also. So my guess is right now our
numbers are probably – clearly with based on FX rates are clearly below $7 billion, probably closer to between $6.5
billion and $7 billion with all the moving parts that are going on just because of foreign exchange.
And as we indicated, we do think right now that based on those rates, we're probably going to be closer to somewhere
around 60% of that cash is accessible in the FY 2016 timeframe would be our current assumption based on the numbers
that we see rolling in. And that's why our 50% commitment to return cash to shareholders, obviously we have much
more flexibility around that, with that 60% kind of mix that we're expecting at this point.
The other thing that's going on, Bob, that's all based on kind of what I would call on an operating basis, including the
FX piece. The other, there obviously are still some one-time items that do affect cash flow. That free cash flow I just
talked about is really coming from our operating results, and then that's what we based all of our assumptions on, but I
do have to think about the fact that there are going to be – so there will be some additional restructuring, things like
that, and capital investments that we're going to have to make as we go forward with Covidien acquisition.
So that's all taken into account as we kind of think through our overall free cash flow here for the current year, but in
general, I would use right now – I think it's less than the $7 billion that we've previously kind of been talking about.
You're probably down more in the $6.5 billion to $7 billion just based on what's going on with foreign exchange.
<Q - Robert Adam Hopkins>: Great. That's very helpful. Thank you. And then one also for Omar, now that you've
had Covidien for obviously just a few months but would love to hear your updated thoughts on ways that you think you
can leverage that acquisition beyond just the cost synergies. And I'm thinking specifically about M&A and leveraging
your access to your global cash flow and leveraging your low tax rate. And so, just wanted to kind of get an update on
ways that you think you can really leverage this Covidien transaction and the degree to which that helps you with an
M&A strategy going forward?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Well, the first thing is that beyond the cost synergies, I just want to remind you that there are
two very specific areas that we've called out in drug-coated balloons and in Neurovascular where we're getting

immediate benefit and we expect some growth acceleration as a result of that. Beyond that, we've begun to explore at a
pretty much grassroots level with engineers, sort of other opportunities where we can leverage each other's
technologies.
Now from an M&A perspective, which is using that access to that extra – using the extra access we have to that cash,
we've stated that we're going to look at Early Technologies in the U.S. primarily where there may be opportunities
which we haven't been able to participate in to the degree that we'd like to, to create a long-term technology pipeline of
early-stage technologies that we think can make a difference. We've begun to look at it. We've actually already in the
ENT area, for example, we've already kind of executed on some of these, and we've got a good pipeline of other
activities that we're looking at closely.
But beyond that, the Covidien or the MITG business has had a history of doing acquisitions to supplement their
business with regularity, and we'll certainly continue to encourage that process and in fact, focus it even more
according to the way in which we've organized the overall business. So the M&A activity from us certainly from a
technology perspective is very sort of close to what we're focusing on. Bigger deals, obviously, opportunistically, we'll
look at it, but that's a matter of our overall financial bandwidth and our management bandwidth, so that's the way in
which we're approaching this.
<Q - Robert Adam Hopkins>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Gary L. Ellis>: Thank you, Bob.

Our next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor of Barclays.
<Q - Matt C. Taylor>: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask one about your emerging markets
strategy, you talked a little bit about some partnerships there that you're pursuing and some things you're doing to try to
get the growth rate higher. I guess I was just curious to see whether you've changed your views on what that growth
could be sustainably and whether or not Covidien integrated into the Medtronic structure could help you to grow faster
in EM?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Well, a number of points. First of all, our confidence and our belief and really surety, if you
like, in the long-term opportunity in emerging markets, is completely unchanged, and we're not at all wavering on that.
That's just a matter of fact. The way in which we approach that market to tap into that opportunity, particularly in the
short-term, actually has been more complex and more difficult than we first envisaged, and so the growth rate has been
slower than what certainly we had originally thought. I think having said that, there is certainly, fairly respectable
double digit growth that we can expect reliably, but we want that to get higher. And we're looking at methods through
which we can – we're continually actually looking at methods through which we can do that sooner rather than later.
And as we are learning, channel optimization is a key factor, partnerships with governments is a key factor and finally,
referral chain development is something that we need to approach with far greater scale than we've had before. These
are all important factors. As far as Covidien goes, there are a number of things that make us optimistic that this
combination will help us. One, there is a complementary strength in certain markets in the Middle East and Latin
America where between Covidien and Medtronic we've got complementary strengths. As a result, we now have our
emerging market profile diversified between China, Middle East and Africa and Latin America as the big three kind of
centers within the emerging markets while previously on a standalone Medtronic basis, it was primarily China.
So that gives us a level of diversity in these markets that we didn't have. And finally, as we've talked about before,
simply the scale that we now have will allow us to penetrate more geographies much more efficiently then we could
before and just adding more sales teams around the world either in underpenetrated regions within countries or in brand
new countries we'll have to contribute. So we haven't pieced all that stuff together yet, and we're in the process of

prioritizing some of those investments, and again, we're trying to accelerate the growth profile in emerging markets
with actually a pretty great sense of urgency.
<Q - Matt C. Taylor>: Thanks for that. And then I guess just on your synergies, you talked about at least $850
million, I think in the past you referenced some opportunities to further that number through some network
consolidation in your plans. When do you think you'll be in a position to give us a quantifiable update on what you
think the synergies could be between the two companies in combination?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: I think a number of things. First of all as we go forward, this is going to reflect in our overall
productivity. I think that's the best way to do it, although we will keep track of our value capture efforts through very
detailed and granular programs. I think at some point, new efforts that are results of the combination versus efforts that
were already in place that get accelerated it gets very kind of mixed up, and so instead of trying to divide those things
up, we're going to sort of commit to certain levels of productivity that we get out of different line items in our P&L.
And that's the way to do it. We feel good about a long-term productivity that we can get out of this, that the value
capture, the synergy sort of effort is going to eventually morph into a long-term productivity benefit extending way
beyond the three years that we've projected. I think that's the correct way to look at it, that this becomes the
productivity engine of significant magnitude that we didn't have before and to some extent, we're pretty excited about
it.
<A - Jeff Warren>: Thanks, Matt. Needless to say, we've gone past the top of the hour but we'll take two last
questions.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo.
<Q - Lawrence H. Biegelsen>: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a strong quarter. Hey,
Gary, one clarification, it's still not clear to me. Is the R&D tax credit assumed in the guidance or not assumed?
<A - Gary L. Ellis>: On the tax rate, it's assumed in the guidance, Larry, but what we're saying is it will probably be
towards the higher end of the range until the credit is approved, but assuming it is approved, then we would be in that
range.
<Q - Lawrence H. Biegelsen>: Okay...
<A - Gary L. Ellis>: Basically it is assumed in there, yes.
<Q - Lawrence H. Biegelsen>: All right. And then for my real questions, first, Gary, the guidance, just bear with me
on some numbers here, the guidance implies constant currency EPS growth of about 5.6% to 10% and your sales
guidance is about 5% to 7.5% if you include the extra week so therefore the EPS guidance at the low end of the range
doesn't imply any leverage. Another way of looking at it, the EPS guidance is applying the 4% to 6% underlying sales
growth adding the benefit of the extra week and then adding the 200 basis points to 400 basis points of EPS leverage,
that gets you to 7% to 11.5% constant currency EPS growth, and as I said, you're guiding to constant currency EPS
growth of 5.6% to 10%. So sorry for the long-winded question, but just curious to know why the EPS guidance appears
conservative? And I just have one product question. Thanks.
<A - Gary L. Ellis>: Well, I can't go through all the numbers you just laid out, Larry, because I don't have those in my
mind. Let me look at it from the way – you're right, our revenue growth overall as we indicated is the mid-single digit
growth, plus the 1% to 1.5% related to the extra week. So just taking the midpoint of the range of 5%, you're seeing
somewhere around 6%, 6.5% revenue growth. What we indicated on the comments overall from the operating margin
perspective as we looked at it, we know from the standpoint of what we're driving there as far as the 100 basis points of
improvement on the operating margin as we go forward, we're driving about 400 basis points of leverage in the
operating income line on an operational basis before foreign exchange.

Page 17 of 18
And so the point is, yes, we are getting that 400 basis points of leverage that we talked about in the calculation. That
offset that's negatively impacted by foreign exchange and so it's all going to get back. Foreign exchange is offsetting
the majority of the overall operating leverage that we've talked about and that we're trying to drive towards. So the rest
of the numbers get a little bit more difficult as we think about the number of shares that have been issued and the
various tax rates that are going on between the various years as we go forward, but, no, the guidance is kind of in line
with what we were expecting from an overall standpoint of earnings per share growing.
Again, as we've talked about, that 200 basis points to 400 basis points faster than the revenue and – but unfortunately
with $0.40 to $0.50 of FX hit, you take the $4.30 to $4.40 and add $0.40 to $0.50 to that, I think you're going to get to
the point that it is on a constant currency basis, is significant leverage over and above the revenue growth.
<Q - Lawrence H. Biegelsen>: Okay. That's helpful. And then on Reveal LINQ, for Mike, it's annualizing now at
about $500 million. It seems like Q4 was very strong with over 20% sequential growth. So where are you in the
adoption of that product? And how should we think about the growth maybe in the near-term and perhaps the next three
years to five years? And do you see any headwinds from either new competition or reimbursement pressure? Thanks
for taking the questions.
<A - Michael J. Coyle>: So on LINQ overall, you have to think about it in terms of its three indications for use, so
syncope, cryptogenic stroke and atrial fibrillation. On the syncope side, we're probably in the low 20%-s to mid-20%-s
penetrated, 20%, and again, I'm just talking about the U.S. and Europe because that really is the only place currently
where it's generating the very significant revenues and we're still building up reimbursement in other places around the
world. In cryptogenic stroke, it's more like 5% penetrated and then when you look at atrial fibrillation it's more like 1%
to 2% penetrated. So there's plenty of growth opportunity left obviously in the product.
Now we don't expect competitors looking who have basic capabilities in electronics are going to look at this and ignore
it so we expect at some point we're going to see competitors but frankly we haven't seen anything yet. I think we're now
at a point as we look at our five-year plan where we think this will be $1 billion contributor to the overall company in
terms of just its diagnostic sales.
And as Omar pointed out, when you look at syncope patients, you put one of these devices in, roughly 8% to 9% of
those patients will wind up with a pacemaker within a year and by the time you get up to year three, it's more like 20%.
So it is really the source of the Low Power growth that we have seen in the United States in terms of growth in units.
So we think it's an important product line in terms of what it does for us on product sales but it also provides us now
with service revenue opportunity longer-term to monitor patients and so we'll be updating that as our plans develop.
<Q - Lawrence H. Biegelsen>: Thank you.
<A - Jeff Warren>: Thanks, Larry. And time for one last question.
Operator
Our final question will come from the line of Bruce Nudell of Credit Suisse.
<Q>: Hey, guys, this is [ph] Matt (1:14:48) in for Bruce. Thanks for taking the questions. First for Mike, just in your
press release you highlighted TAVI growth of 50% worldwide, 30% in the U.S. which implies pretty significant growth
ex U.S. 60% year-over-year I think a $30 million step-up according to our math. So are our numbers reasonably correct
and can you give us any color kind of on what drove the gains there? Was there any stocking or destocking ahead of or
with the launch of the new sizes or anything else there?
<A - Michael J. Coyle>: Just to be clear, the 30% number is the heart valve therapies number, so it's a combination of
our Transcatheter Valve and surgical valve. So actually, the TAVI growth in the United States is faster than the
international growth.
<Q>: Okay. That makes sense, so can you give us any color on kind of how those split out?

Page 18 of 18
<A - Michael J. Coyle>: So our growth in overall was about 50% and in the U.S. we almost doubled our revenues in
TAVI during the quarter on a year-over-year basis. So U.S. is considerably faster in terms of its overall growth.
<Q>: Okay. That's helpful. And then just one follow-up on the leadless pacer launch, you talked about this summer,
can you talk about when you'll have reimbursement in place and sort of when you expect that product to be fully
launched and do you see that more of a source of unit share gains or is the opportunity there for you more in premium
pricing?
<A - Michael J. Coyle>: So first I just did want to finish up, that we don't do any meaningful stocking of Transcatheter
Valves in the U.S., just to finish your first question. On the transcutaneous pacing product line, obviously we're talking
about OUS now, Europe with the CE Mark that we now have, and there is no separate reimbursement in the sense of
this product line obtaining different reimbursement in Europe.
So it basically is being targeted at a specific set of patients who might be at risk for infection and single chamber
patient population, although we do see an opportunity to see a mix shift toward more single chamber pacing because of
the benefit this product line offers in terms of a lower expected complication rate, so we think it's an important
breakthrough, but you'll see us be very deliberate in the rollout of this product. It requires very different implant
technique than what a standard pacemaker has, and so you will see us doing very significant training and education as
we roll this out, and that will gate some of the speed with which it grows.
<Q>: Okay. Thank you.
Omar S. Ishrak
Okay. Thanks, everyone, and thanks to all of you for those great questions. And with that, on behalf of our entire
management team, thank you again for your continued support and interest in Medtronic. We look forward to updating
you on our progress on our Q1 call which we anticipate holding on September, the 3rd. Thank you, and have a great
day.
