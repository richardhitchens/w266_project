MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning, and welcome to the Xerox Corporation Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Release Conference Call hosted
by Ursula Burns, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. She is joined by Leslie Varon, Vice President
and Interim Chief Financial Officer. During this call, Xerox executives will refer to slides that are available on the web
at www.xerox.com/investor. At the request of Xerox Corporation, today's conference call is being recorded. Other
recording and/or rebroadcasting of this call are prohibited without the expressed permission of Xerox.
After the presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] During this conference call,
Xerox executives will make comments that contain forward-looking statements, which by their nature, address matters
that are in the future and are uncertain. Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed
herein. At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Ms. Burns. Ms. Burns, you may begin.
Ursula M. Burns
Good morning, thank you for joining our call. Today we are announcing significant actions that will define the next
chapter of our company. We'll spend much of the call today discussing our plans to separate into two strong,
independent, market-leading companies. We'll also discuss the multi-year strategic transformation program announced
today. And of course, we'll discuss our fourth quarter and full-year 2015 results and 2016 guidance. Let me begin with
our plan to dramatically change the way that we generate shareholder value.
Today we announced that the comprehensive structural review begun in October has been completed. The review has
been a top priority for our board of directors and the executive team. We engaged outside advisors including
independent advisors to the board in this process. It was a robust assessment of options for the company's portfolio and
capital allocation that would best position the company to maximize shareholder value. It became clear through this
analysis as the benefits of separation outweighed the benefits of maintaining the current structure. The board

unanimously agreed that the optimal path forward for Xerox is to become two market-leading focused publicly traded
companies.
We are confident this is the highest value creating opportunity for our shareholders, for our clients and employees.
These companies will both be significant, Fortune 500 scale companies and leaders in their markets; one comprising
our Business Process Outsourcing business, the other our Document Technology. And Document Outsourcing
businesses Document Technology with 2015 revenue of $11 billion will continue to lead the Document management
and Document Outsourcing market leveraging its superior technology, solutions and innovation capabilities. BPO with
2015 revenue of $7 billion and already a leader in a growing market will continue to pursue growth opportunities by
capitalizing on its deep industry expertise, market-leading automation solutions and track record of global delivery
excellence. I will discuss unique strengths, top line financial profiles, and growth opportunities of the two companies in
more detail shortly.
But first, let me talk about the compelling rationale that exists behind the decision to separate these companies. We
have two strong businesses, each facing different market and client realities. Document Technology faces modest
secular declines in its markets, while BPO participates in a growing but rapidly evolving market. The businesses have
distinct operating models and cash flow characteristics and very different growth drivers and competition. The
Document Technology business is one in which operational discipline and a commitment to transformative productivity
is vital to sustaining quality and managing costs in an increasingly interconnected digital world. Doing that right creates
strong profitability and cash flow that can be returned to shareholders and invested in selected growth opportunities.
BPO, on the other hand, needs to be highly adaptive, able to innovate and adopt technology quickly and shift its
portfolio to address the fast-changing needs of its clients. We're seeing how new technologies like
Software-as-a-Service and robotic process automation are changing the way that services are delivered. Additionally,
clients are requiring deep analytics for operational insight and greater personalization. The BPO market is growing at a
greater than 5% rate, and the majority of the revenue streams are recurring. Based on this, we concluded that these
businesses would be stronger and able to create more value for shareholders, clients and employees as independent
companies.
We're creating two companies that will be market leaders, benefiting from enhanced strategic and operational focus,
distinct and clear financial profiles, and capital allocation policies and simplified organization structures. As standalone
companies, they will have compelling investment cases, and be better positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities
and expand margins and market share. We see the BPO company as one focused on revenue growth, margin expansion
and disciplined investments in attractive growing markets. Document Technology will leverage its track record of
market leadership and strong cash flow generation through a sustained and investment grade rating and shareholder
friendly capital allocation plan.
Now, let's look more closely at each company. The Document Technology company will be the global leader in a $90
billion document management and document outsourcing market, with a presence in approximately 180 countries. We
have a broad portfolio of products and are the equipment revenue market share leader. Our Managed Print Services
offerings are widely recognized as best of breed by customers and industry analysts. Despite secular decline in the
printing industry, our Document Technology business remains highly profitable, with annuity-driven revenue
representing more than 70% of our sales. Through relentless cost discipline, this business generates strong and
consistent cash flows that allow us to make strategic investments to penetrate higher growth markets such as aqueous
inkjet, high-end color printing, managed print services and workflow.
BPO is a leading enterprise for the next generation of business process outsourcing with $7 billion in revenues. In this
business, we enjoy the number two position in market share in an industry that is expanding by more than 5% annually.
We're advantaged with differentiated capabilities that help clients improve their flow of work. We bring expertise in
managing transaction-intensive business processes, and are applying new innovations to automation solutions. We have
market-leading positions in healthcare, transportation, public sector, and a range of other industries. Our high recurring
revenue and high renewal rates reinforce our confidence in our ability to grow market share and expand margins going
forward. We are very excited about the opportunities ahead of us for these two businesses. With increased strategic

focus, we can capitalize on their unique strengths and capture the value creation opportunities that we see in each of
them.
In conjunction with the separation announcement, we have also launched a strategic transformation program targeting
incremental savings of $600 million over three years. This brings our total cumulative savings target to $2.4 billion
during this period, which includes ongoing productivity initiatives. In 2016, we expect a total of $700 million in
annualized savings. The plan is company-wide and will include a thorough review of how we work and how we
operate. Bottom line, we're not only optimizing our portfolio and capital structure, we're also driving a strategic
transformation. This will improve our competitive position and help expand margins in both our businesses during the
separation process and beyond. Our employees will benefit from working for industry leaders with streamlined
structures and fast decision-making.
The companies will have greater flexibility to align employee incentives and rewards to business performance. For
clients, each company will maintain its leading service delivery and innovation excellence, but will be able to more
quickly respond to market forces and client needs through focus and agility. And for investors, focused companies with
optimized capital structures and capital allocation policies to present distinct and compelling investment cases and will
be well-positioned to deliver value.
Let me spend a moment on the separation process itself. We are committed to executing the strategic actions
seamlessly in the shortest possible timeframe. The separation is expected to be completed by the end of 2016, subject to
customary conditions. We expect that the transaction to be U.S. Federal tax-free for our shareholders. During the
process we will remain focused on our clients, partners, suppliers and employees and delivering strong financial results.
There are, of course, a series of key milestones that we will need to achieve in the upcoming months to complete the
transaction. We'll keep you updated on our progress. And, as you read this morning, Xerox entered into an agreement
with Carl Icahn, related to the governance of the BPO company, following the planned separation. Details are included
in the 8-K that we filed today.
Now, let me make a few brief comments on the fourth quarter before turning it over to Leslie for a detailed results
discussion. We delivered strong performance in the face of challenging market conditions. Highlights were: revenue of
$4.7 billion in the quarter, down 5% in constant currency year-over-year; annuity revenue was 83% of total revenue;
adjusted EPS of $0.32 above our expectation and $0.27 on a GAAP basis; sequential increase in operating margin to
9.2%; strong cash flow generation of $878 million in the quarter, and $1.6 billion for the full year. The changes we
have made to the Services' operating model are beginning to pay off as demonstrated by sequential margin
improvement and double-digit year-over-year signings growth.
Document Technology was the industry leader for the 24th consecutive quarter, and through focus on performance and
productivity maintained its strong margins. Over the course of 2015, we returned $1.6 billion to shareholders in the
form of $1.3 billion in share buybacks and over $300 million in dividends. We have increased our annual dividends by
11% to $0.31 per share, the highest level since 2000, beginning with a dividend payable April 2016. Leslie will discuss
our 2016 guidance and some changes that we will make in our reporting. We expect 2016 to be a strong year for Xerox,
as well as a foundational year for the two companies.
Now, I'll turn it over to Leslie.
Leslie F. Varon
Thanks, Ursula, and good morning everyone. I'll start by walking through our results and then covering 2016 guidance
before handing it back to Ursula to wrap up. In summary, we delivered solid results in quarter four. Services came in
above our expectations driven by good sequential margin improvement. Document Technology revenue was weaker
than anticipated, primarily driven by lower supply sales, but margin remained in the middle of our range reflecting our
ongoing cost discipline and business model flexibility. Q4 cash flow as anticipated was seasonally strong and drove
$1.6 billion of full-year operating cash flow resulting in a healthy ending cash balance of $1.4 billion. During the year
we returned a substantial amount of cash to our shareholders with $1.3 billion in share repurchases and $326 million in

dividends.
Turning to the earnings slide, I'll walk through the income statement. Revenue in the quarter was down 8% to the actual
currency and 5% to constant currency. Currency cost us approximately $150 million on the top line. Services' top line
was flat at constant currency helped by solid 3% growth in Document Outsourcing, offsetting a 2% decline in BPO.
Document Technology declined 10% at constant currency, and drove the overall revenue decline. I'll speak more about
the drivers when I review the segments. Gross margin of 31.3% was down 80 basis points year-over-year, but up 40
basis points sequentially. Sequential improvement was driven by Services, while the year-over-year decline was by
driven by Document Technology, as well as a greater mix of Services which carries a lower gross margin.
RD&E was lower by $5 million year-over-year and SAG was down $59 million or 6%. Good expense reductions in
absolute terms but not sufficient to offset revenue declines, so operating margin of 9.2% was down 120 basis points
year-over-year, and operating profit declined 18%. Adjusted other net expense was down year-over-year driven by
lower restructuring costs as anticipated in our quarter four guidance. Equity income was $32 million in the quarter,
down $9 million year-over-year reflecting lower profits in Fuji Xerox, driven in part by the continued negative impact
of translation currency. Our quarter four adjusted tax rate of 21% was below our guidance of 25% to 27%, benefiting
our earnings by about $0.02 and reflecting the impact of recent U.S. tax legislation that extends R&D tax credits.
Bottom line, despite the revenue headwinds, we delivered solid Q4 adjusted earnings of $0.32. Moving on to our
Services results, while many of the headwinds we have highlighted in the past continue, the benefits of the new
operating model are beginning to be realized. Services revenue declined 3% and was flat at constant currency,
consistent with both Q3 and full-year performance. BPO was down 2% as a result of lower new contract ramp from
softer signings in earlier quarters, and our decision last quarter to reduce our financial risk and not fully complete the
Health Enterprise Medicaid platform implementations in Montana and California. Good growth continues in Document
Outsourcing, up 3%, driven by strong Xerox partner print services growth, as well as equipment revenue growth in the
enterprise accounts following continued good signings.
In terms of the opportunity ahead, total signings in the quarter were up 26% year-over-year and 8% for the trailing 12
months. New business signings were up 22% year-over-year in quarter four. This really strong growth includes the
Florida Tolling contract. We're pleased to close on this contract and begin implementing a comprehensive tolling
solution that leverages our best-in-class proven vector tolling platform. Excluding the Florida contract, new business
signings were up 10% in quarter four, so a very good signings quarter. Our renewal rate in the quarter was 78%, below
our 85% to 90% target range, and reflects in part one larger lost renewal opportunity, which would have been
financially unattractive.
Services segment margin was 9.4%, down 40 basis points year-over-year, but up 130 basis points sequentially, and
above our 9% Q4 margin expectation. The set of Services' decisions and actions we implemented last year are
beginning to deliver better results. We recognize that we still have work to do. First, to continue to grow signings and
translate that into revenue growth. Second, to improve our business mix with a greater proportion of our revenue from
higher value offerings. And finally, to capture additional efficiencies, including streamlining and automating more of
our delivery capabilities.
I'll now turn to Document Technology. Revenue in the quarter was down 10% at constant currency with the additional
quarter four weakness coming from lower U.S. supply sales, driven in large part by channel dynamics. For the full year,
revenue was down 8%, below our initial 2015 expectation of a mid single-digit decline. The largest driver was the
developing markets' weakness throughout the year. The Document Technology revenue decline is almost halved when
the growth from Document Outsourcing is included along with Document Technology. Activity in the quarter was
mixed, with good growth in a number of color segments, partially offset by the lapping of prior year product launches
in areas such as entry production color.
Overall, 2015 was a lighter product introduction year, and we look forward to more launches in 2016, starting this
quarter with a broad office product refresh, followed by a number of exciting production printing announcements we'll
be making at drupa, the printing trade show, which occurs every four years in Germany. Document Technology margin
of 11.8% was in line with our full-year guidance of 11% to 13%. Ongoing disciplined cost base management and the

flexibility of our business model were able to partially offset the higher revenue decline, negative mix from lower
supplies, and higher pension expense.
Moving to cash flow, we had a strong close to the year for operating cash flow, and a very good full-year for free cash
flow, which was $1.3 billion. This enables us to continue to invest in select growth opportunities and return value to
shareholders through repurchases and dividends. Cash from operations was $878 million in the quarter and $1.6 billion
for the year, in line with our full-year guidance. Q4 cash generation was roughly flat to the prior year, and reflected
higher working capital contribution, higher discretionary pension contributions, and normal, strong quarter four
seasonality.
Invest cash flows were $19 million use, with $80 million spent on CapEx and $9 million on acquisitions, partially
offset by proceeds from surplus property sales. Cash flow from financing was a $278 million use, including debt
reduction of $199 million and $77 million for preferred and common stock dividends. Our cash balance at the end of
quarter four was $1.4 billion, providing us with flexibility as we enter 2016.
Turning to our capital structure, we ended quarter four with $7.4 billion in debt, a $200 million reduction in the fourth
quarter, and a $374 million reduction for the year, consistent with our expectations. Applying 7:1 leverage on customer
financing assets, our allocated financing debt at the end of quarter four was $3.9 billion, leaving core debt of $3.5
billion. We continue to manage our capital structure to maintain credit metrics consistent with our investment grade
credit rating.
Turning to capital allocation, 2015 was another year of strong capital returns to shareholders. We repurchased $1.3
billion in shares resulting in an almost 10% reduction in shares outstanding. We also delivered $326 million in
dividends, which included a 12% per share increase [ph] to its (21:40) common stock dividend. Over four years, we've
almost doubled our common stock dividend when including the 11% increase we announced today. So in total, we
returned over $1.6 billion to our shareholders, greater than free cash flow of $1.3 billion, with the incremental capital
coming from part of the IPO sale proceeds.
We are steadfast in our commitment to return capital to shareholders and be good stewards, and we have a strong track
record to back up that commitment having returned greater than 50% of free cash flow to shareholders each year over
the past five years. For 2016, we plan once again to deploy greater than 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders
through dividends and share repurchase, while balancing our need to manage our debt to a level which is consistent
with our investment grade credit rating. We also intend to support our longer term growth objectives and plan to invest
$100 million to $400 million on acquisitions, with a focus continuing to be on expanding our capabilities in attractive
markets.
Before reviewing our 2016 guidance, I'd like to highlight a few reporting changes we'll be making beginning this year.
These changes will bring our reporting and guidance practices more in line with our peers. I'll briefly summarize the
changes and note that we have a full explanation on slide 25 in the appendix. We'll exclude three additional items from
adjusted earnings to give a clearer picture of underlying operating performance. These items include restructuring
expenses, certain retirement-related costs and transaction costs from the planned separation and strategic
transformation. Retirement-related costs will also be adjusted out of our segment results, and we are moving the student
loan business that we are running off from the Services segment to the Other segment.
Finally, starting in 2016, we will include developing markets within our constant currency calculations to give a truer
picture of our constant currency revenue performance. We have additional information on these reporting changes in
the appendix, including revised results for 2015 that will provide a comparable basis for 2016. Moving to our 2016
guidance on this basis, we anticipate full-year constant currency revenue to decline 2% to 4% with flat to 3% growth in
Services, more than offset by declines of 5% to 7% in Document Technology. At January 15th spot rate, we anticipate
a negative currency impact on revenue of 1% to 2% for the full year, with a higher impact in the first half than the
second half.
Considering the uncertain macro environment, we don't expect our revenue to deviate substantially from trend, but we
do expect modest improvement in both segments as we move through the year and lap the onset of some headwinds in

both Document Technology and Services. We expect Document Technology margin to be roughly in line with 2015.
That's within a 12% to 14% range, excluding retirement-related costs. We expect Services margin to improve and be in
a range of 8% to 9.5%. Adjusted earnings guidance of $1.10 to $1.20 represents a 3% to 12% growth from 2015.
Finally, we expect to generate operating cash flow of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion, and invest $300 million in CapEx,
yielding $1 billion to $1.2 billion in free cash flow. This guidance is below 2015 cash flow, as it includes settlement
outflows associated with our decision last quarter to not fully complete the Health Enterprise Medicaid platform
implementations in Montana and California, as well as a higher than normal level of restructuring as we implement our
strategic transformation program. Transaction-related costs associated with the separation are still being estimated and
aren't yet reflected in our cash flow or GAAP earnings guidance. For quarter one, we expect adjusted earnings per share
between $0.21 and $0.24.
So to summarize for quarter one and full-year 2016, we have set achievable objectives that reflect; first, improvement
in the business tied to the actions and investments we've made over the past year; second, prudent expectations, given
economic uncertainties and headwinds; and finally, continued investment in the business and implementation of the
first year of strategic transformation activities that will further prepare the Document Technology and BPO businesses
to be strong, standalone companies.
With that, I'll hand it back to Ursula to wrap up.
Ursula M. Burns
Thanks, Leslie. Let me recap and reinforce a few key points. First, this is an executive team committed to enhancing
value for Xerox's shareholders. And with the support of our board, we are taking bold steps to do that by separating into
two companies and undertaking a transformative productivity and efficiency program. Second, the plan to separate into
two strong, independent companies is a right step forward for Xerox, as each company will benefit from enhanced
focus, a lower cost structure, and an appropriate capital structure.
Each will have the resources and focus needed to capitalize on unique growth opportunities, and an operating model
and cash flow characteristics to create value and thrive in its sector. Finally, we are fully committed to becoming a
much leaner and more efficient organization, both at Xerox in 2016 and continuing on at the two companies in the
years after. These efforts will dramatically improve the way that we do business.
Thank you for joining us today. Our efforts to transform Xerox are underway, and we look forward to communicating
our progress in the coming months. With that, let me turn things over to Jennifer, who will open it up for questions.
Jennifer Horsley
Thanks, Ursula. Before we get to your questions, Ursula and Leslie, let me point out that we have several supplemental
slides at the end of our deck which provide more financial detail to support today's presentation and complement our
prepared remarks. For the Q&A, I would ask participants to limit follow-on and multi-part questions so we can get to
everyone. At the end of our Q&A session, I will turn it back to Ursula for closing comments.

<A - George K. F. Tong>: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Ursula, can you provide some examples of how splitting the
business can improve execution and drive better Services results?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Hey, George, and thanks for the question. I think that there are probably three areas that I can
refer to, and there will be a mix between both Services and the Technology business, not only in Services, I'm sure. The
investment profile that we have been making and will need to continue to make is to invest more in automation of our
Services delivery infrastructure. Those investment needs, obviously, compete with other investment needs in our Tech
business, and we would be able to actually focus those investments more, pointedly more, much more. It's a big focus
of ours. And as the market has changed, we've realized that we have to make more investments there, automation,
cloud-based services, service-as-a-service offerings, et cetera.
Second is on talent. Interestingly, this is both businesses. The dynamics of these two businesses, one grows, one doesn't
grow that much, one throws off a lot more cash, the other one doesn't. Actually at the leadership level, we'll be able to
actually have more refined incentive structures around leadership of these two companies that align very well towards
their dynamics and their growth profiles. And the third is around how we operate outside of the United States. It's one
of the areas that we put a lot of energy in, in our Services business trying to actually piggyback on the infrastructure of
our Tech business. That was probably one of the most difficult areas for us to break into. And now, we'll be able to
interestingly enough focus back our Tech business on taking care of the tech sector, and be very selective in how we
expand further outside the United States in our BPO business. Those are three areas of difference.
<A - Jennifer Horsley>: Operator, next question.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Shannon Cross of Cross Research. Your line is now open.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Thank you. I have one question on the quarter, and then one question on the transaction or
what you're doing. The first is just on the quarter. Can you talk a little bit about the lower supply sales and how we
think about that? Was that sort of distributors or was that usage? What was sort of in there, and how are you thinking
about supplies and usage as we go through 2016? And then I had a follow up. Thanks.
<A - Leslie F. Varon>: Sure, Shannon. So let me start first of all by reminding everyone that unbundled supplies in
Xerox represent just 20% of our Document Technology revenues, different from many of our competitors because we
sell so much of our supplies as part of the bundled contract. With regard to the lower supply sales in quarter four, it was
in the U.S. and had to do with reseller stocking levels. So what we saw in quarter four was a lower level of stocking at
the reseller level than we had in the year ago period. And that typically reflects some combination of the following
factors; lower-end customer demand given the fact that we've had weaker equipment sales through that segment earlier
this year; reseller cash management and the level of competitive discounts that resellers choose to take advantage of
versus the price discounts on the Xerox level. So it was unusually weak for us in quarter four. We do expect better
performance in quarter one and going forward, but we expect supplies revenue will continue to be pressured given the
lower level of A4 equipment sales. Did you have another question, Shannon?
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Can you hear me? Hello?
<A - Leslie F. Varon>: Yes.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Okay. Yes. If you could just sort of help us walk through, if we think about a $1 of earnings
for Xerox right now, and then we split it, and we obviously know the margin differential, and you've given guidance in
that between the two businesses. But can you sort of help us walk through on the other line item where you think things
will kind of play out? I mean, I'm getting sort of $0.70 to printing and $0.30 to BPO, I mean, that's very much a squishy
number. But just any color you can give us on that. And then also from a cash flow perspective, how we should think
about how cash flow has come from the two businesses because we kind of know what they were like in 2009, but if
we can get an idea of sort of how you're thinking about it now, that would be really helpful. Thanks.

<A - Leslie F. Varon>: Yeah. So Shannon, I'll start by saying that more of these details will become clear as we go
through the process to separate during the year. So I won't give you specific answers now, but I will remind you that
the margin in the Document Technology segment is higher than the margin in the Services segment, and the margin in
the Document Outsourcing portion of the Services segment is above the segment average, which means BPO is
obviously below. So that should give you some sense as to the profiles of the margins in the two businesses going
forward. With regard to cash flow, I think you know, that the Document Technology business and the Document
Outsourcing businesses are very cash-generative businesses, and the BPO business is less cash-generative, and is more
in an investment and a ramp-up growth mode.
<A - Jennifer Horsley>: Thanks, Shannon. Operator, next question.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Essex of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
<Q - Brian L. Essex>: Hi, good morning and thank you for taking the question. I was wondering if you give us a little
bit more detail on the process that you went through, how these decisions were made. And then if you could follow up
with the management structure that you anticipate as you walk through the transition process including what we can
expect at the very top leadership level, current Presidents like Bob Zapfel and Jeff and how they're going to fit in. As
well as, on the CFO search side and how you anticipate staffing the financial side of the business.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Three good questions. Let me start with the process. In October – actually before October,
but in October we spoke to you about undertaking a review, a structural review that was focused on our portfolio of
offerings and our capital allocation structure and process. That was in full swing by the end of October and included
our board, the entire management team, and our board of directors and some advisors that we had from the outside.
And the intention there was to take a look at not only our internal business, but as importantly, the markets, the trends
in the markets, the trends in segments of the markets that we are highly invested in, healthcare, transportation, these
areas.
Very contemplative, steeped in facts and data, and just a very good bottoms-up process. That process lasted until just
recently ended, actually. We made the decision in the middle of January to separate into two companies and to do a
separation. So that was it. We had no external process pressure on that, which has been reported a lot in the news.
Actually, it was not engaged at all in the decision-making process, and so I'm pleased with that. We came up with this
decision based on market trends, based on our strengths and weaknesses, based on the performance that we had in these
two businesses based on the current dynamics and thinking by shareholders, by our customers, et cetera. Shareholders,
meaning how they value allocation methodologies.
As far as management goes, one of the things, I'll start with me, I've gotten this a lot. One of the things that was
removed from the process early as we went into this, that I did with the board was to move me out of this discussion.
The decision about whether or not we split into two companies or what process we take on a go-forward basis can't be
based on an individual or with any worry about an individual. So literally, I said, let us go through this kind of agnostic
of individual and let's manage it from a process standpoint. Good news is that we did that, I have a great relationship
with the board. I'll make some recommendations to the board and my future will be contemplated as part of those
recommendations. I am both confident and solid in that.
And in the next year, by the way, we have to spend a lot of time doing three things; one is taking $600 million, $700
million annualized, I mean, cost out of the business. We have to split the company into two and we have to deliver the
2016 plan, not small activities. As far as Services leadership, if there's one thing that we will change from a structural
standpoint today, that we know today, even though it's not implemented today is that the Services leadership will come
from the outside. But I want to make sure that we're clear. We have a – the BPO leadership will come from the outside.
I have a President that runs the Services business today. He's a very valued member of our company, does a good job.
We expect, I hope that he continues to operate in the business on a go-forward basis, but the new CEO of the company
will come from the outside.

CFO, we put the CFO on the back burner. We didn't totally stop it, but we'll put the search on the back burner as we
went into the structural review. This is a place where we will have strong internal candidates as well as some external
candidates. It's just a good process to go through that, and we will have one and then eventually two CFOs as we go
forward, and I'm pretty comfortable with that process as well. I think I got all of the questions answered, I hope.
<A - Jennifer Horsley>: Great. Thanks, Brian. Operator, next question.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Matt Cabral of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
<Q - Matthew N. Cabral>: Yeah. Thank you. So on the Document Technology business, now that you'll have a more
focused printing company as one of the two entities going forward, can you talk about your views on the opportunities
for consolidation in the market, and if Xerox would like to participate in any of that consolidation going forward?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Most of our focus in this area has been on distribution consolidation, and we're still actively
pursuing that type of activity. We found that our brand is strong and our offers are very strong, and we'll just have to
get more people carrying them to the market, so that will be our primary focus from an acquisition standpoint. That was
one part of the question. What was the second part? I'm sorry.
<A - Leslie F. Varon>: I think that – I'll just highlight a couple of additional things, Matt. On the distribution side, as
Ursula said, we have been adding to the portfolio of businesses in the Global Imaging suite inside of Xerox. And
Global Imaging was an acquisition we did in 2007. It's been extraordinarily successful, and had a very, very successful
2015. In addition to that, we continue to pursue opportunities to expand our offerings in Document Technology, which
includes the acquisition we did of Impika a few years ago in order to position us more strongly up in the high-end of
inkjets. So we see further opportunities in those kinds of areas.
<Q - Matthew N. Cabral>: Great. Very good. Thank you.
<A - Jennifer Horsley>: Great. Thanks, Matt. Operator, next questions.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Ananda Baruah of Brean Capital. Your line is now open.
<Q - Ananda P. Baruah>: Hi guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I appreciate it. Ursula, we just sort
of just love to get what your initial view is, current view is on how you guys would view, I guess, sort of the value
pitch, like really what's the pitch to investors or will it be for the for the Doc. Tech. company given the revenue growth
profile, margins are really solid, cash flow is awesome, obviously. But as investors begin to develop themselves a view
of the Doc. Tech. company standalone as an investable asset, how would you like for them to think about it given the
constant currency revenue growth profile of the company? And then, just sort of a sub-question to that, and this will be
it for me, anything that you can talk about that could be additive over time to the revenue growth profile would be at
least philosophically useful as well. Thanks.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Right. So I'll start with the service – with the BPO company and then get into the DocTech.
company. BPO company, think about nimble expanses; so growing. A really keen focus on operational expertise and
flexibility, and a capital structure and allocation policy that's aligned towards investing for growth. Technology
business is market leader, cash generative, and having a capital allocation strategy that is focused on returning a high
proportion of that capital to shareholders. It will likely – it will have to be investment grade. We're going to push hard
for that to be the case. I mean, invest and make sure that we set up the company that way because it has a financing
business that's captured, as you know, and will benefit from new investment grade rating.

And not look at the top line in total. You have to look at the top line in sub-pieces. We'll be able to have a better
explanation and more discussion about that as we separate the companies, meaning that we'll start speaking more about
the graphic communications business and what happens underneath there, and how it is transforming and how we are
leading that transformation, how our Document Outsourcing business is growing, focused and how we're leading the
transformations there. So a little bit more focus on the dynamics underneath the business that will help to sell both of
these companies – the differences are on both of these companies.
<A - Leslie F. Varon>: If, Ananda, I could just put a point on a couple of things that Ursula said specifically to
DocTech. because I think the growth opportunities on the BPO side are clear. If you step back and look at the DocTech.
market, it's a $90 billion market. When we combine the Document Outsourcing growth with the DocTech. segment,
what you will see is that our performance was essentially down 4% at constant currency in 2015. So it is clearly under
pressure, but certainly the developing markets' economies were under pressure big time in 2015 as well. So I would call
it modest decline. And as Ursula said, with important pockets of opportunity, both in Document Outsourcing, as well
as, for example, in graphic communications. So this is an area where we believe that a more focused business will be
able to make selective investments in attractive growth markets and improve the performance on the top line.
<A - Jennifer Horsley>: Thanks, Ananda. Operator, next question.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Keith Bachman of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
<Q - Keith Frances Bachman>: Thank you very much. I feel like I'm always following Ananda's question. I wanted
to ask you two questions. I agree with the characterization that the Services business, or the BPO parts of the service
business, is probably not congruent or leveraging the core printer business. With that said, I'm not sure anything has
really changed. I'm curious what you really learned. In other words, why did you buy it? And then secondarily, part of
the strategy over the last couple of years within the broader context of Services has been M&A, and I think Xerox has
not been able to generate the growth through inorganic means within the M&A side of Services. Is that a pricing issue
or a structural issue? What's the process? And as you're going through the separation this year, will you have the ability
to go ahead to engage in M&A, even as you're trying to go through the separation? Thank you.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Yeah. So let me take both of those, and it will be a little bit of a conversational tone. Let's
start with the M&A piece. We have acquired in the first couple of years of our M&A journey about $350 million worth
of assets for couple of years in a row. In last two years we have not been able to generate that same level of
performance. We were always shooting for more. By the way, it's not not seeing opportunities. The good news is that
we do see some. But we do have very specific requirements and high hurdles for accepting an M&A deal.
I don't expect that those hurdles will go away at all. So we are guiding down, as you can see, $100 million to $400
million in M&A because we do have, as I said, a high hurdle. I think we'll be able to get somewhere in the middle of
that range, maybe to the high end if we're a little bit lucky there. So no strategic change in M&A, no strategic change in
our desire to acquire a little bit narrow when we talked about being a little bit less diversified in our offers.
Definitely focusing on commercial healthcare, definitely focusing on transportation and those assets, are focusing a
little bit in two areas and maybe others in going internationally. But, I don't think that there's a big change. We're not
having a big change in our strategy for M&A, and we're going to keep trying. As I keep saying, I have money to spend.
I'm hoping that we can actually use it more frequently than we have in the past.
As far as what has changed, seven years ago – I said this a little bit earlier, seven years in business is like seven years in
dog years. A lot has changed in seven years. The healthcare market has changed, not only in how healthcare is
provisioned and paid for, which has a big impact on us, but in the provider areas, how much consolidation there has
been, literally buying and selling of very large companies. So our customer set has changed. International markets have
slowed pretty significantly, and the dollar has strengthened pretty significantly.

There have been a lot of shifts in technology, and et cetera. So there a lot of things have changed in the markets around
us, and all that has done, they haven't changed the fundamentals of the two businesses, but it has made it very, very
clear that fitness and focus is at a premium right now. And that's where we've chosen to make our investments; fitness
and focus. I need to invest a little bit more in our Services business, particularly as the shifts are happening in there, in
as-a-Service and Process Automation, et cetera. And we have to be very pointed in our focus in our Document
Technology and make sure that we continue to drive efficiency through that value chain, et cetera. So we didn't look
back, we didn't spend a lot of time in our analysis looking back to what we did seven years ago. We spent all of our
time looking forward, and we're very confident in our decision on a go-forward basis.
<A - Jennifer Horsley>: Thanks, Keith. Operator, next question.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
<Q - Tien-tsin Huang>: Hey, great. Thanks for all this detail. Long-term and short-term question. I guess the
short-term one, just the incremental savings from the restructuring that you're announcing, how much of that will we
see that's incremental in 2016? Is that net of any cost dis-synergies we might see from the separation? And then, just a
longer term question on the BPO front. When you're talking about 5% industry growth, do you think, when you did
your long-term study on the strategic review for that asset, do you think that the current business mix can get to a 5%
growth rate with greater focus and whatnot, or do you see that potentially a big shift in the business mix to get there?
Thanks.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Let me start with the second question, then do the first part of the first question, and then
Leslie will take over. Second question, we haven't really looked at the specific growth rate and whether we can get to
5%. But I can tell you one thing, and that's that we can grow higher, faster than we're growing today, there's no doubt
about that. Particularly as we remix our portfolio, we're heavily mixed towards customer care. That business, by the
way, we can actually grow that business a little bit faster than we're growing it today. But, that business doesn't have a
margin profile that we actually want to expand too much further. So we are being very selective in how we go forward
in customer care, and picking our customer care accounts and engagements that actually are broader than what we
would call bare customer care.
In the rest of the business lines, transportation for sure, and commercial healthcare, and even government healthcare,
the core portion of it are growing at rates that can support a 5% rate. But we have to do some portfolio mixing to make
sure that we can actually – and mixing and timing to make sure that we can get there over time. And you'll hear more
about it as we do even deeper work in the separation process and looking at the BPO business. As far as – I just want to
also transition to this $2.4 billion, and make sure that we're clear about what we're doing here. Normally, in Xerox – so
every year in Xerox, we do a fair amount, as you know, of restructuring and remixing of how we spend money. We get
some productivity benefits from our vendors, and we get the rest of the productivity benefits from us. This $2.4 billion
is foundational in three basic parts; one, we'll get some of it from our normal interactions with our suppliers to make
sure they actually drive some of their productivity and give that to us. We think that will be about $1 billion over the
three years, plus or minus, give or take some.
We also get, naturally, every year, a level of productivity from both our Tech and Services business foundational. And
what we're explaining and what we're doing with this transformation is taking that first part and the second part and
adding on top of it a $600 million additional savings program, and we're doing that by focusing or changing how we
work. This is not – and it's a big deal. We're kind of readying ourselves for the markets in the future and the business in
the future, and trying to actually shift out – take out an additional $600 million as we go forward. And I'll have Leslie
go through some of the – little bit more line item here.
<A - Leslie F. Varon>: Yeah. So Tien-tsin, just to come back and clarify a couple of things. When Ursula was talking
about customer care, it is clearly our objective to expand the customer care margin. It is not our objective to increase
the proportion of customer care business inside of our BPO business. So we certainly want to grow customer care. We

want to grow the other higher value offers more quickly so that we can drive the BPO margin up.
With regard to cost transformation, we save about – we capture about $600 million a year, which is roughly 4% to 5%
kind of annual productivity. In addition to that, in 2016 we're expecting an annualized savings from the transformation
program of about $100 million, and that will be captured from a variety of focus areas, things like the structure of the
organization so we can start the two separated companies lean, which will include both layers of management as well
as support functions and infrastructure. It will include labor productivity and taking advantage of automation and
changing how we deliver services to our customers. So our expectation is that we will invest about $200 million in
restructuring this year in 2016. And since we will be doing the transformation throughout the year we're really just
starting, we expect the savings that we generate in 2016 will be probably around $50 million from the strategic – from
year one of that incremental program.
<A - Jennifer Horsley>: Thanks, Tien-tsin. Operator, I think we have time for one last question.
Operator
Thank you. And our question will come from Jim Suva of Citi. Your line is now open.
<Q - James Dickey Suva>: Thank you, and congratulations. It seems like you definitely have done a lot of work, and a
lot of work ahead. I have two questions, one fundamental operations, and other the one on the separation. The first is on
the fundamental operations. Did I hear correctly the renewal rate was around 78%? I believe that seems a little bit
normal. Was there any cause behind that, or is there something we should be aware of? And then on the separation, the
$2.4 billion, I believe that's all about the savings. The question I have is, have you identified the amount of costs
associated with the separation? Like do you need an additional ERP system or human resource systems, or are things
actually already run right now on two different systems, and just wondering if there's separation costs, or if the $2.4
billion in savings is net of those costs. Thank you, and again, congratulations on all the news.
<A - Leslie F. Varon>: So Jim, thanks so much for the questions. Let me start with renewal rate, and then I'll talk
about dis-synergies. So you're right, that the renewal rate was light in quarter four, and it was at 78%, although for the
year the renewal rate was up 3 points to 84%. There was one large renewal in the quarter that would have been
unattractive for us, and therefore we walked away. With regard to dis-synergies, we haven't yet spoken about
dis-synergies. But in some of the areas that you're poking at, there has not been a whole lot of integration in, for
instance, IT, between the ACF acquisition back then and the legacy Xerox. So we'll talk more about dis-synergies as
we go forward, but we certainly expect the benefits of the separation and inclusive of the strategic transformation to
more than offset any of the dis-synergies.
Ursula M. Burns
So thank you for joining us and for your questions. I have a couple of things to close on. First, we are creating two
strong market-leading companies positioned to capture unique industry opportunities and maximize value. Each
company will have resources that are appropriate and focused to capitalize on growth opportunities in their markets.
We're going to leverage each company's distinct growth profile, operating model, cash flow, characteristics, et cetera.
And very importantly, during this year of 2016, it's about delivering 2016, we're really focused on that. We closed 2015
well, and I wanted to make sure we carry that into 2016. And we'll keep you up-to-date on how we're progressing as we
speak to you throughout the year.
Operator

all disconnect. Have great day, everyone.
