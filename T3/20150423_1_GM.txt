In the room today, we also have Chuck Stevens, Executive Vice President and CFO; Tom Timko, Vice President,
Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; and Niharika Ramdev, Vice President, Finance and Treasurer, to assist in
answering your questions.
Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mary Barra.
Mary T. Barra
[audio gap] (2:02) appreciate everybody being on the call today. I mean, if I step back and look at our Q1, it was very
solid performance. It was in line with our expectations, and we are on track to achieve our 2015 commitments. Really,
if I look at the first quarter, it was another example of doing what we say we're going to do. Our revenue was $35.7
billion, our consolidated EBIT adjusted was $2.1 billion; our earnings per share adjusted was $0.86, and for the first
time, we've shared our ROIC, and over the last four quarters, it's nearly 20% despite the impact of recall.
Finally, our adjusted automotive free cash flow was in line with our previous guidance and it was an outflow of $1.7
billion due to three reasons; first, an extra supplier payment; two, restructuring payments, primarily, Bochum; and then
recall-related payments that drove the $1.7 billion outflow.
Also, important to note is, immediately, we have started the share repurchasing after we made the announcement on
March 9. And so through yesterday, we have actually repurchased 20 million shares for about $750 million. And as an
addition to the stock repurchases, we've also returned about $5 million to our owners through the dividends in the first
quarter. So, again, it has been a solid start to the year and, we believe, provides a very firm foundation for our 2015
commitments to improve our EBIT adjusted and also to improve our EBIT adjusted margins versus 2014.
If I could just provide a few comments as we go through the world and look at company performance, let's start with
North America. First, our demand for the full-size pickups and SUVs remained very robust. The strong demand for the
pickups, full-size SUVs and our midsize trucks helped GMNA achieve its seventh consecutive quarter of
year-over-year EBIT margin improvement.
We also shared some very significant products. In New York, we revealed the Malibu, the Spark, and the CT6, and
we've gotten very good response on all three of these products; the Malibu, Spark, again, very important segments for
us in the car segment. And then with the CT6, it's very important as it represents a lot of our advanced technology and
specifically our material strategy for structures to optimize mass but improve performance. So, these are very important
vehicles that will play a significant role in helping achieve our targets, not only for 2015 but for 2016. And they are a
part of it. We have more significant launches that we'll be revealing throughout the year.
If I look at China, the industry does remain strong. And we expect the auto industry in China to grow about 6% to 8%
in 2015. As expected, our results in Q1 were impacted by product changeover and launch costs. The product that we're
launching is the Buick Excelle and the Chevrolet Sail 3, and also the Buick Envision. And we also launched a new
plant. The Buick Excelle is built in our new Wuling plant, and this plant will have an annual capacity of 240,000 units.
So, again, very important launches that will fuel our results through the rest of the year.
In Europe, we had improved year-over-year performance, and we reduced our losses despite the headwinds in the
Russian market. So, our total European sales were up 3.1% versus the industry growth of 2.8%, and we improved share
in 11 European markets. The demand for the Corsa is very strong and we are seeing the variable profit improvement
that we talked about before we launched this car; so, again, very good reception in the marketplace for the Corsa.
In South America, it remained challenging given the macroeconomic conditions especially in Brazil and Venezuela.
The company is taking several aggressive actions across all aspects of the business to make sure that we continue to be
able to meet our goal.
And in GM International, we demonstrated year-over-year performance improvement. We're narrowing the loss. In the
first quarter, it was roughly $100 million. And these are the results of several actions we've taken in the countries that
make up GMI. And finally, GM Financial continues to grow its captive presence among GM [ph] details (6:32) and has

successfully rolled out the lease capability and exclusivity with the Buick, GMC, Cadillac and Chevrolet dealers.
Finally, as you are aware, the company provided details of the disciplined capital allocation framework. And I hope
you see that the actions that we've taken to change our business model in Russia, the restructuring announcements that
we talked about in Thailand and Indonesia, demonstrate that we are going to continue to make decisions that allow us
to allocate capital to generate the right returns for our owners.
So, if I look at the remainder of 2015, clearly, we expect to remain robust, year-over-year improvement in EBIT
adjusted and our margins in North America. We are on plan to achieve the 10% EBIT adjusted margins for 2016.
In Europe, with the improved year-over-year performance expected to continue, we are on a path for profitability next
year. And in China, as I already mentioned, we expect results to improve. When we look at the new products that we
invested in, in this first quarter and the new plant, we'll continue to see an expansion in Cadillac, and then, the launch
costs and the changeover costs that we incurred will be behind us.
In GMI, we improved the top line performance and are benefiting from the restructuring, and we expect to breakeven in
performance this year, excluding restructuring.
And finally, in South America, the environment is more challenging and has changed rapidly in this first quarter. But as
I mentioned, we are taking aggressive actions to mitigate this and we expect to improve our profitability, so we are not
changing our guidance for South America at this time. We also are reaffirming our guidance for adjusted automotive
free cash flow, which is expected to be flat to slightly up compared to 2014.
So, if we look across the business, we are on track to achieve not only our 2015, but our 2016 financial commitments.
In 2015, that is to improve our EBIT adjusted and our margins versus 2014. And in 2016, it's North America
EBIT-adjusted margins of 10%, getting Europe to profitability, and sustaining strong margins in China.
So, with that, I'd like to turn it back to Randy, and we can open it up for questions.
Randy C. Arickx
Okay, operator, we're ready when you are.
Q&A
Operator
Okay. [Operator Instructions] And your first question will come from Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Rod A. Lache>: Good morning, everybody. Can you hear me?
<A - Mary T. Barra>: Yes. Hi, Rod.
<Q - Rod A. Lache>: Hi. Couple of questions; first, in North America, I'm hoping you can give us a little bit more
color on your pricing expectations, kind of at a high level. Obviously, you're going to start comping against the strong
pricing from the trucks right now. So, it looks like the tough pricing on the 700,000 cars or 800,000 cars and small
crossovers that you sell is starting to come through. You did say in your comments that you think that's going to
improve as the cars get renewed. A skeptic would say that improvements in passenger car pricing from new products
really – this won't last very long because the segment's overcapacitized and facing currency advantaged competitors.
Do you see something different there that makes you feel like that could be sustainably improved once the products
launch?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yes, Rod, let me talk about Q1 pricing first from a North American perspective and make
sure there's some clarity around the $600 million headwind. First, that's primarily passenger cars. Clearly, the carryover
pricing includes whatever carryover pricing impact there was from full-size trucks and SUVs, but that's relatively

marginal. About 1/3 of that $600 million is retail-related, and it's primarily related to the passenger cars that we're
going to be launching or replacing here over the next 12 months to 18 months. About 2/3 of that $600 million is
fleet-specific and warrants a bit of explanation.
We're in a unique situation where we had a significant volume of past model vehicles going to the auction in the first
quarter of 2015, up about 50,000 units versus the first quarter of 2014. And this was really caused by recall events,
where we prioritized customer repairs over fleet, resulting in carrying inventory longer. So, we had past model vehicles
that we carried longer into the cycle, and clearly, as auction values drop, the longer you go in a model year, that had an
impact. Our expectation is that we're going to cycle out of this in the first half of the year.
Talking about the year in total, we still expect pricing on retail overall to be relatively flat for the year. Carryover
pricing headwinds will be offset by new major launches later in the year. And a portion of that, obviously, will be the
impact of our next-generation products, like the Malibu that we're going to be launching.
On the bigger question that you asked on, do we expect pricing to be able to hold on new model launches? We have
one proof point so far, and that's the Corsa in Europe, as an example, where we said the next-generation because it's a
significantly better vehicle than the one it replaced, would generate incremental profitability. And thus far, that's
holding.
When you look at the next-generation Malibu, you've got a larger car than the one that it's replacing. You've got a car
that weighs 300 pounds less and drives significantly higher fuel economy. And our expectation is, for that car and
others, as we roll over the Chevrolet portfolio, that we will be able to hold that price when we have clearly
segment-leading vehicles that we're launching into the market.
<Q - Rod A. Lache>: The content costs; they are starting to turn positive here. Does that start to moderate when these
new launches kick in? Is there a significant amount of additional content there?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Well, there will be more content on the next-generation vehicles. Based on our assessment,
we will be able to price to recover that. What you're seeing, especially in North America, but also globally, the material
performances on carryover models, we had $300 million in the first quarter. Run rate that for the rest of the year, that's
$1.2 billion globally. We're very much on track to that $2 billion of savings that we talked about in October and
January from a carryover material performance perspective.
<Q - Rod A. Lache>: Okay. And then, just two more; China, there've been quite a few reports about some softening
and deterioration in pricing in the luxury end; you're not really mentioning that. I was hoping you can comment there.
And then lastly, in Europe, last year, you took almost $700 million of restructuring. Assuming that that doesn't recur
and you get some savings from Bochum and from the new products, will they – do you think the year-over-year
improvement this year in Europe could be greater than that $700 million?
<A - Mary T. Barra>: So, first, on the China pricing question. I mean, it continues to be a very competitive pricing
environment across all markets. We just returned – we had the whole executive leadership team in China. We were at
the show. And I think you're seeing some very capable OEMs. So, we expect that to continue, and that's built into the
forecast in our plan, so not unexpected.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: And relative to Europe, as we've talked about before, yes, we expect to see improvement in
2015 versus 2014 on our path to breakeven. We indicated that it wouldn't be a straight line, that the biggest driver of
that improvement year-over-year would be the absence of restructuring, and I think you're seeing that play out in the
Q1 results, but that also we would have launch costs associated here in the first half of the year with the Corsa and then
in the back half of the year with the Astra. And that once we cycled through that and headed into 2016, you would see
the full benefit of the new Corsa and Astra, which represents about half the volume in Europe, really driving improved
profitability.
<Q - Rod A. Lache>: All right. Thank you.

All right. And your next question will come from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Mary T. Barra>: Good morning.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: Just a first question, Chuck, to follow up on the hit that you got from rental – the rental car
auction numbers here. It sounds like it was about $400 million. On an after-tax basis, that would be about $0.17 a share
if we just applied your tax rate and your share count. I mean, is that about right and that's in the ballpark and that's
something you might expect to reoccur in the second quarter but then not in the third quarter and fourth quarter? I'm
just trying to understand the magnitude of the impact to the bottom line, as well as the reoccurrence or lack thereof.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yes. I would say – first, I would start out by looking at overall North American results.
And in North America, in the first quarter, we generated $2.2 billion of profitability and 8.8% EBIT margins, which is,
again, the seventh straight quarter, up 110 basis points on a quarter-over-quarter basis versus the first quarter of last
year; so, clearly, on the path to 10% margins.
If you look at a specific driver of Q1 impact, clearly, the auction impacted our Q1 results. But in the overall framework
of North American results, it was offset elsewhere. Yes, we expect to cycle through this as we go through the second
quarter, would expect that magnitude of impact to be lower.
And then, finally, John, within – this was not an unexpected outcome from a North American perspective, as we
provided guidance for 2015 and looked at our business. But this is certainly an issue that we're factoring into our
outlook, which, once again, higher aggregate EBIT and higher margins in 2015 versus 2014.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: Okay. But if I'm doing my math correctly, absent that, your margin was about 10.4% in North
America, which is pretty strong and a little bit better than what you're even talking about getting to. Just kind of
backing that out, which it actually happened, so, it's tough to back it out, but...
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yes. That...
<Q - John J. Murphy>: ...the ongoing number looks pretty strong?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Certainly have a hard time arguing with your math on that one driver of the business for
sure.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: Okay. And then, just a second question, I just got back from Shanghai as well and we met
with SAIC as well as SVW, and they did highlight the risk to pricing. But they also highlighted the fact that you as well
as Volkswagen as well as most of the international players are pretty tight on capacity utilization. So, it just seems a
little bit curious that the pricing is getting pretty weak over there. So, just trying to understand, are you seeing the local
players becoming much more credible in the market and kind of creeping up and pressuring pricing? I just want to
understand where the pricing pressure is coming from with [ph] cap. ut. (18:18) it sounds like it's pretty tight.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yes. And looking at capacity utilization, it's kind of a tale of two different dynamics. One,
the foreign OEMs are running 90%-plus capacity utilization. The locals are running at about 70%. And I would suggest
that the capability from a local player – and you were there, so you saw it, it's certainly improving. But the pricing
dynamics that we've seen and that we're anticipating this year, negative 3%-plus net price on carryover, that's the same
dynamic that we saw last year and the year before. The market's slowing. There's a lot of competition. It's maturing.
Importantly, what we said, and recognizing that that was a headwind, was our launch strategy, more SUVs coming into
the market, Cadillac, and continued cost efficiency was going to offset those pricing headwinds and enable us to
maintain margins. And we're executing that. I'll give you an example, the Envision. And it has just been outstanding
performance since we launched that as well as the Chevrolet Trax, and as we look at crossovers and SUVs versus
passenger cars, they're more profitable by $1,000 a car to $1,500 a car.

So, I think the pricing dynamic is going to continue to be challenging. In China, we're planning around it being
challenging, but we're executing to the plan that's going to offset that.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: Okay. That's helpful. Then on free cash flow, negative $1.7 billion. I'm just curious though if
you can outline what the exact numbers are for the extra week of supplier payments? And then as we think about the
recall and restructuring cash used in the quarter, if you can just kind of delineate those three items for us just so we can
understand.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Sure. Yes. The extra payment cycle was worth roughly $1.9 billion, and that's a typical
cycle payment that we have. The recall and restructuring combined about $800 million, $400 million each for the year.
What we had talked about before was roughly $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion of recall-related cash, so we're kind of on run
rate for that as I think about the rest of the year and restructuring cash payments north of $1 billion for the year. And I
think as you run through the rest of the year, that will start to diminish as we cycle through in Bochum and some of the
other ones. But that's kind of broad strokes, John.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: So, horseshoes and hand grenades, it was basically more like a $1 billion positive free cash
flow quarter if you adjust for those numbers. That's just our numbers.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yes. If I looked at it on an apples-to-apples basis versus the first quarter of last year and
excluded some – the extra payment cycle and the restructuring and recall, I ended up with the same math you did.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: Okay. And then just lastly, the buyback, you guys are being reasonably aggressive in the
market and the pace seems to be a lot faster. It seems to be a bit faster than we would have expected. Is there any
potential that you'll blow through this buyback during the course of this year and we see an upsizing by the end of this
year or the beginning of next year?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Well, when we announced the initial share buyback, what we said was within the context
of the capital allocation framework, one, we wanted to get to our target cash balance of $20 billion as quickly and
prudently as possible.
And depending upon other contingencies, unknown issues that could result in an acceleration of our share, we like to
buy back the shares as quickly as possible, but I think you need to factor it into the $20 billion target cash level and
how other things develop.
We will monitor it, John, very closely on a month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter basis as we go through the year. And
another important point what we said was an initial $5 billion share buyback. So, depending on execution, we would
expect this to be the first tranche.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: And given what your shares are doing today, seems like it will be a great time to accelerate it.
But I appreciate the help. I appreciate the help, guys. Thank you.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: As soon as we exit the window period, perhaps.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.

The next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi.
<Q - Itay Michaeli>: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Mary T. Barra>: Good morning.
<Q - Itay Michaeli>: Just want to start with South America. Maybe a little bit more color on some of the actions you're
taking that give you confidence that you can still meet the full year plan. And then, secondly, on the FX hit for the
quarter, was that a balance sheet re-measurement? Just want to get a little bit more color on that FX impact.

Page 7 of 15
<A - Mary T. Barra>: Sure. If you look at South America, the team has moved very proactively. Looking at all
aspects of our cost structure, there'll be production cuts, and in line with that, we'll look at our labor costs. There's
already active programs going on as it relates to our salaried workforce, and the appropriate adjustments will be taken
from an hourly as well, and again very significantly. And then, I would say it's really a detailed approach of looking at
every single cost, a zero-based budget approach, looking at indirect purchasing initiatives where everything is
questioned. So, they have really gone to, I'd say, a very austerity approach.
The other element on the revenue side is to price as appropriate because even though the market has shrunk
dramatically, we still have a very strong portfolio, and are getting our share and a little bit higher share growth, it's just
the market is so much smaller. So, they're looking at every aspect and cost element of the business, building on what
they've done over the last two years.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: And on your foreign exchange question, Itay, which aspect are you asking about, the
impact on revenue or the EBIT bridge?
<Q - Itay Michaeli>: The $200 million EBIT, Chuck.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yes. Fundamentally, that's transaction exchange. And the biggest driver of that, the ruble in
Russia, the real in Brazil, and then, we have a won/euro interaction where the euro is weakening faster than the won
and we still import a certain number of vehicles into Europe. Largely, on the ruble and real side of it, we're trying to
offset that with price. That's why you saw that improved EBIT performance on a year-over-year basis. But that's
fundamentally where it's at.
<Q - Itay Michaeli>: Great. And then a question on the product cycle; one of the increasingly popular disclosures in
your 10-K is the variable profit by segment that highlights your cars, crossovers and trucks relative to the weighted
average, and I think it was about 40% for cars last year. If we think about the next couple of years, I mean, firstly, do
you have an early rough estimate of what that might be this year for cars and maybe where that was historically in the
last time you refreshed some of the small cars and midsize cars?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yes. We haven't changed our outlook on that, 160%, 100% and 40%. I believe 2010, 2011
timeframe, it was closer to 50%, 100%, 150%, as we went into that launch cadence of the current generation of
vehicles. I personally haven't looked at the dynamics associated with this as we go through the launch cycle, but I
would certainly expect those gaps to narrow on a go-forward basis based on our expectations on the next-generation
products. But clearly, trucks and full-size SUVs are always going to be most profitable, crossovers are going to be close
to the average, and passenger cars, on a relative basis, are going to be least profitable just because we have all the small
and compact vehicles in there.
<Q - Itay Michaeli>: Great. And then just I'd love to get an update too, Chuck, on raw material costs, we've seen steel
prices continue to come down. Any incremental benefit that you might see from raw materials this year, and at what
point, if raw mats stay where they are today, might you begin to lock in some savings for 2016?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yes. We expect right now, based on our view on raw materials for it to be relatively neutral
on a year-over-year basis, there's puts and takes. Steel, resins and other raw commodity prices are down. Aluminum,
some rare metal – rarer metals are up. And again, you have to look at what's indexed versus what's tied to specific
supply agreements. But broad strokes, I view that as relatively flat on a year-over-year basis. Relative to raw material, I
would say this, and we talked about it before, as we were looking at 2015 versus 2014, we thought commodity pricing
was going to be a headwind. Now, we view it as more neutral. And I've indicated that it's several $100 million, not

Your next question will come from the line of Michael Ward for Sterne Agee.
<Q - Michael Patrick Ward>: Good morning.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Hey, Mike.
<Q - Michael Patrick Ward>: Thank you for taking my question. Two questions; first on Russia, I think if you
include FX, it sounds like it accounted for about $100 million loss in the quarter. Can you talk a little bit about the
timing of the shutdown and when we might see some of those costs taken out of the pre-tax calculation?
And the second thing on GM Financial, I assume the equity line that we see now in the GM Financial results is from
the Chinese joint ventures. Is that joint venture in China similar to the automotive? Is it a self-funded joint venture and
it's an after-tax impact?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Okay. Yes, first on Russia. No, that was your math on the $100 million. I would suggest
out of the losses in Europe, there's a fairly significant Russian headwind in the first quarter. I'm not going to provide
specifics. But I would suggest as we go through the rest of the year, there's going to be some roll-through impact in Q2,
Q3 and Q4 on a diminishing basis as we wind that operation down and then we should get the benefit absent to those
losses in 2016. And on GMF, yes, that equity that's included in GMF is the joint venture now in China.
<Q - Michael Patrick Ward>: Okay. And is that a self-funded joint venture, or can they fund themselves?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yes. Well, it's a self-funded joint venture, and that is at least from the equity perspective
after-tax in China rolling in to our equity line in GMF.
<Q - Michael Patrick Ward>: Okay. And can we expect similar-type performance or expect it to grow as it gained
some share?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Well, our initial view is we would expect that to grow because the market is going to grow
and more and more people, as the market matures, are going to start financing vehicles. We're penetrating right now at
about 20% of SGM sales, and we would expect to see that grow over the years. So, that's certainly one of the strategic
initiatives that we have.
<Q - Michael Patrick Ward>: Thanks, Chuck. I appreciate it. Thanks, everybody.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Thanks, Mike.

Your next question will come from Matt Stover with SIG.
<Q - Matthew Stover>: Thank you very much for taking the question. First question is, is during the quarter you folks
announced that you're considering increasing capacity on SUVs in North America. I wondered if you could kind of
address two things in this, is one, what's the scope of the increase that you would envision? And number two, how do
you think about this internally increasing the capacity of the product and once you're getting such terrific yield, when
maybe in a longer-term perspective, the regulatory environment that could emerge, post-2020 might make that addition
excessive?
<A - Mary T. Barra>: Yes. So, when you look at the full-size truck capacity, I would say right now, our primary focus
is on breaking bottlenecks, not only in our plants but also in supplier plants to make sure that we're providing not only
the maximum capacity without installing any new brick-and-mortar because I think there's still a lot that we can do
there, but also get the mix to be exactly what customers are looking for.

And so, we have a very dedicated team that works on that. We've already made tremendous progress. And I know you
asked about full-size trucks; I will say though that in midsize trucks, we are – because of strong demand for both the
midsize truck and the vans, adding a third shift to Wentzville, again, focusing on what we can do without capital and
spending brick-and-mortar.
So, it's really a breaking bottleneck strategy and then the shift addition in Wentzville.
<Q - Matthew Stover>: What do you think you could add – 10% to the capacity of the facility?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Which facility? Are you talking about full-size pickup and...
<Q - Matthew Stover>: Full-size. Full-size.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: We're running pretty close to max line rate capacity. We've got opportunities from an
overtime perspective. And we will continue to look at efficiencies. Now, at a system level, we've got capacity to meet
demand from a truck standpoint, a 17 million-plus industry at a 12.5%, 12.6% segment share. So, I think we're in pretty
good shape overall. And same thing from a full-size SUV, a segment share that's running at 2.5% to 2.6% of industry.
And as Mary indicated, our intention is to not to add necessarily fixed capital investment like brick-and-mortar. It is
really to optimize where we can in the supply base and assembly. And by the way, that's what we've been doing over
the last number of years. No brick-and-mortar. We add shifts. We continue to drive line rate efficiencies, and we'll
continue to look at that as well.
<Q - Matthew Stover>: The second question is on international operations. Over the course of the last few years, you
guys have restructured Australia, and then this year, Thai and Indonesia. There's one more big operation there that
seems to need some fixing. I'm wondering if we should expect to see something in Korea in 2015 or 2016, or is that just
a put that's too long.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: We continue to work to optimize and drive efficiency in all of our operations. And Korea is
one where we have that opportunity on a go-forward basis. In the 2015 plan and in the restructuring that we talked
about already included in our plan is a small portion related to Korea on a variable separation program. And that's just
an ongoing activity we do there. But I would – certainly would not expect any significant restructuring in Korea in the
near-term.
<Q - Matthew Stover>: Okay. Thanks very much.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yes.

Your next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner with CLSA.
<Q - Emmanuel Rosner>: Hi. Good morning, everybody.
<A - Mary T. Barra>: Good morning.
<Q - Emmanuel Rosner>: I have a question on mix, both in China, as well as in North America, but starting with
China, a lot of the noise that's, I guess, coming out of China now is that a decent amount of the growth in demand
comes from the lower end, essentially, a recovery in demand at the cheaper or Chinese-made mini vans or small SUVs.
I wanted to know if you were seeing that in your numbers with Wuling outperforming, or the growth of Wuling, in
outperforming the rest of your brands, and if that constitutes a negative mix impact that we should look into.
And at the same time, I would like an update on how Cadillac, where you are in the rollouts there in terms of volume
numbers, and if that's offsetting some of the mix impact.
<A - Mary T. Barra>: So, let's start with China and especially, if you look at the lower end, what we've seen – first of
all, we have SGM Wuling. It's a very, very strong local competitor. And it has successfully shift from not only leading

in commercial vehicles, but also, the launching very successful passenger vehicles. We have the Baojun 730. It's a
MPV in the C-segment. And it's quickly becoming one of the best-selling models in its segment. And then, we have a
very important launch of the Baojun 560 SUV that is very competitive.
So, I think when you look at the lower end, our Wuling operations have successfully bridged to where the market is
going and looked out ahead of it and are participating in a leading position. So, that from a China perspective, I think, is
how we're seizing that opportunity.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yes. And overall, again, Cadillac, we expect to sell close to 100,000 units in Cadillac this
year, up significantly year-over-year in China. And that is part of the overall between the Baojun SUV launches, the
SGM SUV launches in Cadillac that we're going to drag much improved mix, which will offset the pricing headwinds
that we talked about before.
<Q - Emmanuel Rosner>: Okay. And then on the North American operations, excluding recall expense, essentially,
the biggest driver of year-over-year improvement seems to be the positive mix, which you attributed to full-size – I
guess to trucks, in general. When I look forward at your goals for 2016, how much – do you rely on mix sourcing just
as positive as it is now, or if the mix normalized or there was – the markets renormalizing or the competition heating up
in some of these full-size segments, would you still be able to achieve the mid-term goals?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Right. So, let's talk about Q1 mix for a second. Q1 mix on a year-over-year basis, very
robust and it's consistent with the EBIT bridge and how we talked about 2015 developing. Q1 specifically, very strong
full-size SUV mix, but remember, last year, we were launching the full-size SUV. So, we're at run rate now in Q1
versus Q1 last year. So, that's driving that big mix number. We expect mix to be favorable as we go through the year,
but certainly not at the same level as Q1.
Looking forward, into 2016, the biggest drivers from 2015 to 2016, number one, launching products in segments that
we had not historically competed in, like the midsize trucks, like Chevrolet Trax and other products that we haven't
announced yet, plus the improved passenger car profitability. So, we certainly don't anticipate the mix continuing to
improve.
And I think it's important also if you look year-over-year, ultimately from a volume perspective between full-size
trucks and full-size SUVs, they'll be up but not significantly up on a year-over-year basis. So, again, strong mix in the
first quarter, expect that to moderate as we go through the rest of the year. The real driver, catalyst for earnings
improvement from a product perspective will be products that we have not sold before plus the replacement of some of
our core Chevrolet portfolio.
<Q - Emmanuel Rosner>: Perfect. Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.
<Q - Ryan J. Brinkman>: Hi. Thanks for taking my call. You mentioned a 20% ROI hurdle as governing some of
your strategic actions in the recent years, presumably including Australia, Chevrolet Europe, Russia, Indonesia, et
cetera. Now, those are places where you're retrenching, right? So, I'm curious, relative to some of the very big
investments that you are making, like the $12 billion in Cadillac, the $16 billion in China, how do you think those
investments stack up in terms of returning potential?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yes. Let me talk about China first because it's easier. China is self-funded by the joint
venture, so we're not putting incremental capital in there. Obviously, that's absence of dividends we could be taking but
I would say that China earned significantly higher return on invested capital because they have very strong margins and
a relatively low invested capital base. So, I would suggest that that's very accretive from an overall perspective.
The $12 billion for Cadillac; that is a kitchen sink number from an investment perspective over the next number of
years. It's not just capital spend. The actual kind of North American or consolidated operations capital spend portion of

that's about 50% of the overall $12 billion or $6 billion relative to the product portfolio. And our expectations are that
we're going to drive better than 20% returns on Cadillac products as we should. They are more profitable than some of
our mainstream products.
<Q - Ryan J. Brinkman>: Okay. That's great to hear. And then just a couple of questions on your cost structure in the
United States; firstly, there was a study recently, I think, by the Center for Automotive Research, maybe you saw it,
that concluded GM had the highest hourly wages amongst Detroit-based manufacturers. They suggested one cause was
a lower percentage of Tier 2 workers. Is that consistent with your understanding?
And then secondly, a Ford executive recently commented that they would look to close this year their cost disadvantage
relative to Chrysler. Is that an objective and realistic objective of yours too, to get your costs in line with the
competition there?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: One, we are not the most expensive or the highest-cost OEM in the U.S. relative to an
average cost per hour, so – and that's based on Harbour Report data. Two, our objective, and it continues to be our
objective, is to continue to drive efficiency and drive our costs, employment costs closer to the overall competitive
benchmark. And we will work very, very closely with all the stakeholders including our UAW partners to try to close
that gap, but that's certainly our objective, and it hasn't changed within the overall constructive, maintaining or
improving our breakeven point in North America.
<A - Mary T. Barra>: And we've been very clear in all of our conversations that improving our competitiveness, is a
key item that we're going to be taking through all of the discussions as we get into negotiations.
<Q - Ryan J. Brinkman>: Great. Good to here there, too. And then just lastly, Sergio Marchionne commented
recently he was looking for a merger partner for Fiat Chrysler. And he mentioned your company, amongst a couple of
others as potentially being logical. I think the message from you though in recent years is that you don't need to merge
with anyone else, right? You need to merge with yourself and you don't want to distract from that. But I'm curious what
your latest thoughts are with regards to strategic partnerships or even more broadly the likelihood or need for
consolidation in this industry.
<A - Mary T. Barra>: So, specifically, about General Motors, again, I think, we've been very clear. We laid out a very
comprehensive plan that takes us through the early next decade with milestones next year and beyond. As we
communicated, we think there's tremendous opportunity for us within the business as we look at efficiency measures,
as we look at truly achieving the scale that we should have, because we're already in that top tier of the auto industry
among the largest OEMs. So, we have a very well articulated plan. We're in the middle of executing that and we're not
going to entertain anything that distracts us from accomplishing that. So, that is the way we look at it and that's how
we're executing.
If you look more broadly from an industry consolidation perspective, I mean, there are – the technologies that we need
to invest in, whether it's from a propulsion perspective, whether it's some of the new emerging technologies, as we look
at connectivity or even different business models as it relates to urban mobility, those are all – all require investments.
We have a plan well in place to accomplish and to be in front of the change that's going to occur in this industry over
the next five years to 10 years. We've already made several significant announcements as it relates to autonomous
specifically. And we're already leading from a connectivity perspective when you look at our deployment of 4G LTE in
the United States, which is now moving through Europe and through China, and we have more coming in those spaces,
as well.
So, I think there may be some need as other OEMs face the change that is happening. But again, we've got a very well
developed plan and we're 100% focused on execution.
<Q - Ryan J. Brinkman>: Perfect. Thanks so much.

Your next question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Joseph R. Spak>: Thanks, everyone. I guess in the past, you've talked about, as we go forward here and I think
it's embedded in your plan, having to add more and more content to your vehicles and that being a headwind. And I
guess just in light of some global competitors announcing a significantly lower cost of entry to features like active
safety, or in some case, even standardizing it. If you think that trend is happening quicker than you anticipated, if it's on
pace, and also, how you are going to respond competitively.
<A - Mary T. Barra>: Well, I think if you look at it, you have to look at every vehicle by segment and really
understand what the customer is looking for because I think the key is getting the right technology and function and
features on the vehicle by segment by market. And clearly, in the Shanghai 2015 Show that we were just at, there is a
lot more content being added, but you've got to look at the right content again for the segment.
But, I think, again, this is why it's so important that we continue to execute our strategy. As Chuck mentioned, we're on
track to the $2 billion goal from a material cost. I still think there's more opportunity as we continue to execute there.
Doing that allows us to then have the most efficient cost structure to be able to put the right features and functionality
on the vehicles, and that's our plan. So, we think we've got more opportunity in that area, and we'll continue to work at
it.
<Q - Joseph R. Spak>: Okay. So, I mean, are you surprised at all by [indiscernible] (45:30) pace that you see some
people have in content or it's sort of in line with what you guys were thinking?
<A - Mary T. Barra>: I mean, I think, overall, I'm not surprised by it. I mean, there's kind of two types of content.
There's the content that you have to add from a regulatory perspective, and then there's the features and functions that,
I'll say, create the customer delight and enthusiasm. And we have aggressive plans for both. I would say the one area
where it is moving very quickly is with the domestic OEMs in China. They saw that as being very significant, but
again, our SGMW Wuling is right in the middle of that and very much focused on the right content for the vehicles.
<Q - Joseph R. Spak>: Okay. And then, obviously, this – the TPP agreement has been in the news a lot, and I was
wondering if you were willing to sort of say what GM's stance is. Obviously, it's important for auto and whether if you
have any insight to just sort of how you think it plays out. Obviously, it sounds like maybe the Japanese are looking to
get some of the tariffs drop, but in return, maybe there's some language there about currency manipulation. So, any
color you could provide there would be helpful.
<A - Mary T. Barra>: Well, generally, General Motors has always – we believe in free trade, and I think our record
evidenced that. Again, as you look at this, the key is in the details, clearly, something that puts some controls from a
currency manipulation are important to us, and we'll continue to evaluate that and work productively to provide input,
because, generally, we're very supportive of free trade.
<Q - Joseph R. Spak>: Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.

Your next question will come from Brian Johnson with Barclays.
<Q - Brian Arthur Johnson>: Hi. I just want to follow up on some of your comments about kind of executing your
plan with a question around, plans are set, you execute sort of the long-term plans, but the market's evolving very
rapidly. So, I'd like to get a sense just as how you as a management team maybe are making midcourse corrections,
maybe specifically around three things that have changed even since the Investor Day. The first is the collapse in oil
prices and the impact on really weakening demand in the North American car market. You already talked about your
SUV adds.
Second, the deteriorating conditions in Russia. And third, how do you pay for the content cost particularly around
connected car where good news the take rates are accelerating faster than expected. Mixed news is some of the
competitors are beginning to price things like ADAS quite aggressively.

<A - Mary T. Barra>: I didn't hear your very last comment as you talked about competitors. I'm sorry.
<Q - Brian Arthur Johnson>: Competitors pricing ADAS aggressively. So, just things that might have been different
than when you – unless you had perfect foresight, than when you set out your plan.
<A - Mary T. Barra>: Right. But if you could just go through those three items, I think we've been very agile in
making sure we have the right full-size truck, full-size SUV, midsize truck, SUV capacity and capability to put those
products in the market and I think you're seeing us do that. So, we're going to respond and be opportunistic of what the
customer wants to buy. And I have been very aggressive in that space. So, I think we've demonstrated that we can
adjust there and we'll continue to do so.
As it relates to Russia, we took actions to change our business model in Russia, reacting to this situation and the point
that we were at, again, wanting to make sure we're staying true to our capital allocation framework and deploying
capital where we are committed to generating the return for our shareholders.
And then as it relates to content, I mean, especially if you look at – you mentioned connectivity. There's also revenue
opportunity associated with the connectivity, and I think we are just starting to scratch the surface as we look at
additional functions that can be accomplished now that we've got the pipe into the car and that ability to communicate.
And we have several initiatives of new features and functions that we're going to be putting that utilize that. So, I think
there's a revenue opportunity there.
And then finally, as it relates to the cost piece, again, I think with the plan we have this year for $2 billion in
performance, I think we still have more room to go. And that's a GM-specific opportunity that we truly leverage our
scale and have the right working relationship with our suppliers across the board, longer-term relationships and seize
those opportunities.
So, I would say – I don't know, Chuck, if you have anything to add to those three.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: No. And to the cost and continuing to drive efficiency, a few weeks ago, I was in New
York and talked about, across the broad dimensions of the business, where we will continue to focus. And clearly,
material and logistics is an opportunity that we talked about – Mary talked about. There are still opportunities to drive
productivity and efficiency in manufacturing.
And as I indicated, just our productivity on a year-over-year basis from a manufacturing perspective is worth $800
million a year or $900 million a year. We still are pursuing overhead cost reductions with Global Business Services,
our IT transformation, that will generate significant savings on a run rate basis.
And then to the opportunities with OnStar connected car, again, I said just as Mary did, that we are just scratching the
surface there. But even so, we had $350 million worth of improved profitability built into our plan based on what we
have taken advantage of so far, and I think there's significant upside to that as well.
<Q - Brian Arthur Johnson>: Just final question. Could you maybe drill down on that in terms of what's already been
realized with that $350 million? You had some categories in the slide deck, but kind of what's already really set in
place to collect versus what's going to require either partners in terms of revenue sharing from apps or a change in
consumer behavior to realize.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yes. I would like to avoid getting into the details of those specifics and that $350 million
improvement. Broad strokes, so, obviously, our agreement with AT&T and revenue sharing opportunities are one
avenue of improved earnings.
Number two is vehicle health, maintenance and diagnostics and how that can drive improved warranty and customer
satisfaction on a go-forward basis is another opportunity. And then, ultimately, the application framework and how you
deploy that on a business-to-business and business-to-consumer standpoint is another opportunity.
But as I said, we're just scratching the surface. There's opportunities to leverage GMF as we grow them to full captive
to link in better with our after-sales operations to drive service retention. So, significant opportunities that we're going

to continue to take advantage of.
<Q - Brian Arthur Johnson>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
And our final question will come from Dan Galves with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Daniel V. Galves>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. First one has to do with the new vehicle
architectures, which are really important to the outlook. You've already said that we'll have increased content, but you
expect a price for that. In terms of like-for-like material costs, how much savings can you achieve from globalizing
these architectures maybe from a material cost perspective or engineering savings?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Well, first, we're starting to see some of it roll through in last year and this year. Last year,
we generated roughly $1.2 billion of material cost performance on carryover; this year, $2 billion. Now what's captured
in carryover are recently launched products like the K2XX platform.
As we went forward, remember what we said about the Corsa and the Astra and the next-generation Malibu, and the
next-generation Cruise that we expected roughly one-third of the profit improvement in those vehicles on a variable
basis to be coming from material efficiency. And part of that is getting more scale and leverage bringing the suppliers
in early.
So, I believe that there is still significant opportunity on a go-forward basis as we execute our vehicle set strategy and
ultimately get down to a handful of global architectures, so, more to come on that. But I wouldn't – to size it, I wouldn't
be surprised if the number ultimately ends up being 2% to 3% of material cost on a run rate basis.
<Q - Daniel V. Galves>: Okay. Thanks. And then, I have two questions on North America. The first one has to do with
truck pricing. Some of the external groups that estimate pricing were reporting pretty large ATP increases on full-size
pickups and particularly the SUVs. Was there evidence in your year-over-year bridge of these increases? I guess was it
buried in the $200 million of retail negative or was this all due to mix or offset by content?
And then the second question relates to North America costs. I think in January, you said that overall costs would be up
in 2015 where fixed costs more than offsetting the material cost tailwinds. In Q1, you had a benefit of about $200
million from cost. How does that trend in the balance of 2015? Thank you.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yes, let's talk about general pricing from a full-size pickup, full-size SUV. What we talked
about and we're seeing play out versus a relatively aggressive environment in 2014 is a more moderate pricing
environment from a full-size pickup and a full-size – specific to full-size pickups. With that said, we have taken action
already. This year we have raised prices on full-size pickups and full-size SUVs as we look at the opportunities that are
being presented. I would expect on a go-forward basis that we would certainly look towards trying to hold some of that.
In other words, kind of the base price increases more than offsetting any increase in incentives. It's still a bit early in the
year. And we have to see how the market develops, but I'd say overall, the pricing environment is certainly more
constructive this year versus last year from a truck and SUV standpoint.
What was the second part of your question, Dan?
<Q - Daniel V. Galves>: Yes. Just on the costs. Between fixed costs in North America or structural costs in North
America and material costs, I think you said in January that, overall, cost would be up a bit. You had a tailwind in the
first quarter between those two items. Just wondering how that trends in the rest of 2015?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yes, well, I think the material performance is going to trend pretty close to our
performance in the first quarter of the year. For the rest of the year, from a kind of fixed cost perspective, our
expectation was that engineering in advance of the product launches and marketing, was going to be up on a
year-over-year basis. I would still expect that to play out. With that said, we continue to drive the efficiencies in the
other parts of the business from a fixed cost standpoint, overhead manufacturing. So, we'll have to see how that plays

out. But generally I would say we are very much in line with the guidance that we provided back in October and in
January.
<Q - Daniel V. Galves>: Okay, great. Thanks a lot for the color and for the new format of the call. Appreciate it.

Operator
Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Mary Barra.
Mary T. Barra
Thank you. So, I'll be brief here. But I think if you look at it, we had a very solid first quarter. We've got a strong
foundation to go through the rest of the year. We're going to continue to build on this positive momentum, and I'll
reiterate that we are on track to achieving our 2015 and our 2016 financial commitments. Also, you can see that we are
already executing the capital allocation framework, and we'll continue to do that, as Chuck said, month-by-month to
look at what is the right strategy recognizing some of the uncertainties and open items that still need to be resolved. But
we're on track.
And we will continue to look to maintain an investment grade balance sheet and the $20 billion balance and then invest
in profitable growth opportunities and then return value to our shareholders. So, we're continuing to execute our
strategies. So, look forward to talking to you at the end of Q2.
