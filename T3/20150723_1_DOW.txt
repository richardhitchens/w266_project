MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, and welcome to the Dow Chemical Company Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Results Conference Call.
[Operator Instructions] Also, today's call is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jack Broodo. Please go ahead, sir.
Jack Broodo
Good morning, and welcome everyone. This is Jack Broodo, Vice President of Investor Relations for Dow Chemical.

Some of our comments today include statements about our expectations for the future. Those expectations involve risk
and uncertainties. We cannot guarantee the accuracy of any forecast or estimates and we don't plan to update any
forward-looking statements during the quarter. If you would like more information on the risk involved in
forward-looking statements, please see our SEC filings.
In addition, some of our comments reference non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to the most directly
comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in our earnings release and on our
website. Unless otherwise specified, all comparisons presented today will be on a year-over-year basis. Sales
comparisons exclude divestitures in Hydrocarbons and Energy, EBITDA, EBITDA margins, return on capital, and
earnings comparisons exclude certain items.
Some of our comments may also contain statements about our announced agreement to separate a substantial portion of
our chlor-alkali and downstream derivatives business and merge it with a subsidiary of Olin Corporation. In connection
with that transaction, Dow and Olin have filed with the SEC that contains important information and we advise you to
read them. These filings are available free of charge from the SEC, or Dow, or Olin as applicable.
The agenda for today's call is on slide three, and I will now turn the call over to Howard Ungerleider.
Howard I. Ungerleider
Thank you, Jack, and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide four, simply put Dow delivered strong financial results
with year-over-year increases in operating EPS, EBITDA and EBITDA margin expansion all for the 11th quarter in a
row. Our business discipline and financial objectives remain firmly on track and are reflected in our performance.
Earnings per share rose 23% to $0.91 on an operating basis. Operating EBITDA increased to $2.5 billion, a record
second quarter for the company and driving first half EBITDA also to a record $4.9 billion.
Operating EBITDA margins expanded 396 basis points from the year-ago period to 19%. Sales declined 13%
year-over-year, primarily as a result of currency and the effects of lower oil price. However, on a sequential basis, sales
were up 4% as local price improved offset by currency, while volume grew 4%. Excluding the impact of divestitures on
a year-over-year basis, sales volume has increased for the past seven quarters.
Sequentially, we saw increasing demand across most geographic areas led by Greater China, the U.S., and Latin
America. Year-to-date, our cash from operations increased more than $700 million year-over-year, reaching $2.7
billion. And we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders so far this year.
Our performance over these last many quarters highlights the strength of our structurally hedged integrated portfolio.
The power of growing demand for our innovative products, which enable margin expansion in our targeted markets; the
benefit of our geographic footprint to capture demand where it is around the world; and the value of our integrated
low-cost positions and feedstock flexibility to overcome volatile crude oil pricing, all of which are enabling us to drive
higher and more consistent earnings.
You can see on slide five and six progress on our key financial goals as outlined at our Investor Day last fall. We are
becoming an EVA-driven company with a clear focus on growing earnings, improving ROC and rewarding our
shareholders. We review these metrics with our board at every board meeting.
As a result, we have been consistently delivering improving financial performance. EPS has grown at 22% CAGR over
the last three years. Operating ROC is 11.5% and continues to increase as our growth levers are beginning to produce,
and we complete the execution of our announced portfolio management actions.
We continue to generate significant cash flow from operations of $7.2 billion over the last 12 months, and we remain
disciplined in deploying this cash to further reward our shareholders, having paid $1.8 billion in dividends and $2.6
billion in share buybacks in that same timeframe, all while continuing to invest for growth. These results, which you
can see on slide six, are a direct reflection of our consistent efforts to perform with industry-leading operational
excellence, execution and enterprise-wide financial discipline.

Now, let's take a look at our operating results for each of our segments in the second quarter as well as some modeling
guidance. So turning to slide eight, in Agricultural Sciences, overall operating EBITDA increased 8%. Record yields
across the America have led to tough conditions in the Ag industry, but our sales of new Crop Protection products
increased 5% year-over-year while we continue to make progress on regulatory approvals for our new technologies. In
fact, this quarter, we received the approval of ENLIST corn and soybean traits in Brazil, ENLIST E3 soybeans in
Argentina, and the active ingredients in ARYLEX herbicide and ISOCLAST insecticide in Europe.
And just yesterday, the Chinese government approved a permit for Dow AgroSciences to import and test Dow ENLIST
E3 and Conkesta as the next step. And although this is not final approval or an indication of the timing of final
approval, it is a key required and significant milestone on the path forward for full-scale launch of ENLIST for both
corn and soy.
In Consumer Solutions, overall sales and EBITDA declined; however, Dow Automotive Systems delivered yet another
record EBITDA quarter as a result of volume growth and the sector's demand for lightweighting behind our
industry-leading BETAMATE products, as well as strong demand for premium vehicles and large SUVs which feature
more Dow material.
Our Electronic Materials business also saw strength in the semiconductor sector, building on Dow technologies like our
iconic polishing pads that delivered growth at pace higher than the 5% industry MSI increase expected for the full year.
This strength, however, was offset by weaker display volumes as the industry awaits new product launches.
In Infrastructure Solutions, demand was strong in our construction and reverse osmosis businesses, with new
technologies such as our polymeric flame retardant materials for foam insulation and our FILMTEC ECO membranes
for water applications.
Our Building & Construction business achieved a record quarterly operating EBITDA, and our Coating Materials
business once again delivered volume growth through expanded market participation in both new grades of emulsions
and rheology modifiers. This was offset, however, by declines in the energy sector which negatively impacted sales in
Dow Microbial Control and Dow Oil, Gas & Mining, along with continued and industry-wide trough-like conditions in
acrylic monomers.
Turning to slide 11, Performance Materials & Chemicals operating EBITDA grew 28% year-over-year and EBITDA
margin expanded nearly 600 basis points as the benefits of our productivity actions, focused price/volume management
and lower cost continued to positively impact the bottom line. Demand is strong for products in our core chains
including integrated chlorine, polyurethanes and EO derivatives. The chlorine envelope is showing recovering
EBITDA performance and stable EBITDA margins due to our productivity gains following a weaker first quarter.
And finally, Performance Plastics achieved a new second quarter operating EBITDA record of $1.2 billion, up 15%
year-over-year on strong demand. Dow Packaging and Specialty Plastics and Dow Elastomers both delivered record
EBITDA levels with strong year-over-year volume growth, reflecting our market focus and the success of innovative
products like HYPERTHERM and PacXpert. The quarter was also another proof point on our feedstock strategy, as our
flexibility provided a healthy earnings tailwind in the quarter.
Now I'd like to take a minute to update you on our pending chlor-alkali and derivatives divestiture with Olin on slide
13. In the quarter, we surpassed a number of key transaction hurdles, including all antitrust clearances, as well as the
favorable private letter ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, which we received last week. The value of the
consideration that Dow will realize is approximately $5.5 billion, and is approaching $9 billion on a pre-tax equivalent
basis. Upon completion of this transaction, it is our intention to execute a split, allowing us to retire in excess of $2
billion in Dow shares.
In addition, at the close of the transaction, which remains on track for the fourth quarter, our cash balance will improve
by $1.3 billion. Our debt will go down by $1.6 billion, with a further $500 million reduction in our pension liabilities.
The finalized values, of course, will be updated at the close of the transaction.

Before I turn the call over to Andrew, let me provide you with a brief outlook of our financial expectations heading into
the third quarter. We see an overall macro environment which supports volume growth, balanced by ongoing currency
and price headwinds across most of our businesses. Our productivity actions are gaining momentum, essentially
offsetting inflation, and we also expect a year-over-year increase in turnaround costs in the third quarter, as well as
increased Sadara spending as we approach first product startup. More detail regarding our modeling guidance and our
ethane-propane supply/demand outlook, as well as the return of our popular and often-asked-for macroeconomic heat
map, can be found in the appendix of the presentation.
And now I'd like to turn it over to Andrew for an update on our outlook, as well as our key earning drivers in 2015 and
beyond. Andrew?
Andrew N. Liveris
Yeah. Thank you, Howard. Our overall outlook is on slide 15. And if you go through the points, global growth remains
volatile and uncertain, with spotty growth in some economies, and our overall global GDP [audio gap] (11:41) is
approaching around 3%. Now, the U.S. remains the one consistent bright spot, and our view is that the consumer has
begun to spend some of those lower oil price bonuses, with our order loading remaining strong as we enter Q3.
China remains a mixed bag. A very solid Q2 for us is not necessarily a harbinger of Q3, but note that we have targeted
our products and our product mix to sectors that are truly domestically driven, like automotive and construction, and we
see good growth in those areas. Volatility and softness do prevail in other sectors.
Western Europe remains a positive for Dow, with stellar demand despite the situation that unfolded in Greece. And
emerging markets are all strong, with the exception of Brazil. And Dow has positive exposure to all of these growing
markets, nearly 35% of total revenue. And we see decent demand in places like Southeast Asia, the Middle East, India,
and Eastern Europe.
Overall, we are growing where growth is. That's our strategy. And our execution is very focused on growing share of
demand in those markets, which for us means true value growth. We are doing this predicated on the assumption that
the world economy will remain in its current volatile condition, and we have to find growth while continuing to focus
on productivity and our key projects.
Turning to slide 16, this brings me to our earnings growth drivers, both in the second half of this year and beyond. Our
discipline and our emphasis on EVA and portfolio management continued to release further value and are driving
higher rewards for our shareholders. As Howard showed, we are very milestone-driven, with now 11 straight quarters
in a row of strong earnings performance. And our key enterprise growth projects are beginning to start up over these
next six months, with our first units coming online in Texas, and Sadara beginning its start-up in Saudi Arabia. Our
low-cost integration strategy will be even further enhanced with these new assets coming online.
In addition, our strong technology pipeline is in full swing and is yielding in-demand Material on Ag Science solutions
such as ISOCLAST, EVOQUE, INFUSE, BETAMATE, ARYLEX, VORALUX and many, many more, at a rate of
5,000 new products per year. Our innovation program is producing bottom line results, with more than a third of our
EBITDA tied to innovation. And we have nearly completed our divestiture program. AgroFresh is on track to close
within the coming weeks, and as Howard said, our seminal Dow Chlorine Products transaction with Olin is on track for
close in Q4. Last, completing our next six months drumbeat, our JV consolidation efforts remain very much in focus,
and we are actively addressing our two major joint ventures as we speak.
You know 11 quarters is nearly three years. The pivot we made ahead of the market in 2012, with the call on a slowing
and transforming China, was to commit to a very different focus on how to achieve earnings growth in a slowing and
more volatile world. Self-help through a focus on EVA, productivity and aggressive portfolio management has enabled
this performance all the while funding our large integrated projects and our innovation program.
We now have a portfolio that's built to last under all conditions that can grow volume and margins, can be upgraded in
quality through aggressive portfolio management, has a pristine balance sheet with all the pre-mentioned new value

drivers about to become tailwinds, and all with a disciplined focus on shareholder remuneration through share
buybacks and dividend increases. In sum, this drumbeat of execution and discipline, based on our board-approved and
management-aligned strategy, continues to deliver higher earnings growth, drive strong cash flows and is fueling high
rewards for our shareholders. The Dow team will continue to deliver quarter in, quarter out as we have done for these
last many quarters.
With that, Jack, let's turn to Q&A.
Jack Broodo
Thank you, Andrew. Now we will move on to your questions. First, however, I would like to remind you that my
comments regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures apply to both our prepared
remarks and the following Q&A.
Rochelle, would you please explain the Q&A procedure?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Thank you. Good morning. Andrew, very strong first half for ethylene and polyethylene.
What's your expectation for the back half of the year in terms of reduced outages and potentially some lower
polyethylene prices off the lower oil prices?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yeah, look, operating rates, David, are strong on the derivatives and on the crackers.
There's a lot of aged fleet out there. And we certainly had some of our own outages in the quarter. And we achieved the
results you saw despite that. With the age of the fleet, unexpected outages are out there as a harbinger of constrained
supply. There's not a lot of new supply coming on as a consequence, with GDP around 3%. And let's say that the global
ethylene growth rate is a multiple of GDP, somewhere between 1.1 times and 1.5 times. It's very hard to call them in
90-day slots, but we will see some price slippage with the oil prices staying low and continuing to have a forecast that
keeps it low, which you know all of us are reading the same sort of material.
But I would tell you that this snugness, this potential for outages, we have a price increase for polyethylene in August.
We had one in June. It does speak to the tightness in a pre-cycle run-up that we've been talking about for some time.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Very good. And, Howard, just on equity earnings, they were up year-over-year and
sequentially. Can you discuss what drove that and what were the Sadara start-up costs sequentially? What was the
impact in Q2 versus Q1 from Sadara?
<A - Howard I. Ungerleider>: Yeah. Good morning, David. So yeah, you're right, equity earnings were up. They
were up about $46 million versus same quarter a year ago, about $100 million sequentially. What really drove the
year-over-year was the naphtha chain margins with our Thai JVs and sequentially, we saw a little bit of a boost there as
well as increased earnings from our Kuwaiti JVs. But actually, if you look at it on a first half over first half, we got no
help from equity earnings. First half, the equity earnings were actually down about $37 million.
Relative to Sadara, we don't release the actual number, but I would say it was in line – Q2 was in line with Q2 costs. So
that will ramp as we head into the back half of the year.

And next we'll hear from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.

<Q - Vincent S. Andrews>: Thanks and good morning to everyone. Andrew, I'm just trying to get a sense sort of
where you are in terms of your outlook today versus three months ago. Are you feeling better? Are you feeling about
the same? And I guess maybe you could put that in perspective with sort of the performance of the Consumer and the
Infrastructure segments during the quarter. Was it uniform throughout the three months of the quarter or was there
some months better than others? Did you finish stronger? And how are things trending so far in the third quarter?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yeah, I think – thank you very much, Vincent. I think there's no question that the six
months is a better read on the go-forward economy than the three-month slices. If you look at sequential numbers,
actually, Building & Construction, for example, was up sequentially and stayed strong, and I made note of that in my
prepared remarks as well as on the TV interviews today, that Building & Construction and Automotive are doing quite
well in the global economy, especially in North America, or U.S. particularly, and Europe. But there's some headwinds
that we have seen that became bigger headwinds in Q2, mostly in and around our Performance Monomers unit which,
as you know, gets tagged along with Coatings. Coatings itself did very well but Performance Monomers continues to be
oversupplied. So that's specific to that little – that business; not a little business, a big business.
And then Energy & Water, Water did well but Energy, the oil and gas market itself, as you know, with low oil prices is
quite depressed. So if you pull those numbers out of there and make a statement around the whole company,
Performance Materials end-use demand, Performance Plastics end-use demand, and then Consumer and Infrastructure
trending in the right direction in terms of global demand. And again, I made a big point of saying we have built a
portfolio that has targeted demand drivers. In other words, we're no longer a vanilla commodity supplier, we are
targeted on our end use.
Our China numbers are a good example of that. Our volumes in China are up despite everyone thinking China is soft or
down. Where we play in China is where China's needs are domestically driven such as automobiles, construction, and
frankly, water and food safety and all those things that are drivers.
So look, I haven't really changed or we haven't changed our outlook from three months ago. I think different parts of
the portfolio will play in 90-day slices, but we are still trending. We've had seven quarters in a row of year-on-year
volume growth in the company. Now that's a big statement under all these conditions quarter-to-quarter. We're
structurally hedged as our prepared remarks or I think Howard said in his prepared remarks.
<Q - Vincent S. Andrews>: And just as a follow-up, you mentioned the Sadara cost ramping in the back half of the
year. How should we think about them going into next year? Because I'm just thinking, I think you have four plants
starting up this year and I think another 20 plants or 22 plants to complete over time. So [ph] is it sort of (22:38) going
to move in a straight line the way – from this year's trend or does it level out? Or how should we think about it?
<A - Howard I. Ungerleider>: Yeah. We'll give more details as the end of the year approaches. But the way I would
think about it is Performance – first product which is at this point about 99% complete, first product we'll start to – is
focused in Performance Plastics, right. So you'll start to see the headwind in cost in Performance Plastics turn into a
tailwind between now and the end of the year. That will ramp the – the cost headwind though will ramp in Performance
Materials because those products will be starting to launch in 2016.
Operator
And next we'll move on to Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Hey. Good morning, gentlemen. Forgive me, I saw you two in concert last night, and with
your results this morning, it really is a beautiful day. So thank you so much for starting us off in...
<A - Howard I. Ungerleider>: Frank, did you just call Andrew Bono?

<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Hey, honestly, with these results you are a rock star, Andrew. Hey, how – explain to me how
your Performance Plastics business had volumes of 5% – or 9% ex Hydrocarbons & Energy. I mean I would have
thought last year you were running pretty much flat out. What's going on in that business?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Well, remember, there's a fairly large rebound going on in Europe, Frank, that I – Western
Europe. And overall for the company, our Western Europe results have been pretty, pretty strong. And we did a couple
things in Europe that gave us even more competitive advantage and enabled us to take share and really pump up those
operating rates even higher into their 90%s. And that's because of our propane crack. I mean we have now got propane
flexibility not just in Terneuzen but also in Tarragona. That's a big deal in terms of our in-market cost competitiveness
in Europe, and frankly enabled us to really gain share and run those assets even harder, and they've been running very,
very well.
We did have some operating rate issues here in the United States [ph] with around (24:42) some cracker trips that we
just basically had to cope with throughout the quarter that actually was [ph] a high level – (24:50) a little bit of a cost
blip for us. But still operating rates were in the high 80%s, early 90%s.
So look, when you run them this – I said around the earlier question, when you run them this hard, you stand the chance
of being – tripping out not just our assets, everyone else's assets. But our reliability and our manufacturing people are
doing a bang-up job in running our assets more reliable and getting more asset capability out of them as a result, and as
a consequence of that, we've had this volume growth that you pointed out.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: I thoroughly agree in terms of the potential for unplanned outages when everybody's running
their assets so hard. So just hope it's not you and you just expanded on that. On the propane flexibility side, you've
quietly kind of improved your exposure, your ability to crack propane. Where do you stand right now in North America
and where do you stand in Europe on the propane flexibility?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yeah. So the U.S. number is around 67%, close to 70%. And Europe is around 55% to
60%.
Operator
And next we'll move onto Jeffrey Zekauskas with JPMorgan.
<Q - Jeffrey J. Zekauskas>: Hi. Thanks very much. I think in the first quarter, you said that your equity income would
be down in the second quarter. And it turned out to be strongly up. What was the thing that was unexpected that
happened in the quarter? And do you expect these sorts of numbers to be sustainable?
<A - Howard I. Ungerleider>: Yeah, I'll take the first part of your question first. I mean what surprised us on the
upside was the strength of the naphtha chain margins. We knew they were going to come up. We didn't expect for them
to come up as strongly as they did. And the Sadara spending was actually a little bit better than we expected it to be as
well.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: And double up, Howard, the naphtha point really came home with Thailand.
<A - Howard I. Ungerleider>: Exactly right.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Thai JVs really had a great year-on-year quarterly comparison that may not be sustainable
for the back half but certainly, in the comparison for Q2, was very strong.
<Q - Jeffrey J. Zekauskas>: How much was the benefit from propane cracking, both in the United States and
elsewhere this quarter, versus either the first quarter or last year at this time? How much did that benefit your
EBITDA?
<A - Howard I. Ungerleider>: Yeah, Jeff, I would say, we're not going to give you an exact number, but what we can
say is, it was well north of $100 million. And also, don't forget the Andrew point, that we did also have some

at least I give you a couple of points to titrate from.

And next we'll move on to P.J. Juvekar of Citi.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Yeah. Good morning, Andrew.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Morning.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: So in this tough Ag environment, there is a lot of consolidation that is being attempted. Would
you be a buyer or a seller of assets here? [ph] And sort of (27:54) can you differentiate your comments between crop
chemicals and seeds? Thank you.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yeah, look, certainly, the last few months, that question's becoming top of mind for a lot of
people, given the obvious Monsanto-Syngenta discussion. You know, P.J., as everyone on this call I'm sure has heard,
we've been very consistent value growers of ag. And we have a strength, not just in crop protection and our integrated
chemistry business there and all the launches that – I even had on the prepared remarks, ARYLEX, ISOCLAST, et
cetera, but also, we are a very strong trait developer. That ENLIST permit approval for Conkesta and soy, E3, was a big
deal that Howard talked about that just came yesterday for the soy market in China. As you know, we'll play big in soy.
So we have two very large value drivers.
If you look at the value of the buyout of Dow [ph] Lanco (28:51) in the late 1990s, we had an Ag business worth about
$3 billion based on that transaction. If you look at the multiples that are out there right now, we have taken that
business and made it basically somewhere near a $20 billion to $25 billion business. We doubled the value in the last
five years. We can double it again in the next five years. But consolidation and this integration between crop chemistry
and traits and germplasm, we're a big believer in. That's what ENLIST, ENLIST DUO is all about. So we understand
what's going on out there in this round of consolidation. And, as I said on TV this morning, we'll be at the table and we
could go either way, depending on what creates the most value for our shareholders.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: All right. Thank you for that. And just in Ag on the near term, you talked about missed
applications by farmers in June due to rains. Can you get that back in July? And what does that mean for inventories
going forward? Thank you.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Look, it's going be tough. I would tell you that – and I think Howard had it in the prepared
remarks, what keeps us expanding margins is our new product introductions, so that's the differentiator for Dow. But
the market, high inventories, currency headwinds, economic issues in Argentina, highly competitive product and
pricing environment, this is not going to – this is going to be a down year for AgroSciences as a market, and certainly
for us in the second half, it's going be tough to maintain the year-on-year beats that we've had in the Ag business. Look,
it'll clear itself out. I mean, one year does not make an ag driver or an ag market, but it's going to be tough to sustain it
through the second half, given the conditions of the marketplace.

And next we'll hear from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Brian P. Maguire>: Hey. Good morning. It's actually Brian Maguire on for Bob today.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Morning.
<Q - Brian P. Maguire>: I see in the appendix, it looks like your global operating rate ticked up to 84%; looks like it
was the highest second quarter rate on that chart. Just wondering if that – what that means for your ethylene operating
rates. And do you think we're now at the point of the cycle where we're firmly in that upcycle, where prices aren't really

going to be set by marginal costs, and we shouldn't really think about oil prices as driving the prices of ethylene and
polyethylene going forward?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yeah. I think it's a great, astute observation. I kind of partly answered it on an earlier
question. Those ethylene operating rates and the potential for trips and outages, like Frank Mitsch was also talking
about, really means that cycle dynamics are approaching. We're [ph] calling (31:29) 2016 as upcycle opportunity, based
on non-outage driven demand. If there's outages, you're going to get opportunities for price increases independent of
the feedstock input.
This is not yet a cycle discussion, but it's starting to mimic one with outages. I think that's really what we saw in 1995,
for any historian on the phone, where supply outages really created a mini cycle on the up. But not a lot of new
capacity, not a lot of upside coming in terms of supply side. Decent demand, around 3%. You're going to be able to
[ph] kick (32:07) those operating rates into those precycle dynamics.
Remember though, we're not a cycle story. We're structurally hedged to take low cost inputs and add value to the
outputs. We're not a peanut butter over bread or toast plastics player anymore. Most of our product mix is very, very,
very targeted and very, very upmarket value-add.
<Q - Brian P. Maguire>: Okay. Thanks. And just as a follow-up, in the slides it also mentioned you're still working on
addressing your two major JVs; I assume that's Dow Corning and then some of the Kuwaiti JVs. Could you just maybe
provide an update on how business trends are going in those businesses and whether those are businesses where you'd
like – where Dow would benefit from getting some more exposure?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: So the two major JVs are the obvious ones. Dow Corning is doing very, very well. They're
coming back as the market comes back, and their base silicones business is doing very well. Polysilicon still has got
major issues, flat demand. The whole solar discussion between the U.S. and China and resolution to the duty question
has kept their demand suppressed. But look, overall, I think they're starting to recover like many of our downstream
businesses have begun to recover based on consumer pull, construction pull and the key drivers like transportation that
I referenced in the Dow mix.
Kuwait, look, Kuwait is a great low-cost producer and that's a big contributor of our equity earnings, but it will swing
compared with the commodity market with glycol pricing being a big driver there, and glycol pricing is on a downward
swing right now. So it's an up and down business but, of course, what makes money over any condition is this low cost.
We've already said we're not going to continue to be investors in those businesses. We are going to be redirecting our
resources to the value-add, low cost integrated plays like Sadara, for example.
Operator
And we'll hear from John Roberts with UBS.
<Q - John E. Roberts>: Thank you. You mentioned your China strength was automotive and construction. And I can
understand automotive. Construction seemed a little bit peculiar there. What's driving that?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: No question, John. It's infrastructure spend. I was just in China. I mean, they pivot the big
bubbles that they created in the housing market. They pivot on really trying to figure a way to continue the economy to
grow at a reasonably decent rate until they get strong domestic consumption, [ph] they'd be getting – (34:31) auto being
a good example, but in some non-auto areas as well. They're investing in upscaling their water treatment plants, so our
sales of water treatment products are going up. That's also construction.
So I would say it's an infrastructure driver. We particularly saw it in our Performance Materials business as well in
China not just our Water business. The Water, Performance Materials, mostly polyurethanes, as well as of course the
plastics point, especially in packaging, and specialty plastics and elastomers in transportation. These were all strong
drivers and again very targeted, and not your normal housing construction-related spend.

<Q - John E. Roberts>: And then...
<A - Howard I. Ungerleider>: Our Ag business was also up almost 10% on a volume basis versus a year ago in
China.
<Q - John E. Roberts>: Thank you. And then you can't buy back stock until after the Olin distribution. But what's
your thoughts on capital deployment again once we get past that milestone?
<A - Howard I. Ungerleider>: Yeah. So we've got – we announced at our Investor Day last fall a $5 billion program.
As you know, we did $500 million in the first quarter prior to the Olin transaction. If you use the current Dow and Olin
share price, that'll be another $2 billion of the $4.5 billion that we have remaining. That would leave $2.5 billion. And
what we've said, the way to think about it is that $2.5 billion will be done. It's an open program. 2015, 2016, 2017 is
how you should think about it and we'll do it in line with our earnings growth as well as our portfolio [ph] moves
(35:59).

And moving on we'll hear from Peter Butler with Glen Hill Investments.
<Q - Peter E. Butler>: Morning – good morning.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Morning.
<Q - Peter E. Butler>: Looking ahead, if this was the second quarter conference call in 2016, what would Andrew be
talking about? What would be the Dow-related positives and negatives that would be highlighted in your conference
call next year?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Successful – hi, Peter. Good morning. Successful start-ups of PDH. Successful start-ups
and, of course, producing positive EBITDA for Performance Materials mostly polyurethanes as well as acrylic acid and
derivatives reduced mostly in coatings. Successful start-up on the first units in Sadara, by end of the year – by second
quarter next year we'll have quite a few more.
So headwinds becoming tailwinds on the EBITDA line for the Sadara enterprise, which is a big deal. [ph] Places relates
to (37:02) the Plastics side. A very, very low cost plastics coming out of those units which is very material to the cash
flow projections of Sadara. And then of course continual recovery in the global economy and Dow's operating rate
starting to get mid-80%s and beyond, probably in the high 80%s by then. That capacity then will be very important to
us.
Snugger markets in some of our key businesses, not the least of them being Plastics giving us price power and more
EBITDA coming from that. Our productivity program which will deliver on a run rate basis $300 million a year of cost
savings. And then our new innovation launches, and we have 5,000 of these a year now right now, Peter, but we review
the 50 at our board and our top 5 and their ability to produce bottom line impacts, we'll be highlighting those. And
here's the punch line, there are going to be different ones every quarter. We have so many new innovations that we
have a proliferation of new high margin products, so our percent of patent-protected sales is increasing as we speak,
and so that's enabling higher margins.
So that's just a snapshot and I'm sure I could add more. Oh, the closure of Olin. I shouldn't forget that one. That's a
biggie. Further, realization of our JV consolidation strategy, without being specific, just to name a few others. And then
we'll see where we are with the Ag business at that point in time as well.
<Q - Peter E. Butler>: Okay. You partially answered my follow-up but the full question would be obviously, a
company's key resources are people, financial resources and technology, and does Dow see any major changes in any
of these three inputs in the next year?

<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yeah. Look, for sure, I answered partly the technology question. Remember that we're in
our max CapEx year in terms of resource deployment this year and into next year. The market is asking us over and
over about how you're going to deploy excess cash flows to the shareholder, and I repeat it, to the shareholder. We've
got funding of all of our organic growth programs, including the hiring of lots of new skills for our new portfolio.
We've hired 22,000 new people in the last five years, 12,000 of them are under the age of 30 years old. We're making
the generational change here at Dow and that will be very, very evident as we go into 2016 in terms of their ability to
keep running this company over the next decade and beyond.
Operator
Next we'll hear from John McNulty with Credit Suisse.
<Q - John P. McNulty>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So the first one, with regard to the second
quarter heat map that you had put in the appendix, there's certainly a lot more green on it than almost anything else. I
guess any major pockets in terms of end markets, whether it's packaging or durables, industrials, et cetera, that you're
seeing a noticeable change as you go into 3Q, either to the positive or the negative side? Can you kind of walk us
through your thoughts on that?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yeah. Look, thanks for referring to the heat map. I was wondering if people would notice
its return. Yeah. Look, I think the areas of agriculture which I've already talked about and oil, oil-related field services
and our products that go into that like Dow Microbial Control, these are going – trending negative, so I'd put those into
the negative category.
[ph] Trending (40:37) positive are the ones that I've talked about, which are packaging, construction, and automotive.
I'd say automotive has had a good run up here based on our technologies. The market itself may be looking pretty
saturated but in terms of our position in the market, our share of wallet, so to speak, that's [ph] trending (40:55)
positive.
And Electronics, as we see the pivot in products in the phablets, as they're called, which is a smartphone tablet
combination, new display technology, new product introductions, we should start to see the display business coming
more to the positive. The semiconductor business is already doing very well. Those are the ones that's come top of
mind.
Do you have any, Howard?
<A - Howard I. Ungerleider>: No. You covered it. Thanks.
<Q - John P. McNulty>: Great. And then just as the follow-up, I guess with propylene down as much as it is and other
raws for some of your more specialized businesses also down, I guess, I was a little bit surprised to not see maybe a
little bit more margin lift in areas like the Consumer Solutions and even Infrastructure Solutions businesses. So can you
walk us through how to think about that? Is it a timing issue? Are there just other offsets that may be weighing on those
businesses now whether it's Performance Monomers weakness that you'd highlighted or what have you?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yeah. The offsets were very blunt. I mean, the acrylic acid and derivatives business is way
oversupplied and quite troubled with new capacity. And our strategy is very clear, we're converting more and more of
that into Coatings. Coatings actually had a very good sequential quarter and we're doing quite well on our Coatings
business, but Performance Monomers is just too much of it that supplied into a commodity-like market. We'll get a bit
of help with PDH coming on for that business, but it won't help the supply/demand balance. That's a major offset and
I've already mentioned the energy business.

<Q - Don D. Carson>: Yes. Andrew, I want to go back to your Ag comments. You've said in the past that you're
willing to be an investor in Ag. I guess question is, is how big because seed businesses could be expensive and I guess
they could also complicate potential joint venture discussions as well. So how much capital would you be willing to put
into the Ag business to grow it?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yeah. Look, we have been very clear that we're not spenders in big M&A, and that's a very
important question in terms of resource deployment. As we go narrow and deeper in key markets, I think what's going
to have to happen here is that we will look at the opportunity to play up or play down in the Ag space and make a
resource decision based on the playing up or playing down. So it's less about the absolute amount and more about our
resource deployment priorities, which are shareholder remuneration and organic growth, and small [ph] borrow (43:18)
on M&A. So that's going to factor into our conversation there, without revealing our hand at this point in time.
<Q - Don D. Carson>: And then a follow-up on Ag, you're down about 10% year-over-year in the first half on
EBITDA. How much of that is due to Brazil? And when do you see Brazil turning? You made comments that you think
this excess pipeline is continuing rather than shrinking.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yeah. Look, it wasn't as much Brazil in the first half. It was really Europe and the weather
situation and commodity prices through the oversupply, mostly here in the U.S., but warehouses are full. The Brazil
factor will really play in the second half and that – of course, the oversupply issue will hurt the ability to, obviously,
reduce as much – or plant as much and produce as much as we would normally see in the season. So, look, I think
Brazil and Argentina – don't forget Argentina – will loom large in the second half comparisons, as I said earlier.
Operator
And next, we'll move on to James Sheehan with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.
<Q - James Sheehan>: ...my question. Just wondering about some of the strength in Performance Materials. You
noted polyurethanes demand was quite strong. Could you talk about some of the drivers there? I know you've done a lot
of work internally. What are you seeing on the macro front in polyurethanes?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Well, those two major macros, one on the supply side, which is – obviously, there was
major competitor outages that enabled us to expand margins because of supply shortages. That will disappear in the
second half.
But the demand side of it, as I mentioned already on China, we started up a new polyol plant in Thailand, and that's a
specialty polyol plant that fed the Chinese market and started up and it's flat out right now. So, it is demand and it's in
demand in the areas I've mentioned, like construction, bedding and furniture, which is local consumption, back to the
domestic drivers in China. But also our competitive position here on propylene in the United States means we can run
the PO chain flat out, which is one of the other reasons.
Isocyanates remains challenged, in particular TDI. But look, demand and tight supply, especially in the PO chain.
<Q - James Sheehan>: Thanks. And on slide 19, you've got some interesting supply/demand balances in NGLs. Just
wondering if you could comment on the propane outlook for the second half. Do you think prices have reached a
bottom here, or do you see continued tailwinds in the propane area?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: I think propane fundamentals remain bearish. So we've been actually pretty consistent in
saying that. I think I've given Mr. Broodo accolades a few times on this comment in the last several quarters, and I will
do it again. When he was running the Hydrocarbons Group, [ph] we full share (46:14) of this several years ago, which
is why we ended up spending the capital we did to convert over to propane flex. I think they're going to stay
fundamentally a tailwind for us for the next many quarters, if not many years, and that also applies to butane, by the
way.

And next, we'll move on to Duffy Fischer with Barclays.
<Q - Patrick Duffy Fischer>: Yes. Good morning, guys. In the acrylic acid chain sitting at trough, where do you
worry about that kind of infecting some of the downstream derivatives? Or do you think those are pretty well walled off
and it won't kind of infect its way down into the chain?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: It depends on your strategy, I think. There's no question that, if you're going in a more
commodity-like emotions, [indiscernible] (47:01) emotions, you're going to see some price knock-on effect. It won't be
walled off, to use your term, Duffy. But certainly, the strategy of Coatings is being innovation-led. And if you look at
their work to be with the winners, end-use customers who are making a difference in premium coatings, whether it be
architectural or non-residential, you'd see that that strategy's working.
I think we've got margin growth going on, differentiation that is walling off the upstream, if you like, oversupply effect,
and that strategy has been deliberate. It's been hard to get there, but we have, and we've got sales of new commercial
grades of vinyl acrylic binders is a good example of new product launches in the Coatings business.
<Q - Patrick Duffy Fischer>: Great. And then, if we could just jump back to Ag, kind of on the strategic side. If the
Monsanto-Syngenta deal happens, do you think that forces either the industry or yourselves to do moves? Or would the
industry be able to continue to compete kind of as-is, even if Monsanto and Syngenta did come together?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Well, I think it would force other moves. I think the whole consumption base, the farmer, is
going to look at that and say, we need some alternatives here. This creates an incredible company should it combine,
which speaks to this integrated strategy which we're a fan of, and we've been a fan of, that I mentioned earlier.
Operator
And we'll move on to Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global.
<Q - Hassan I. Ahmed>: Morning, Andrew.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Good morning, Hassan.
<Q - Hassan I. Ahmed>: Obviously, very interesting slides in the ethane and propane supply/demand side of things
and obviously, in this quarter, you benefited a fair bit from cheaper propane. As I look at those slides, you obviously
have the ethane surplus coming down quite steeply by the end of the decade. Obviously, in my mind, that's partly some
exports and to a large extent, ethylene capacity coming online in the U.S. But along the same time horizon, propane's
rising quite steeply as well in terms of surpluses. So can you give us your views about this interplay between ethane
and propane going forward?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: I think it does speak to the earlier question, Hassan, on maximizing propane flex and
especially [ph] in (49:34) market Europe, which we've done and here in the United States, keeping our fleet able to flip
within a day or two between ethane and propane on the in-the-moment decision or the balanced decision, which you
just talked about.
As this comes to pass and I think we'd all look at that ethane supply/demand balance one and say grain of salt. I don't
think the market will let that happen based on the other consumption of, let's call it, low carbon fuel in the United
States. Remember, natural gas is a preferred fuel for low carbon emissions. As you start to look at that from a carbon
emissions point of view, you can see more of the power fleet going over to natural gas with time.
So there'll be natural gas production. [ph] Will all be dry? (50:20) Probably not, especially the shale gas. So, I'd say that
interplay is something we've strategically invested for. Where we have pure naphtha crackers left is really only the
Taiwan and pretty much our Dow Central Germany facility. And we'll look at that from a propane point of view, both
of them very strongly. But we're okay on this ethane and propane in a mix and in a balance on how we can manage it.

We're probably one of two or three who can do it.
<A - Howard I. Ungerleider>: One more point on that is that propane is going put a lid on ethane. They're going to
compete for a cracker, to get in the cracker and so there's competitive economics between them.
<Q - Hassan I. Ahmed>: Fair enough. As a follow-up to that, obviously. the next step to this is your very long propane
over here. You're cracking more and more propane over here. So obviously producing more propylene co-product,
right? So propylene partly goes into oversupply because of sort of more propylene co-product coming on stream here.
And then if global utilization rates pick up as well, that means naphtha-based ethylene operating rates go higher, which
means again further exacerbation of the propylene side of things.
So now with that in mind, assuming for a second propylene is massively oversupplied, I mean, that would mean higher
ethylene prices as well, right, because you will not be getting as much propylene co-product credit as you historically
would. Is that fair?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Very fair. Very fair.
<Q - Hassan I. Ahmed>: Excellent. Thank you, Andrew.

And at this time, we have no further time for questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Jack Broodo for any
additional or closing remarks.
Jack Broodo
We appreciate your time today. Andrew, would you like to make some closing comments?
Andrew N. Liveris
Yeah. I just like to repeat that this Dow is now got 11 quarters of execution, seven straight quarters of volume growth
year-on-year, 11 quarters of EPS growth and EBITDA growth. So volume, margins, self-help, portfolio management,
aggressive portfolio management, the closure of the Olin deal here in the next few months, our big projects coming
online and our balance sheet in great shape. We've never ever had such high-quality earnings. In fact, this EBITDA
margin we haven't seen since the bubble economy of 2005.
And so if you think about this, this company's quality of earnings and all the things in front of us: the approval of
ENLIST and launching that as a big product launch next year, and of course, Sadara and Gulfstream, big Texas assets
and buybacks, shareholder buybacks and shareholder dividend increases. This is the company that we have and you can
count on us to keep delivering these quarters.
Jack Broodo
Thank you, Andrew. We appreciate your questions today. As always, we appreciate your interest in the Dow Chemical
Company. For your reference, a copy of our prepared comments will be posted on Dow's website later today. This
concludes our call for today. We look forward to speaking with you again soon.
