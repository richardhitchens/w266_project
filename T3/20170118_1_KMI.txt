MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the quarterly earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in
listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of today's call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being
recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.
Now, I'd like to hand the call over to Mr. Rich Kinder, Executive Chairman of Kinder Morgan. Sir, you may begin.
Richard D. Kinder
Okay. Thank you, Jay, and welcome to our quarterly call. Before we begin, as always, I'd like to remind you that
today's earnings release and this call include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1935 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as well as certain non-GAAP financial
measures. We encourage you to read our full disclosure on forward-looking statements and use of non-GAAP financial
measures set forth at the end of our earnings release as well as review our latest filings with the SEC for a list of risk
factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in such forward-looking statements.
Before turning to Steve Kean, our CEO; and Kim Dang, our CFO, for an update on our operational and financial
performance, let me just start the call by reiterating our strategy at Kinder Morgan. We're all about creating value for
our shareholders.

To accomplish that goal, we work really diligently in 2016 to strengthen our balance sheet, and we did. We also
achieved financial performance consistent with the guidance we've been giving you since our first quarter call in April
2016. We expect that the strengthening of the balance sheet will continue in 2017. We also expect that when we finish
our work on JVs and as we work through the backlog, we will be producing cash well in excess of our investment
needs.
While we have alternatives in using that cash to deliver value to shareholders, our current thinking remains that the best
way to deliver that value is through substantially increasing our dividend. We expect to update you on that in the latter
part of this year when we announce our dividend policy for 2018.
Steve?
Steven J. Kean
Yeah. Kim will take you through the fourth quarter and full year performance in detail, so I'm going to focus on three
themes on our performance that have implications for 2017 and beyond. First, our balance sheet strengthening
initiatives; second, progress on our growth projects; and third, where we are beginning to see some positive indications
in the sector.
On the first, we ended the year ahead of target at 5.3 times debt-to-EBITDA after executing on a number of joint
ventures and divestitures through the year. We have built our plans for 2017 to continue that progress, including a joint
venture or IPO of the Trans Mountain expansion. Both of those approaches are attractive to us, and the interest is
strong. We will develop both alternatives further this quarter, and position ourselves to take advantage of the best one
in terms of value and other key terms.
We believe that syndicating Trans Mountain is the right answer for our shareholders and for the project. It now
represents close to half of our backlog, and we believe the value we can receive from investors willing to participate
plus the syndication of risk that comes with it makes bringing in other investors the best approach. We accounted
nothing for the value we believe will be realized from investors who wish to participate in the project when we came up
with our ending debt metric of 5.4 times for 2017. So, we believe we've left ourselves some room to improve on that
metric as the year goes on. Bottom line, we exceeded what we said we would do in 2016, and we will work to beat our
2017 target as well.
Second, with respect to progress on our projects. Starting with the backlog, it now stands at $12 billion, which is down
from $13 billion last quarter. We placed a little under $800 million worth of projects into service during the quarter and
about $1.8 billion over the full year 2016. We removed $200 million for the projects in the quarter, and overall $4.6
billion of projects were removed over the full year. Some of the removals during the year were based on regulatory
circumstances. But in almost all cases, we were eliminating a project in order to accelerate progress – removing the
project, accelerated progress on the balance sheet, and freed up capital for higher return projects.
We also had $50 million of reduced costs in the quarter. Again, still reconciling on the backlog here. We added $167
million of new investment during the quarter and $740 million for the full year. Now, much of that and some of the
project removals were a function of high grading our investments within CO2, eliminating some projects, adding
others. In short, we high graded the backlog to strengthen the balance sheet, and directed our capital to the highest
return opportunity just as we said we would.
So, in 2016, we improved the balance sheet, made progress on our projects, found a few new high return projects,
closed the year with DCF and EBITDA results in line with what we've been projecting since April, covered our
dividend and our gross CapEx needs without needing to access capital markets, and we expect to continue our progress
in 2017. I think also worth noting, we've been watching counterparty credit risk over the course of the year and we have
not had a default resulting in a revenue impact to us since early April of this year. We made that a priority, and I think
we've been successful through the year. Of course, we were impacted early in the first quarter by bankruptcies from
some of our coal customers, but we've done a very good job of holding the line since then on counterparty credit.

So, third, I'll give you an overview of the road ahead. Some market recovery begins to take shape in the markets we
serve. Starting with natural gas, North American gas continues to be the long-term fuel of choice in meeting domestic
and increasingly international energy needs. Growth, we believe, is going to driven by the emerging demand hole from
power plants. Gas exceeded coal's share of power demand for the first time in 2016. Second, exports to Mexico, of
which KM has about a 75% share. LNG exports which, of course, are emerging on the Gulf Coast and expect to reach a
full level of between 8 and 9 Bcf of capacity when the build-out is complete of just the current projects. And finally,
Gulf Coast, pet chem and industrial demand.
So, the green shoots, we saw some green shoots in the fourth quarter, including some record-setting days on two of our
larger systems. The return of price volatility, which our storage businesses were able to take advantage of, both for
2016 period as well as for 2017. We had about a half a Bcf of new natural gas capacity sign-ups, a little less than 100 of
that, about 60 of that was existing capacity, bringing the total over the last three-year period up to 8.7 Bcf.
While gather volumes were down on our system, the return of rigs to the Eagle Ford and Haynesville, the resilience of
our assets in the Bakken where we actually kept oil gathered was roughly flat, and increased our gas gathering volumes
were good leading indicators for us. To put this in context, our gas business represents about 55% of our segment
earnings, and gathering and processing is about 20% of that number.
In North American crude, green shoots were apparent as rig count rose significantly over the last half of the year, and
U.S. production actually grew during the fourth quarter. Producers have continued to lower their breakeven prices with
respect to the Eagle Ford specifically, which was hit especially hard by the downturn. Acreage has now started to
change hands from capital constrained players to new owners who we expect will do more with that position. We
expect to see volumes in the Eagle Ford, both gas and oil, to continue to decline in the first part of 2017 before
flattening and then starting to grow as 2017 progresses.
Refined products have held steady. Pipelines are the most cost-effective way to move products from refining to market
centers, and we have the largest refined product pipeline position. Further, our terminals assets are well-positioned.
About 80% of our segment earnings before DD&A in the terminal sector now comes from liquids, and that is
predominantly from refined products. And in Houston in particular, we are in a great position to participate in demand
growth as well as export growth for refined products.
On NGLs, while the NGL processing business is a small part of our network, there is visible growth that we are
positioned to benefit from as pet chem projects are completed over the next one to two years.
So, overall, the long-term prospects for North American energy are bright, and our assets are well-positioned to
participate in the recovery and growth.
I'm going to conclude with an update on our two largest projects, Trans Mountain and Elba.
First on Trans Mountain. Trans Mountain achieved two critical milestones in December of 2016 and this month in
2017. On December 2, we received our Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity from the Government of
Canada. And just last week, British Columbia Premier Clark announced that we had met our five conditions that she
specified for heavy oil pipelines crossing BC. And also, importantly, the BC Government issued its environmental
order, approving the project with conditions.
These were enormous steps forward in enabling us to help Canadian producers access world markets, and the steps
were taken in connection with an overall package of federal and provincial policies and decisions designed to mitigate
and address environmental, climate and First Nations' concerns. So, a comprehensive set of announcements coming
from the federal and provincial governments over the last several months, of which this project was just one piece.
Our expansion is needed as Canadian oilsands production continues to grow, even though it's at a slower pace than it
was two years ago and pipeline take-away capacity is constrained. We remain confident that the vast majority of our
shippers want the capacity that they have, some may even want more, and there are other customers who are interested
in capacity if it were to become available. So, this project has advanced significantly since our update last quarter.

Here's what remains for us. We're finalizing our cost estimate for the shippers. We expect now that's going to be
delivered in early February. We then have the shipper review of those costs. That takes place over a 30-day period. And
then we have a final investment decision that we expect to make sometime late Q1 or early Q2. During this period,
we'll be working on bringing in additional investors, either in the context of a joint venture or as an IPO, as I
mentioned. So, it's going to be a busy next few months on our largest project.
Turning to Elba, we're under construction here. We are receiving notices to proceed from FERC under the 7(c) that we
got – the certificate that we got last June. The notices are coming through on a timely basis. So, we're under
construction. Just a reminder, we have a 20-year contract with Shell on this project. While not essential in our contract
with Shell, the project now has both FTA and non-FTA, that is free trade agreement, export authorization. We've got an
EPC contract in place. We have this project identified as a JV candidate, and believe that the prospects for concluding
something on that front are very good. As we've said before, we don't have to JV the project, but we believe it's a good
candidate, will attract good value from investors, and we believe the prospects of concluding something there are very
good.
And with that, I'll turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer and our newest board member, Kim Dang. Kim?
Kimberly Allen Dang
Thanks, Steve. Today we're declaring a dividend of $0.125 per share, consistent with our budget. I'm going to take you
through all the numbers as usual, but I don't think you're going to find any surprises in our results as adjusted EBITDA,
DCF and net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA are all consistent with the guidance that we have provided since April, updated
for the SNG transaction.
Starting with the preliminary GAAP income statement, you'll see that revenues are down and cost of sales has
increased, resulting in about a $457 million reduction in gross margin. As I've told you in many quarters, we do not
believe that changes in revenue, or revenue itself, are a good predictor of our performance. However, when revenues
are down, we generally see a reduction in our cost of sales which more than offsets the reduction in revenues, as we
have some businesses where revenues and expense fluctuate with commodity prices, but margin generally does not.
That did not hold true this quarter, so let me explain.
Both revenues and cost of sales are impacted by non-cash, non-recurring accounting entries, which we call certain
items. Certain items contributed $237 million of the quarter-over-quarter gross margin reduction, with the largest being
an approximately $200 million of revenue that we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 related to a pipeline contract
buyout. Adjusting for these certain items, gross margin would have been down $220 million.
The largest contributor to this decrease is the sale of a 50% interest in SNG. As a result of the sale, we no longer
consolidate SNG's revenues or cost of sales, but instead report our 50% interest in net income further down the income
statement as equity earnings. Keep in mind also that SNG did not have significant cost of sales.
The impact of deconsolidating SNG was approximately a $134 million reduction in gross margin for the quarter,
leaving a reduction in gross margin of about $86 million, which I think is more consistent with how we would view our
results. The main drivers of the remaining gross margin reduction are consistent with those that I will cover for you on
DCF in a moment.
Net income available to common shareholders in the quarter was $170 million or $0.08 per share versus a loss of $721
million or a loss per share of $0.32 in the fourth quarter of the prior year, resulting in an increase of $891 million or
$0.40 a share.
Now, before everyone celebrates a 125% increase in our earnings, let me give you the numbers adjusted for certain
items.
Net income available to common shareholders before certain items was $410 million versus the adjusted number in
2015 of $463 million, down $53 million or 11%. EPS before certain items was $0.18, down $0.03 versus the fourth

quarter of 2015.
Certain items in the fourth quarter of this year were an expense of $239 million, the largest of which was a $250
million non-cash impairment of our investment in Ruby. Although the majority of Ruby's capacity is contracted until
2021, the impairment was driven by a delay in expected West Coast natural gas demand to beyond that timeframe.
Certain items in 2015 were a net expense of $1.2 billion, also driven primarily by non-cash impairments.
Let's turn to the second page of financials now, which shows our DCF for the quarter and year-to-date and is reconciled
to our GAAP numbers in the earnings release. DCF is the primary financial measure on which management judges its
performance. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, our 2016 performance is consistent with the guidance provided
since April, updated for the SNG transaction.
DCF and adjusted EBITDA are approximately 4% below our budget, and net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA is 5.3 times.
We generated total DCF for the quarter of $1.147 billion versus $1.233 billion for the comparable period in 2015, down
$86 million or 7%.
There are a lot of moving parts, but if you want a very simple explanation, the segments are down $123 million,
primarily due to a reduction in our natural gas and CO2 segments as a result of the 50% SNG sale and lower realized
oil prices. Interest expense was reduced by $41 million versus the fourth quarter in the prior year as we used the
proceeds from the SNG transaction to repay debt. These two items, the change in the segments and the change in
interest expense, net to a change of $82 million or approximately 95% of the DCF change.
DCF per share was $0.51 versus $0.55 for the fourth quarter of the prior year, or down $0.04, almost all of which is
associated with the DCF variance I just walked you through. $0.51 in DCF per share results in $867 million of excess
distributable cash flow, above our $0.125 dividend for the quarter. For the full year, DCF per share was $2.02, resulting
in almost $3.4 billion of excess distributable cash flow above our dividend.
Now, let me give you a little more detail on the segment performance. The Natural Gas segment is down $114 million,
largely due to the sale of SNG. Increased contributions from TGP expansion projects placed in service largely offset
lower midstream volumes. CO2 decreased by approximately $54 million due to lower oil price and approximately 8%
lower production. As Steve mentioned, the lower production was partially driven by project deferrals, as well as
reallocating capital higher return projects with slower production response.
The Terminals segment was up $39 million or 15%, driven by increased contributions from our Jones Act tankers and
our joint venture with BP. Products was up 19%, impacted by higher volumes on KMCC and Double H pipes, and
favorable performance on our Transmix business. And [ph] KMC (19:05) was down about $5 million due to timing of
OpEx.
Versus our budget, as I previously mentioned, adjusted EBITDA was about 4% below budget, largely as a result of the
partial sale of SNG, lower midstream natural gas volumes in our Natural Gas segment, coal bankruptcy impact, and
reduced liquids throughput and ancillaries in our Terminals segment, lower crude and condensate volumes in our
products, and lower crude and condensate volumes in our Products segment. The individual segments ended up very
consistent with the guidance we gave you in the prior quarter. DCF was down approximately 4% with the negative
variance on adjusted EBITDA, somewhat offset by reduced interest in sustaining CapEx. With that, I'll move to the
balance sheet.
On the balance sheet, you will see total assets down about $3.8 billion. A huge driver of the reduction in assets was the
sale of SNG, and you can see that coming through primarily in the plant property and equipment line and the reduction
in goodwill. Net debt, we ended the quarter at $38.16 billion. That translates into net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA of 5.3
times, as I previously mentioned, consistent with the guidance we gave you.
For the year, debt has decreased $3.064 billion. And for the quarter, we had a reduction in debt of $1.088 billion. So, let
me reconcile that for you. In the quarter, $1.088 billion reduction in debt. We had $1.147 billion of DCF. We had about
$627 million in expansion CapEx, acquisitions and contributions to equity investments. We had divestiture proceeds of
$77 million plus $776 million of the SNG divestiture proceeds we had placed in escrow on September 30 to pay down

debt on October 1. So, those proceeds were released from escrow. And then we paid dividends of $279 million.
Working capital and other items were a very small source of cash.
For the year, a reduction in debt of $3.064 billion; DCF was $4.511 billion; expansion CapEx, acquisitions and
contributions to equity investments were a use of cash of $3.06 billion. That number's a little bit different from the
number you saw in the press release and that's because this is a cash number and the number in the press release is an
accrual number. We got divestiture proceeds of $2.94 billion, and the biggest piece of that was SNG. SNG, we got $1.4
billion in cash and then also $1.2 billion in debt was deconsolidated. The other contributors to divestiture proceeds, we
sold our Parkway Pipeline. We got $142 million. We got a promote on Utopia. And then we got some proceeds on
some small terminal sales.
Dividends for the year, $1.12 billion, and then working capital and other items was a use of cash of about $210 million,
and that's a whole laundry list of things including the make-whole payments that we paid on the debts that we repaid in
conjunction with the SNG transaction, timing on distributions on JVs, margin that went out the door, working capital
use on AP and AR, offset by a positive working capital on property tax.
So, with that, I'll turn it back to Rich.
Richard D. Kinder
Okay. Thank you. And, Jay, we're willing to take questions now.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Kristina Kazarian from Deutsche
Bank. Your line is open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hi, Kristina.
<Q - Kristina Kazarian>: Afternoon, guys and Kim. So, congrats on the TMX milestones. I've got a quick question
here, though. So, I know I'm still waiting for FID and you guys are thinking about what the final cost number will be.
But could you just talk a little bit about that in the context of the 6.7 times multiple you refer to when talking about the
project backlog and just generally how I should be thinking about the return on this project?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. It's a very good return on the project. If you think about our overall backlog multiple
being about 6.5 times EBITDA, it's a little bit better than that. Now, keep in mind that this capital spend is going on for
a while under this project, so that doesn't translate directly into an IRR, but it's a very attractive returning project and
what we invest in this project, wherever that number comes out, we earn on that number when we set the final cost.
<Q - Kristina Kazarian>: Perfect. That's helpful there. And then, could you give a quick update on Utopia as well? I
know the press release referencing on your progress made on the right-of-way. But how should I be thinking about
that?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. Actually, this call last quarter, we had just gotten an order from one of the courts in Ohio
finding that Utopia did not have eminent domain in that particular jurisdiction. We've since had mixed results, meaning
that some have found eminent domain rights, common carrier status, and public utility status in eminent domain. But
we can wait for all that to resolve itself. So, we, Ron McClain and his team, put together a strategy to go pursue the
right-of-way notwithstanding whatever the courts decide, and they've made a very good progress on that. And so, I
think the way to think about it is we believe we're going to get it done, and we've acquired a substantial amount of the
right-of-way and we believe we're going to complete it.

<Q - Kristina Kazarian>: All right. And last one for me. Can you guys talk a little bit more about this small but looks
like new JV with EnLink and what the genesis for this project and strategic venture is?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. So, we have a position in the SCOOP/STACK area that came as part of the Hiland
acquisition and some acreage dedications there or commitments there. And we looked for the most, the best returning
opportunity to get that system built out. And essentially, because there's additional processing capacity in the area, we
were able to come up with a much better project from an NPV standpoint than if we had laid our own pipe and built a
brand new processing facility. So, it turns out better for shareholders. We utilized some under-utilized capacity that our
partner had and ended up with a better result for our customers and shareholders.
<Q - Kristina Kazarian>: Perfect. I'll leave it there and save the tough ones for the Analyst Day next week. Thanks,
guys.

Operator
All right. Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Shneur Gershuni from UBS. Your line is open.
<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: Hi. Good afternoon, guys.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Good afternoon. How are you doing?
<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: Good. Just had a couple of quick questions. I guess, just sort of following up on the TMX
question. With the focus to a potential JV, I was wondering if you can sort of talk to us about how we should think
about expectations of what the promote could potentially look like. If I recall, with Utopia, you did about a 20%
promote, but at the same time when I look at where Canadian pipelines are trading at these days, it seems to be far
higher than that. Is there a scenario where we could see a promote that's well in excess of 20%? I was wondering if you
can sort of give us some color as to how to think about how it would work?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. Well, no. We specifically have not given specific guidance on that because, frankly, we
don't want to set a marker out there. We want to run a process and test that value, but we don't want potential
counterparties to see a number out there that they feel like if I hit that, then I'm done. And so, we think it's best for our
shareholders, best for the project overall if we just run the process.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: But we can say that the interest has been very strong.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Right.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: From potential JV partners, and also strong interest in an IPO as an alternative.
<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: Okay. Fair enough. And as a follow-up question, in your prepared remarks, Steve, you
sort of talked about green shoots. When I sort of think about the contracted nature of many of your assets in terms of
some MBCs and fee-based and so forth, I was wondering if you can talk about if these green shoots do continue where
we can potentially see a positive revision to your EBITDA guidance for 2017?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: What might affect our guidance? Well, actually we'll get into that in a fair amount of detail next
week at the call. I mean, I think one place that we've seen some value that actually has had an impact, we've got – not
saying it's going to exceed 2017 plan, but the return of some value to the storage assets, I think, has been a good sign
and that's a place that's a potential positive, but we'll get into some – and you could say that too about throughput on
our Products Pipelines, potentially throughput on to our Terminals facilities, et cetera, but we'll give you a pretty good

<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: Okay. And as a final follow-up, and I suspect this is a next week answer as well too, but
you sort of put out the return marker of 6.7 times excluding CO2 projects. I was wondering if you can remind us what
the target was for CO2-related projects and how much of the backlog is represented by CO2 these days?

<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. So, we have set kind of a minimum of 15% unlevered after-tax for CO2, and the projects
that we've approved recently were well in excess of that amount, so we're not trying to identify – we're trying to
identify good high returning projects, stress test them for different oil price scenarios, et cetera, but we set that as kind
of a minimum. And the total on EOR, I'm sorry, the total on CO2 is $1.4 billion of the $12 billion in the backlog.
<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: Perfect. Thank you very much, guys. I'm looking forward to seeing you next week.

All right. Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Brandon Blossman from Tudor, Pickering, Holt &
Company. Your line is open, sir. Go ahead.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Good afternoon.
<Q - Brandon Blossman>: Good afternoon, Rich. I guess, let's try a couple of LNG-related questions. Thinking about
the potential for an Elba JV, what are the metrics that will help you determine whether or not it makes sense to you? Is
it a return threshold? Is it a deleveraging metric? EBITDA or something else or a combination of all of the above?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Well, the reason for considering a JV on Elba is to address the balance sheet. So, we, of course,
take into account what the impact is going to be on our leverage metrics, but it's really a function of return. It's the
value that we get for someone buying in and participating in the project.
<Q - Brandon Blossman>: Okay. Fair enough. Another question. The Southwest Louisiana Supply Project, is that tied
to a Cameron online date or is that contractual February 2018?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Tom Martin?
<A - Thomas A. Martin>: Yeah. No. It is tied to their first in service on that project.
<Q - Brandon Blossman>: Okay. It looks like there's the potential you'll get your part done before them. And then just
very simplistically, on the CO2 projects north of 15% return, I assume that that's strip crude pricing, correct?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. We look at it on a strip, but then we also look at it with a sensitivity off of that strip to
make sure that – to look at what a NPV 15 breakeven price would need to be. So, we look at the pricing a couple of
different ways.
<Q - Brandon Blossman>: Okay. That's all for me. Thanks.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: [indiscernible] (32:41) comfortable with the potential, if there's downside risk in the pricing,
will we still have a nice return in economic project for us?
<Q - Brandon Blossman>: Makes sense. Thank you.

<Q - Jean Ann Salisbury>: Hi, guys. It's been in the news a lot that Trump is supportive of Keystone. I'm just
wondering what impact, if any, this has on the potential list of Trans Mountain shippers and maybe they're willingness
to pay.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. So, we don't think that it has much impact. We think that there are some significant
advantages to the Trans Mountain project. Of course, it is under contract with shippers and it is the project that we
believe is in the lead and gets people to tidewater where they can access a world market price. And so, there's a strong

interest in it, and that strong interest has continued after Trump's election and after his comments on Keystone.
<Q - Jean Ann Salisbury>: Great. Excellent. Thanks. And also on Trans Mountain, as you know, the Canadian dollar
has fallen pretty significantly since you started the Trans Mountain process. I think this is true, but I just want to make
sure that both the CapEx and the tariffs are in Canadian dollars, there's not really any ForEx impact either way.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. So, we carried the CapEx in our backlog in U.S. dollars, but yeah, the tariff is in
Canadian dollars, and the CapEx that gets communicated to our customers will be in Canadian dollars as well.
<Q - Jean Ann Salisbury>: So, just in terms of returns, there's not really ForEx exposure?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: No.
<Q - Jean Ann Salisbury>: Okay. Thank you. And then...
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Most of the spend is in Canadian dollars.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Right.
<Q - Jean Ann Salisbury>: Okay. Thank you. And then the last one is, you noted that a big reason that gas volumes
were down was because of Texas Intrastates, due to declining Eagle Ford. I'm just wondering how much room there is
for Permian gas growth to offset this or if you're kind of near your max for Permian gas flow?
<A - Thomas A. Martin>: On the Intrastates?
<Q - Jean Ann Salisbury>: Yeah.
<A - Thomas A. Martin>: Yeah, I think we're fairly full in the Intrastates system with what we can receive from the
Permian.
<Q - Jean Ann Salisbury>: Okay.
<A - Thomas A. Martin>: And Steve said earlier, I mean, I think we are approaching a bottom in the Eagle Ford
volumes. We expect those to flatten out towards the middle of the year and more than likely grow later in 2017.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: And Permian volumes, putting the Interstates aside for a moment, Permian volume growth does
tend to drive good value on our EPNG assets.
<A - Thomas A. Martin>: Right.

questions. The first, within Products Pipes, on that segment, exiting 4Q, and I realize we'll get more detail on this next
Wednesday, but exiting 4Q, were you guys more optimistic about the incremental uplift on NGL volumes and margins?
Or possibly what KMCC and Double H could do if capacity utilization improves into the first quarter?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Ron, do you want to?
<A - Ronald G. McClain>: Well, what we've seen recently is strong volumes in Q4 and January. And we expect that
to fall off a little bit, but I think we expect KMCC volumes to return, as Tom said, as we progress through the year and
maybe some drilling goes on.

<Q - Darren C. Horowitz>: Okay. And then if...
<A>: [indiscernible] (36:22). Go ahead.
<Q - Darren C. Horowitz>: Yeah. I'm just trying to get a sense of the expected pull-through and kind of how that
segment ultimately shapes up for year-over-year performance, thinking about the quarters. But I know we'll get into
that on Wednesday, so we can defer until then.
If I could just switch quickly over to CO2, within that 8% lower reported production estimate or actual, outside of those
project deferrals and that reallocation of capital to projects with slow production response that you guys discussed, was
there anything from a legacy organic field decline perspective that caught your attention? Maybe pattern conformance
or anything that we should be looking out for?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Look, there's a natural decline associated with those fields, and we continue to work for ways to
offset those declines. And historically we've been able to do that. And we're looking at, and we'll go over this next
week as well, looking for some opportunities to flatten out again or potentially even grow that production with some
new opportunities in those fields. I guess, I wouldn't say that there was anything unexpected in what we saw in our
results there.
<Q - Darren C. Horowitz>: Okay. And then last question for me. Kim, just a quick housekeeping one on that $250
million impairment on the equity investment in Ruby, recognizing obviously the non-cash nature of it. Can you
quantify for us maybe the magnitude and timing shift of that West Coast natural gas demand that drove the impairment
to be recognized? I'm just trying to get a sense of the drivers behind it.
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Sure. It's probably moved out three to four years.

Our next question is coming from the line of Keith Stanley from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
<Q - Keith Stanley>: Hi. Good afternoon.
<A>: Hi.
<Q - Keith Stanley>: How are you guys thinking about some of the legal challenges to the Trans Mountain project?
Just your thoughts there on where you expect to be challenged, how you're feeling about the legal case, and over what
timeline we should expect some of these challenges to play out?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Okay. Yeah. Several parts to that answer. So, one is legal challenges have already been filed.
Most of the legal challenges to-date related to the project have resulted positively for the project continuing. And a big
part of that, I think, is due to the fact that the Canadian government, provincially and federally, has taken a long time, a
lot of care, and gathered a lot of information and attached a lot of conditions and engaged in a lot of consultation in
order to make the orders that they ultimately issued very strong and hard to overturn on appeal. So, it was a lot of good
work building the record and listening to, responding to and putting in place the appropriate conditions to deal with the
legitimate concerns that have been raised.
Our view of the appeals, and we'll be filing our responses today or shortly to those that have already been filed, is that
they're unlikely to succeed on the merits on appeal, and that given the much higher standard for something like an
injunction, for example, they're unlikely to succeed in getting something that actually stops the project. So, I think the
credit goes to our team up there, but certainly the government engaging in such a thorough process, which ultimately
makes those orders very strong.
<Q - Keith Stanley>: Great. So, you sounded pretty confident there. One follow-up. Just any more color on the merits
when you're considering a JV partner for the project relative to an IPO of the Canadian business, just how you're

weighing what some of the positives and negatives would be of each option? And then also, how do we think about the
timing of when you would look to do a sell-down? Is it soon after FID? Or would you wait a little while on this?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Well, let's start out with the timing. We would anticipate doing something
contemporaneous with the FID or shortly thereafter. And as far as timing is concerned, I think that that will give you an
idea. There's a lot of pros and cons between the JVs and IPO, and we can get into more detail, perhaps next week, on
that. But I think the real salient point is that both are very good potential alternatives, and we think we're going to have
the ability to make a selection between the good and the better. So, we think that it's going to be a decision that benefits
our shareholders in the long run.

All right. Our next question is coming from the line of Craig Shere from Tuohy Brothers. Your line is open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Craig, how are you doing?
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Good. Thanks, Rich. Good afternoon. And congrats to Kim on the board position.
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Thanks.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Quick question. So, once you're done with the balance sheet repair, are you still planning on
financing half of ongoing growth CapEx that is separate from JV partners and the debt markets and the rest of operating
cash flow?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: I think that's a good summary. Obviously, we'll look at the circumstance as we go forward,
but clearly our predilection would be to get to the point where we have gotten our balance sheet in the right shape, and
we think we're getting a lot closer to that. That's what we've indicated. I think you'll see good results from JVs over the
course of this year that will move us in that direction. And when we've done that, then we will be able to maintain that
balance sheet, that debt-to-EBITDA ratio, and without putting out new equity, unless we desire to do so.
So, we'll be using excess coverage dollars above our dividend payout to fund the equity portion of the capital
expenditures. And while we'll look at all the alternatives as far as good new projects on a going forward basis,
obviously, Trans Mountain project is a little bit like that [indiscernible] (42:51) you saw about the pig going through
the boa constrictor. It is a huge pig going through, and when you get through on the other side, we anticipate our capital
expenditure levels will be less. We're still going to be looking for growth opportunities, but our capital expenditures
will not be as great.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Well, on that note, it didn't sound like there was maybe much added in terms of new project
origination in the fourth quarter. How comfortable are you, given the positive signs already discussed, that maybe we
can start to move over the next couple of years back towards that $2 billion to $3 billion in annual project origination?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. And that could happen. I mean, like we've always said, we will continue to look for good
high returning projects. We believe that the best way to deliver value is to invest it in good high returning projects. But
I think our current view is that we're likely to generate cash as these projects come on, we're likely to generate cash in
excess of the equity portion of those investment opportunities. And in those circumstances, we believe the best way to
return value to shareholders is with an increasing dividend.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Understood. Yeah. If you're only having to cover half of that out of your operating cash flow,
you definitely have a lot free.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: That's right.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: So, last question. Any update – I suppose that you might touch on some of the specifics on the
segments next week, but any update about prospects for a contracting remaining unhedged Jones Act tankers?

<A - Richard D. Kinder>: So, 11 of the 16 are under long-term contracts.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Right.

<Q - Craig K. Shere>: I got you. So, all the exposure is for what's – in terms of anything meaningful, what's yet to be
delivered?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: And some are existing charter terminations as well, as ships roll off of charter. And look, I
think we've been very active in re-chartering vessels as charter expirations come up and I think have been pretty
successful in what is no doubt a down market in making sure that our ships have charters even if it's at a reduced rate.
And that will continue to be our goal through the year. I think also – we'd hoped that we and the other large vessel
companies would be able to take a little business from the ATB market, and I think we're beginning to see – we're
competing for that business as well.

Go ahead, please.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Good afternoon.
<Q - Danilo Juvane>: Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you. I wanted to circle back on the question on Ruby. So, there was
a write-down on Ruby this quarter. I think, if I'm not mistaken, MEP was written down last quarter. Are there any
expectations of additional write-downs going forward, Fayetteville perhaps?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Yeah. I think our carrying value on Fayetteville is like $100 million. So, it's got a
relatively low carrying value. But look, I mean, we have to assess our assets every quarter and to make sure that we're
carrying them at the right value. I don't see significant risk of impairments going forward, but we will have to make that
assessment based on market conditions at the end of every quarter.
<Q - Danilo Juvane>: Got it. And the last question for me. Most of my questions have been hit. What was the CO2

Okay. Our next question is coming from the line of Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan Chase. Your line is open. Go ahead,
please.
<Q - Jeremy B. Tonet>: Good afternoon.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: How are you doing?
<Q - Jeremy B. Tonet>: Good. Thanks. I just want to go back to TMX here and just wanted to clarify. Do you see any
situation where you would go it alone with this project? Or at this point you feel you have a lot of certainty with
regards to the JV or IPO options that you feel pretty certain that that would happen at this point?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: It's the latter. It's the latter. I mean, that's an option to us, but I think, as I said at the very
beginning, we think that syndicating this is the right answer overall. And we think that the interest level is high enough
and strong enough for whichever route that we take that we're going to be successful in that syndication.
<Q - Jeremy B. Tonet>: Great. Thanks. And then, could you just walk us through what you think might be the optimal
amount to monetize at this point and how you kind of think about gives and takes there?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. It varies. It varies so much depending on the structure that's pursued. And it's a broad
enough range that I can't really give you a specific answer there.
<Q - Jeremy B. Tonet>: Okay. Great. And then just a housekeeping one there. What was the last number for the
CapEx spend there? How current is that?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah, we have been carrying – so, it is – as we said in the earlier discussion, we have been
carrying it at 5.4 and if you did – U.S. So, when you see it in our backlog, it's sitting there at 5.4 U.S. and if you
converted that at the current exchange rate it's about six U.S.
<Q - Jeremy B. Tonet>: Great. And when was that last updated?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: We carry that same number for a while and what's happened is, just by kind of happenstance as
the FX rates have changed, it's stayed reasonably closely in line so we haven't updated the U.S. dollar number since the
beginning of the project for our U.S. investors, but it was done at a time when the loonie and the dollar were at par.
<Q - Jeremy B. Tonet>: Okay. Then no material cost or anything had changed much, but – and then just one last one
as far as shipper contracts. Is everything set there? Is there any deadlines where things go past certain time frames that
that could be changed or anything like that?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. No. To be clear on the earlier question, costs have changed. Costs have changed, and
we're in the process of doing now an increase and is communicating that final cost estimate to shippers, which we
expect to have prepared and delivered to them in early February. That's the current thinking. And then there is a 30-day
period of shipper review where they examine the underlying cost because once that cost is set, that is investment, that is
what we earn on. So, there will be a review process over the 30 subsequent days after we give them the final cost
estimate.
<Q - Jeremy B. Tonet>: Great. And all the shippers are fully committed. Are there any kind of drop-dead dates where
contracts would reopen or anything like that?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: If the costs exceed a certain level, then there is an opportunity for customers to reconsider their
position and turn their capacity back. But, as I said at the beginning, there is enough interest from current shippers
potentially in expanding their position, as well as from other potential customers who are not currently shippers
wanting to come in, that we remain very confident that capacity gets placed at the level it is today.
<Q - Jeremy B. Tonet>: That makes a lot of sense. I would expect there to be very high demand. And then just one
last one, if I could. As far as – it seems like we're starting to see the makings of some industry consolidation out there,

kind of small players can fold it in, and GP/LP consolidation continuing to pick up pace after you guys. I'm just
wondering how you see Kinder Morgan playing within that context going forward and whether that could be an
opportunity to expedite delivering, if you could do an all-equity deal there?

and implied in your question, we're looking at DCF accretion, but we are also looking at leverage improvement as well.
That narrows the field, frankly. That narrows the field, but we continue to look actively in that market for opportunities.

All right. Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of John Edwards from Credit Suisse. Your line is open,
sir. Go ahead.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hey, John. How are you doing?
<Q - John Edwards>: Doing good, Rich. And congrats on the approvals on Trans Mountain.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Thank you. We think they're really significant.
<Q - John Edwards>: Yes. Just a couple of clarifications. Can you share with us or remind us how much has been
spent on Trans Mountain development to-date? And then in terms of the cost overruns or if there is cost overrun, it
sounds like the way things are structured with the shippers that they would – in terms of what they would pay on the
shipping costs, they in effect bear a portion or all or maybe if you can share if there's any cost overruns, how that
works?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Okay. So, starting with the first question. It's roughly CAD 600 million gross and so there's also
– remember, part of our development costs are covered. It's over a 10-year period, but they're covered under our what
we call our firm 50 dock charges. So, years ago, we signed up shippers to give them access to the firm's space across
our existing West Ridge Dock and those proceeds go toward the defraying of development costs. And over the life of
those charges, it's about CAD 250 million, CAD 255 million. So, you have to net that off, and those don't all come at
the same time that we're doing the development. As I said, some of them come over time. But it's CAD 600 million
roughly, gross, and then net, a firm CAD 50 million off of that.
On how the cost structure works, once the final cost estimate is delivered and we proceed toward project execution,
there are two categories of costs. There's a set of uncapped costs and those are costs where, if there is an overrun, then
that overrun would be to the project's account, okay? Then there is a set of uncapped costs, and those overruns, if there
are any, those overruns would be added to the investment in the project and we would earn on those. So, it's not just
flowthrough. It becomes part of the investment and we earn on it.
And those tend to be, as you'd expect, the most predictable elements of the build. They apply to things like steel costs
which are not going to be an issue, aboriginal consultation, ultimate consultation and accommodation costs, and two
particular parts of the bills that are likely to be difficult and unpredictable when we're forecasting it.
Having said all that, what we're delivering to shippers will be a P95. So, we feel like with all the work that's been done,
we have narrowed the estimate both on capped and uncapped costs to a very narrow level, and at a 95% probability,
meaning a 95% probability that we come in at or under the number that we deliver, okay? So, we think we've done a lot
of work to make sure we have our arms around what the cost risks are there and are taking them into account in the
final cost estimate.
<Q - John Edwards>: Okay. And just to help us out, about what percentage is capped and what percentage is
uncapped?

<A - Steven J. Kean>: I don't have that off-hand. The majority is going to be capped. But I don't have the specific
percentage of the uncapped portion. But the substantial majority of the costs will be in the capped category.
<Q - John Edwards>: Okay. That's really helpful. So, it sounds like there's some kind of a sharing on the uncapped,
and then the capped is basically predictable costs that are locked in. So, that's the idea, correct?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Well, yeah. And on the uncapped, to be clear on that too, there's a possibility, since these are
the more unpredictable category of costs, that they come in lower, and if they come in lower the shippers get the benefit
of that lower cost as well.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: It just rolls into the totals, John. If it comes in higher on the uncapped portion, the total is
increased. If it comes in lower, the total is decreased.
<Q - John Edwards>: Okay. That makes sense. And then just on the schedule. I think the last schedule you shared
with us was fourth quarter 2019 or end of 2019 start-up. Is that factoring in any expected litigation? How should we
think about that?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. We still view the project in-service as the end of 2019, so really think of 2020 as being
when the revenue starts to arrive. And the schedule we're building takes into account what we think we're going to
encounter, including the need to deal with litigation as we proceed.
<Q - John Edwards>: Okay. Great. And then the other thing I just wanted to touch on briefly was just, every now and
again we hear these rumors flying around about sale of the KMI E&P business. You had some discussion last year. It
sounds like we're hearing some rumors fly again. We've always thought about it, that you would sell down if it could be
effectively balance sheet accretive, otherwise you wouldn't do it. Any other comments you could share with us in that
regard?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: We don't comment on that kind of transaction activity, but I can tell you the same things we
talked about, I think, last quarter and we've talked about in conferences in between, which is that we like that business,
we get good returns on that business, we've built a particular proficiency in that business in the EOR part of it, the
midstream part of it, the source and transportation part of it. We integrated forward into EOR because we've got a
scarce resource and that is CO2, and that resource is essential to getting certain barrels of oil out of the ground and
we've figured out how to do it. So, we're happy to have that business.
We are a shareholder-directed company and we entertain, in any context really, something that will give us the
opportunity to increase shareholder value, including the disposition of an asset that we own, as we've shown through
this year. But again, this is a business that we like. We don't have to do anything with it. The considerations around it in
addition to the ones that you mentioned, John, have to do with, if you did a disposition and likely it would be DCF
dilutive, and is the multiple uplift that you get on the remaining cash flows, because they're viewed as more secure,
enough so that the day following your investors are better off. And so that's a very important constraint as well.
<Q - John Edwards>: Okay. That's great. That's it for me. Thanks so much.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Thank you, John.
Operator
All right. Our next question is coming from the line of Tom Abrams from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Go
ahead, please.
<Q - Tom Abrams>: Thanks a lot. A couple of segment questions. One is back on CO2, is the 8% decline something
that is, given your current spending and projects timing, is that 8% something we should assume for the next few
quarters or is it something that accelerates or even declines?

<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. The way we invest in that business is not based on a decline rate or offsetting a decline
rate or holding a decline rate or reversing it. It's really based on individual projects and whether the incremental oil
that's produced for that capital is going to pay us a handsome enough return for us to make that investment. So, that's
the way we do it. And we don't plan for and can't forecast for you a targeted decline rate or a targeted level of
production. We address the project opportunities as they come forward and fund the ones that make economic sense.
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: And that being said, we will go through the 2017 budget next week, and I think you'll
see in there that 2017 production is relatively flat versus 2016. And then to answer the question that was asked earlier
about the CapEx for the fourth quarter on CO2, $73 million.
<Q - Tom Abrams>: Thanks for that. The other question I had left was on the Natural Gas Pipelines segment, just
trying to understand, a lot of moving parts there, but if you took SNG out of both years or both fourth quarters, what
would be the comparison?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: If you take SNG out of both fourth quarters?
<Q - Tom Abrams>: My impression is it's partly in 2015, but below somewhere in 2016. Just wanted to clarify the
rate of change there.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: In other words, you want a number that reflects SNG – even though SNG wasn't joint ventured
until September of this year, what would be the number Q4 of 2015 to Q4 of 2016 if SNG were out of both quarters?
<Q - Tom Abrams>: Correct. Just what the underlying is doing.
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: The underlying business in SNG is relatively flat.
<Q - Tom Abrams>: Okay.
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: SNG's underlying business, to make that clear. Year-to-date, I think the sale probably
has an impact – on the segment, let me make sure that's clear, on the segment versus our plan of a little over $100
million. Now, net to the company, the impact is much less because there's a piece of the G&A that goes away, there's a
piece of the sustaining cap that goes away and...
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Interest.
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: And you have substantial reduction in interest because we use the proceeds to pay down
debt.
<Q - Tom Abrams>: Great. All right. I look forward to seeing you next week. Thanks a lot.
Operator
All right. Next in the queue is coming from the line of Sunil Sibal from Seaport Global Securities. Your line is open.
Go ahead, please.
<Q - Sunil K. Sibal>: Hi. Good afternoon, guys, and congrats on the hitting the Trans Mountain milestones. Most of
my questions have been heard, but just one clarification. When you look at the Natural Gas Pipelines segment, it seems
like the TGP and NGPL kind of had a good uptake year-over-year while the other segments were probably a bit – other
pipelines were pretty flattish. I'm wondering if you could talk about what kind of upticks you're seeing in NGPL and
[indiscernible] (1:02:48) pipelines and flows of cash contributions?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. So, I...
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Yeah.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Project driven, I would think, largely.

<A - Steven J. Kean>: Project driven on TGP.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Yeah.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: But if you think about the prospects for those systems, just looking at the underlying
fundamentals of the flows, et cetera, TGP continues to be a system that grows in value. The return of growth in
Marcellus and Utica will just drive that further. It's participating in Mexico market demand expansion, it's participating
in LNG markets expansion, and it's participating in the power sector and has had record power days, I think, this year,
if I remember right.
Same thing with SNG, very strong NGPL. NGPL's also benefiting from bonds coming in from REX, on REX-West.
Well, that's a Marcellus/Utica phenomenon as well.
And then coal on the downside from Sabine Pass, on the bottom of the system from Sabine Pass, and some incremental
power demand and growth into Mexico.
So, all three of those systems, I think, are doing well, have good underlying fundamentals.
<Q - Sunil K. Sibal>: Any update on the recontracting for some of the contracts that are rolling off on NGPL?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Contracts rolling off on NGPL, generally the recontracting has gone really well.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Have gone well. Some of our bigger customers who actually have long-term commitments
as long as 10 years, but the regular tender on some of the more traditional LDC customers are every three years and
we're still seeing that at or better rates in some instances than we've seen in the past. And there seems to be good
interest in the projects that we're working on in NGPL as well. So, I think the prospects are very good for all the
reasons that Steve just mentioned as far as the drivers.
<Q - Sunil K. Sibal>: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Operator
