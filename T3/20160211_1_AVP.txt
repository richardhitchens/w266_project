MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Holly and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome
everyone to Avon's Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute
to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator
Instructions]
I'll now turn the conference over to Adam Zerfass, Director, Investor Relations. Mr. Zerfass, you may begin your
conference.
Adam Zerfass
Thank you, Holly. Good morning and thank you for joining us to review Avon's fourth quarter and full-year 2015
results. I'm here with Sheri McCoy, Avon's CEO; and Jim Scully, Executive Vice President, COO and CFO. Sheri will
make some opening remarks including her perspective on our overall performance and milestones for 2016. Jim will
then take you through our fourth quarter and full-year results as well as some 2016 priorities. Then, we will have our
usual Q&A session.
With that, I refer you to our non-GAAP reconciliations, which are available in our release located in the Investor
Relations section of our website. A usual on the call, we will focus on these adjusted non-GAAP financial measures.
Our call will also contain forward-looking statements that concern our business and financial strategies including our
Transformation Plan, cost actions, and savings, performance trends and the impact of foreign currency, taxes, and tax
rates. These statements involve risks and uncertainties, which are detailed in the Cautionary Statement available on our
Investor Relations website and in our SEC filings.
I'll now hand the call over to Sheri.

Sheri McCoy
Thanks, Adam. Good morning and thank you for joining the call today. There are three topics I will cover this morning.
First, I will provide my high-level perspective on Avon's 2015 fourth quarter and full-year results, which were in line
with our previously shared outlook.
Second, I will highlight and address key areas from our recent Investor Day. And third, I'll cover seven specific
milestones from our transformation plans for you to track over the course of 2016. Jim will then take you through the
financial results in more detail.
Before we get started, I want to remind you that we announced the deal with Cerberus Capital Management on
December 17. A key component of this transaction is the separation of the North American business from Avon
Products, Inc. North America will become a privately held entity, majority owned and managed by Cerberus. Because
of this, the North America business is reported as discontinued operations, and is not reflected in the revenue and
operating profit we now report.
As a result of this reporting method change, the portion of global expenses that were allocated to North America now
remain in Global. As a result, there was a small negative impact on Avon Products' 2015 reported operating margin.
I will note, however, that on an overall basis, if we were to include North America, Avon's results for the year were in
line with our expectations, and we are pleased that the North American business met our goal of being profitable for the
year.
Let me start with my perspective on the fourth quarter. Please note that these results exclude North America. Our
operational performance was consistent with expectations. Fourth quarter revenue was $1.6 billion, up 3% in constant
dollars excluding Liz Earle. Revenue would have grown 6% when also excluding Brazilian IPI tax and VAT credit.
I was pleased that active representative trends continued to improve, growing 2% in the fourth quarter. On the other
hand, our operating margin continues to suffer, primarily due to FX. The adjusted operating margin was 6%, down 420
basis points year-on-year. Jim will provide some additional detail, but I want to note that while we did see some minor
easing of currency pressure in third quarter, the trend reversed in the fourth quarter.
From a geographic perspective, Latin America came in about as expected, with flat constant-dollar revenue
performance year-on-year. Brazil had a more challenging quarter than anticipated. However, I was pleased with
Mexico's performance delivering 6% growth on a constant-currency basis driven by strong average order growth. For
the Latin American region, excluding VAT credits in 2014 and IPI tax in 2015, constant-dollar revenue would have
grown approximately 6%, due in equal parts to inflationary pricing and underlying operating performance. Active
Representatives declined slightly due to Venezuela and Argentina.
Specific to Brazil, despite the weak economy, the challenging political environment and reduced consumer
consumption, the team is doing a good job of maintaining the underlying health of the business. Excluding IPI and
VAT tax impact, constant-dollar revenue was down 2%. What we see in Brazil is Active Representatives are growing;
however, average orders declining as women are tightening their wallets in the current economic environment.
Turning to EMEA. I'm pleased with the overall performance of the region driven by strong results in Russia and South
Africa. Across the region, the teams delivered strong Active Representative growth of 8%. UK was down for the
quarter but we are seeing modest improvement as the team focuses on growing average order and increasing the
number of sales leaders. We expect this improvement to continue moving forward.
In Asia Pacific, the Philippines had another strong quarter. However, this was not enough to offset declines in other
markets, mainly China.
Now turning to the full-year 2015, I'm pleased that our key local markets drove steady improvements in overall
performance. One of our priorities for the year was to improve Active Representative growth in our top markets. We
made significant progress in this area. The majority of our top markets are growing in constant currency and are
profitable. We have strong management teams in place locally, and they are performing well; some of them in

extremely challenging environments, and I'm very proud of these teams.
From a financial perspective, our full-year revenue was $6.2 billion, an increase of 3% in constant dollars, excluding
the divestiture of Liz Earle. Revenue would have grown 5% when also excluding VAT IPI Brazilian tax items. Again,
these results exclude North America. Importantly, we improved year-on-year Active Representative trends, with
full-year growth of 1%, and the ending representative trend is favorable to prior year.
From a category perspective in constant dollars, Beauty grew 3% for the full year, with 7% growth in Fragrance, flat
performance in Skincare and 1% growth in Color. Fashion & Home grew 5% year-on-year, and we were pleased with
our innovation and new product execution, with strong performance across all three Beauty categories, including
standout performance by our Attraction fragrance, a new Ultimate serum, and Big & False mascara.
Our adjusted operating margin for the year was 5.7%. Results were negatively impacted by Brazilian VAT credits in
2014 and IPI tax in 2015 of approximately 180 basis points, and unfavorable impact from foreign currency of
approximately 480 basis points.
Also important in 2015, we introduced Avon's new brand positioning, Beauty for a Purpose, in all markets across the
globe. This has been exceptionally well received by consumers and representatives, and we look forward to building
upon this in 2016.
We significantly increased our social media and digital capabilities, and we began rolling out our upgraded IT systems
in some key markets, which is critical to the implementation of improved service models and a more contemporary
social selling model.
On the other hand, the FX pressure we faced over the course of the year was extreme. While we continued to take out
costs, it wasn't enough to offset the FX, which had nearly $0.5 billion impact on adjusted operating profit in 2015
alone. Over the course of 2015, we also strengthened our balance sheet, including restructuring our working capital
facility, divesting Liz Earle, and addressing our 2016 maturities.
And our most important accomplishment of 2015 was setting a new path forward for Avon. This includes our strategic
partnership with Cerberus, which provides a solution for Avon North America, and provides funds, focus, and
resources for our international markets.
Overall, while we faced significant macro issues, we made solid operational progress in 2015, and we executed a
transaction that is a catalyst to position the company for sustainable, profitable growth.
Turning now to the plans we shared with you at Investor Day. First, I want to thank all of you who attended. I'd like to
reiterate the key elements of our three-year transformation plan to drive shareholder value. As we execute the plan, we
will balance aggressive cost takeout with investing in growth and assure that we have the financial flexibility for both
the short and long term.
At a high level, the three components of the plan are: invest in growth, take out costs, and improve financial resilience.
Let me briefly comment on the three areas. First, growth. In the area of branding and products, we will be investing in
our new Beauty for a Purpose positioning in our key markets. We'll also have detailed pricing guidelines in place, and
we'll be monitoring these in our top 10 markets. Work is under way to build our top 40 brands, and we will continue to
introduce and support innovative new beauty products.
In the area of representative engagement, we've instituted improved on-boarding programs, and our top 10 markets are
executing or preparing to implement representative segmentation. In the area of service model evolution, we have a
three-year implementation plan. Our markets are starting from different places.
We have newer Avon markets, such as Poland and Turkey, leading the pack and legacy markets like the UK fully under
way but at earlier stages. In EMEA, the digital tools are live in many markets across the region, and the first phase of
our OMS implementation will be complete in our major markets over the next year.

As it relates to the service model evolution in Brazil, I know this received attention at Investor Day, so let me take a
step back and provide some additional perspective on what is included in the service model evolution. There are
essentially two broad components. First, there's the order management system, which is the back office component we
discussed in January. And second, a suite of digital tools that allow the representative and field manager to better
manage her business and improve consumer access.
From our experience in Canada, we know that implementation of both needs to be phased strategically to drive
productivity rather than create disruption.
In Brazil, we already have digital capabilities in place, and this year, we'll be taking another big step forward with the
launch of a comprehensive set of representative tools with full mobile capability. This will significantly improve many
aspects of the representative experience, including how she places an order, tracks her earnings, and build her business.
We're also pilot testing pickup points and planning for on-demand delivery for our top sellers. And from there, we'll
systematically work through the remainder of the service model evolution plan at a pace that best supports the business.
Ultimately, we do need the new OMS to deliver the full potential of social selling. And the new OMS system provides
increased flexibility, speed, and cost savings. However, we are not constrained today from making significant
improvements to the representative experience and operational efficiency. Our IT road map for Brazil fully supports
our growth plans. It is strategic and well-paced starting with the representative facing areas and then moving to the
back end and OMS.
In the second area, cost takeout, we committed to cutting $350 million over a three-year period. We have specific plans
in place and are already executing on the changes to the operating model, and we have significant work underway that
enables us to address the supply chain costs and underutilization.
And our third area, improving financial resilience. We will strengthen our balance sheet with the Cerberus investment,
the suspension of the dividend, repayment of debt and improved operational performance.
As we reviewed at Investor Day, our long-term goals are to deliver mid-single-digit constant revenue growth and low
double-digit operating margin.
Before I hand it over to Jim for a more detailed financial discussion, I wanted to share some perspective with you on
what you can expect from us in 2016. To begin, we are on track to close the Cerberus transaction over the next couple
of months. We've already begun executing our transformation plan, and there are a lot of moving parts, and I thought it
would be helpful to share with you seven key milestones for the year.
First, we will deliver 1% to 2% Active Representative growth for the company and continue to improve the Ending
Representative trends.
Second, from a geographic perspective, we will continue to drive improved overall performance in our top 10 markets.
We anticipate that Brazil will continue to be a challenging environment. We expect our Brazilian team to maintain the
underlying health of the business while keeping our representatives engaged. For the year, we expect Brazil to be
relatively flat with some ups and downs over the course of the year. We expect Russia to continue to grow, Mexico will
continue to deliver solid performance, and we anticipate that the UK will continue on its current trend of improvement,
and deliver flat to slightly positive growth by year-end. We will also have a resolution for our China business.
Third, we'll be pricing with inflation and monitoring this closely in our top 10 markets, and we will continue to invest
in the brand with Avon's new Beauty for a Purpose positioning to drive consumer and representative engagement.
Fourth, we will execute more cost takeout, $70 million in 2016. This will be driven largely by the changes in our
operating model and enterprise efficiencies in supply chain.
Fifth, in the area of our service model evolution, we will continue to make significant progress in advancing our EMEA
markets and we'll be well underway in Brazil.

Sixth, as it relates to our IT agenda, we expect to have completed the full IT infrastructure transition to HPE by
year-end for all Avon markets. This transition will improve enterprise efficiency and provide better operational
flexibility. Importantly, it also allows us – it allows our own technology resources to focus on the service model
evolution.
And seventh, we will continue to improve our balance sheet with the Cerberus investment and opportunistic debt
repayment.
Before I hand it over to Jim, I want to close by saying, I'm confident that the actions we've taken in the past year
position us to accelerate the pace of change, transform our business and improve our competitiveness.
Jim?
James S. Scully
Thank you, Sheri, and thanks again to all of you for joining the call today.
In terms of my prepared remarks today, I will start with a review of our fourth quarter performance. I will then provide
an overview of our full-year 2015 results, and finally I will wrap up with a summary of the key priorities for 2016.
Before getting into the results, I'd like to provide two reminders. First, as Sheri mentioned, given that we entered into a
separation agreement to sell 80.1% of the North America business, it is now being reported as a discontinued operation.
This means North America results are no longer in our revenue or operating profit from continuing operations for all
periods presented.
However, global expense amounts that were previously allocated to North America remain in the SG&A of continuing
operations as unallocated global expenses. We have included a supplemental schedule to our press release that shows
what our full-year revenue and adjusted operating margin would have been had North America remained and continued
continuing operations.
And second, similar to last quarter, in order to provide a better understanding of the underlying performance, we have
once again added a supplemental schedule to our press release. This schedule calls out the impact of the divestiture of
Liz Earle and certain Brazil tax items, specifically the new IPI tax on cosmetics in Brazil that began May 1 of 2015,
and the recognition of Brazilian bad credits in 2014 associated with previous periods that did not reoccur in 2015.
Turning to our fourth quarter performance, reported revenue declined 20% due to the negative impact of foreign
exchange. Excluding Liz Earle from the prior year, constant dollar revenue would have grown 3%. In addition, the
combined impact of the Brazilian IPI tax in 2015 and the Brazilian VAT credits in 2014 adversely impacted our fourth
quarter constant-dollar revenue growth by an estimated three points.
Excluding the impacts of Liz Earle and these Brazil tax items, revenue would have grown in constant dollars by
approximately 6%. Our high inflation markets, Venezuela and Argentina, contributed a combined three points to this
growth. Active Representatives were up 2% despite the negative impact from the Latin American market experiencing
high inflation.
Average order declined by 1%. This metric was negatively impacted by the Brazilian VAT credits recognized in 2014,
the IPI tax in 2015, and the divestiture of Liz Earle. These negative impacts were partially offset by pricing actions in
all regions as price mix grew 3%.
Adjusted gross margin declined 270 basis points to 58.8%. The Brazilian VAT credits in 2014 and IPI tax in 2015
adversely impacted the year-over-year comparison of adjusted gross margin by approximately 70 basis points.
Excluding these impacts, adjusted gross margin would have decreased 200 basis points.
The favorable net impact of pricing and mix as well as lower supply chain costs were not enough to offset the
approximate 350 basis point negative impact of foreign currency.

Adjusted operating margin declined 420 basis points to 6%. The Brazilian VAT credit in 2014 and IPI tax in 2015
negatively impacted the year-over-year comparison of adjusted operating margin by approximately 210 basis points.
Excluding the impact of these items, adjusted operating margin would have decreased approximately 210 basis points.
This decrease was primarily driven by foreign currency, which negatively impacted our results by approximately 530
basis points. These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by the favorable net impact of price mix as well as
benefits from continued cost-saving initiatives.
Moving to tax, the adjusted effective tax rate was negatively impacted by the country mix of earnings and the inability
to recognize additional deferred tax assets in various jurisdictions related to our current-year operating results.
The year-over-year difference in the adjusted effective tax rate caused an estimated $0.06 per share negative impact on
adjusted earnings per share. The adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be volatile on a quarterly basis due to the
country mix of earnings.
As a reminder, there are four key factors which drive the majority of the volatility in our tax rate. First, the country mix
of our earnings; second, the inability to recognize tax benefits in some countries where we have current period losses as
a result of being in a position where we were recording valuation allowances on these countries' deferred tax assets;
third, we are recording the cost of withholding taxes on cash repatriations required to service corporate needs; and
finally, the absolute level of pre-tax earnings.
Fourth quarter adjusted EPS from continued operations was $0.00 per diluted share compared with $0.21 of adjusted
earnings per share a year ago. Two items had a significant impact on this year-over-year change. First, the negative
impact of foreign currency drove an estimated $0.16 per share decline. And second, as previously mentioned, the
year-over-year change in the adjusted effective tax rate reduced EPS by an estimated $0.06 per share.
I will now provide more details on our fourth quarter results by region, starting with Latin America. Fourth quarter
reported revenue declined 26%, while in constant dollars, revenue was relatively unchanged. Constant-dollar growth
was adversely impacted by approximately two points due to the Brazilian VAT credits recognized in 2014, and
approximately four points due to the Brazilian IPI tax in 2015. Excluding the impact of these items, constant-dollar
revenue would have grown approximately 6%, driven by pricing.
Active Representatives were down 1%, negatively impacted by continued declines in Venezuela and Argentina, while
average order increased 1%.
Latin America adjusted operating margin was 6.3%, down 250 basis points from the year ago. The Brazilian VAT and
IPI tax items negatively impacted adjusted operating margin by approximately 410 basis points. If we were to exclude
the impact of these items, adjusted operating margin would have increased approximately 160 basis points.
The favorable impact of pricing and mix, as well as cost reductions, more than offset the approximate 510 basis-point
adverse impact from foreign currency.
Turning to Brazil, constant dollar revenue declined 14%. The VAT credits in 2014 and IPI tax in 2015 negatively
impacted constant dollar revenue growth by approximately 12 points. Excluding the impact of these items, constant
dollar revenue declined approximately 2%, driven by lower average order. These negative average order impacts were
partially offset by a solid growth in Active Representatives which benefited from a successful third quarter recruiting
crusade.
In Mexico, revenue grew 6% in constant dollars. The growth was driven by an increase in average order, which more
than offset a modest decrease in Active Representatives. Mexico's Beauty business continued to grow in the fourth
quarter, and the Fashion & Home business, which is an important part of our Mexican business, returned to growth.
Moving to fourth quarter results for EMEA, reported revenue declined 13% while constant dollar revenue increased
6%. The divestiture of Liz Earle negatively impacted constant dollar revenue growth by approximately 4 points.
Excluding the impact of this item, constant dollar revenue would have grown approximately 10%, driven by Active
Representatives due to strength in Russia, South Africa and Turkey. The underlying business and operational

fundamentals remain strong in this region.
EMEA adjusted operating margin was 12.5%, down 140 basis points, as significant adverse foreign currency negatively
impacted the results by an approximate 540 basis points. This negative impact was partially offset by the benefit from
revenue leverage, cost savings, and increased pricing.
Turning to Russia, constant dollar revenue rose 29%, driven by balanced growth from Active Representatives and
average order as the team maintained momentum in recruiting and retention and continued to increase price. Constant
dollar revenue in the UK declined 7%, driven by a decline in Active Representatives, while average order was flat
compared with the prior year.
Moving to Asia Pacific, reported revenue declined 16% while constant dollar revenue declined 8%. Average order
declined 8% and Active Representatives were flat year-over-year. The Philippines continued to grow, increasing 5% in
constant dollars, driven by an increase in Active Representatives. However, it was not enough to offset declines in
other markets, most significantly China, which declined 41% in constant dollars.
Asia Pacific adjusted operating margin was 5.6%, down 60 basis points compared with the prior year. This was
primarily driven by unfavorable price mix, which was partially offset by lower fixed expenses as we continued to
benefit from cost reduction actions.
Please see our press release for a further discussion of the six adjustments we made to our GAAP results in the quarter,
which were: costs to implement restructuring, Venezuelan special items, pension settlement charges, a non-cash
impairment charge related to the company's Egypt business, transaction-related costs associated with the planned
separation of North America that were included in continuing operations, and income tax benefits recognized as a result
of the implementation of foreign tax planning strategies.
I will now provide an overview of our full-year results. Reported revenue declined 19% due to the negative impact of
foreign exchange. Excluding Liz Earle from both years, constant dollar revenue would have grown 3%.
In addition, the combined impact of the Brazilian VAT credit in 2014 and the IPI tax in 2015 adversely impacted our
constant dollar revenue growth by an estimated two points. Excluding the impacts of Liz Earle and these Brazilian tax
items, revenue would have grown in constant dollars by approximately 5%. Venezuela and Argentina contributed a
combined 3 points to this growth.
Growth in constant dollar revenue for 2015 was driven by both an increase in Active Representatives and higher
average order. In fact, despite a continued decline in Active Representatives in Venezuela and Argentina, Active
Representatives grew 1%. And as I just mentioned, average order grew as well. This metric was up 1%, despite being
adversely impacted by the Brazilian VAT credit recognized in 2014 and the IPI tax in 2015, as well as the divestiture of
Liz Earle.
Rounding out the discussion on 2015 revenue drivers, it is worth noting that price mix grew 4% due to our focus on
selectively increasing prices and shifting mix throughout 2015.
Let's now move to our 2015 adjusted operating margin results. Year over year, adjusted operating margin declined 360
basis points to 5.7%. The year-over-year comparison was adversely impacted by approximately 180 basis points due to
the Brazilian VAT credits in 2014 and the IPI tax in 2015 that I discussed previously. Excluding impacts of these items,
adjusted operating margin would have decreased 180 basis points.
The decline was primarily driven by approximately 480 basis points of adverse foreign exchange, of which roughly 280
basis points of the decline was transaction and 200 basis points was translation. While we were able to offset the
unfavorable impact of transaction foreign exchange through the combination of pricing actions, revenue leverage and
continued benefits from our cost saving initiatives, it was not enough to mitigate the negative impact of foreign
currency translation.
For full year 2015, adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $0.01 per share compared with $0.74 per share in the
prior year. Two items had a significant impact on this year-over-year change. First, the negative impact of foreign

currency drove a $0.68 per share reduction and, second, the year-over-year change in the effective tax rate reduced EPS
by $0.22 per share.
Moving onto cash flow. Cash from operating activities during 2015 provided $91 million compared with $289 million
during 2014. The year-over-year reduction was primarily due to lower cash-related earnings which, as I previously
described, were negatively impacted by foreign currency translation. These items were partially offset by lower net
payments associated with operating taxes and lower payments for employee incentive compensation.
Working capital was one day worse operationally compared with a year ago. Accounts payable improved eight days
operationally as we continue to benefit from our focus on renegotiating payment terms with our vendors. However,
inventory was eight days worse operationally, primarily related to the impact of unfavorable transaction FX on the cost
of inventory as well as additional inventory to support EMEA growth.
As we evaluate the state of the business and look to the future, taking into account some of the one-off items as well as
recognizing the impact of Venezuela and Argentina on our metrics, I believe overall the underlying top line is healthy
and is supported by metrics trending in the right direction.
That said, it is clear that our profitability has suffered significantly given our footprint and the strength of the U.S.
dollar.
Consistent with what we shared at our most recent Investor Day, we are not assuming the currency issue will reverse in
the near term, and we have launched our transformation plan which includes three pillars: investing in growth, driving
out costs, and improving our financial resilience to enable high-quality, sustainable earnings growth.
Turning to the highlights of our transformation plan. Invest in growth. We will invest $350 million into the business
over the next three years, $150 million in media and social selling and $200 million related to the service model
evolution and IT to improve the overall representative experience.
Second, drive out costs. We plan to take $350 million dollar of cost out of the business over the next three years, $150
million from changes to our operating model and better alignment of our expenses with their geographic footprint, and
$200 million from optimizing our supply chain network.
In 2016, we expect to achieve 40% of the $350 million on a run rate basis. If you assume a half-year convention, we
expect to realize $70 million of these benefits in 2016.
Lastly, improved financial resilience. This is well under way as we are moving with a sense of urgency. In 2015, we
refinanced our working capital facility, divested Liz Earle, paid down our 2016 maturities, and made the decision to
suspend our annual dividend.
And in 2016, you can expect us to close the deal with Cerberus, continue rigorous pricing discipline, opportunistically
repay debt, evaluate hedging key currency exposures, make strides to improve working capital, and lay out our tax
planning strategy. This comprehensive transformation plan puts us on a path to achieve our long-term goals of
mid-single-digit constant dollar revenue growth and low-double-digit operating margins.
While we are not providing detailed financial guidance for 2016, I want to highlight that we expect profit comparisons
to be weaker in the first half of the year due to the significant foreign currency deterioration we have experienced.
While we plan to continue our rigorous pricing discipline, there is a lag between the realization of the pricing as
compared to the inflation caused by the currency issues. Additionally, we expect to begin to realize our 2016 cost
saving targets in the second half of the year.
In addition to the milestone Sheri mentioned, I would like to provide some additional details regarding our priorities for
2016. We expect 1% to 2% Active Representative growth, to complete and close the Cerberus transaction, to execute
key operating model changes, to opportunistically repay debt, to evaluate strategies to hedge key currencies, and to
finalize our tax claiming strategy.

I would also like to communicate a couple of additional points. In the first quarter of 2016, we will begin to report
against our new segments which will be Europe, Middle East and Africa, North Latin America, South America, and
Asia Pacific. We also plan to evaluate the metrics we may provide to allow you to gain insight into the business
performance and transformation plan.
And I would just like to wrap up by saying, thank you again for your time. I hope this gives you a better sense of the
current state of the business, our near-term priorities and our long-term expectations.
With that, we will turn it back to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of the call.

Your first question comes from Lauren Lieberman. Please state your affiliation then pose your question.
<Q - Lauren Rae Lieberman>: Great. Thanks. It's Barclays. So first, I wanted to ask about the North America
expenses that are being retained in Global expenses. Should we think about that as kind of like a – is a run rate of
around $10 million a quarter kind of a good run rate, and are there plans to alleviate some of that stranded overhead or
kind of the dis-synergy from separating North America?
<A - James S. Scully>: So, it's Jim. So, that's a good question. So you'll see it in the 10-K when we file it. Given how
we've done continued operations and discontinued operations, as I mentioned, we did take some global allocations that
were previously at North America back to continuing operations, and that was that $40 million approximately that you
were referencing. Going forward, however, there is going to be a combination of things that happen once we close the
transaction with Cerberus, including transferring some expenses and TSAs going both ways. So, when I think about it
from a stranded cost perspective, after the deal closes, stranded costs will be in the $20 million to $25 million range.
And we have plans on the expense side to offset those stranded costs.
<Q - Lauren Rae Lieberman>: Okay. And are those plans, Jim, in addition to the $70 million as part of the global
plan, or should I think about that as net, we get $50 million to work with this year?
<A - James S. Scully>: The plans to offset the stranded costs are incremental to the $70 million that I mentioned.
<Q - Lauren Rae Lieberman>: Okay. Great. Thank you.

Your next question comes from Ali Dibadj. Please state your affiliation then pose your question.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Hey, guys. I'm from Bernstein. I want to focus a little bit on the cash discussion. We spent a lot of
time in the prepared remarks on that. And it came in quite below your expectations set not too long ago actually for this
year on a free cash flow basis. So, $50 million even including North America, obviously lower without it.
Can you give us a sense of what really drove that miss versus your expectations? It doesn't feel like it's all currencies. I
feel like there's other stuff going on there. I just want to hear your thoughts about it.
And then, how do you think about free cash flow for the coming year? And are there any implications to the kind of
credit or liquidity situation that you have right now? And last piece on cash is can you give us a sense of where the cash
actually is, like if 10% in Argentina, at least that's the last disclosure. Is that all accessible? How should we think about
the ability to get that cash right now? So, just a fuller focus on cash in those couple of questions.

<A - James S. Scully>: Sure, Ali. So, it's Jim. So, let's go back to the expectations in terms that we've set on cash. I
think the expectations that we've set did change throughout the year. The last guidance we gave was less than $100
million but positive. If you look at where we came in, we came in essentially flat to that number excluding North
America. If you look at the cash flow statement as it relates to some of the ins and outs related to discontinued
operations it would have been maybe an incremental $20 million positive, $15 million to $20 million positive.
So, it's a little bit lower than our expectations, not by much, I would say largely driven by a lot of the currency activity
that occurred in the fourth quarter was probably the biggest driver that related to – at least to our expectations.
In terms of cash for next year, since we are not giving detailed guidance for next year, I want to be careful that we don't
give guidance on cash, which is really the result of all the other assumptions that we're not giving. So, what I would
like to say about cash in 2016 is that I think I would personally be disappointed if we were not equal or better than
where it landed in free cash flow in 2015, even absorbing the cash costs related to the savings plans in 2016.
And then, as it relates to kind of the limitations, we do have trapped cash in some countries. We haven't broken out
before the amount. It's not a significant amount, and we are seeing some movement even in Argentina where we've had
some recent changes that we'd been able to get some of the cash back out, but it's not a significant amount of the
amount that you see on the balance sheet.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Okay. That's helpful. And then when you guys talked about IPI tax and VAT impact to your
numbers and you say excluding those, I'm trying to get a better sense of the net impact on the top line from IPI tax and
VAT credit.
So, are you including any pricing mitigation that you're perhaps taking to offset those in those marketplaces, or is there
none? And I guess the real kind of underlying thing I'm trying to figure out is, once you lap those things, should we
expect the 3% to 4% rebound in your topline to come, or is it not going to be that great of a rebound because, again,
you're mitigating some things already with pricing? Does that question make sense?
<A - James S. Scully>: So, Ali, it does make sense. I think I would say it's the latter. The impact that we are stating
does include actions we're taking to offset that include pricing. So when you see us anniversary, you would not
necessarily see the rebound that you would expect. It would just be in the base of the businesses going forward. And at
the same time, we'd stop talking about the 2014 VAT as well because we wouldn't be up against that from an
anniversarying perspective.

Your next question comes from Bill Schmitz. Please state your affiliation then pose your question.
<Q - Bill Schmitz>: Hi. It's Deutsche Bank. Hey, I have a question on pricing. If you look at your peers with similar
regional exposure, or just look at the regions where they compete, your pricing is way below a lot of the other guys,
and it's probably even more exaggerated because Argentina and I'm sure Venezuela is a piece there. So, why aren't you
taking a lot more pricing to offset the currency hit? Because, obviously, the currency effect that you're seeing is light
years worse than anybody else. And so what's the risks of taking pricing even higher? Because if you're going to drive
volume, but it's unprofitable or very low profits, I'm not sure that really does anything for the business over the long
term?
<A - Sheri McCoy>: So, we are taking pricing as we're looking at that. One of the things that we're doing in our top 10
markets is ensuring that everyone is very clear on what the inflationary pricing is and making sure we're taking that
inflationary pricing. Where we've been focused is making sure we understand the impact, particularly on the what I
would call sort of the high-unit movers to make sure that we're keeping the representatives engaged in the process. But
we have taken significant price in Russia; we're taking it in Brazil. We've obviously in the high-inflation markets, we've
been consistently doing that.

But we are doing that across our top 10 markets and making sure we're also coupling that with advertising and other
things to support the representative and the consumer. This is something that historically we've been a little bit slow on.
We have this year, the last two quarters, been very focused on that. And as we've built our plan in 2016 we have
significant price in the plan.
<Q - Bill Schmitz>: Okay. Yeah, because it's still not working though, because the margins are getting actually
demolished relative to anybody, even if I just look at other people's sort of Latin America exposure. So, I'm curious,
like, what is the risk of taking pricing too high? Do you know what I mean? Because it's not like rep growth is through
the roof right now. Do you know what I'm saying? Like, why not just try it?
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Yeah. I mean, we are taking price. What we're doing it is on a campaign-by-campaign basis. I
think some of the things that you're seeing in our numbers, particularly if you look at Brazil, which is a big portion of
it, is that we're also dealing with the IPI tax component of it. But we have taken significant price, and we'll continue to
do that moving forward.
<Q - Bill Schmitz>: Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then, just on makeup, it seems like there's this kind of like
makeup renaissance going on with all these beauty bloggers and advisers and yet your makeup business is flat. So what
is the opportunity there, and what do you think you guys are missing relative to the category and some of the
competitors?
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Yeah. I think, overall, we've been very competitive in Color. One of the things that – when you
look at our numbers that – when I report on a category basis, we have the IPI and the VAT comparison in there, so that
changes the numbers. So, we actually are performing better. So if you look at it on a market-by-market basis, we're
very focused on Color.
The important thing, and you saw this, I think, at the Investor Day, is using Beauty for a Purpose and going out from a
digital standpoint to make sure that we're actually getting bloggers excited about our brand. We've put a lot of energy
and effort behind that, and we'll continue to do that. That's going to be critically important as we continue to move
forward.
<Q - Bill Schmitz>: Great. Thank you guys so much.

Your next question comes from Javier Escalante. Please state your affiliation and pose your question.
<Q - Javier Escalante>: Consumer Edge Research. Good morning, everyone. My question has to do with from
primarily two countries, Brazil and Russia. And I'm trying to reconcile two statements made in the call. One, that the
metrics – the field metrics were trending in the right direction. And then you basically said that even though Brazil is
going to anniversary some of these comparative issues, the VAT, the IPI taxes it won't rebound.
So, if you can help us to explain why is it that it won't rebound if you are breaking out the impact in the last couple of
quarters as if it were a one-time item? So why is it that if field metrics are getting better, there is no rebound? And then
I have a follow-up.
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Sure. Thanks, Javier. As it relates to Brazil, one of the things that we're seeing is that we have
been able to recruit and retain representatives. We're very pleased with our efforts there. The results that we're seeing
now are impacted – the average order is impacted by, as you point out, the IPI and the VAT piece.
The other piece though that we're cautious about and we're watching closely is it's a very challenging environment. If
we look at the consumer consumption across all categories, you look at where the GDP is, we're being cautious relative
to that. We do expect over time that things will come back, but we're also hesitant relative to the volatility in the market
versus our own situation. Because what we know is consumers will tend to hold back, particularly in areas like facial
skin care, because she'll trade off and use that for other things.

So, the reason I talked about that, it was less about the comparison of IPI and VAT, as it was about uncertainty in the
market, and we're continuing to stay very, very close to that to make sure that we're doing the right things to keep
representatives engaged.
Certainly, Brazil is a very important market for us. We continue to be very bullish for the long term, and we think that
Beauty is going to be something that will continue to be an important category. It's just as we look at 2016 realistically
we're just uncertain relative to the macro issues.
<Q - Javier Escalante>: And the follow-up also has to do with Brazil. If you can comment on competitive issues.
Natura is going into these stores which is a departure from their traditional direct selling model. Is this a benefit or a
detriment to you? To what extent the fact that they are opening the stores is something that is going to hurt them in
terms of recruiting because they are creating a channel conflict or vice versa, is having a competitive advantage
vis-à-vis to you. So, if you can explain the competitive dynamics in terms of how your largest competitor is changing
their strategy and how that reflects upon your results? Thank you.
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Sure. Well, certainly, Brazil is a very – as I said, a very important large beauty market. It's very
competitive environment. I think what's important is to continue to build the brand in Brazil. And as we've looked it at
from an Avon standpoint, the good news is we touch a broad base of middle-class and we're able to build – we see this
with our Cores execution and Coty where we can go upscale. We also compete at the lower-price tiers. And that's
something that we will continue to do.
As we look it from a branding standpoint, we're looking at how they can do things from a digital standpoint. We also
are testing some things and we'll continue to test that. I think, it's really important in these markets to support the
representatives. My point of view is that, particularly in a volatile macro situation, we need to be doing everything in
support of her, and that we will continue to do that. I can't really speak for the competitors, what their plans are there.
We do know it's a very competitive environment, and we're very close-watching all of our competitors in the market.

Your next question comes from Steph Wissink. Please state your affiliation then pose your question.
<Q - Lauren M. Wolff>: Hi. This is actually Lauren Wolff calling in for Steph Wissink from Piper Jaffray. Just a
quick question for you. We'd like to drill down deeper into performance specifically in China. Was the weakness a
function in the region of price and mix, rep count, floor conversion or broader market weakness? And then, how long
do you expect pressure there to persist, and what types of actions from a cost perspective do you anticipate to take to
minimize the impact?
<A - Sheri McCoy>: So, our specific challenge in China has been our business model. We operate beauty boutiques.
So, we don't have the more traditional Avon model. And that's been under pressure for some time now. As I said during
Investor Day, we are looking at strategic partnerships or opportunities for China to figure out how we better serve the
customer there. We have a very strong brand, good products, a lot of good assets, but we have not been able to crack
the business model. And so we are looking at different alternatives for that business.
<Q - Lauren M. Wolff>: Okay. Thanks.

Your next question comes from Steve Powers. Please state your affiliation then post your question.
<Q - Stephen R. Powers>: Hi. It's UBS. So, I know that you don't want to give guidance for 2016, and I think that's
totally understandable, given all the moving parts. But just directionally, you've got the underlying improvement
initiatives that you talked about on the cost saving side and incremental pricing. But then clearly, you've got FX
challenges, given where we are today.

So just – should we think about margins being up or down materially versus the 5.7% that you showed pro forma in
2015, or is roughly that 5% to 6% range right for next year in terms of thinking about it?
And then looking beyond that, just long term, your long-term objectives of mid-single-digit top-line growth,
double-digit margins, how much improvement in the underlying macro environment do you need to see to achieve that
within your three-year plan? Because I'm assuming you need some. That'd be helpful.
And then just as a clean-up accounting wise, Jim, can you just confirm or clarify how you'll be accounting for the
preferred once the Cerberus deal closes as it flows to EPS? Thanks.
<A - James S. Scully>: Okay. So, let me hit by the first and say, Steve as much as I would like to give more clarity
around margins next year, we have so much going on. It is an important year in the transformation, and our key focus at
this point is really around closing the transaction, focusing on cost, realigning our expense base, and all of those have
significant impacts on what the overall margin structure will look like going forward.
So, I think for us right now, we've got to accomplish some of those things before we have visibility to come back and
then give a better view to you. And I understand that that's – it's difficult not to have better visibility.
As it relates to the macro environment, we are building our plans based upon the continuation of the forward curves
and where things are. And we are pressure testing our model to make sure that we can withstand and improve and get
to the hurdles that we outlined and the targets, assuming that those forwards come to fruition.
To the extent that they improve, obviously they will benefit us. To the extent that they – the forwards – or the spots go
through the forwards, obviously that'll put more pressure on us. But we are not expecting anything other than the
forward rates in the foreign currency, and what the inflation estimates are for those markets.
And then finally for how we're going to account for the preferred, we're going – the coupon will be a reduction from
income in order to calculate EPS. And we can give you – we can spend some time offline going through the puts and
takes, but that's how it's going to line up from an accounting perspective.
<Q - Stephen R. Powers>: Okay. Thank you. And just given where the forward curves are and given where inflation
rates are, I mean, given all your earlier commentary, Sheri, it sounds like we should expect some material sequential
acceleration in constant currency price over the next couple of quarters as you catch up from where we are.
Because I just look at the pricing you achieved in Latin America in the quarter and in the year versus where inflation is
in those markets, and in real terms it doesn't look like you grew. So, is that a fair read that we're going to see material
sequential acceleration in price/mix?
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Yes, you will. I mean, we're continuing to focus on that, and all of the markets have plans in
place that we are taking price. So, you'll see that.
<Q - Stephen R. Powers>: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.
