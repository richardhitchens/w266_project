David J. Lesar
Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. I want to begin with a few of our key accomplishments in 2015. First,
total company revenue of $23.6 billion declined 28% year-over-year, outperforming a 35% decline in both the average
worldwide rig count and global drilling and completion spend. And even though it was a very tough market, I am
pleased to say that once again we outpaced our peer group in North America and internationally, both sequentially and
on a full-year basis.
I'm especially pleased with the resilience of our international business. Despite lower revenues as a result of pricing
concessions and activity reductions, we were able to improve operating margins during the year due to a relentless
focus on cost management. We also outperformed our largest peer sequentially and on a full-year basis in both revenue
and in margins. And in North America, of course, it was beyond a challenging year, where we saw unprecedented
declines in activity. However, relative to the overall market, I am pleased with our performance.
From the 2014 peak, our completions-related activity declined approximately 33% relative to a 64% reduction in the
U.S. land rig count. This clearly again demonstrates the customer flight to quality that has emerged during this
downturn and positions us well for the market's eventual recovery.
Now I would like to provide you with an update on the pending Baker Hughes acquisition. During the quarter, we
announced that our timing agreement with the Department of Justice expired without reaching a settlement or the DOJ
initiating litigation. In December, the DOJ informed us that they do not believe that our previously announced proposed
divestitures are sufficient to address the DOJ's concerns, but acknowledged that they would assess further proposals.
With respect to the European Commission, the review has entered Phase II, which was anticipated, and we recently
advised the Commission that we plan to formally propose remedies which we believe should satisfy any competition
concerns.
Earlier this month, Halliburton presented to the DOJ an enhanced set of proposed divestitures in order to seek their
approval of the transaction. We also informally notified the EC and other jurisdictions about the enhanced divestiture
package. The sales process for the planned divestitures continues and we are in discussions with interested buyers.
There is no agreement to-date with the DOJ or EC as to the adequacy of the proposed divestitures. Our conversations
with the DOJ and the EC and other enforcement authorities continue with the desire to resolve their competition-related
concerns as soon as possible.
Now I want to be clear that we remain committed to seeing this deal through despite the extended time required to
obtain regulatory approvals. Now, while it is taking longer than originally expected, we believe the compelling
strategic and financial benefits for our shareholders inherent in this combination continues to remain intact. We
strongly believe that the proposed merger is good for the industry and for our customers. The combination is expected
to create an even stronger company and achieve substantial efficiencies, enabling us to compete aggressively to provide
efficient, innovative, and low-cost services. Completion of the transaction would allow us to better meet our customers'
oil services needs and help them operate more cost effectively, which is increasingly important due to the current state
of the energy industry and oil and gas prices.
Finally, we agreed with Baker Hughes to extend the period to obtain required regulatory approvals to no later than
April 30, 2016, but remain focused on completing the deal as early as possible. In the event regulatory approvals have
not been received by April 30, the merger agreement does not terminate automatically. Both companies may continue

to seek regulatory approval or either company may terminate the merger agreement.
Now, let me discuss what we are seeing in the market today and our prospects and challenges for the coming year, and
then Christian will discuss our fourth quarter results in more detail.
Now this has certainly been the most challenging downturn that I have seen in my many, many years in business. We
expect the market will continue to remain challenged in 2016 and that it will be the first time since the late-1980s that
global upstream spending will decline for two consecutive years. Commodity prices have been a moving target, forcing
our customers to be cautious in providing visibility to us and their shareholders into their 2016 capital expenditure
plans. Although we do not believe current oil prices are sustainable, they are without a doubt negatively influencing
customer plans in the near term.
On a geographic basis, North America is expected to be the most impacted in 2016. Third-party surveys have also been
a moving target, indicating a year-on-year decline in service spending from 30% up to as much as 50%. And that's on
top of the estimated 40% decline in industry spend in 2015. But the reality is, due to the macro uncertainties, many of
our customers are managing their businesses in real time, rig-by-rig. Accordingly, we are going to take this market
week-by-week and in some cases crew-by-crew. This is unlikely to change until our customers have confidence in a
sustainable and economical oil price.
Now, there are a number of moving parts in North America and my experience has taught me not to bet on the exact
timing of a recovery. But we do expect that the longer it takes, the sharper the recovery will be. Until then, we will
continue to execute our playbook and adapt our cost structure to market conditions, while also positioning our North
America land business for future success and ultimately to outperform the industry as the market recovers.
The international markets held up much better than North America in 2015, but they are also not immune to the
impacts of lower commodity prices. Recent third-party surveys for international spend indicate a decline that may be up
to 20%, which will be slightly worse than last year. We are working diligently with our customers to improve
economics of their projects through technology and operating efficiency, but do expect margins to be negatively
impacted by lower activity levels and pricing pressures throughout the year.
Now looking at our geographies, we expect activity in the Middle East/Asia region to again be the most resilient in
2016, as recent mature field project awards throughout the Middle East are anticipated to move forward. However, we
expect Australia, India, and other markets across Asia to be impacted by reduced customer spending and delayed
projects. Europe/Africa/CIS is also expected to experience activity declines across the entire region in 2016, with the
most vulnerable areas being the North Sea and Angola, where the offshore markets continue to face extremely
challenging economics. Customers are focused on reducing their cost structures through more efficient well design and
the adoption of new standards for production systems. But these are structural changes that will take time to fully
implement.
And in Latin America, we expect lower activities across the region, with the largest declines projected in Brazil and
Mexico as a result of significant NOC budget constraints. Latin America is currently expected to have the largest
percentage decline within our international markets.
So, in summary, 2016 is simply going to be a tough slog through the mud, but I can tell you, we will do what we have
to do. We know what buttons to push and levers to pull, and we will. We believe our customers will remain focused on
cost per barrel optimization and gaining higher levels of efficiency, both of which bode very well for Halliburton.
Now, it is very difficult to predict the exact timing, but once the market has visibility of the trough, the recovery will
come into view. And when it does, we expect the recovery will play out very similar to others, where North America
will rebound first and the strongest, followed by the international markets where the rebound will be more methodical.
Now let me turn the call over to Christian to provide more details on our financial results. Christian?

Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with a comparison of our fourth quarter results to the third
quarter of 2015.
Total company revenue of $5.1 billion represented a 9% decline, while operating income declined by 7% to $473
million. All regions experienced revenue declines during the quarter, led by North America as a result of continued
activity and pricing headwinds. For our international business, fourth quarter revenue and operating income declined by
5% and 10% respectively as a result of price concessions and activity declines with our customers during the quarter.
Additionally, due to customer budget constraints, we did not see the typical benefit from year-end equipment and
software sales.
In the Middle East/Asia region, revenue declined by 5%, with a similar decline in operating income of 6%. Lower
activity levels in Saudi Arabia and Iraq led the decline, partially offset by modestly higher sales in China and increased
activity in Kuwait and Oman.
Turning to Europe/Africa/CIS, we saw fourth quarter revenue decline by 6% with a decrease in operating income of
18%. The decline for the quarter was primarily driven by a sharp reduction of activity in the North Sea, partially offset
by higher activity in Angola and Algeria. Latin America revenue and operating income declined by 6% and 9%
respectively, driven by reduced activity throughout most of the region. Partially offsetting this decline was improved
activity levels in Mexico.
Moving to North America; revenue declined 13%, with operating margins improving by approximately 160 basis
points. Reduced activity throughout the U.S. land was the primary driver of the revenue decline, especially in the
pumping-related product lines. The margin improvement was primarily due to a spike in year-end completion tool sales
in the Gulf of Mexico, which is not expected to repeat in the first quarter.
Margins also benefited from our aggressive cost reduction efforts and minimal weather disruptions during the quarter.
Our margins continue to include an elevated cost structure in North America in anticipation of the pending Baker
Hughes acquisition.
For 2015, our total company decrementals were about half of the previous cycle due to actions we've been taking to
adjust our cost structure throughout the year. In the fourth quarter, we incurred a charge of $192 million after-tax
consisting primarily of asset write-offs and severance-related costs. As industry fundamentals continue to weaken, we
will continue to make further structural adjustments and may incur additional charges in the first quarter.
Our corporate and other expense totaled $70 million for the quarter, excluding costs related to the pending Baker
Hughes acquisition. We anticipate that our corporate expenses for the first quarter will be approximately $70 million,
excluding acquisition-related costs, and this will be the new run rate for 2016.
Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of approximately 19% includes a retroactive benefit from Congress' recent
approval of the Federal Research and Experimentation Tax Credit. As we go forward in 2016, we're expecting the first
quarter and full-year effective tax rates to be approximately 24% to 25%.
Given the ongoing decline in activity levels, we've further reduced our capital expenditures as we exited the year,
ending 2015 with a total CapEx spend of $2.2 billion. Our current guidance for 2016 capital expenditures is $1.6
billion. This CapEx guidance includes the continued conversion of our fleet to Q10 Pumps to support our surface
efficiency strategy which is critical in this environment.
We also expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $1.9 billion for 2016. This is the first time in over a
decade that our CapEx is lower than our expected DD&A expense, which demonstrates our commitment to live within
our cash flows during this challenging period for the industry.
Turning to our operational outlook; the severity of the activity decline in the coming year continues to be unclear, but
let me give you some comments for the first quarter. Our first quarter international results will be subject to
weather-related seasonality that occurs in geographies such as the North Sea and Russia, exacerbated by the uncertainty
around customer spending levels for the coming year. Although difficult to predict, at this point, we anticipate first
quarter Eastern Hemisphere revenues to decline sequentially by a low-double digit percentage with margins similar to

the first quarter 2015 levels. In Latin America, we anticipate revenues to decline sequentially by a mid-teens percentage
with margins retreating to the upper-single digits.
In North America, we also have limited visibility, but estimate that first quarter revenues will decline with the U.S. rig
count, which is already down double digits against the fourth quarter average. We currently anticipate margins to come
in at around break-even levels. And finally, we enter 2016 on a solid financial position with strong liquidity, which will
enable us to address the current market challenges and be well positioned for the industry's eventual recovery.
Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff for the operational update. Jeff?
Jeffrey Allen Miller
Thank you, Christian, and good morning, everyone. To begin, I would like to take a moment to congratulate all of our
front-line people for delivering solid fourth quarter results in a tough market.
As Dave mentioned earlier, we're expecting 2016 to be a very challenging year due to poor commodity prices and
shrinking customer budgets. We believe that as the coming cycle unfolds, we will see a continuation of what began in
2015: customers seeking efficiency gains and discrete technology to help them bend the cost curve. At lower
commodity price levels, we believe the market will continue to evolve in this direction and customers will adopt
products and services that help them produce wells with a lower cost per barrel of oil equivalent. Now this plays
directly into Halliburton's strengths, helping our customers become more efficient on location and maximize their
production, all of which contribute to lowering their unit cost per barrel of oil.
So regardless of the commodity price, we're continuing to execute on our proven two-pronged strategy in this
downturn. The first part being to control what we can control in the short term, and second is to look beyond the cycle
to prepare for recovery.
And with respect to the short term, this means making the tactical changes necessary to right-size the business to the
market. We revisited our cost profile throughout 2015 and made significant changes to help mitigate the impact on our
operating margins, and we will continue to do so. It started with where we work. We systematically reviewed
profitability at a granular sub-product line level. This resulted in the consolidation of facilities in more than 20
countries around the world and closing down operations in two countries. And finally, current market conditions forced
us to reduce global head count by 25% in 2015, a necessary but very unfortunate reality.
The second part of our strategy is to look beyond the cycle and ensure long-term health of the franchise. For example,
aligning ourselves with the right customers, investing in technology and staying dead focused on superior execution.
In terms of customer portfolio, we've worked to align ourselves with customers who have stronger balance sheets and
fairway acreage in the basins. In North America, our top 17 customers make up 50% of our revenue. When the
downturn began, these customers were among the last to lay down rigs. Today, we are collaborating with them on ways
to lower their costs per BOE to a place where we can both be successful. And when the recovery comes, we believe
that these operators, and therefore, Halliburton, will be best positioned for the upside.
In terms of technology, 2015 was a successful year. Despite the downturn in activity, we saw an uptake of new
technologies such as DecisionSpace and RockPerm, helping customers maximize production and lower their cost per
barrel of oil. A recent addition to our custom chemistry portfolio is our MicroScout Service. MicroScout is a hydraulic
fracturing treatment designed to deliver proppant into far field microfractures, enhancing the productive life of new
wells. Early trials have indicated more than a 20% uplift in production compared to offset wells. Now, technologies
like MicroScout represent years of research through a disciplined, multi-stage gate program.
And although I typically spend more time talking about execution and how we get things done in the field, it's
important to point out that we're executing in the technology side of our business as well. Through joint research
projects with our customers and by elevating field developed solutions, Halliburton is among the more efficient
innovators in any industry. Last year, Halliburton secured new patents at an R&D cost of less than $1 million per

patent. In terms of R&D patent efficiency, which is central to the return on intellectual property, Halliburton is in the
same range as other top global U.S. patent leaders.
And finally, superior execution. Service quality is a frequently underappreciated piece of our business, but I can tell
you that in a market like this, a timely, efficient job can be the difference between an economic well and an
uneconomic well. So for many markets, contract extensions and project awards are influenced by service quality. Or
simply put, it's how we distinguish ourselves to win and retain the work.
Now looking at 2015, it was an extremely strong year for the quality of our operations. This was our third straight year
of improvement in both safety and service quality metrics, both of which saw significant double-digit reductions from
2014. Even while the market is forcing us to streamline our footprint in the field, we're improving our performance
rates, essentially doing more with less and doing it better. We are refining our processes and systems, eliminating
everything that's not required to deliver our value proposition. You will be hearing more about this throughout 2016, as
this is not a one-time event. It's the relentless focus on efficiency and process improvement that makes us the execution
company.
We believe that these elements, our strong customer portfolio, our efficient technology spend, and our superior service
quality provide a strong foundation for our business. We are confident that by executing on our strategy and building
on these successes, we can continue to outperform our competitors both during the downturn and when the recovery
comes.
Now, let me turn the call back to Dave for his closing comments. Dave?
David J. Lesar
Thanks, Jeff. Let me sum it up. As I said, 2016 is shaping up to be one tough slog through the mud, and the industry is
going to have to take it a quarter at a time. We have a seasoned management team and a proven playbook that has
served us well during previous cycles, and we are entering the year from a position of strength with a solid financial
position.
We are focused on maintaining a strong customer portfolio, investing in more efficient technology and delivering
reliable, best-in-class service quality for our customers, and are preparing the business for growth when the industry
recovers. And as we demonstrated this year, whatever the market gives us, we will take it and then take some more.
And finally, we remain fully committed to closing the pending acquisition of Baker Hughes. We are diligently focused
on the regulatory reviews, the divestiture process and planning for integration activities after we close the deal.
So with that, let's open it up for questions.

<A - David J. Lesar>: Good morning, James.
<Q - James West>: So, Jeff, really impressed with the international operations in 2015, I mean, growing margins,
outperforming on the revenue decline. Obviously, there's a lot of cost management going on there. Could you maybe
highlight a little bit further how you guys were able to outperform and what 2016 looks like in terms of your ability to
continue to outperform?

<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Yeah, well, thank you, James. It really is around aggressive cost control. And we've been
outperforming for a number of quarters. This looks like winning the right contracts and managing the heck out of the
costs most certainly and it's also a mature field strategy in action. I mean, a big piece of this is mature fields and where
we see the benefit of scope, scale, and that clarity of strategy, it's a recipe for success. So really pleased with the
performance and that team is right on top of their business.
<Q - James West>: And do you think that outperformance can continue as we go through 2016?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Yeah. So if we look at 2016, I mean, it will be a tougher slog in 2016, no question. I mean,
we're seeing fairly constant pressure around negotiation and tenders. But in some cases, we are having, what I'd say,
positive collaborative discussions with clients around how to reduce uncertainty, increase system efficiency. So,
certainly pleased with the performance right now.
<Q - James West>: Got it. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Jud Bailey from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
<Q - Judson E. Bailey>: Thanks. Good morning. A follow-up question on some of the international commentary
earlier, specifically Latin America. The – I think the sequential revenue decline is somewhere in the mid-teens.
Christian or Dave, could you maybe give us a little bit of color? Is that based on activity declines, is it pricing, both? Or
do you have any other major projects that may be rolling off? Just maybe a little more commentary over what's driving
Latin America at least in the first quarter?
<A - David J. Lesar>: Well – go ahead, Christian.
<A - Christian A. Garcia>: So in Latin America, if you look at our sequential decline it was 6% – down 6%, it was
driven by almost all countries except for Mexico. Now, on a product line – product line basis, we had actually good
Landmark and Baroid, however, we also had some expenses associated with our vessels in Mexico.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Maybe one further comment. I mean, across the piece, it's a tough slog in Latin America, nearly
every country is facing some sort of particular challenge, whether it's macroeconomic or just pure facing-down
commodity price, which as an example, for a Colombia, for example. So we're seeing historical lows in terms of rig
activity in a couple of countries and I don't see that changing.
<Q - Judson E. Bailey>: Okay. I guess I was more referencing the first quarter, some of the commentary – or I think
didn't you say, Christian, mid-teens sequential decline for revenue?
<A - Christian A. Garcia>: Yes. That is absolutely correct. And it's because of the macro headwinds that Latin
America is facing, as Dave pointed out, Latin America will probably be the most challenged international region that
we have, and it's particularly acute in Mexico and Brazil.
<Q - Judson E. Bailey>: Okay. All right. And my follow-up, Dave, maybe if you could maybe talk a little more about
North America, and I guess specifically the nature of discussions with customers and maybe how those are evolving
with commodity prices so weak to start the year. They're obviously going through a number of different budget
initiatives. If maybe you could talk a little bit about any visibility that you have or don't have and kind of what
customers are communicating and how they're thinking about the first half of 2016 in North America?
<A - David J. Lesar>: Yeah, I mean, I'm talking almost every day with the CEOs of our customers and I would say
that it's a real challenge out there. And I guess the way I would sum it up is there's sort of a constant revision of budgets
going on and those revisions are clearly with a downward bias. So the way I would describe is right now, our customers
don't know what they're going to spend, where they're going to spend it, and when they're going to spend it in North
America at this point in time, which is why I made the comment earlier. We really are trying to run the business on
literally a week by week, crew by crew, unit by unit basis until our customers see some stability in pricing where they

very flexible. And I like our chances in that kind of a market.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Angie Sedita from UBS. Your line is now open, please go ahead.

quarter and year given overall market conditions.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Thank you.
<A - Christian A. Garcia>: Thank you.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: So a little bit of granularity on the U.S. pressure pumping market. In the past, you've done
some work on the potential level of attrition, specifically for pumps and engines versus fluid, and so any color further
on the attrition side? And are you starting to see a change of behavior by the small pressure pumpers where they're
starting to become more aggressive and either pulling out of the market or on the cost side, or can they?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Okay. Thank you, Angie. This is Jeff. Attrition is really the story here. And consistent
with remarks before, we see today about half the equipment as idled. That's equipment that's not being maintained and
is being cannibalized for parts more broadly. The service intensity, believe it or not, continues to creep up. So we saw a
9% sequential increase in proppant pumped on a per-well basis, which means equipments working harder than it ever
has. We estimate 4 million to 6 million horsepower that would be out of the market by the second half of 2016. My gut
says we're at the top end of that range right now. And this is really why we are committed to Frac of the Future. I mean,
it's the cost of the pump and it's the total operating cost of the equipment that matters, in my view, the most. And that's
what'll have Halliburton best positioned for the recovery.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Okay. Very, very helpful. And then any change of behavior with the small guys given where
their margins are and overall profitability, or status quo with what you saw in the second half of 2015?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Yeah. I mean, we don't see ourselves as competing with that group, but they are certainly
aggressive in the marketplace. We haven't seen them back off. But again, this is the reason why we have strategically
invested in Frac of the Future and Surface Efficiency and then the custom chemistry that we deliver. I talked about
some of that in my earlier comments. I mean, those are the things that differentiate Halliburton.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Okay, perfect. And then as an unrelated follow-up on the merger. Obviously, you can't talk
about the regulatory process, but Dave and Mark, you've commented in the past that you've reiterated your confidence
on the cost synergies with Baker cutting pretty aggressively as well on the cost side. Can you talk about the cost
synergies, your confidence there into 2016, 2017?
<A - David J. Lesar>: Yeah, Angie, I don't want to elaborate anymore, but the cost synergy story stays intact.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Okay. Perfect. Thanks. I'll turn it over.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Dave Anderson from Barclays. Your line is now open, please go ahead.
<Q - J. David Anderson>: Great. Thank you. So you mentioned several mature field projects in Middle East I think
you said are poised to move ahead. How do you think that Baker Hughes transaction is having an impact on bidding of
this type of work? I guess I'm just kind of wondering that with the uncertainty around the divestitures, it must make it a
bit challenging for both you and your customers in terms of putting together and evaluating bids. Can you just talk a

little bit about how this is being handled?
<A - David J. Lesar>: Yeah, Dave, as you can appreciate; I don't think we want to go there.
<Q - J. David Anderson>: Okay.
<A - David J. Lesar>: They still compete with us. We're still running our companies separately, and they're in the
market making their own pricing decisions, and where they tender and how they tender, and we don't have any
visibility into that.
<Q - J. David Anderson>: Okay. On a separate subject on North America, on your North American margins, I noticed
the D&E margins in North America improved quite a bit this quarter. C&P was more or less kind of as expected. I
think you said in the release it was something to do with offshore. Can you expand a bit? Obviously, it wasn't the
completion sales. Can you talk a little bit about what's going on? Is that a trend we should be expecting and maybe kind
of your outlook on how you're seeing the Gulf of Mexico this year?
<A - Christian A. Garcia>: Yeah. So, on your question around D&E, D&E was also benefited from obviously
aggressive cost reductions as well as – as Baroid and Landmark had good quarters. In terms of just the overall
completion tool sales in Gulf of Mexico, as we pointed out in the prepared remarks, we don't expect that to repeat in the
first quarter.
<Q - J. David Anderson>: Okay.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: And I think it's important, let me just follow that up, because the – our D&E business is
executing really well. I mean, those guys are dead focused on winning the right contracts. We're seeing the benefit of a
lot of work in key markets for all of our D&E service lines.
<Q - J. David Anderson>: And do you think that you can keep those margins where they are over the next couple of
quarters, in D&E?
<A - Christian A. Garcia>: Well, we're taking it one quarter at a time and we'll just have to see.
<Q - J. David Anderson>: Fair enough. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill Herbert from Simmons & Company. Your line is now open, please
go ahead.
<Q - William Andrew Herbert>: Thanks. Good morning. Dave, with regard to your cost structure, I mean, you've
extolled an exceedingly sort of realistic outlook for 2016, international down as much as 20% and North America down
anywhere from 30% to 50%. Given the adjustments that you've made over the preceding two quarters, are you
right-sized for this expected level of activity in 2016 now?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Yeah, Bill. This is Jeff. I mean, we are always reducing cost. And so, as Dave described, it
is a moving target. But there are still a number of areas where we continue to work on reducing costs, both at the
variable cost as well as around some of those sustainable fixed cost items, like refining or maintenance processes, takes
out cost, value engineering exercises that are taking place. We, in one case, took more than 20% of the cost out of 20
products. So we're constantly, as I say, reviewing the structure, but I do believe these are things that best position
Halliburton for the recovery.
<Q - William Andrew Herbert>: Okay. And two housekeeping items for me to sort of end it, magnitude of Gulf of
Mexico year-end completion tool sales. And then also, depreciation, why is it going up when your capital spending is
going down by as much as it is in 2016?

<A - Christian A. Garcia>: Well, it was because of additional CapEx, right? So obviously there's a layering effect on
the CapEx. On your first question – what was the first question again, Bill? On the completion...
<Q - William Andrew Herbert>: Gulf of Mexico year-end sales, what was the magnitude?
<A - Christian A. Garcia>: Yeah. We're not going to provide that sort of detail. As I pointed out in the prepared
remarks, the margin increase in North America has been due to both completion tool sales in the Gulf of Mexico and
also the impact of cost reductions that we did at the end of the third quarter. To give you just a little bit of additional
color, the sequential decrementals for the U.S. land in the fourth quarter was in the very low-single digits. So as you
can see, there has been a significant contribution from the cost cuts that we did in the third quarter.
<Q - William Andrew Herbert>: Very good. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Scott Gruber from Citigroup. Your line is now open, please go ahead.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: Good morning.
<A - Christian A. Garcia>: Good morning.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Good morning.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: I want to circle back to the international margin risk as this is very top of mind for investors
currently. Obviously, your margins have proven very resilient, so kudos to you and your team. But this does lead some
investors to believe that your clients abroad will simply continue to ask for larger and larger concessions until you're
down to very thin margins. Can you just comment conceptually on why this risk is low to help allay these fears in the
marketplace?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Well, yeah, I think the investment in our – the investment internationally, at least by
Halliburton, we were always sizing largely to the market that we saw. It's a little bit different than maybe what we saw
in North America. And so I think that our ability to pull levers internationally in key markets is probably more focused.
The – and again, I think the ability to size as we move along will bode well for us.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Yeah, I think I may just add a little color to that. Of course, the way you do business between
international markets and the U.S. markets is also quite different. With the drilling and completion efficiencies that
we've gotten in the U.S., the time to drill and complete a well has been dramatically reduced, which means the time
between when you can price what is a frac cost or what is drilling cost, or what is a mud job cost, is very dynamic, very
real time, it is very transactional.
The international market still continues to be a long-term contract market. So, the discussions that you have with
customers around price concessions and scope changes is typically done within the context of an existing long-term
contract, which gives you more of a seat at the table and more of an ability to convince the customer that what you are
delivering is adding value, or that you have ideas where their contracts can get more efficient and therefore reduce their
cost per BOE.
And customers always have the ability to go out on tender, but those things typically take a while to come to fruition.
So I think really the velocity by which business is done in North America is quite faster than it does in the international
market, and therefore I think the margins will stay up at a higher level and not be compressed down to U.S. levels.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: That's good color. How should we think about the contract role risk then over the
medium-term especially in light of these pricing concessions? If I recall, the contract role risk was material last
recovery period. The starting point for pricing was obviously very high going into 2009. But just given the
renegotiations that are ongoing today, does this minimize the contract role risk as we think about potential recovery in
2017, 2018?

<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: I think the – this is an international question?
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: Yes, focused on international, yes.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Yeah. And so one of the things that you would typically see internationally, obviously that
cycle lags, the U.S. cycle. And again, these are also economies in many cases that are built around production of oil and
gas. And so from an activity perspective, they tend to be relative basis more resilient. The second thing it does is it does
provide the opportunity to better manage the work with some visibility, which helps us support margins, and the
second, work with clients who are committed to a level of activity to then optimize that level of activity, and that
serves, I think, both our customers and us.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: Great. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Boyd from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open, please
go ahead.
<Q - Daniel J. Boyd>: Hi, thanks. Dave, can you update us on your mature field strategy, the opportunities you are
seeing in this market and then sort of specifically maybe tie that to Latin American margin projections going forward? I
was under the assumption that mature field was becoming a bigger piece of the pie in Latin America, so I'm wondering
if once you adjust cost to the lower level of activity, can we actually see margins trend higher after the first quarter.
<A - David J. Lesar>: So, thanks. These are a good opportunity and we are seeing more of them, but I would say they
are still on a relative basis a small part of our business. Market conditions are creating demand for these sorts of
investments, but clearly they bring a different risk profile. And so with that, they have got to have some key criteria like
good rocks, good terms and service pull-through. And so when we look in a commodity price like the one today, these
projects will be more challenged. And what happens in those is we'll slow down activity around those the same as any
operator would.
<Q - Daniel J. Boyd>: Okay. And then unrelated follow-up, but can you give us an update on the additional costs
you're carrying in North America in preparation for the Baker acquisition?
<A - Christian A. Garcia>: The cost associated with the service delivery platform that we're keeping intact remains
essentially the same in the last two quarters. It ran somewhere between 300 basis points to 400 basis points, and it
remains at that level in the fourth quarter.
<Q - Daniel J. Boyd>: Okay. Thanks.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Kurt Hallead from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open, please

<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Hey, good morning.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Good morning.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Good morning, Kurt.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: I was curious, on the CapEx front, at $1.6 billion, how would we characterize say maintenance as
a percentage of that?
<A - Christian A. Garcia>: We really don't look at it that way. Most of the maintenance expenditure is actually
expensed, and as such, our CapEx is pretty much based on the line-of-sight contracts and also the implementation of

our strategic initiatives like the Q10.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Okay. And then you expect that $1.6 billion – I know there's a lot of change in the marketplace
clearly, but that $1.6 billion you feel confident is based on existing contracts and not much movement on that going
forward?
<A - Christian A. Garcia>: Yes. Yes. Let me give you kind of an indication of how we run our capital program. Our
capital program, as I said, is based on line-of-sight contracts as well as the implementation of strategic initiatives. But
as you know, we manufacture our own equipment that gives us a really good ability to ramp down and ramp up
depending on the market conditions that we are seeing. So if you recall, in 2015, we began the year with guiding to flat
CapEx to 2014 and ended up being down about 30% versus 2014. So that manufacturing capability has become a
significant advantage here in this environment. So the fact that we can ramp up and ramp down is we're going to adjust
our CapEx program depending on the market conditions that we are seeing in 2016. And if we do so, we'll
communicate that to the Street.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Great. Thanks. And then – and a follow-up would be, you mentioned, Christian, North American
decremental margins in low-single digits during the fourth quarter. You feel you guys are at a point where combination
of your cost reduction efforts and maybe a good handle on where this market may be heading, is that the decrementals
you would continue to expect in North America as you move forward?
<A - Christian A. Garcia>: Well, we'd take it one quarter at a time, Kurt. If you think about Q1, if you look at our
decrementals for the whole year in 2015, it was a – for North America, it was about 40%. And if you do the math
implied by our guidance for Q1, the sequential decrementals will be less than that, which incorporates the lower
activities from continued decline in the U.S. rig count as well as the – not having the completion tools repeat in the first
quarter. So we're taking it one quarter at a time.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Okay. All right. Anyway, that's great color. I do appreciate it. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Sean Meakim from JPMorgan. Your line is now open, please go ahead.
<Q - Sean C. Meakim>: Hey, good morning.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Good morning.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Good morning.
<Q - Sean C. Meakim>: On your international margin performance, I was just trying to look at it a little bit differently.
I'm curious, how much of the mix shift between offshore and onshore in spend the last couple of years has helped your
margins and how that could be a benefit going forward?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: I think it's more of a shift between exploration and development may have a bigger impact
than maybe onshore or offshore. Onshore is certainly an important and growing piece of our business in certain
markets. But when we get to not only drilling, but also completions, the development space is right in our wheelhouse.
And we've seen as the markets have contracted quite a move in that direction.
<A - Christian A. Garcia>: Yeah, if you – if I can add to that, if you look at where Europe/Africa would have the
most concentration of offshore is really the weakest. However, we also saw outperformance in that region. And then
Middle East/Asia has the highest concentration of mature fields. And we also outperformed in that region. So both
regions have been outperforming both on the onshore and offshore segments of our business.
<Q - Sean C. Meakim>: Right. Those are fair points. Thank you. And then just back to North America, on Frac of the
Future, do you guys have an update of where your Q10 mix stands today and what you think it would look like at the
end of the year based on the new CapEx guide?

<A - Christian A. Garcia>: Right. At the end of the year, we had about – about 60% of our fleet is Q10, so that we've
– actually that's higher than what we've guided during our Analyst Day. We said 50% by the end of 2016, and we're at
60% right now. And based on our capital plan, it should reach close to 75% by the end of 2016.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Lamotte from Guggenheim. Your line is now open, please go
ahead.
<Q - Michael Lamotte>: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Dave, I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit on the
comment in the press release about the CGG collaboration. What is entailed in that agreement, where you think it goes?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Yeah. This is Jeff. Look, we're excited about that arrangement, and we think it's a great
combination. A couple of points, though. I think it demonstrates the value of DecisionSpace and its ability to adapt to
and help in seismic interpretation. It also – I think, the relationship advances our position there and our access to data to
further develop [ph] fab (52:01) software and serve a broader group of customers. The other thing that it does from our
perspective is it puts us in the seismic interpretation part of that business where we believe it is – where there's a lot of
value but then keeps us out of the seismic acquisition business.
<Q - Michael Lamotte>: Is there any potential pull-through on other services, you think, once you're in the door at the
interpretation level?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Well, I think that we'll work together, but I think the ability to advance the software and
have bigger data sets to work with will always pull through, probably more in the software space than more traditional
services. But clearly, we believe this is a positive move by Landmark.
<Q - Michael Lamotte>: Thanks, Jeff.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Jim Wicklund from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open, please go
ahead.
<Q - James Wicklund>: Good afternoon, guys.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Good afternoon.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Hey, Jim.
<Q - James Wicklund>: How long will it take the industry to respond to full prices one day were to go up and activity
one day started to move up? How long would it take the industry to recover 15% of activity in terms of people, but
industry overall?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Jim, this is Jeff. I'd love to have that conversation with you. I think that it would be a real
mix of response. And by that I mean the service industry broadly has been beaten up pretty good at what we believe are
unsustainable prices. But I think from our perspective, at least at Halliburton, I'm confident that we would respond
quite quickly. And if you recall, it was just 2014 when we hired more than 20,000 people on to the payroll at
Halliburton. And then the way we're taking care of our equipment now, I talked about the maintenance processes and
the Q10 Pumps, our ability to respond would be fairly quick.
<Q - James Wicklund>: Okay. I appreciate that. And you talk about slower velocity in the international sector. We've
seen guys like Chevron and obviously Pemex in Brazil, cut CapEx. Usually they're done, like you say, on a lower
velocity level, more annual longer-term contracts. How soon – U.S. onshore can react immediately. How long will it

take the NOCs and IOCs to start to pick up activity? Will it take an annual term?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Yeah. Again, you're right that that velocity is slower, but at the same time, it doesn't slow
down as quickly. So is it – typically we've seen that about a six-month lag behind the U.S., internationally in terms of
activity build, though, it just tends to be more stable. A lot of government approval is required and partner requirements
to get that ramped up. But inside of existing projects, I would say within six months to a year that activity could pick
back up.
<Q - James Wicklund>: Six months to a year. Okay. My unrelated follow-up, how many Lower Tertiary completions
do you expect to do this year versus how many did you do last year?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: The – look, again, a bit of a moving target, so [indiscernible] (55:35).
<Q - James Wicklund>: They all are, aren't they?

Thank you. And your next question comes from Rob MacKenzie from IBERIA Capital. Your line is now open, please
go ahead.
<Q - Rob J. MacKenzie>: Great. Thanks for fitting me in, guys. My question I guess is for Christian on receivables.
Can you give us a feel for how much of your receivables might be with E&P companies that are distressed or at risk of
being distressed to get a feel for the risk we might see for capital accounts?
<A - Christian A. Garcia>: As Jeff pointed out in his prepared remarks, one of the key tenets of our strategy is
customer alignment. And based on that, the concentration of our customer in North America, 17 customers represent
50% of our revenues, and those are the largest companies with better balance sheets that can withstand this downturn.
Now as such, we don't have much exposure to the smaller guys. It's not to say that we are totally immune, but it's much,
much lower than other service providers in the market today.
<Q - Rob J. MacKenzie>: Okay. And my related follow-up I guess would be a similar question. Internationally
vis-à-vis NOCs such as [ph] Hedavesa (57:02), Pemex, et cetera.
<A - Christian A. Garcia>: Yeah. No, absolutely. There's no question they have been slow paying. In fact, if you look
at their days working capital, it has gone up. Good to say that we lead in that metric, and it is still – and I think we've
widened the gap against our peers. But in terms of international, those are the largest companies in the world, and we
don't expect to have issues there as well.
