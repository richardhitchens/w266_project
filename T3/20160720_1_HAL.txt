press release which can be found on our website.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Dave.
David J. Lesar
Thank you, Lance, and good morning to everyone. Our second quarter results showed great resilience in the face of a
very challenging environment which included declining rig activity and even more pricing headwinds. Our total
company revenue declined only 9% sequentially, compared to the 19% decline in the global rig count. And our North
America revenue was down 15% from the prior quarter, significantly outperforming a 23% decline in the average U.S.
rig count. However, despite these continuing headwinds, based on the recent improvements to North American activity,
I believe that the second quarter will mark the trough for our earnings.
Now, we are at a dynamic point in the cycle, and I'm not going to waste the limited time we have with you on the call
this morning discussing things like the macroeconomics or worldwide demand, the general economy or commodity
prices. There are many public sources out there where you can get this data, including our customers' because that is
the world that they live in every day. What I want to talk about today is the world that we know best. Now,
conventional wisdom coming out of the first quarter was that the rig count would continue to drop. We said we saw
North America differently, and were the first to call a bottom for the rig count. This is precisely what happened.
So let's talk about the reality of today's North America market. I can summarize this market in one sentence. Today our
customers are thinking about growing their business again rather than being focused on survival. There are two distinct
factors at work in North America; psychological and economic. And I think it's critical to understand them both. Now,
you haven't heard me talk about the psychology of North American producers before. But given what has happened to
many of our customers in the last 18 months, I think it's an important point to understand. I've spend a large amount of
time with customers late in the quarter taking their pulse, and I can tell you there's a growing survivor mentality out
there. And you can't underestimate the positive change in attitude that we are seeing in our North American customers.
There is a spring in their step that I didn't see earlier in the year. And in almost every case, they're talking about adding
rigs, buying assets, or doing something value accretive. In short, they are getting back to business.
And the psychological factors are getting better. Oil reaching $50 per barrel, even for a brief time, was a critical,
emotional milestone for our customers, as was being able to buy a strip above $50 per barrel. But maybe it can be
summed up best by one customer who told me, Dave, it's actually a light at the end of the tunnel and not an oncoming
train. So to borrow a Keynesian economic term, the animal spirits are back in North America. But also understanding
the economic reality in North America is equally important.
Pricing has helped cash flow, but not enough. Hedges rolling off have created cash flow uncertainty. Balance sheet
repair is still critical, and many customers are looking at severe declines in production, as many of them have drilled
few wells in the last 18 months. And while there are many customers that have adequate liquidity, there is also a large
segment evaluating how to access capital. This evaluation is around whether to do dilutive equity deals, accessing the
high-yield markets, looking at reserve base lending, or partnering with private equity. But the important point is, they
are back in business.
Now, our North America customer management teams are great to work with. They're creative, adaptive, and
increasingly confident. And I believe they will find the solutions best tailored for their companies. This is also a smart
group. And they see today's looming supply shortfall and know that U.S. unconventionals will likely be the first and
deepest beneficiary of growing supply shortages. And you can be sure they want to reap some of that benefit.
So let's talk about how the cycle is starting to stack up and how this coming up-cycle will play out. Now, obviously, the
last two years has been a period of significant underinvestment, where global CapEx has been reduced by nearly $400
billion. As a result, the industry will have to find a lot of new barrels in the next five years. Now, you can choose your
own energy supply expert, and there are many of them out there, but most agree we will need between 18 million and

22 million barrels per day of new production by 2021, meaning, we have to find nearly two Saudi Arabias worth of
production in the next five years.
To achieve this production goal, we believe there will need to be structural changes that have to happen. It clearly starts
with a supportive commodity price, and we're not there yet today. The prices will have to get there soon or the supply
challenges will be even greater. Industry balance sheets will need to be repaired. The industry will need to replenish
experience lost to retirement and cut-backs. We will have to find sustainable ways to deepen the relationships between
operators and service companies, collaborating to integrate better, eliminate duplication and drive down delivery costs.
And finally, producers will have to accept the reality of service company economics. Some of the efficiency gains we
have made with our customers are in fact sustainable and will continue, but others, including deep uneconomic pricing
cuts, are unsustainable and will have to be reversed.
In this environment, we are confident that North America will recover the fastest. The North America market has
turned and we expect to see a continued modest up-tick in the U.S. rig count during the second half of the year and
becoming more meaningful as we go into 2017. And now that we have seen the floor in activity levels, we expect
revenue to increase based on higher utilization rates. And as we have said consistently, rig count stabilization is the first
step on the road to margin repair. And Jeff will discuss that in a few minutes.
Current service pricing in North America is unsustainable. We are in an environment where service providers are
unable to meet their cost of capital and many are struggling to recover even their cash costs. Historically, as we reach
the bottom, the downward momentum on pricing creates a headwind and margin repair tends to lag activity recovery by
a quarter or so. To break this typical cycle, we have made structural changes to our delivery platform, eliminating
management layers and consolidating roles and locations. As a result of these savings, we are confident that North
America margins can begin to recover in the third quarter.
When this downturn started, we said that we were entering it from a position of strength in all of our markets. Since
that time, we have executed our downturn playbook and have continuously outperformed the market, both in North
America as well as the Eastern Hemisphere, gaining market share in both.
So, to summarize, the market has played out as we predicted and our strategy is working. North America has turned,
and with our market share increase during the downturn, we believe we are the best positioned company. During the
coming recovery, we plan to scale up our delivery platform by addressing our product line building blocks one at a time
through a combination of organic growth and selective acquisitions.
With that, let me turn the call over to Mark and Jeff to cover our financial and operational results. Mark?
Mark A. McCollum
Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone.
Let me start with a summary of our second quarter results compared to our first quarter results. Total company revenue
for the quarter was $3.8 billion, which declined 9% compared to an 19% decline in the worldwide rig count. Total
company operating income declined 72%, primarily due to the continued decline in global activity and pricing, as well
as the reintroduction of depreciation expense for our previously held for sale assets.
Moving to our region results, North America revenue declined 15%, with margins moving down to an operating loss of
8%. The primary drivers were the impact of reduced pricing and activity in our stimulation, wireline and drilling
product lines. In Latin America, revenue declined 12% and operating income declined 54% as a result of reduced
activity levels in Brazil, Mexico and Colombia, and by our decision to curtail our activity in Venezuela. Rig activity in
both Brazil and Mexico is at a 20-year low, while Venezuela continues to experience significant political and economic
turmoil.
Turning to Middle East/Asia, revenue declined 3% while operating income declined 22%. We saw increased activity in
Kuwait and fairly consistent activity in Saudi Arabia. However, we also began to experience pricing pressure across the

region, and activity levels declined in Iraq, Australia, and Indonesia.
In Europe/Africa/CIS, second quarter revenue increased 2% and operating income increased 12% as a result of the
seasonal recovery of activity in the North Sea and Russia. Our corporate and other expense for the second quarter
totaled $60 million, and we expect third quarter expense to come in at similar levels.
We recorded a tax benefit for the second quarter of approximately $6 million. Based upon our current outlook for the
third quarter, we anticipate that our effective tax rate will be approximately 50%. This unusual rate results from having
tax losses in the U.S. that are then offset by taxable income in the foreign jurisdictions with lower statutory rates.
During the second quarter, we had several special charges that we need to highlight. First, as we previously disclosed,
we recognized the $3.5 billion termination fee associated with the Baker Hughes transaction. We also recognized
pre-tax restructuring and other charges of $423 million.
These charges consist primarily of severance cost and asset impairments as we continue to adjust our cost structure and
footprint to the current operating environment. The largest single item in that charge was a fair market value adjustment
required by accounting rules for exchanging $200 million of our Venezuela receivable for an interest-bearing
promissory note.
This instrument provides a more defined schedule around the timing of payments while generating a return while we
await payment. There is an immediate expense because accounting rules require that these notes be revalued to their
current trading value even if you intend to hold them to maturity. Our current intent is to hold them to maturity, and we
expect to collect 100% of the principal. As such, the notes will accrete back to their par value as they mature over the
next few years.
All of these adjustments are tax deductible, but the tax benefit we recorded also includes the impact of removing our
accounting assertion on permanently reinvesting our foreign earnings and some adjustments related to the carry-back of
our now sizable U.S. NOL. The NOL carry-back will provide us with a significant cash flow benefit later this year.
Speaking of cash flow, this quarter was particularly noisy because of the termination of the Baker Hughes deal and
continued restructuring work we are doing. When the smoke clears from the unusual items, however, cash flow from
operations was slightly positive, and we closed the quarter with $3.1 billion in cash and equivalents.
Over our history, it's not unusual for our annual cash flow to be back-end loaded in the year, and 2016 is no exception.
We continue to commit to living within our cash flows during this challenging environment and improving earnings,
and a number of working capital initiatives that we are implementing should get us ultimately to break even for the
year. Capital expenditures for the year are still expected to be approximately $850 million.
Turning to our short-term operational outlook, let me provide you with our thoughts on the third quarter. In North
America, the U.S. land rig count is already up 5% sequentially on average and is expected to improve modestly over
the remainder of the third quarter. We anticipate revenue will outperform the rig count by several hundred basis points
and that margins will improve by 100 basis points to 200 basis points as a result of our cost control initiatives and better
utilization.
In Latin America, we are anticipating a mid-teens percentage decline in revenue, with margins moving down to the
low-single digits. Although we may see some end-of-year sales, Latin America is expected to remain our most
challenged region throughout the international down-cycle, and we do not expect to see a fundamental improvement
this year.
And finally, third quarter Eastern Hemisphere revenue is expected to be down modestly, low-single digits, due to
declining activity and continued pricing headwinds. Looking ahead, we anticipate Eastern Hemisphere activity to
decline over the balance of the year. However, we expect margins to remain flat in the third quarter as they also benefit
from our cost control initiatives.
Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff for the operational update. Jeff?

Jeffrey Allen Miller
Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Let me start today with a headline. 900 is the new 2,000 for U.S. rig
activity. Now, what do I mean by that? I believe that it'll only take 900 rigs to consume all of the horsepower available
in the market. Why? Well, we know the North America market best. And we are in every single part of that market.
And what's clear to us is that the increases in rig efficiency, lateral length, and sand per well create a compounding
effect that consumes increasingly more horsepower per rig. In addition, we watch the effect of the downturn on North
America service capacity every day and every basin. We've seen the attrition of equipment, people, and companies.
So, let me take these in order. First, horsepower attrition continues due to scrapping and cannibalization. We believe up
to 4 million horsepower, and maybe even more, has been permanently removed from the market, representing about
20% of the horsepower capacity reported at the peak. And more is permanently impaired each day. Industry head count
reductions continue, and many of these people are leaving the industry. Finally, company bankruptcies and
consolidations also work to accelerate equipment attrition.
Now I want to address what we do as we scrape along the bottom and look ahead to the recovery. The steps are must be
present to win, and we are. We are present in every market. Second is reduce structural cost. We're doing it. Third,
increase utilization. We're positioned for it. And finally, get pricing help. This happens when utilization increases.
To be ready for the recovery, we played offense. First, we actively protected our market position with key customers,
kept the majority of our fleet deployed, and delivered fantastic service quality. Despite absorbing the pain of pricing
reaching unsustainable levels, we made a strategic decision to stay in every market and keep crews running. In spite of
the nearly 80% decline in rig count, our stage count only declined 33%. So here's what we're doing now.
We preserved idle equipment outside of our field locations so it doesn't get cannibalized. It's clear to me that it will be
cheaper to reactivate our cold stacked equipment than to put capital into cannibalized horsepower. This means we are
best positioned to more quickly get back to work in the market recovery and are prepared to activate equipment when
we see economic opportunities to do so.
In terms of structural cost control, we're making significant progress towards reducing our annual cost structure by $1
billion. We've reduced head count and consolidated facilities in every region. At the end of the second quarter, we're
about halfway there, both internationally and in North America. We anticipate the remaining savings will come in the
second half of the year, and we'll reach the $1 billion run rate cost savings as we go into 2017.
The next step is increased utilization. We know our platform is most effective when it's fully utilized. So job one is to
fill the white space in the calendar. This is why we work with customers to best utilize our platform, in turn helping our
customers produce at the lowest cost per BOE. Throughout the downturn, our superior delivery platform, which is our
value proposition – our people, processes, and equipment – results in a margin gap to nearly every competitor. And we
expect to maintain that advantage in the recovery.
The last step will be the return of pricing. Price negotiations have been a barroom brawl. And in certain situations, as
we've seen the signs of recovery, we've elected to walk away from money-losing jobs in recent months. We've been
reviewing every contract and program down to individual wells on a pad by pad basis, including opportunities for
pass-through and cost-related pricing and surcharges. It's a tough market, but we believe pricing will recover as activity
increases. And when we have these four things, we are confident our North America margins will return to double
digits.
But beyond North America land, our key focus areas are unconventionals, mature fields and deepwater. And I'm
pleased with how we're executing around the world. Though they may be limited, we're working closely with our
customers to unlock unconventionals in every region around the world, including recent projects in Abu Dhabi and
Argentina. In the Middle East, we've made significant inroads in our IPM business, taking a market-leading position
during the downturn. This reflects the dedication our employees have for understanding their customer needs,
identifying solutions and helping to reduce risks, all while improving efficiency in this uncertain market. This creates a
great environment for our collaborative and integrated business model, helping our customers to deliver the lowest cost

per barrel of oil.
Though we know deepwater is the most challenged, we are collaborating closely with our customers who are working
hard to drive down structural costs and make economic wells. BaraECD is an engineered drilling fluid system that
allows us to manage narrow frac gradients while drilling. In addition to reducing overall drilling times, BaraECD has
helped break records on rate of penetration and is one of multiple systems that have allowed us to take a number one
position in the Gulf of Mexico fluids market.
In Southeast Asia, we have a great example of a collaborative effort with a client that optimized the drilling solution,
including drill bits and fluids, for an exploration well, reducing the drilling time by 14 days. This cost savings helps to
deliver the lowest cost per BOE and is proof that when we work together with our customers and internally, we can
provide efficient solutions in any market. The ability to input customer requirements into our drill bit development in
short order is what enables us to deliver this collaborative solution.
Collaboration is central to everything we do. Not only do we say it, we do it. A great example is a new resource for
customers and partners called iEnergy, available through Landmark. It's an open architecture approach to
problem-solving. Now, iEnergy was conceived as a community of stakeholders sharing data and building applications.
Think of it as our open architecture approach in contrast to proprietary and closed models in the market today. This is
highly indicative of how we collaborate at Halliburton, not only collaborating internally, but collaborating more closely
with our customers. I could go on all day about specific products and services. Let me wrap up with what we do.
Our competitive advantage is this; we collaborate engineer solutions and execute to maximize our clients' asset value,
which means lower cost and making more barrels. This is why we maintain our global service footprint. We will own
the last mile, be present across the globe and maintain dead focus on service quality.
So to sum it up, we like our position. As we expected, the North America unconventional market has responded the
fastest, demonstrated by the recent activity pick-up. International markets will take more time to rebound, but we are
certainly well-positioned for when they do.
I want to close by thanking our employees for maintaining their focus on service quality and executing at every level in
this challenging market. Simply put, service quality is central to how we win and retain work. We've seen record-low
incident rates so far this year, and it's important we keep this focus on safety and service quality as the market begins to
pick up.
Now I'll turn the call over to Dave for closing comments. Dave?
David J. Lesar
Thank you, Jeff, and let me sum things up.
We are prepared for the North American up-cycle. Our approach to the market remains unchanged. The North
American market is turning. It will recover the fastest, and Halliburton will be the biggest beneficiary. In the next North
America rig cycle, 900 is the new 2,000. The international markets will follow, and we are maintaining our integrated
global services footprint, managing costs and continuing to gain share.
We are working hard at reducing structural costs. We expect to achieve $1 billion lower run rate going into 2017. We
remain laser-focused on consistent execution, generating superior financial performance and providing industry-leading
shareholder returns. And finally, we expect that the second quarter will be the trough of our earnings, and we are
confident that Halliburton will be best positioned to outperform in the recovery phase of the cycle.
Now, before we open it up for questions, I would like to thank Christian Garcia for his outstanding work over his 20
years at Halliburton, and particularly his work as Interim CFO during the past 18 months. I very much wish him well in
the future.
Now, let's open it up for questions.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Our first
question is from Scott Gruber with Citigroup.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: Yes. Good morning.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Good morning, Scott.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: Jeff, as someone who spends an inordinate amount of time on headlines and titles, I really like
your rig count headline. It's a good one.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Thank you.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: You stated that about 4 million horsepower has been removed from the North American frac
fleet. Could you just provide some color on this figure? How much do you think has been disassembled, cut up and
won't come back? How much is in more of a mothballed state? And overall, where do you think these figures could
stand by year end?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Let me go – maybe start with how we get to the 900 as the new 2,000 and then address
your question along the way. So the – going into the downturn equilibrium was about 2,000 rigs and 600 frac crews in
the U.S., so a little more than three rigs kept every frac crew busy. Really three factors at play here. So first, drilling
efficiency, then completions intensity and attrition. So from a drilling efficiency standpoint, rigs have gotten almost
30% faster, meaning more wells per rig per year, so that new ratio is closer to two to two-and-a-half rigs for every
crew.
Second is around completions intensity, and the jobs have gotten twice as big, meaning more horsepower per crew –
almost 20% more, meaning that the same horsepower that made up 600 crews now only make up 500.
And so then we get to the attrition part of that, and there are estimates that range from 3 million to 7 million
horsepower that have left the market. We think it's about 4 million. We see that because we're out in the market every
day looking at horsepower, but the fact is there's more horsepower that attrits every day just given the type of intensity.
So I think the important point is that the market can tighten maybe faster than you think.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: We certainly agree with that point. Quick follow-up. We hear that some of the most
dilapidated fleets could require $20 million, $25 million per fleet to reactivate, give it a really full refurb on all the key
components as needed. Is there an argument to be made that pump technology has progressed to the point where it's
just simply a better use of capital to build a new fleet than invest $20 million, $25 million to bring a legacy fleet back
out?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Well, Scott, it's certainly our view, and that is the way – why we kept our equipment the
way we have. We've segregated it with – I've described it as we stacked equipment with the end in mind, so it doesn't
take capital to do that. But I do believe that equipment that has not been maintained and has been cannibalized, it'd be
very difficult to get that economically back into the marketplace.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: Great. Thanks.

<Q - James C. West>: Hey, good morning, gentlemen, and congratulations on a well-executed quarter.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Hey, James.
<Q - James C. West>: So, Jeff, probably for you, in terms of the North American landmark and really just because of
the devastation of the industry and particularly your competition, we see a lot of bottlenecks that are going to appear;
labor, working capital, attrition like you just discussed, logistics. Could you maybe comment on what you see from the
competitive landscape and where these bottlenecks, these pinch points might occur first or earliest? And then how
Halliburton can mitigate these issues relative to the competition that really can't do a whole lot?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Thank you, James. Yeah, I mean, you nailed it. I mean, the pinch points will be
equipment, sand and people. And we spent time on equipment, but clearly the approach we've taken around equipment
is to be best-positioned to get that equipment back into the marketplace. So we've talked about that.
From a sand standpoint, it's not the sand as much as it is the logistics, and in our view, we are very well-positioned
around that. Having built out our infrastructure over the last several years, we've got sand delivery in every basin, and
we've got sufficient rail infrastructure to address the logistics part of that.
And then finally, around people – and we've been careful as we've gone through sort of these restructurings to do our
very best, anyway, to retain experienced people, and we have those today. And then don't forget, it was just in 2014, we
put 21,000 people on to the payroll, and so we know how to do that and we know how to make those people effective.
So, feel like Halliburton is well-positioned.
<Q - James C. West>: Right. I certainly agree. And do you think that some of the market share gains in North
America have occurred because of your ability to ramp back up relative to the competition and that the – your customer
base understands these bottlenecks and these issues?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Yes, I do. I mean, it's part of the flight to quality. And as I describe our value proposition,
it's our process, people, and equipment. And a big part of that is the reliability of Halliburton to stay. And we have
stayed in all of the key markets.
<Q - James C. West>: Got it. Thanks, guys.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question is from Jud Bailey with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Judson E. Bailey>: Thanks. Good morning. Dave, I was hoping to get a little more color with your thoughts on
thinking about North America over the back half of the year. Oil touched $50, as you noted. It's kind of pulled back a
little bit, closer to $45 or a little below now. How does that impact expectations in terms of activity increase in the back
half of the year? Is $45 enough? And also is it sufficient to stabilize the pricing environment? It sounds like pricing is
still under pressure. So just like to get your thoughts on maybe the moving parts in the back half of the year as we think
about oil in the mid-$40s.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Yeah, let me maybe start that and then may be follow-up. So the – we call it a landing
point, which means rigs stop falling. But I think it's important that the – it's a sentiment that trumps the oil price right
now. So based on conversations, they are clearly more positive and constructive than they have been in the past. But
realize we were starting at the worst part of the market, a lot of the worst had been factored into plan, so moving up
from what were clearly the worst plans. And I would call it a measured step-up as opposed to a boom. And so certainly
seeing positive things. We think we'll be well-positioned for that whatever shape that recovery takes.
<Q - Judson E. Bailey>: Okay. No, that's helpful. Thanks. And my follow-up is maybe for Mark. Mark, the margin
guidance for North America up, I think you said 100 basis points, 200 basis points. That implies probably a little bit

lower incremental margins than I would've thought given the cost cutting you guys are doing. Can you maybe talk a
little bit more about the moving parts and thinking about how margins can move up in 3Q and then again in 4Q given
the cost-cutting initiatives?
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: Well, I mean, clearly, cost-cutting initiatives are helping us. And we're being able to get
out there and address. But I think that the thing you've got to key off of what Jeff was saying that while sentiment has
changed, we're still in a very low-activity environment. Our first course of action is to get utilization on the equipment
that's out there in the field and depress that quite a bit. There are, because you can see it in our numbers, right, there is
equipment out there that's ultimately not covering fixed cost. And so we're working on trying to make sure that, that
equipment, as we get it utilized, is being as efficient as possible to move our margins.
I think that as we work through the restructuring, that's going to continue to add margin points on everything. I mean, I
guess what we're saying is we're not counting on price at this point. I mean, the market itself is utilization of what we
are going after. We're fighting for price every single day. But it's still – it's hand-to-hand combat, as Jeff said, out there.
And so we're not necessarily baking that into the forward look today.

Our next question is from Angie Sedita with UBS. You may begin.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Thanks. Well, good morning, guys.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Good morning.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: So, Jeff, I also thought it was very interesting your comments there on the 900 rigs is the new
2,000. And so if you take that one step further, I guess you can conclude that, that would imply in your minds that frac
utilization would probably be near last cycle peaks of 90%. And then if you could take that another step forward is
what would that imply on normalized margins this cycle and how you think the pricing will play out this cycle? Is it
once we start to reach that 90% utilization, or could we see pricing before then?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Well, I think we see – let's take the pricing first. I mean, that will follow utilization. So as
we've described it in the past, we would expect to see utilization begin to tighten, and at which point you start to see
pass-throughs of things and opportunities to improve margins that aren't necessarily priced. The real pricing leverage,
we actually didn't see in the last cycle. We were getting to that in late 2014, just about the time things slowed down. So
a lot of the value creation we're able to accomplish with our platform that's efficient and putting the utilization to it.
Yeah, I think the rest of that was to look forward around margin progression. Look, I would expect – very able to
accomplish what we did last time, except probably do better given the fact that we've done some of the heavy lifting
around structural costs, so very encouraged about how things would look in the future.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Okay, that's helpful. So you think margins could go back to where they were last cycle given
the cost cutting and a 900 rig count?
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: Yeah.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Certainly [indiscernible] (38:24).
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Okay, very helpful. And then on the international side, can you – whatever color you do you
have, thoughts on when you think we could see the bottom in some of these regions? And also it was very impressive
you saw some market share gains in your international markets. Maybe you could talk about that a little bit.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Yeah. So typically, international business will trail U.S. behavior by six months to nine
months, and that's – it's historically done that. I don't expect that it's any different, so that means that it is still an

absolute brawl in the Eastern Hemisphere. And what the things that mute that a little bit are the length of the contract
terms which causes it to respond more slowly. And then so from a, in my view, margin resilience, it is really reflecting
better visibility that we have because of the longer timeframe and our team, the Halliburton team just absolutely
executing on all points.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: And then on the market share gain?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Look, that's...
<A - David J. Lesar>: Yeah, Angie, let me take that one because I think it's important to understand it's the Eastern
Hemisphere is sort of a tale of two customer groups. You have – you've got the NOCs generally with mature fields and
they're just trying to squeeze more out of their mature fields through their existing infrastructure. And that part of the
business actually has held up pretty well. There's certainly some pricing pressure there. There's certainly some issues
with customers trying to lower their cost per BOE. I think it's the deepwater complex that is the most challenged in this
commodity price environment. And we clearly are working with our customers, as are all the other contractors, to try to
push that cost, that breakeven cost down in the deepwater complex. But where pricing is today, it just doesn't work
generally in the deepwater, especially the new deepwater.
So we have been – we've been focused on making sure that we get market share gains, even as the market has shrunk,
because in the long-term contracting nature of that market, when it does turn back up, you've got those contracts in
hand, and that market share becomes very sticky at that point in time.

guys.

Our next question is from Bill Herbert with Simmons. You may begin.
<Q - Bill Herbert>: Thanks. Good morning. Mark, back to the North American margin question. Just trying to
understand it better. I mean, if you just focus on the quarterly rate of change and let's just presume – I mean you made
the prophecy I think with a reason that your revenues would markedly outperform the rig count in the third quarter. So
just presuming a 10% increase in top line and only a 200 basis point improvement in margin, that implies a 15%
incremental. And at this stage, that's – just seems to be woefully anemic recognizing the fact that you're underemployed
from an asset-employment standpoint. Is there a negative pricing role that's also being taken into account in the third
quarter? Or would you characterize the guidance as conservative?
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: Bill, I actually am glad you asked the question because I was sitting here thinking there
was another point that I didn't get a chance to make on the earlier comment. Of one of the things that we're already
beginning to see in the marketplace is a little bit of cost inflation.
<Q - Bill Herbert>: Okay.
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: We're seeing it in diesel, we're seeing it in some commodities and things, and so we're
already, believe it or not, at this point beginning to fight inflation. And so during this period of time, this sort of off the
bottom here with the slope that – of the shallow slope that we're on, it makes it challenging. Right? You've got to –
we've got to get capacity utilization before you can really go get price. We're going to push, but those – some of the
commodities are starting to poke their head up and it's catching us a little bit, and that's part of what's being reflected in
there.
<Q - Bill Herbert>: Okay. And then, Jeff, with regard to the evolution of

your Q2 stage count, how would you characterize – how did that evolve? I mean – and I guess the specific question is
whether the June exit rate stage count was markedly higher than the Q2 average?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Yeah. I mean, we saw – it was higher in June, so the exit rates were higher than sort of the
quarter average, which is reflective of a couple of things, which is modest amount of rig activity, but also we see DUCs
being worked off. And I wouldn't describe DUCs as a bow wave, but they are in the mix. And because we're in the
market the way we are, we're a beneficiary of that.
<Q - Bill Herbert>: And how would you describe the frac calendar for the second half of the year? Is it
disproportionally weighted towards Q3 and pretty solid and hopeful for Q4 or pretty evenly distributed? How would
you characterize your frac calendar right now?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Well, it's – we've always got better visibility sooner than we do further out, but it – I
would describe it as more evenly weighted at this point in time than heavier to Q3.

Thank you. Our next question is from Sean Meakim with JPMorgan. You may begin.
<Q - Sean C. Meakim>: Hey, good morning.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Hey.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Good morning, Sean.
<Q - Sean C. Meakim>: So just thinking about the frac business, Jeff talked about walking away from work in some
cases, and some of your peers have talked about requiring 20% to 30% higher pricing in order to justify reactivating
frac crews. Just curious if you see it the same way? And thinking about your thoughts on, what will it take for pricing
to move higher and how much you'd need in order to bring equipment to the market?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Yeah, Sean, this is Jeff. Look, we're just not going to talk about pricing at this point in
time. So we continue to look at every crew in terms of what's economic. And as we've described before, we hear a lot
about customer alignment, basin alignment and customers that are able to consume our platform in a way that helps us
and helps them, and so we continue to view it that way.
<Q - Sean C. Meakim>: Okay. Fair enough. And then, Mark, you talked about – in previous discussions, you've talked
about being opportunistic on some of the upcoming debt maturities. Maybe you pay down some with cash on hand.
Maybe in some cases, you extend some depending on what the market's giving you. Capital markets seems fairly
amenable today for those with even more challenged balance sheets. Just curious how you're thinking about debt
reduction measures or the other potential changes to the capital structure over time.
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: I think our best opportunity right now is continue to look at maturities as they come due.
We've got a $600 million maturity coming up in the back half of the year. Our current intent right now is to make that
payment out of our cash flow. We should have the ability to do that. That's a part of our cash flow forecast for the year.
So that's the current intent. We're just going to continue to watch it, we're just continuing to watch it very carefully. But
we've got $3.1 billion of cash on the balance sheet. It's a little more than we need. With some of these maturities
coming, and you'll notice that we've taken the tax hits to be able to move our money around as we need it no matter
where it is in the world. So right now, our current plan is just continue to naturally de-lever.
<Q - Sean C. Meakim>: Understood. Thanks for your time.

Thank you. Our next question is from Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may begin.
<Q - Timna Beth Tanners>: Hey. Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Good morning.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Good morning.
<Q - Timna Beth Tanners>: I was hoping you could provide a little bit more color about some of your international
comments. In particular, I wanted to take advantage of you being the first call since Brexit to see if you have any
comments on your broader thinking about what that might imply for North Sea operations.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Look, we don't see Brexit alone having a dramatic effect. Though, clearly, like in so many
economies around the world, oil and gas is a clear path to help an economy, so in some ways, I think that that would be
structurally a positive in the U.K. sector of the North Sea. But immediately, no impact.
<Q - Timna Beth Tanners>: Okay, great. And then similarly, you talked about the six-month to nine-month lag in
international operations, but more challenges in Latin America. What do you think we should watch for to think about
what would trigger the recovery in that region?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Yeah, the – Latin America is a – has terrific reserves. I mean, the bottom line is the
reserves are there, and we've been in some countries in Latin America for 80 years. So I think the positive signs are
going to be production. It's pleasing to see in Brazil, for example, Petrobras clearly back on the business pages today,
talking about wells that are producing. But I think stability in commodity price is going to have to be one of the first
things that helps in Latin America, just given kind of financially where some of our customers are. But look, it's the
kind of market that over time will clearly rebound, clearly rebound.
<Q - Timna Beth Tanners>: But it's just going to be later because of the more reliance on oil prices? Or what makes it
so much later? Or what you think is going to be that trigger, like you said?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Well, I think it's later partly because you've got to almost go country by country in terms
of some of the disruption that's going on. And so Mexico is working through sort of a market reorganization, along
with some other things that have to settle out. I believe Brazil, in terms of sort of the cost of deepwater, is always an
overhang and how they work through that. And then the other big one being Venezuela, and clearly a lot of turmoil
there too, and it's very unfortunate. But hope to see resolution over time.
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: Part of it's just the natural budgeting cycle for many of our NOCs clients. Their annual
budget – they'll have to take their budgets and get it approved by legislative bodies. They're working off a year without
significant – they're not spending and they don't have a lot of cash flow. And so that means that really until those
budgets are approved, they're not going to be spending. And often times that ends up happening sort of later, late first
quarter or even into the second quarter before everything's approved. And so that starts to push out the ramp in
spending. Even if they see higher prices, that pushes out the ramp in spending beyond what others might see, whereas
in North America, they're not reliant on legislative bodies. They get out and they spend quickly as soon as they have the
cash flow.
<Q - Timna Beth Tanners>: Okay, that makes a lot of sense. Thanks so much.

Our next question is from David Anderson with Barclays. You may begin.
<Q - J. David Anderson>: Thanks. Dave, you had talked about the psychology of the E&P getting better. I was just
curious, so one big part of it has to be the lower breakeven costs that they're seeing. And I've been seeing in a number
of presentations from E&Ps who seem to think that the cost that they have now are basically locked in place. Just
curious how those discussions go. Are they expecting to see oil service inflation? I mean, is this kind of how they're
kind of locking in the next kind of couple of years? I'm just kind of wondering about that part of the psychology of the
cost side.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Oh, man. Good question, Dave. I think the conversations go like this. Hey, we've finally driven
service prices down to where we can breakeven [ph] sort of plus 40 (50:52). My response to that is, yeah, for right now.
But you're not going to have any service industry to take care of you if you think that's where pricing is going to stay.
And then you get into sort of a to and fro about what is sustainable. And Jeff hit on some of them. Rig efficiency is
sustainable. The speed that we can drill out laterals is sustainable. The bigger jobs and higher production is sustainable.
But that doesn't come without a cost. And so, as I said, these are a great set of customers. They know in their heart of
hearts that service prices have to go up. They are going to fight that – that impact of prices coming up as fast and as
long as they can, but the reality is they know they need a viable service industry to be successful in the long run. So it
will be give and take. And my guess in – as we listen to the calls over the next few quarters is the operators will say
they've got them locked in and the service companies are going to say we've got to have price increases. And we'll end
up in the middle somewhere like we always do.
<Q - J. David Anderson>: Okay. So it's a bit of a disconnect now that kind of gets played out over the next year or
two. But there is an acknowledgement that the service costs do have to go up at some point though within the – you
think in the heart of hearts that they do acknowledge that there has to be some in there.
<A - David J. Lesar>: In their heart of hearts, they have to know that. And I believe they do know that.

Thank you. Our next question is from Kurt Hallead with RBC. You may begin.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Hey, good morning.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Good morning.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Good morning, Kurt.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Hey. I just wanted to calibrate – see if you guys can calibrate some information for me. So you
guys talk about a 4-million horsepower reduction in U.S. frac market, so that puts maybe the market at about 14 million
horsepower, give or take. We've heard, depending on who you want to talk to, maybe about 6 million of that
horsepower is currently active in the market, and of that 6 million horsepower, you guys talk about a lot of white space,
that 6 million horsepower is maybe working 50% of the time. Does that kind of jive with how you see the market right
now? Or could you help me understand it a little bit better if you think some of those numbers are off?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: No. I mean, I don't think those numbers are inconsistent with kind of how we view the
market, and that's why we describe the path back as it starts with utilization of what's there. I think there are barriers to
a lot of that equipment ever makes it back into the market, and I do think that unattended equipment almost attrits on its
own, particularly with cannibalization that we hear others talking about it, so don't think you're wrong.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: So then in the context, as we try to think about the opportunity for margin improvement vis-à-vis
pricing, do we need to get back up to 8 million horsepower now being active in the market, give or take, or is it
sufficient to get that 6 million horsepower – we all agree generally on those numbers. Can we get that 6 million
horsepower up to 80% utilization? And is that sufficient to start to drive some pricing? Any viewpoints on that?

<A - David J. Lesar>: Yeah, I think – let me take that one, because I think – again, we're not going to go down any
pricing path today. We have a pricing strategy that we're going to follow. We're not going to share it with anybody. It'll
be sort of a discussion customer by customer, but I would say one thing is necessary. Don't fall into the trap, as not all
pumping equipment is the same. I mean, there are pumping companies out there that have zero utilization today
because they can't find a customer, or they're in the wrong basin, or their equipment is not qualified to basically sort of
pump the formation where they are.
So, I mean, I think that there is a bifurcation, trifurcation, whatever you want to call it, amongst the pressure pumping
companies, and I think a lot of people like to lump everybody together and sort of talk about averages. But I really
think it's important to sort of segregate the market into the various basins, the various customers that are drilling, the
types of formations that are being drilled, the kinds of completions that are getting done before you sort of get the – a
more granular view of sort of what is really going on out there.
And I think that's a view we have, and I think it's a strategic advantage that we have. But I think it's important to sort of
stay away from averages because I think you can actually draw the wrong conclusions about sort of the health of the
industry.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: All right. That's great color. And my follow-up is on the international front. What region do you
think will kind of lead the way out? And what product lines you think if – if frac is where you're very well-positioned
in the U.S. among others to kind of lead, where do you think, internationally, Halliburton is best-positioned to lead on
the way out internationally?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Look, I think the Middle East has demonstrated the most resilience, and I think that when
we think about our business, we tend to think more mature fields, unconventionals and deepwater. And so from a
mature fields standpoint, setting aside the Middle East, I think Asia probably has sort of the next chunk of runway, and
we are very well-positioned there, I'd say, in all of our service lines.

you guys do a lot of your – most all your own work. But are we to the point in terms of sentiment – and you mentioned
optimism by your customers, and clearly you're optimistic. Have we gotten to the point that service companies are now
willing to look at increasing CapEx in anticipation of 2017?
And then that really applies more to your state of mind for the future. You guys state that the recovery this year will be
anemic, but it will get better next year. Are we starting to free up that sentiment in terms of capital from the service
side?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Look, Jim, it's interesting. Forgings actually indicate more to me that they are trying to
replace cannibalized parts. In a lot of way, I mean, forgings tend to be consumables as they repair equipment, so one
could interpret that as, we have run out of cannibalized equipment and now we're having to replace things. So I don't
see that as maybe the change in sentiment that maybe you do, but – so, anyway...
<Q - James Wicklund>: I'll take restocking consumables; I'll take that as the first step.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Okay. Step one.
<Q - James Wicklund>: Okay, guys. I appreciate it. Thanks so much.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Thank you.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.
David J. Lesar
Okay. Thank you, Shannon. I would like to wrap up this call with just a few key takeaways. First, we like our position.
We've maintained our global integrated service footprint, outperformed during the downturn and taken share. Second,
for North America, the landing point's now behind us, and our customers are talking about growth, not survival. And
finally, we're in the best position for the recovery. We will on the last mile continue to address our cost structure and
collaborate with our customers to maximize their asset value. Look forward to talking to you again next quarter.
Shannon, you can close out the call.
Operator
