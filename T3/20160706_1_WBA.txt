Stefano Pessina
Thank you, Gerald. As you can see from our results, I am pleased to announce that we have delivered another solid
performance with adjusted earnings per share of $1.18, better than original expectation. We have also made further
progress in positioning our company for the future. We are continuing to build a strong business partnership across our
markets. In the U.S., we have made particularly good progress in developing a closer relationship with payers and
PBMs. In March, we exercised our first tranche of warrants in AmerisourceBergen, purchasing common stock. We
subsequently extended our pharmaceutical distribution and sourcing arrangements by three years. ABC has agreed to
make certain working capital investments in the relationship, and we'll proceed with additional capital investments in
its distribution network.
Our proposed acquisition of Rite Aid is progressing as planned. As you know, we are in the process of seeking a
regulatory approval, in parallel our integration team is continuing its work on preliminary planning. In June, we
completed a $6 billion public bond offering to support the funding of the acquisition. Also in June, I'm pleased to report
that we achieved our $1 billion synergy goal for fiscal 2016 from the Walgreens and Alliance Boots merger.
June was quite a busy month for us. We have also changed our senior management responsibility to structure the
company in a way that is more efficient, following the successful integration of Walgreens Boots Alliance, as we move
to operating a unified company. To support me in my role, we have created Co-Chief Operating Officers, Alex Gourlay
and Ornella Barra, who will oversee the day-to-day activities of the company, with the support of George Fairweather,
as Global Chief Financial Officer, and Marco Pagni as Global Chief Administrative Officer and General Counsel, and,
of course, with the continued support of all other senior leaders.
Over the past 10 years, Alex and Ornella have established an extremely effective working partnership, and that created
significant value for our company to-date. They will be instrumental in driving the operations of our company in the
next phase of its evolution.
This will allow me to focus even more on driving the growth strategy and developing our company. You can be
assured, however, that this change will not in any way reduce my scrutiny and expectations of our businesses and the
team.
Since the quarter end, as you have seen, the UK referendum on Europe has created some uncertainty and volatility in
our markets. Our businesses and management teams have operated through many business cycles in many markets. For
us, change is normal and sign of life. We work with and manage it every day. Yes, volatility and uncertainty create
issues to be overcome, but they also provide opportunity for our company. It is our job to ensure that we meet these
opportunities positively, and position and structure our company to its best advantage.
As events unfold, and the uncertainty in the wider markets is resolved, I am confident that we will emerge well
positioned as we enter more optimistic times. The progress that we have made to-date gives us a stronger platform from
which to drive further efficiencies, meet the challenges of current volatility in many of our markets, and the potential
wide economic impact this may have in many of the region we work in, and puts us in an even better position for the
company to deliver long-term success.
Now, let me hand over to George.

George Rollo Fairweather
Thank you, Stefano. I'd like to start by pointing out that for the first time since the acquisition of Alliance Boots, we
have fully comparable quarterly results.
Net sales for the quarter totaled $29.5 billion, up 2.4% versus the same quarter last year. These were impacted by
currency translation, net sales on a constant currency basis being up 3.3%. GAAP operating income was $1.5 billion,
up 9.4%. GAAP net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.1 billion and diluted EPS was $1.01.
The decrease in both GAAP net earnings and net earnings per share was due to fluctuations in the fair value of our
ABC warrants.
Adjusted operating income was $1.8 billion, up 3.7%. On a constant currency basis, this represents an increase of 4.7%.
Adjusted net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.3 billion, up 14.7%, and adjusted diluted
earnings per share was $1.18, up 15.7%.
The adjusted effective tax rate, which we calculate excluding the equity income from ABC, was 24.4%, the rate
benefiting from revisions to the full year tax rate forecast including certain discrete items. We now expect the full year
adjusted effective tax rate to be broadly in line with the year-to-date rate of 27.2%.
For completeness, here are the numbers for the first nine months of fiscal 2016. These results are of course not directly
comparable with the first nine months of the previous year. I will not go through them in detail, but you will see that
GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.88 was down 28.7%. This reflects a number of accounting factors including the
fluctuations in the warrants, and last year's noncash gain relating to Alliance Boots. On an adjusted basis, diluted
earnings per share increased by 17.3% to $3.52.
So turning now to our segmental performance, starting, as usual, with the Retail Pharmacy USA. Total sales for the
quarter in Retail Pharmacy USA were $21.2 billion, an increase of 3.7% over the same quarter last year. Sales growth
was driven by an increase in pharmacy, partially offset by the sale of a controlling interest in our Infusion business
back in April 2015. Comparable store sales increased by 3.9%. As we expected, adjusted gross margin declined by 0.5
percentage points to 26.9%, lower pharmacy margin being partially offset by retail products.
Adjusted gross profit was up 1.8% to $5.7 billion, and adjusted SG&A was $4.3 billion, an increase of 1.1%. Now as
you may recall, in the same quarter last year, SG&A was lower than normal. This was because we had a temporary
pause in certain investments while we evaluated the returns being generated.
We are pleased with our performance and we are well on track towards achieving our overall target savings from our
cost transformation program. This program, the vast majority of which is in the U.S., will deliver $1.5 billion by the
end of fiscal 2017. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 6.5%, resulting in adjusted operating income of $1.4
billion, up 4.1%.
So turning now to look in more detail at Pharmacy. Total U.S. Pharmacy sales in the quarter were up 5.8%. We filled
235 million prescriptions on a 30-day basis including immunizations, an increase of 3.9%. This reflects our strategy of
increasing script volume in our stores. On a comparable basis, Pharmacy sales increased by 6%, scripts filled being up
by 4.5%, primarily due to continued growth in Medicare Part D volume.
Our reported market share of retail prescriptions on the usual 30-day adjusted basis was 19.6%. Over the year ago
quarter, this was up approximately 30 basis points. As we expected, gross margins were lower mainly due to
reimbursement rates and changes in mix, partially offset by procurement efficiencies.
Retail product sales on a comparable basis increased by 0.1%. This was primarily due to higher sales in the health and
wellness and photo categories partially offset by declines in certain convenience categories. As we've said previously,
we are focused on expanding front-of-store gross margins and are pleased with the progress we've made this quarter.
To further drive performance, we are starting to expand our differentiated beauty offering across over 1,800 stores, and
expect to complete this phase by the end of calendar 2016.

So turning next to our Retail Pharmacy International division. Total sales in the quarter for the Retail Pharmacy
International division were $3.2 billion, an increase of 3.4% on a constant currency basis. Comparable store sales
increased by 0.2%, clearly, comparable figures are in constant currency.
Adjusted operating margin was 8.1%, up 0.4 percentage points in constant currency. This resulted in adjusted operating
income of $258 million, an increase of 8% in constant currency.
Comparable Pharmacy sales decreased by 0.7% due to Boots in the UK and the loss of certain institutional sales
contracts in Chile. In Boots UK, comparable Pharmacy sales were down 1% due to the negative impact of a reduction
in government pharmacy funding that was expected. As you may know, the U.K. government has been consulting with
the industry on pharmacy funding. The consultation period closed at the end of May and we are awaiting to hear their
conclusions.
Comparable Retail sales for the division increased 0.7% with strong performances in the Republic of Ireland and
Thailand. Boots UK's comparable retail sales increased by 0.6%. We were particularly pleased with the performance of
our Sleek cosmetics brand acquired in November last year, and No7, where in April, we successfully launched our new
Lift & Luminate TRIPLE ACTION Serum.
So turning now to our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division. Total sales in the Pharmaceutical Wholesale division were
$5.7 billion. In April, we sold Alliance Healthcare Russia to 36.6 in return for a 15% stake in the combined group.
Comparable sales, on a constant currency basis, excluding acquisitions and dispositions increased by 6.3%. This was
ahead of our estimate of market growth, weighted on the basis of our country wholesale sales.
In a number of our emerging markets, sales growth was particularly strong. Adjusted operating margin was 3%, level
with the same quarter last year. Within the Pharmaceutical Wholesale division, we report our 16% share of ABC's net
earnings. While this is reported on a two-month lag, the quarter included only two weeks of equity method income.
Overall, the division's adjusted operating income increased 4.7% to $179 million. On a constant currency basis, the
increase was 7.6%, of which 4.7% was for ABC. Next quarter, we will recognize the full three-month share of ABC's
net earnings, based on their quarter to the end of June.
Combined net synergies in the quarter from the strategic combination with Alliance Boots were $330 million. This
takes the cumulative total up to the quarter end to $947 million. As Stefano said, since the quarter end, we have
achieved our goal of reaching at least $1 billion of combined net synergies. Going forward, we will, therefore, not be
breaking them out separately, as we have said before.
In the quarter, operating cash flow was $2.1 billion. This was due to our solid profit performance and favorable
working capital cash flows. Cash capital expenditure was $247 million. This resulted in free cash flow of $1.9 billion.
Looking to the full fiscal year results, we have raised the lower end of our guidance by $0.10. Guidance is, therefore,
$4.45 to $4.55. This assumes no impact from the proposed acquisition of Rite Aid and related financing, and already
assumes current exchange rates for the rest of the fiscal year. Looking forward, to fiscal 2017, our current plan is to
issue guidance in October when we announce our full year results.
I will now hand back to Gerald. Thank you.
Gerald Gradwell
Thank you. Operator, could we now throw the call open for Q&A?

My pleasure. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with Bank of
America. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
<Q - Steven J. Valiquette>: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Congrats on these results. I guess, a couple of things I
wanted to touch on was, I guess, first, just on the renegotiation of the distribution agreement with AmerisourceBergen
that was announced a few months ago, I've seen that was maybe driven by some shifting of cash flow, but just curious
if you have any additional color on that? And also, what drove the timing of that renegotiation? Thanks.
<A - Stefano Pessina>: You can understand – Stefano here – that we cannot comment on a contract. We have been
quite clear that there has been some agreement on extending our payment terms, .and also an agreement on the size of
their investments to follow us in our future expansion. So we cannot go farther. But, of course, if we have extended our
agreement by three years and we have committed to take them as our, the main source for the future, we have done this
because we had the right risk for doing it.
<Q - Steven J. Valiquette>: Okay. Got you. One other quick one. Just the legacy Walgreens management used to talk
about driving gross profit growth at maybe 100 basis points or maybe one percentage point higher than SG&A cost
growth. It seemed you achieved that this quarter in Retail Pharmacy USA because you had 2% gross profit growth, 1%
growth in SG&A dollars. Just curious, should we still think about that relationship in terms of managing the U.S.
operations? Or have the targets changed a little bit with, obviously, some of the management changes as well? Thanks.
<A - George Rollo Fairweather>: We haven't, since the formation of Walgreens Boots Alliance, published any targets
relating to this. Our focus is obviously on growing our overall profits. We're focused on improving our retail gross
margin, which I talked about in my presentation. And then on the Pharmacy side we've talked about, very clearly, that
our focus is on growing our profitability on Pharmacy in a way linked to building our volume. We're clearly pleased
with the share gains that we've announced today, which is really continuing the trend we've seen for some time.
<Q - Steven J. Valiquette>: Okay. Got it. Okay. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
<Q - Lisa Christine Gill>: Great. Thank you very much, and good morning. I was wondering maybe you could just
give us a little more color around your new relationship with Optum. It appears that they've been winning some nice
pieces of business in the marketplace. Do each of those new pieces of the business, are they tied to the new relationship
that you have? So any incremental color you can give us around expectations of the types of volumes you could see
with the new Optum relationship.
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Hi, Lisa. It's Alex here. We've had a great relationship with Optum on with cash before
that for many years. So our relationship is very strong, historically and has improved in the last period, as you've seen.
And they are doing a nice job, I think, in the market with their offer. And we are helping particularly with the Select90
program, which gives the customer the choice to go to mail order or have 90-day retail. And we believe from the
evidence we've seen before that 90-day retail is a very good option for customers, and so does Optum. So with that
relationship and with the contract we have in place to support it, we are working with them on a commercial basis. And
they're doing a nice job in winning contracts which, obviously, we are very pleased about. Going forward we hope to
see them continue to be successful, and we hope to be their partner commercially for the medium to long-term as we
have been in the past. So when they win, I believe that we win, as we have done in the past we will do in the future.
<Q - Lisa Christine Gill>: Alex, is there any way to put any kind of numbers or expectations around that as we think
about pieces of business that we've known publicly that they've won? And any thoughts at this point? Or do you think
it's too early?
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: It's really too early. With these contracts, as you know, all these contracts start in
January 1. And the focus that we have, our part of the deal, is to make sure we give a great customer experience to their

health plan members as they come into Walgreens, so that we can actually make sure that we pull through the
customers and they stick with us. And that's the bit that Richard and the team have done a great job, on in the last
period, as you've seen by our volume increase and by gradual increase in market share. So we're confident that when
they win contracts we can win more than our fair share. But our job is to make sure we do that by providing great
service and care at the pharmacy.
<Q - Lisa Christine Gill>: Okay. Great. And then just a follow-up. George, I know you said that included in the
guidance is the expectation around currency. But can you just remind us what the EPS sensitivity is to FX? I know
you've talked about this in the past, but I just want to make sure we have this correctly.
<A - George Rollo Fairweather>: Just [ph] George, to pull you off that (25:28) Stefano.
<A - Stefano Pessina>: I was saying [indiscernible] (25:33) we analyzed and we made our calculation over the life of
the contract. When you see a new contract, you don't have to expect to see the benefits immediately. The benefit will
come, and it will be, of course, bigger, if we perform well. And you will see a growth during the entire life of the
contract. So the benefit of all the contacts that we will do will be – will grow over the next years. Sorry about that.
<Q - Lisa Christine Gill>: That's okay. And, George?
<A - George Rollo Fairweather>: I think as we've said before, in terms of currency translation, a 1% movement in the
value of the pound versus the U.S. dollars, approximately $0.01 impact on adjusted EPS.
<Q - Lisa Christine Gill>: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Please
go ahead.
<Q - Robert Patrick Jones>: Great. Thanks for the questions. Just trying to get a better gauge of the fundamental
performance of the Retail USA business. You guys have given us details on synergies every quarter. Could you maybe
give us a sense of how you're tracking on the SG&A savings relative to the $1.5 billion target by the end of fiscal
2017? And how we should think about how that's contributing to the EBIT growth in the quarter would be really
helpful.
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Hi, Robert. It's Alex here. Yeah, so I think as George said in the script, we are on plan.
The majority of the $1.5 billion, as George said, comes from the USA Pharmacy business. We have a comprehensive
program, and our program's on track and is delivering to plan.
We see more opportunities going forward, and the team here in the USA and also across the rest of the group will
continue to drive the most efficient business we can and build more cost plans. And we'll give an update at the end of
the year in terms of how that plan is going. And it's a major part of our strategy to use our scale, use our efficiency both
in the U.S. and globally to make sure that we are the most cost effective pharmacy retailer, particularly here in the
USA.
<Q - Robert Patrick Jones>: Okay. Got it. Then I guess just one question on Part D. You mentioned prescriptions on
a same-store basis seeing strength from Part D in particular. I know getting bigger in Part D has been a specific goal of
the company. Can you maybe share a little bit more of how you've progressed in winning Part D and maybe where you
think you are today from a market share perspective as it relates to Part D lives?
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Again, it's Alex again. I mean I think it's about partnership philosophy, we worked
really well across all of these plans. We've always had a strong relationship with United and that continues. And as
we've continued to offer our strong 8,200-store network, the right value, the 90-day retail option in terms of Part D,
we've been able to win more contracts. And we've been able to get into some of the more narrow networks, which are
forming actually in the marketplace.

So I would put that into partnership and delivering really well in the stores. It's a very important segment for us. The
market is growing faster than the rest of the market. It will continue to grow that way because of the aging population.
And our 90-day retail is really, really popular with that population. So partnership and focus is the reasons why we're
winning, and we'll continue to do both as best we can.
<Q - Robert Patrick Jones>: Great. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Please
go ahead.
<Q - George R. Hill>: Yeah, good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the questions. George, I guess two parts.
Number one, is there any way that you can quantify for us the impact of the Med D the increasing Med D mix on U.S.
drug margins in Q4? And kind of correlated to that question is, I guess we thought that we would've seen more modest
gross margin deterioration given the deterioration in generic drug pricing against the MAC part of the book. I guess just
any quantitative or qualitative color you can put around the gross margin deterioration in the quarter would be helpful
with the big moving pieces. Thanks.
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Hi. It's Alex here. We see this on plan, so there's been constant reimbursement pressure
in the market. We've spoken about this constantly, and we see that pressure going forward. We've been very open about
this – as the market consolidates, and the mix moves.
Remember, we focus on operating margin. And that really is the number we pay attention to here. So using our very
large fixed assets, going to more 90-day, where we're dispensing once rather than three times, is a very important part
of that. And also the growth of specialty, which is lower margin in terms of percent but higher dollars is another feature
of the marketplace. So overall, we're comfortable with where we are, and we're comfortable with the strategy we're
driving to focus on operating profit rather than just gross margin.
<Q - George R. Hill>: Okay. Then maybe a quick follow-up, maybe, Alex, if you just want to rank them and
separating pressure and mix, is the change in mix kind of leading to more downdraft followed by pressure followed by
90-day followed by specialty, is that the right way to think about the order of the moving pieces as it relates to the
margin profile?
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: No, I just think that the market is growing through the aging population, so that's why
Med D is the fastest-growing channel. As a result of that, people are putting together more competitive offers both in
terms of price but also in terms of care and performance and that comes as well. So I think that what's driving it is
really the market has been driven as always by the customer, and it's a growth market. So therefore, if you're able to
provide the right value through a good cost structure, which I think we have through the scale we have here in the USA
and the buying power we have globally, and then you're able to have the right relationships and partnerships, you can
take advantage of the fastest-growing channel which is Med D in a net profitable way, and that's what we're doing.
So I don't think one outdoes the other, to be honest, George. I think it's about market change and we are just positioning
ourselves in what's a very important market segment for our model, and one where we're very well positioned to
continue to win.
<Q - George R. Hill>: Okay. I appreciate the color. Thank you.

Valeant and now that you guys are about six months in, kind of takeaways and lessons you've learned and just
commentary on how you think the relationship is going to-date?

past from Perrigo where the group had a very good relationship with Joe and Perrigo, and we're in constant dialog with
Joe and the management team. We do see their situation, and we're very willing to help them in a positive way. So it's
early days, a 20-year contract, and from our point of view, we are pleased and we want to help our partner to be more
successful in the market.
<Q - Mark Rosenblum>: Got you. And then just following up on the RAD acquisition, I know you guys are still
expecting a second half close, but if the deal were not to get done, how would you rank your capital deployment
priorities now that you have the additional cash on the balance sheet?
<A - Stefano Pessina>: Oh, we would have a lot of ideas, but I can assure you that we are, for the time being, we are
not taking it into consideration because we are very confident that at the end this deal will go through. It takes some
time, but we knew. We knew it is normal for these kind of deals, which is a complex deal at the end of the day, it is
normal for these kinds of deals to take months and months.
So I would say that we are on track. We don't – our lawyers are telling us that we don't have any negative signal, and so
we are operating on the hypothesis that we will do the deal. You see that we have raised the capital, you see that we
have a big team in place starting the integration, and they are working hard to prepare the integration. We are trying to
find the right buyers for the pharmacies that for sure we will have to divest, and that's it.
<Q - Mark Rosenblum>: Okay. Thank you. That's very helpful.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Percher with Barclays. Your line is now open. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Eric Percher>: Thank you. Maybe focusing on International, going back to your comment about discussions with
the UK authority, is there a focus on recent cost reduction on any changes that might reduce that? Is it more of a service
focus? Could you detail that?
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Hi, Eric. It's Alex here. And obviously, from the past I know the UK pretty well and
I've caught up with the team in the last period. So this is a deeper conversation about what they call a global sum in the
UK which is the amount of money they pay our pharmacy, a combination of drug costs and services, and the
government are keen to get more value from pharmacy, and that's a negotiation that's currently being carried out. And
it's not just for Boots, but it's for the whole market. Boots has around about one-fifth of the market in the UK pharmacy.
It's not untypical. We've lived with this sort of pressure and these requests for very many, many years, both in the UK
and Europe, and we're used to dealing with it. There's a particular phase we're going through with that request that is
slightly deeper than the norm, and obviously, the industry's working together to try and give the government the best
answer we can.
<Q - Eric Percher>: Thanks for that detail. And then maybe also on International, the piece in Russia, was that
previously consolidated and now has been moved to discontinued? Would we see that in the year-ago results?
<A - Stefano Pessina>: It's correct. It was consolidated, and now it is not consolidated anymore because we have 15%
of the new company. To be honest, Russia was a quite volatile country where the results were depending very much on
the weather. And also, over time they were selling business which was really the best part of the supply chain of the
chain in Russia, earnings-wise. It has deteriorated because the pharmacies have become more important. In the past, the

pharmacies were not particularly profitable because the cost of the rents was really very, very high. Now the situation is
normalized. You can have long-term or medium-term rents with a way of extending the rents.
And so the pharmacies are becoming the most important and the most profitable part of the chain, and so we had the
opportunity to contribute our sale to the largest pharmacy chain because we have 1,000 pharmacies in 36.6 but the
1,000 pharmacies also in another chain A5, and the two chains have merged. And so we have 15% in a company where
we had, in reality, 2,000 pharmacies, and the opportunity to buy out the company in five years. So we will see what
happens in five years and we will take the decision. It's a big opportunity for us because this is the best segment of the
distribution in Russia today.
<Q - Eric Percher>: Thank you for that. And maybe just the financial impact from that, George? So that sounds a little
larger than I was thinking. But is there much of a profit impact from that given your ownership stake?
<A - George Rollo Fairweather>: I mean, the financial impact, looking at income, is it's very, very small in relation to
the size of WBA. Where we will see an impact is, obviously, in the sales. Being a low-margin wholesale business, the
sales were just under $700 million historically, just to give you a size. But that's why we're showing comparable sales
on a constant currency basis excluding M&A, so that you can really understand the clear performance of wholesale.
But really in actual profit contribution terms, this is pretty immaterial.
<Q - Eric Percher>: Thank you.
<A - Stefano Pessina>: [ph] Especially (39:51) after the devaluation of the ruble. You will remember that the ruble has
lost quite a lot versus the dollar, and so the impact has been really low.
<Q - Eric Percher>: Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim. Your line is now open.
Please go ahead.
<Q - John Heinbockel>: So two things for Alex. Let me start with the store level labor. If you can sort of touch on
crosscurrents, the impact of minimum wage going up and then change in overtime rules, and then the flip-side,
offsetting that, where do you think there's still opportunity to trim labor hours or get more efficient? Is it a back room
issue, how you use the pharmacy techs? Thoughts on those would be helpful.
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Yeah, John. I think there's always more opportunity, and if you remember, we're
investing quite a lot in our core IT systems right now, both in retail, and that program is about six months in. And also,
in pharmacy, we're redoing our pharmacy system over the next five years. These two, although not part from working
capital benefits, will clearly make the whole supply chain more efficient and allow us to remove a lot of non-customer
facing activity out of the drugstores and save money, and also put more hours into customer care, which is part of our
strategy to become more differentiated in health, wellness, beauty care and pharmacy. So I think there is a significant
investment going in.
The Board signed this off only a couple of months [ph] clearly. (41:35) And we're very confident the programs are well
set up, and we've got the global expertise, both here in America and Europe, apply to these two very important
programs here in the U.S. And we'll update you on what that means in the future as it becomes clear about the benefits
that we see coming through.
We've already, going back to the first question, starting with minimum-wage, we've already in the background we've
already for our most lower paid people in stores improved the base salary. We've done that already. That's already in
the cost you see, and we'll continue to improve our minimum wage against the market, paying very close attention to
the market.

Second to that we're also upskilling our people, for example, with the rollout of beauty differentiation, we're putting in
place a number of beauty consultants in our top 2,000 stores who have got deeper expertise and more knowledge and
more ability to take care and drive up sales appropriately with customers. That's another investment we're making in
labor costs in our stores, but with a very clear return on our investment. So we're feeling good about where we are on
these two investments. With the overtime, we studied this very carefully. We have a solution very clearly marked out
and will announce that solution at the appropriate time. And it's the one that will be both fair to people and cost
effective to our shareholders.
<Q - John Heinbockel>: And then secondly, so you talked about within the guys at the front end, the convenience
categories, so maybe talk a little bit how you're rethinking that whole part of the business. And when you broaden it out
to consumables, can that business effectively drive traffic? You think about, I'm not sure how productive some of those
soft drink promotions were, but can that drive traffic? Or do you want to go back and drive traffic on beauty, the
experience, and really not use consumables to do that?
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: No, consumables is really important to driving traffic, particularly the fill-in shop,
effectively, which is becoming really important to customers across America. And we believe that Walgreens, in
particular, can play a much broader role in that work. We've only really had the data with the cards, Advantage loyalty
card, for just about three years. I've seen very clearly the opportunities for the fill-in mission, and with no constructing
our offer across convenience categories, including toiletries, that we believe will offer the right brands at the right
price. Not the lowest price, but the right price. And we're on with that walk. It will be different by types of stores for
sure, and that's quite a complicated piece to get done. But we are well on the journey, and you'll see that coming
through in the months and years ahead. It's very important to our plan.
Obviously we're trying to create more destination beauty. That plan has already been executed in 1,800 stores as we
speak, and there will be more to come once we get these stores complete. And healthcare has always been a very
important category to us. And we continue to drive that category pretty well. So that's how we see driving footfall back
into our drugstores.
The final thing I'd say [indiscernible] (44:51) is omni channel, it's really important. You see that in the UK, the UK
team has done a really nice job in the UK market here to join up the supply chain and to make our effective customers.
Clearly we can share and borrow some of that best practice from Europe, and we intend to do that.
<Q - John Heinbockel>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.
Please go ahead.
<Q - Mike D. Otway>: Hey. Good morning, everyone. This is Mike Otway in for Scott. Thanks for taking the
questions. First question. The $0.10 raise in the low end in the guidance, could you parse that out into tax rate versus
stronger profitability? How much is due to both?
<A - George Rollo Fairweather>: I think there's a bunch of factors coming into this. Obviously, the tax rate has come
in a little bit lower, as I talked about in my presentation. I think the most important point I would make is, obviously,
we're continuing as we've, if you look at the guidance we set out at the beginning of the year, our ability to continue to
raise the lower end really at a time when we've been able to cope with currency moving in the wrong direction for us in
translation really, I think, illustrates the strength of the – the overall strength of the business. Really not a huge amount
more I can add to that at this stage.
<Q - Mike D. Otway>: Okay. Thanks, George. And then I guess following on John's question earlier. Given the focus
is on expanding gross margin in the U.S., how should we think about the front-end comp trajectory over the next
couple of quarters? Should we expect more of the same until – is there an expectation that the beauty rollout is going to
change the trajectory of comps? Just any thoughts there?

<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Michael, yeah, I mean, I think obviously, we're in this transition period for sure, as
we've spoken about before, where we're seeing nice improvements in the operating margin and in the gross margin
within that. And with the expense of some sales loss in some convenience categories and some seasonal categories
where we fundamentally over bought. The next phase is to really start to drive sales, particularly in beauty. That will be
progressive over a period of time, and it starts really the summer into the autumn. So you should start to see the comps
gradually improve quarter by quarter. But the key thing really that we keep on repeating is the comps are important but
always going to be relatively low in reality in a mature market, we were really shifting the mix. The important thing is
the operating margin, and that's the thing that we've been consistently focused on now for the past couple of years. And
we're pleased with the progress we're making there, and we see more progress in the future.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alvin Concepcion with Citi. Your line is now open. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Alvin Caezar Concepcion>: Great. Thank you. I just wanted to follow up on Rite Aid. Sounds like it's still on
track. Just wondering when you expect to hear more color from the FTC, if you could give us any more color on your
discussions, and related, are there changes in the number of store divestitures you expect?
<A - Stefano Pessina>: We still believe that our initial estimate is correct. We still believe that at the end, we will stay
in the range of the stores that we initially indicated, around 500 stores. And time wise, we still believe that we will be
able to really do the deal, finish the deal by the end of this financial – calendar year, as we said. So by December, we
believe that everything will be done. But of course, it doesn't depend on us. The FTC will let us know when they are
ready.
<Q - Alvin Caezar Concepcion>: Got it. Thank you. And kind of a tough question. I realize it's very early. But as it
relates to Brexit, have you seen or would you expect to see an impact in underlying demand or margins in the UK
business since the announcement, excluding currency impacts, of course?
<A - Stefano Pessina>: Very, very difficult to say. The situation, it's very volatile at this time. For sure, the period of
uncertainty will be quite long, whatever happens, because even if the UK will leave the Europe it cannot happen
overnight, it will take at least two years. And the consequence of it will be much longer than two years.
So I believe that once the emotional impact is gone, things will settle down and we will have an idea of what is
happening. But for now it's really too soon. We have seen in the stores days, very good days, very bad. So in a few
months, probably, we will be able to say something.
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Hi, Alvin. It's Alex here. Again, just couple of things tied to what Stefano said. I think
that historically, Boots has been very solid through difficult times that it tends to over-perform the market during
recessions or slowdowns because it's got a very strong beauty business and people still buy into beauty even in tough
times, and that's been historically the case.
So we feel that that's important, and you know, Boots is still growing its position both in beauty and in healthcare in the
UK. The team have done a nice job there to keep it strong and the model is still very strong. So I think if any retail
business is positioned to do okay during these uncertain times, as Stefano talks about, I think it is the Boots brand in the
UK.
<Q - Alvin Caezar Concepcion>: Got it. Thank you for that color. I appreciate it.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Larsen with Leerink. Your line is now open. Please go
ahead.
<Q - David M. Larsen>: Hi. Congratulations on a good quarter. Can you talk about at a high level who buyers of these
RAD stores could potentially be, especially for stores that are in rural markets? Thanks.
<A - Stefano Pessina>: We cannot give indication on that. We cannot go – even because at the end of the day, we
don't know exactly how many stores and where. We have an idea, but we don't know exactly. So for the time being, it's
really too early.
<Q - David M. Larsen>: Okay. And then let's say the FTC wanted to continue to review the transaction until, let's say,
March of 2017. I mean, are you willing to allow the process to continue into 2017?
<A - Stefano Pessina>: For the time being, we don't have this feeling. Our lawyers don't have this feeling. If this will
happen, we will see and we will try to understand why the process becomes so long, because if there are just a technical
reason, of course we will wait. If this is a symptom of something which is going not in the right decision, we will take a
decision at that time. But I repeat, for the time being, we are – our lawyers are very quite optimistic. I would say
optimistic.
<Q - David M. Larsen>: Okay. And then my last question is do you have any thoughts on would you keep the
volumes with McKesson or switch them over to AmerisourceBergen? Any high-level thoughts on that? Thanks.
<A - Stefano Pessina>: When we will conclude the deal with Rite Aid, we will see what to do. Of course, we have to
take into consideration that we have a good contract and a fantastic relationship with Rite Aid, so we will analyze what
to do at the right time.
<Q - David M. Larsen>: Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Coldwell with Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.
Please go ahead.
<Q - Eric W. Coldwell>: Thanks very much. First, I just have a, hopefully an objective and friendly comment here to
help. Walgreens, both prior to and after this current team's leadership, has only beaten revenue three times in the last
five years. Even with the Street lowering forward targets after each quarter, I guess what I'm saying is I just really think
you need to maybe circle the wagons and provide better insights into things such as pricing, generic launches,
conversion rates, mix, anything that could help folks get to a better method on the top line I think would be a huge help.
So that's my comment. I'd love you to take it under consideration.
The question is around tax items. I'm curious I did not see this. What were the discrete items in the quarter? How much
did they impact the third quarter? And did any of the lower expected tax rate for the year, did any of that come from
items that might be deemed as more sustainable as opposed to discrete? Thanks very much.
<A - George Rollo Fairweather>: Fundamentally, there was a small amount of discrete items. Typically, obviously
one is prudent in doing provisioning and then when one is able to agree numbers with the tax authorities, then one has
the discrete items. But fundamentally, we've been doing a lot of work looking at our underlying tax rate, and exactly
with the quite complex structure that we've got in place, what is the real underlying rate. We've been quite conservative
in the first sort of part of the year on this while we're doing this work. And really, the numbers that you've seen in the
quarter, if you look at the year-to-date, as we said in my presentation, that really gives us a true reflection of what the
rate would be with this mix of profits at the currency rates that we've seen in this year-to-date.
So I think you should really look at it as the clear rate. Clearly, if we then – going forward, the mix changes, and
clearly, it will change with Rite Aid coming in, being U.S. based and the U.S. being obviously one of the highest taxed
countries in the mix of where we trade, then you will see the tax rate going up, reflecting mix, but only mix.

<A - Stefano Pessina>: Substantially. Substantially, this quarter we have taken back some provisions that we had made
before in the previous quarter for the bulk of it being prudent and then now we have released it and that's it. So overall
for the year, this is the real, substantially, the real tax rate and the real dollars that we have paid in tax, or we will pay in
tax.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.
Please go ahead.
<Q - Charles Rhyee>: Yeah, thanks. Maybe going back to the roll-out of the Boots products in the U.S. I know you're
expanding it now into more stores. Can you talk about sort of what the uptake has been in the existing stores as a
percent of sort of the front-end sales? I know you're sort of calling your target sort of a 5% mix shift over time, but just
curious where we are at this point?
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Hi, Charles. It's Alex here. We've had these products in different tests and trials in New
York and more importantly, in Phoenix, which is a more normal market for us in terms of our stores, really for 18
months. And we've really seen two effects. We've seen bigger baskets across the beauty spend from customers and
we've seen more repeat customers coming back with particularly No7 skin care in the basket. And these numbers, we
extrapolated with costs. We also looked at different models of investment from a people point of view and investment
in fixturing, and we created what we thought was the most customer effective and importantly, the best model for
return to our shareholders.
And that's what we're implementing right now, this summer, in around about 1,600 more stores. And we're very
confident because we've seen these customer behaviors of more in the basket and coming back more often, specifically
for No7 skin care, consistently for 18 months. So that's what we've seen and that's how we've measured it. And clearly,
we have long-term goals to shift the mix to more owned brands and owned brands in the U.S. business, and this is the
start of that journey, particularly in important beauty categories.
<Q - Charles Rhyee>: Can you talk about – if I recall correctly, No7 and some of the other Boots products are sold in
other chains today. Can you talk about how, what that mix looks like in those stores in those other chains and how
relevant they are to what you expect for Walgreens over time? And are there ways to also leverage that brand
recognition that you already have and maybe shift those buyers back to the Walgreens stores? Thanks.
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Well, the intention is to grow the brand, and so we have good distribution in Target
and have had for many years and a good relationship, and we have distribution growing in ULTA who are doing a nice
job with their brands and many other people's brands to be fair to them. They're doing a good job. So from our point of
view, they are different channels to Walgreens. Walgreens is a drug store channel and the customers, some customers
do swap across both. Of course, they do. But we have so much opportunity with Walgreens, with 6 million customers.
About 20% of them are what we call look good, feel good customers who are prepared to buy more beauty products
from Walgreens, and that's what we're focused on in the Walgreens channel. The rest of the team, led by Ken, who
heads up our Brands division for WBA, are focused on building the brands in across America and building good
relationships with the partners outside of Walgreens. It's a very clear strategy and one where we want to be successful
in both, and that's what we intend to do.
