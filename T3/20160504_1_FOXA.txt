Lachlan Keith Murdoch
Thanks, Reed, and good afternoon, everyone. Over the past few quarters on these calls, we've talked about the strength
of our core brands and their value to both existing and emerging distribution platforms. In this quarter, we've seen some
positive tangible results of the work we've been doing in this area, which all of us here are pretty excited about. In a
few minutes, James will take you through our thinking and the early milestones we've achieved, but first, I'll briefly
address the highlights of a good quarter for us.
We continue to be focused on building powerful brands, making compelling content and driving advertising
innovation, all of which create meaningful long-term value for stockholders. This past quarter's results, financial and
operational, demonstrates good progress against these objectives.
The quarter itself reflected underlying strength led by double-digit EBITDA growth at the cable businesses, the
second-highest quarterly EBITDA ever at the film studio, and further programming momentum at the network and at
our international cable channels.
Affiliate revenues grew by 7% in the quarter across our global television business and by 10%, excluding currency
impacts. This growth is supported by our investment across our entertainment, news and sports brands.
Fox broadcast network has the number-one broadcast series with Empire, the number-one new series with X-Files, and
the number-one scripted special with Grease Live!. Fox News network outranked all of basic cable for the first time on
the strength of primetime ratings that were up 35% in the quarter.
FX continued to define high-quality, culture-defining storytelling. The People vs. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story
is cable's most-watched new primetime series, and Baskets is cable's most-watched new primetime scripted comedy.
And NatGeo earned its highest rating ever with its recent docu-series, Story of God with Morgan Freeman.
Ad revenues grew by 4% in the quarter. This strength was fueled in part by 20%-plus increase in domestic scatter
pricing and also reflects the particularly strong Fox News viewership and STAR's continued solid gains.
The market has recognized the power of premium programming to win the attention of consumers. While the value of
our broad reach for brand marketers is clear, we continue to move toward a more efficient and effective targeted model
that is enabled by streaming distribution.
At Filmed Entertainment, the company delivered the highest grossing R-rated film of all time with Deadpool, which
has earned more than $760 million in global box office receipts against a modest production budget. It is also the
highest-grossing film ever for a first-time director, Tim Miller, a distinction we're equally proud of.
Looking ahead, we have the highly anticipated theatrical release of X-Men Apocalypse and of Independence Day:
Resurgence in our fourth quarter and Ice Age 5 in July. And although it's a ways off, we have also announced that
James Cameron is well underway developing four Avatar sequels.
At our television production business, we produced three of the top four broadcast series of the current season, Empire,
X-Files and Modern Family, and a number one new comedy, Life in Pieces. Sorry, the number one new comedy, Life
in Pieces. In addition, we produced the absolutely fantastic The People vs. O.J. Simpson: An American Crime Story.
Looking forward, the studio has three new Fox series in development as well as 15 broadcast pilots, 12 of them for Fox.
And it is clear that in a world where more people are accessing more screens across multiple technologies and
platforms, the demand for such premium content will continue to grow. It's why we are excited to be offering our

portfolio of brands to new consumer-driven platforms like Hulu and Sling and it's why we believe we are well
positioned at this dynamic time in our industry.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to John.
John P. Nallen
Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon, everyone. You'll have seen in today's earnings release that we reported very
strong financial results in the quarter, underpinned by a 12% increase in both EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share.
Third quarter revenues increased 6% over the prior year as growth at both our Cable Network and Television segments
was partially offset by a slight decline at our Film segment. Absent the negative impact of foreign exchange, third
quarter revenues increased 9% over last year.
Total segment EBITDA for the third quarter was $1.88 billion, a 12% increase over a year ago, reflecting double-digit
growth at our Film and Cable Network segments, and slightly lower results at the Television segment. Overall,
unfavorable foreign exchange movements reduced the quarter's EBITDA growth rate by 7 percentage points.
From a bottom line perspective, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $844
million or $0.44 per share, while adjusted EPS was $0.47 this year, up 12%, versus a comparable $0.42 a year ago.
Looking forward with the first three quarters of the fiscal year now behind us and based on all the assumptions inherent
in our current outlook, we're comfortable with the fiscal 2016 EBITDA growth guidance that we provided to you on
our last earnings call, specifically flat to low single digit percentage growth above the $6.49 billion we reported for
fiscal 2015, excluding the DBS businesses.
Now, let me provide some additional context on the performance at our operating segments in the third quarter starting
with the Cable Network segment. Overall, total Cable segment revenues increased 10%, and EBITDA grew 12%.
Excluding an approximate $60 million negative impact from currency rates, EBITDA grew 16% in the quarter.
Note that this year's results included the consolidation of the National Geographic non-channels businesses that were
acquired in our second quarter, which increased both revenues and expenses in the segment by approximately $90
million.
Domestic cable revenues increased 11% in total, with affiliate fees up 7% and advertising up 17%. As expected, our
domestic affiliate revenue growth decelerated slightly in the quarter, primarily reflecting the timing of affiliate contract
renewals. Our expectation is that affiliate fee growth will step up as we begin the next calendar year consistent with the
timetable for upcoming contract renewals.
Domestic advertising growth was led by higher ratings at Fox News, the continued strength of local sports at the RSNs,
as well as the consolidation of the acquired National Geographic businesses.
EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 7% over the prior year, reflecting the strong revenue growth, partially
offset by higher political coverage costs at Fox News, and increased content and marketing spend at FX driven by two
new original series, led by The People vs. O.J. Simpson.
At our international cable channels, reported affiliate and advertising revenues both grew 6% versus last year, but on a
local currency like-to-like basis, affiliate revenues increased 20%, and advertising revenues were up around 9%, driven
by strong growth at STAR's entertainment channels and at the Fox Networks international channels.
Reported international channel EBITDA increased 67% over the prior year even after reflecting the $60 million
negative foreign currency effect. This EBITDA growth reflects the higher revenues as well as lower sports rights costs
at STAR due to the absence of last year's broadcast of the ICC Cricket World Cup.
Turning to our Television segment, third quarter EBITDA was $125 million, $16 million lower than a year ago. Total
revenues increased 5%, led by higher retransmission consent revenues and higher political advertising revenues at the

stations. This revenue gain was absorbed by increased sports programming costs, principally for NASCAR and NFL in
the quarter.
At the Film segment, third quarter EBITDA increased $88 million versus last year. Higher contributions from the film
studio, reflecting the successful theatrical release of Deadpool, were partially offset by reduced TV production
earnings, primarily from lower contributions from Glee, which had its final network season last year. Foreign exchange
movements negatively impacted the segment's EBITDA this quarter by approximately $50 million.
And finally, regarding capital allocation, from July 1 through today, we've repurchased approximately $4.2 billion
worth of Fox A shares, of which approximately $3.7 billion has been against our $5 billion buyback authorization.
With that, I'll turn it over to James.
James Rupert Murdoch
Thanks very much, John and Lachlan. Welcome, everyone. So, as you have seen, it was a solid quarter. Now, there's a
lot we'll talk about, and hopefully we can cover a lot of ground in Q&A, but I wanted to first highlight some of the
objectives of the business more broadly and the progress we're making towards them. And in particular talk a little bit
about our digital business and plans.
Over the long term, but approaching quickly, all video entertainment will be consumed over IP streaming networks.
That means that what we create and produce is released into an incredibly competitive environment in which the
customer can choose at any minute, and on any device, any entertainment that has ever been made.
So, first and foremost, we need to be making better things all the time. We're immensely proud of the creative
achievements of the business recently, and of the momentum that we have at each of our brands. We're in a better place
in almost all of our businesses creatively.
This is driven by the investments we've made in our brands over the last number of years. We're positioning for success
in this environment, where it's not worth making the distinction between linear and digital anymore, just as the walls
between cable and broadcast melted away years ago.
We're building a business that has real scale in streaming distribution and monetization capability. And here, too, we've
made a lot of progress. We're very focused on the velocity we need to be at, and even with some progress depending
heavily on counter-parties, these last three quarters have seen a marked step-up in pace.
Last month, we announced our participation in Sling's new multi-stream digital video service with all of our
entertainment and sports brands forming a core part of a new all-digital product priced well below the fully bundled
MVPD offering that some customers find hard to digest.
And this week, we can confirm as well that we're working with Hulu to participate in a reimagined digital video service
later this year that combines a current and live affiliate distribution model with an expansive and attractive SVOD
window. We think this breaking down of licensing windows into a simpler and more straightforward set of rules is
going to be very attractive for customers, and therefore for downstream video retailers as well.
We want to make our programming more available, not less, and we want to be able to innovate in the way we can
monetize that programming on digital platforms. This precedential move with Hulu means we can now license similar
consumer services and products to new entrants or established MVPDs, encouraging and enabling innovation
downstream, creating a distribution infrastructure that allows us to monetize more effectively, and all the while grow
our direct to consumer capability.
Our work on this front has not been limited to the U.S. In India, STAR's ground breaking Hotstar mobile video product
recently crossed 60 million downloads and just launched a premium subscription tier, leveraging our exclusive rights
for HBO Original's films and the Fox library. And over the next few months the service will also include a premium
sports offering.

In Europe, Sky Go and Now TV at our 47% owned affiliate Sky continue to grow strongly and the launch of Sky Q is
off to a strong start. And in Latin America, FOX+, our premium digital on-demand service is growing well and is now
available to over four million subscribers.
This progress we're making puts us on strong footing. And as we look across our global portfolio, we feel good about
where we are and that we have the right strategies, assets and brands to see significant opportunities, both in mature and
developing markets. The next decade is one of really immense opportunity for all of us at 21 CF, and we're very
focused on seizing it.
So with that, we're happy to take your questions. Bryan, can we go to the Q&A, please?
Q&A
Operator
Okay. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Richard Greenfield with BTIG. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Rich Greenfield>: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. During O.J. and the Americans, I noticed – I think
everyone's probably noticed a real increase in the push that you're driving of FXNOW. And I'm curious, are you seeing
a real tick-up in users? Any way you can qualify or quantify actually how many people are using FXNOW on an
authenticated basis? Have you seen a dramatic change in time spent? And then just, James, you brought up the
commentary about Hulu, which Mike Hopkins actually talked about during their up-front this morning. I'm curious,
how do you think about what's going to happen as you compete with legacy distributors? Is it simply just that the time
is right to take matters into your own hands and kind of lead a path forward, regardless of whether it ruffles feathers of
the Comcasts and the Charters of the world?
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Thanks, Rich, for your question. Look, on the first one, I don't want to get into
specific numbers on FXNOW usage. But one thing that we're very focused on is, is growing consumption on our, kind
of what we call our owned and operated apps, be it FOX NOW or FXNOW or FOX Sports GO. And we're seeing good
growth there. And you're right. We have been marketing that more on our air because we think it's a really good
consumer experience. We think it's a great way for customers to access the programming. It's available to many, many
millions of MVPD customers on an authenticated basis. And it's something that as you've seen as we've restructured
and created our digital direct-to-consumer group, it's something that we're just very focused on building. We think it's
the right thing to do to grow the audience in a streaming environment, where we can innovate and monetize better in
terms of data and analytics, in terms of how we create new ad products and monetize them, the pricing we're achieving
there.
And that's true as well with Hulu, where pricing on Hulu from an advertising perspective is very, very attractive for us.
And we think that's a mix between Hulu, our owned and operated apps as well as VOD platforms belonging to the
existing MVPDs, where we're seeing really marked growth. And I would say that what we're seeing decline in terms of
multi-platform usage is really in DVRs. And as streaming availability comes forward and is much, much better and
creates a better customer experience, DVR usage seems to be declining or is declining on a percentage basis pretty
dramatically. And that's something that is: a, good; and b, something that we want to encourage. But we need to make
great products available for customers and make sure that we're putting together good products and working closely
with our MVPD partners in terms of making sure the authentication pathways are as smooth and easy as possible,
which as we all know, there's a lot of work to be done to improve that and improve that part of the user experience.
On your second question with respect to Hulu and the competitive response, look, I think our view is that we'd like to
make our programming more available, not less. We'd like to take our brands and the customer experience around our
brands to new entrants in the downstream distribution market, be they over the top or new products and services
developed by the MVPDs. And that's just as we – as I mentioned in the remarks earlier and Lachlan did, we're licensing

to Sling for example, is a core part of their new multi-stream digital video service, or licensing to Hulu as it develops its
plans for this next generation video service for customers across the country.
And I think really, the strategy for us is to create these products with simpler windows, things like better in series
stacks, better customer experience and make that available to MVPDs generally. So, it's not really a question of some
heightened competitive dynamic. It's always been a competitive environment downstream. And just as licensing to
satellite and telcos was seen as controversial at the time, within these new entrants, paying a fair price, putting together
a great product for customers is one that's actually going to spur growth in the overall universe of video customers, but
also is one that's going to make a better user experience, driven by those competitive dynamics. And we're very keen to
play a part in that and be a catalyst for making that happen.
<A - Lachlan Keith Murdoch>: And we'll sell the same rights and the same terms to the existing MVPDs as well.
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Yeah. Exactly.
<Q - Rich Greenfield>: Sorry. Just to follow up on that, Lachlan, so you'll be able to – the same distributors will be
able to create the same types of skinny bundles that you're going to create with Hulu?
<A - Lachlan Keith Murdoch>: We prefer to call them a core bundle as opposed to a skinny bundle because it's really
the core brands that will be represented in the bundle. But, yes, Rich, you will.
<Q - Rich Greenfield>: Thank you very much. That was great color.
<A - H. Reed Nolte>: Ryan, can we have the next question, please?
Operator
The next question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael B. Nathanson>: Thanks. Let me keep on the Hulu questions. Can we talk a bit about rights and
in-season stacking? One of the challenges in the past couple years is that as a network, you have not bought all the
rights and then as a studio you may not have sold those rights. So can you give us a sense of how you're thinking that
evolving on in-season stacking? Is that something you expect for Fox and FX to control, to own? And would you sell in
season stacking rights to other networks like Modern Family and ABC? So talk about rights for a second.
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Thanks, Michael. Look, I think there's, our preference would be to – if you want to
think about establishing sort of standards or at least for us anyways that we would have, full in-season stacks available
to customers. We think that's the best customer experience. We think it's sensible. And I think, there's been a little bit of
– it's taken a little while for the industry, if you will, to settle on how to price that and how do you think about those
things. I think that's getting more established now.
So, yes, we're very focused on having full season stacks for current seasons and then having a more seamless handoff
between that and the later SVOD window. So, simplifying those rights and those windows is something we're focused
on, really in an effort to eliminate what can appear to customers as really arbitrary holdbacks driven by business rules
that they don't care about. And our focus is on how do you make a better customer experience. We think the in-season
stack is a key part of that.
<Q - Michael B. Nathanson>: Okay. James, the last one would be on broadcast affiliates. One of the frustrations also
is some of these packages can't roll nationally because you don't have all the affiliates on board. So talk about the
process of being able to offer all your affiliates maybe Hulu or Sling, how is that going to evolve?
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Those things – the affiliate carriage agreements on a national basis, something that
Hulu and the affiliates are involved in, we would anticipate that we will be able to achieve substantially national
coverage pretty soon for all these things. That's something that's necessary. But each affiliate group and each agreement
is different and that's something that in Hulu's case, they have to have with those affiliates in Sling's case the same.

It comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Alexia S. Quadrani>: Hi. Thank you. Sorry to stay on the same topic here, but James, just to clarify from your
earlier comments, in this evolving anywhere any time model that you talked about, more demand, potentially better
pricing, but potentially risk to linear model in terms of that revenue stream, is this a net positive for Fox? Or is it to be
determined depending on how successful you are? I'd love your thoughts on that. And should we assume that when you
are doing these deals with the RSNs and Sling you are getting a premium pricing to what you would get more the
traditional model?
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: I think we've talked about it before, Alexia. Thanks for your question. We talked
about it a little bit before. I think if we can establish the right sort of licensing arrangements, the streaming distribution
model is actually a much better model. You have to take into account as well our ability to monetize advertising in a
different way. We believe that the pricing in a streaming advertising basis can be much, much better than network
pricing given our ability to target, our ability to have lower ad loads, our ability to put new kinds of ad products like
engagement units and so forth, into the marketplace. So, we think from an advertising perspective, it can be a superior
business.
And from an affiliate income perspective, we're obviously very focused on getting a fair price for each of our brands
and all of our brands in aggregate, so that the streaming distribution business is a net positive, as you put it, for our
overall set of brands. Thank you, Alexia.
<Q - Alexia S. Quadrani>: And then just in terms of the pricing, is it a given that you get better pricing on these new
entrants on these over the top products or is it sort of every contract is different?
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: I think we take all of our distribution agreements – if you look at them in the round
that over time we can achieve, pricing increases, et cetera. But certainly these agreements are in line with what the
current market is for these brands to be distributed in the current season to customers.
<Q - Alexia S. Quadrani>: Thank you.
<A - John P. Nallen>: Net-net economically to us, from an affiliation point of view, we'll be agnostic in terms of
whether our customer is an MVPD customer or DMVPD customer.
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Yeah.
<Q - Alexia S. Quadrani>: Thank you.
<A - H. Reed Nolte>: Thank you, Alexia. Ryan, next question, please?
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jessica Jean Reif Cohen>: I have two questions. One is just a wrap-up of what everybody has been asking. So
just to go through the skinny bundle components, pricing on affiliate fees it sounds like will be at least the same, so no
loss there. Advertising monetization should be better. Is there any other revenue driver that we should be thinking
about? And I think, James, you said that all the brands will – like on Sling and Hulu, I just want to clarify when you say
all the brands, you mean including the RSNs, all of the Fox Channels?

<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: I think the Sling package is outlined and out there, and it's all of our brands, but Fox
News had an earlier deal with DISH and Sling. So that's not included at this point. The Hulu agreement or the Hulu
arrangement is for all of the brands including the RSNs. And the Sling includes the RSNs as well. We think the RSNs
are a huge driver here. I think sports in the streaming environment can be enormously attractive and priced attractively
to customers. I think it obviously drives a big audience in the linear and live viewing. But we look around the world,
not just here, and see sports really driving over the top consumption as well. So I think that the sports piece here is
really attractive, and it's something that's really fresh and new in the over-the-top environment with these new products.
<Q - Jessica Jean Reif Cohen>: Okay. And then just to maybe slightly change the questioning. So as we're
approaching the up-front market I'd love to get your thoughts, but also how different will this be in terms of
components? I mean you're clearly going down this path of more targeting, more platform selling, cross platform
selling, more holistically. Can you just give us your thoughts on what's ahead in the next few months?
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Well, first of all, on the up-fronts generally, we're really excited about the up-fronts.
We think that all of the networks are in really good shape creatively. And as Lachlan mentioned in his comments,
scatter pricing has been really strong. It's been a strong market. So, it's really great moment to go right into up-fronts,
and we're very excited about that.
I think also your point about the changing components and how we sell advertising. We're really focused here on how
do we sell a total audience, how do we sell a total audience and how do we really market to our advertising partners, to
other brands to the attention of that audience. I think we're driving incredible engagements in our audience both in
linear as well as in digital platforms, and we want to add that up and really create something that is very valuable for
those advertisers.
It is a more complicated process right now just because we have varying measurement techniques, and we have to
really add all of that up and have a more broad conversation with advertisers. But it's one that they've been extremely
focused on and excited about. So, I think the engagement with all the big brands we work with has been strong. And I
think in up-fronts you'll see a bigger component of digital obviously, and sticking together all of this multi-platform
audience to create one platform for video consumption that makes sense for people.
And I think that's going to be a trend that's going to continue. But ultimately we have to think of it less as the sort of
slice and dice different commercial windows, and more about a total audience across all of these platforms, which
sometimes is current programming, sometimes it's a month old programming, and we continue to add cumulative
audience and engagement over time in ways that is really exciting in terms of the overall audience growth and overall
inventory growth. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of John Janedis with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - John Janedis>: Hi. Thank you. Maybe a bit more of a follow up, James. Back to the ad market, you talked about
the strength, and I think it's well appreciated that the traditional TV ad market has been tight for a variety of reasons,
including ratings. So, with younger viewers watching less live TV and given your comments, I guess in response to
Alexia and Jessica, how much more receptive are advertisers to buying VOD and DAI as an alternative relative to six
to 12 months ago? Again, to your point, I'm just trying to think about alternative ways to increase inventory and
monetize shows that don't include shortening the length of the actual program.
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: I think, qualitatively, I would say, buyers are much more engaged around buying that
multi-platform audience. And it's been a progression because that's really where lot of the audience is. So when we look
at total ratings being down for any given network, x percent, actually the total multi-platform audience is holding

steady to up when we put it together. So, I think we're moving away from saying, okay, look, let's get people to go from
plus three to plus seven, and we're really talking about total audience, plus 30, plus 60, whatever.
As I said, I think on these calls before, all viewers are alive, so all of the viewing should be counted as live viewing,
and it's a question of establishing the currency that people can buy easily and get their head around, and that's a
negotiation that you have. But certainly, there's an appetite to really follow where the viewers and where the
engagement is, and that is multi-platform, and it is across a longer period of time.
<Q - John Janedis>: Is that more so you think a calendar 2017 event, or is it beyond that? Or are we much closer,
meaning later this year?
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Well, I think we're going to see continued growth through this year, and I think in
2017 as well. I think as a component part of our total viewing, the multi-platform viewing outside of the live window or
the linear window, I should say, continues to grow. We expect that to continue until it's substantially all, other than in
our sports and news business, which we're adding a streaming and ad targeting capability with, with these new
platforms. But obviously in sports and news, the vast majority of the viewing is actually live.

And that comes from the line of Vasily Karasyov with CLSA. Please go ahead.
<Q - Vasily Karasyov>: Thank you very much. I wanted to ask about STAR India. Fiscal 2016 was a year of
investment there, and I think you invested in additional sports rights and some over-the-top applications. I was
wondering if you could give us an update on how that went, and should we expect to see a benefit in fiscal 2017?
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: So, thanks, Vasily. So, first of all, yes, we have been investing, as you all know, in the
Indian business with the sports investment in particular and in the digital investment with Hotstar, and we'll continue to
do so. That said, the peak investment year is really behind us, and actually this fiscal year in 2016, you'll see it will
have been strong growth for STAR overall over the last year, and we expect that to continue.
We're extremely pleased with how the sports investment is going, particularly with kabaddi and cricket, the two kind of
biggest there. Kabaddi is a new sport that's growing very well. We will be investing and expanding that season and
growing that sport. But also, our monetization of cricket rights is actually getting much, much stronger as well for a
variety of reasons.
So I think we're happy with how that investment has gone. And in the Hotstar side in digital, with 60 million plus
downloads of the app and increasing consumption of pretty substantial length, these aren't really short form videos.
People are watching soaps, they're watching dramas; they're watching sports. We think it's a very, very exciting new
platform for us. So, we're pleased with the investment and how it's gone, and going forward, we're very confident that
the growth in terms of EBITDA from the STAR business will be in line with the target that we laid out in the past,
which is, getting towards $0.5 billion of EBITDA within a few years in 2018, and towards $1 billion around the end of
the decade.

<Q - Todd Juenger>: Terrific. Just a couple quick ones on affiliate fees, if I may. Just a very mundane question, if
somebody would be willing to just walk us through a bridge of domestic cable affiliate fees from the growth rate from
last quarter down to the growth rate this quarter. I think the two main elements we know about are the YES blackout
and whatever is going on with cord-cutting and shaving. Just wanted to confirm that.
On a related note, when we think about pricing back to these over-the-top bundles, with your traditional distributors,
we've grown accustomed to these annual rate increases per sub. So, you've been questioned already on what the starting
price is for your networks with these new services. I'd like to extend that question and see should we expect annual rate
increases with those type of distributors as well, or not? Thanks.
<A - John P. Nallen>: Todd, it's John. I'll take the first part. So, yes, you're right, there's been a deceleration from Q2
to Q3. And as I said, we expect the step-ups to occur in the beginning of calendar year because of the timing. And that's
really what happened in Q3 as against Q2. We anniversaried a number of step-ups in Q2, so we enjoyed that lift and
that benefit leading to the 10% growth, and now the pattern is more comparable year-on-year in Q3.
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: And I think what we'll see in terms of affiliate fee growth going forward is an
acceleration in 2017 and 2018, as new affiliate agreements come up and we're able to do that. And then with respect to
pricing for new entrants, I would go back to looking at whenever we've seen new entrants come into the marketplace,
we see it increase competition and we think that really increases the value of programming upstream. Not only do we
continue to invest in that programming and make it better for customers but also the value of that increases the more
competition we have at the downstream retail level. So we're very confident that we're going to continue to be able to
grow the value of our programming in these brands in a downstream retail environment that's more competitive, not
less; more innovative, not less; and that's a real shift.
So we'd really like to see, I think everyone would like to see, we think these new entrants can be a catalyst for and
hopefully there will be more of them is growth in the total video consumption universe downstream as well as into the
broadband-only households as well as replacement products for some customers, but also continued pricing strength as
that competition increases.
Ultimately, it's up to us to make products that are distinctive, that are great, that customers really care about, and that's
why we are so focused on these brands that we've been investing in and simplifying our investment around to make
things that ultimately matter for customers. That matters for our distributors and we think we can get a fair price with
that approach.
<A - H. Reed Nolte>: Thank you, Todd. Ryan, can we have next question, please?
Operator
That comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Doug Mitchelson>: Thanks so much. So, James, Lachlan, how can I not continue to ask about Hulu? One of the
great debates I think we're going to continue to have with these virtual MVPDs will be optimizing subscriptions and
customer experience versus the desire to advertising revenue, and you touched on the potential to lower ad loads. Has
your experience with Sling or any of your surveys or studies given you a sense of what the right ad load is going to be
for these virtual MVPDs? And if your ad load on VOD online for streaming ends up quite a bit lower, will we see your
live ad loads harmonize with that over time?
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: I wouldn't say today that or I wouldn't be able to predict today what the ideal ad load
is two years from now, three years from now, four years from now. I would say the experience that we have is that, A,
the advertising loads are highly relevant to the customer experience, there is no question about that. There's no question
that we invest a lot in programming and we invest a lot in achieving a suspension of disbelief amongst our customers as
we create these cinematic experiences for them, and then we jerk them out of that environment to show them
advertising.

That's obviously necessary economically in many cases. But I'd say the biggest lesson we've learned is what's
interesting is with the Hulu ad free option, where customers can opt-in to pay a premium to buy out essentially their
own time, to buy their own engagement, many have chosen to do so but certainly not all of them. So customers are
smart, and they understand the value equation here. So we think some will pay a premium in that environment to have
no ad load. Some will value the lower ad loads that exist on Hulu today, for example, than in the broadcast
environment. And I think in a streaming environment, the real opportunity here is to have better pricing and more
targeting across the piece, which allows us to continue to reduce the ad load as more video shifts and more
consumption shifts to the IP streaming platforms.
<A - Lachlan Keith Murdoch>: And increased CPMs at the same time.
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Yes, and increase pricing.
<Q - Doug Mitchelson>: And I think the debate will obviously continue, but part of the thought is if you create this
new business model, and let's call it new, and it ends up with worse economics to start because ad loads are lower and
it's going to take a while to grow the CPMs to where you want them to be, or perhaps just because you presume
younger customers would prefer lower ad loads and won't come into the product without that, but you build a
sustainable business that can grow from there. Is it worth it to take that step down in economics initially hoping that
ultimately you can either grow that business from subscriptions or targeted CPM, if that makes sense?
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Yes, look, we're doing that today with what we're doing in terms of encouraging
usage as the question earlier was around FX Now. We certainly don't fully monetize all of that streaming viewing
today, but we're totally convinced that it's a better ad experience for customers and a better ad experience for
advertisers. And that it can be a better business than the traditional broadcast ad load business. So we do that today, and
I think it's too early to call how big that investment is, but fundamentally, we do believe in the long term of this
business. We invest against the long term of this business and establishing these streaming platforms at scale is
absolutely worth it.
<A - Lachlan Keith Murdoch>: And we've been running a lower ad load in Empire, for instance, and we do that on a
show-by-show, on a series-by-series basis and make those judgments every day to say, hang on, is it worth building the
value of those series and those brands? And obviously, in many of the cases it absolutely is.
<A - H. Reed Nolte>: Thank you, Doug. Bryan, could we have the next question, please?
Operator
That comes from the line of Omar Sheikh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Omar Sheikh>: Hi, there. I've got a couple of questions, first of all on Hulu again. James, I wondered if you
could just outline what you think the market opportunity is for this new product. What does your research tell you
about what sort of customers you're going to get? Is it going to be another complementary product? And just if you add
it to the subscribers you expect on the existing Hulu subscription product, what numbers the subscribers should we be
thinking about over the next few years? First question.
And secondly, I want to ask about STAR India. There's some sports rights renewals that are coming up in a couple
years. I think the IPL rights are coming up in 2018. I wonder whether you could just give us your current thoughts on
what you think STAR might need in terms of incremental sports rights over the next couple years. Thanks.
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Thanks. Thanks, Omar. Look, it's really going to be for Hulu to comment on their
customer numbers and expectations specifically, so I won't really get into that. But I would say that when we look at
the proliferation of new MVPDs, new virtual MVPDs or the existing MVPDs, innovating, creating new over-the-top
products and improving their own product experience, I think the opportunity is very large. And one that is very much
worth pursuing and very much worth trying to be a catalyst to create. But I think the specific subscriber goals, et cetera,
better left to those distributors.

With respect to India, I don't think we're really focused at this point on incremental rights, but in all of our sports
businesses, not just India, we always seek a balance, and we have to see when new rights come available, how do they
fit, how can they be monetized, are other rights things that you would give up to pay for those, and you have to create a
balance of investment there that you think is delivering the right value for customers and the right value for the
distributors.
So I certainly don't think given the performance of the business, there's any necessity to have incremental rights on top
of where we are today. But from time to time, we may invest in new rights and let other rights go or find ways to
monetize new rights so that it's not necessarily an incremental investment. But we love the sports business. The cricket
business is strong, as I mentioned earlier. From a monetization point of view, it's very strong right now for STAR. And
it's a sport that we're obviously very committed to.
<Q - Omar Sheikh>: And, sorry, just to follow-up. Could I just ask on STAR, do you think that total sports costs for
STAR have peaked?
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: The total sports investment for us in terms of the investment losses in establishing the
sports business have peaked. Whether or not the total cost base of sports over the long-term, that's really a question of
what's the size of the revenue as well. So I think I would say the investment losses in creating the sports business have
peaked, and we're seeing the business move towards profitability.
<Q - Omar Sheikh>: Perfect. Thank you very much.
<A - H. Reed Nolte>: Thanks, Omar. Ryan, could we have the next question, please?
Operator
Comes from the line of Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Daniel Salmon>: Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. James, maybe could we return to Hotstar for a moment? For
better or for worse, you probably focus a little bit less on the OTT options overseas. And I'm just curious about where
your bigger-picture ambitions are for it, particularly with differentiation versus some of the other over-the-top products
there that seem to be a little bit more driven by TV shows and films. And you talked a little bit more about bringing
sports there, and also maybe how Netflix's entrance into the market affects the competitive dynamics for it.
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Yes, well, first of all, I think the Hotstar business – where should I start? – it's an
exciting business because it's really broad based. So we already do include sports in the Hotstar business but not live.
It's on a delayed basis. So the premium sports offering will be coming later this year, and we think it's going to be
attractive. But the peaks in usage come not just from sports but also from the availability of new scripted series as well.
So we're actually seeing pretty broad based usage across that and something that's pretty encouraging and reasonably
long session times.
The key issue in India around the over-the-top services, mobile video in particular, is really the tariff structure and
metered tariffing in terms of data from the telcos. So a lot of the consumption is bigger on Wi-Fi when people are at
home or in an Internet café, et cetera. And until you get larger data caps or flat pricing, et cetera, I think that's going to
continue to be a dynamic. And that does put a constraint on pricing. That's why the core business in Hotstar is free. It's
just something that people can download and use because it becomes quite expensive given the data tariffs.
And then with respect to the premium subscription service, which we just launched, I think is more squarely in the
competitive dynamic with the Netflix, which just launched there, et cetera. We took a view that we wanted to have an
attractive price for people, so it's priced underneath where some of the other competitors are, but with some of the best
premium international television in the world. For example, from HBO, from FX, from places like that. So it's a really
attractive service. But it's too early to comment on what scale it's going to be, what we think the growth is. We really
just launched it a few weeks ago. So it's the premium service. So that's where that is. Was there another part of your
question? I don't think so. Okay.

<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: I think we have time for one more question.
Operator
Okay. And that comes from the line of Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Bryan Kraft>: Hi. Good afternoon. I was hoping to ask two questions, if I could. First, how are you handling the
technology side of the digital streaming business, both from a platform and network aspect as well as the advertising
insertion? And then separately when you talk about a core bundle of networks for Hulu, and there are companies like
yourselves that own major broadcasting cable networks with very few of the mid-sized and smaller networks. But
you've got other companies that have similar major network assets but at the same time have more of a long tail of
mid-size and smaller networks. How do you reach agreements with those companies without having to load this basic
tier up with more channels than you want? And also how do you think about the smaller cable network groups? Thank
you.
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Thanks. Well, on that last piece, really that's a question for the distributors, right? So
it's a question for Hulu. It's a question for Sling, et cetera, and those are things that they have to deal with. It's them that
are coming to agreements with these things. Yes, we're an investor in Hulu and we're early licensee, I guess. And so we
can talk about our position around that. But as you said, we've spent a lot of time over the last couple of years
simplifying this brand portfolio, getting into places where we have five big brands that really matter for customers, and
we're going to stay focused on that. The other piece of that is really for Hulu or Sling or any of the other downstream
retailers.
And what was the first part of your question? Sorry.
<Q - Bryan Kraft>: How are you handling the technology side of the streaming business?
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Oh yes, sorry. Well, again, there's a lot of – be it a Sling or a Hulu or the traditional
MVPDs, obviously that's for them to do. Our real focus here is how does the user interface work for us in terms of our
owned and operated apps. What are the things we have to do to interface with their systems? But we're not in the
business of direct streaming ourselves that much, but we work in particular on the authenticated apps very closely with
the managed networks, the facilities-based distributors to try to figure out how the best customer experience can be
there. But, again, I think that's really a question for the video platforms, be it Hulu or Sling or any of those guys and
how they do it. But we've restructured some of our own organizations to put more focus on investing in the technology
around customer experience, on app development. We've consolidated that into one group. We've really staffed up
there and got some of the best product people from around our business and affiliates into that. And it's something that
I think you'll see real progress on from a product perspective over the next, six, nine, 12 months and continually
thereafter.
<Q - Bryan Kraft>: And is true[X] the primary technology provider for the advertising insertion?
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: For the advertising piece, yes, and it's really now formed the core part of what we call
our Advanced Advertising group which really does all of the tech ops and everything around advertising for digital and
linear across the piece. So we have one place there to manage all of that inventory, price it properly and develop new
products.
<Q - Bryan Kraft>: And then my last follow up, I promise, is do you think that you're going to move to more of a
programmatic approach to selling advertising as you move to more of a dynamic ad insertion streamed world?
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: I think programmatic is a really big word. It means a lot of different things to a lot of
people. Is most of the buying and selling of advertising from an just inventory management and pricing point of view
going to be done by machines in the future? Yes. But that's not a comment on pricing. That's a simple question around
efficiency and process.
