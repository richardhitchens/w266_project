MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Brandi, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome
everyone to the Exelon Corporation third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to
prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator
Instructions]
I would now like to turn the conference over to Dan Eggers, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go
ahead.
Daniel L. Eggers
Thank you, Brandi. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2016 earnings call. Leading
today's call are Chris Crane, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer, and Jack Thayer, Exelon's Chief Financial
Officer. They're joined by the other members of Exelon's senior management team, who will be available to answer
your questions following our prepared remarks.
We issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, both of which can be found in the Investor
Relations section of Exelon's website. The earnings release and other matters which we discuss during today's call
contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results
could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material,
comments made during this call, and the Risk Factors section of the earnings release and the 10-Q, which we expect to
file later today. Please refer to today's 8-K or the 10-Q and Exelon's other filings for a discussion of factors that may
cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts, and expectations.

Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please
refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for a reconciliation
between the non-GAAP measures to the nearest equivalent GAAP measures. We have scheduled 45 minutes for today's
call.
I'll now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon's CEO.
Christopher M. Crane
Thanks, Dan, and good morning to all of you. We appreciate your time and the interest in Exelon in joining the call
today.
We hosted our Analyst Day in August, and you have a lot of information that we passed on to understand the business
and our value proposition. With that fresh in your mind, today's call will focus on the third quarter results, some
business updates, including actions we are taking with recent power weaknesses.
We had a great third quarter across our utilities, Constellation, and our generating fleet. On a GAAP basis, we earned
$0.53 versus $0.69 last year quarter over quarter. On the operating basis, we earned $0.91 a share, up from last year's
$0.83 per share and well above our guidance range of $0.65 to $0.75 per share. Jack is going to cover the details on
earning drivers, but let me make a few observations.
At the utilities, the hot summer weather was a big help, with revenues up on higher volumes of electricity sold and
lower costs with less storm activity across the system. The excellent reliability we provided to our customers over a hot
summer reinforces the benefits of our capital investment programs. ExGen had a great operational quarter, with the
nuclear fleet producing more power ever in a quarter. Finally, Constellation really hit a sweet spot in the third quarter.
The sustained hot weather enabled us to sell high volumes of electricity to customers while limited price volatility
brought the cost to serve the customers down, allowing us to profit on both volumes and margins. The continued
success at Constellation in the third quarter reinforces the value of our gen-to-load matching strategy.
So if you look at slide six, as we talked about best-in-class operation, at the Analyst Day we emphasized best-in-class
operation across all our businesses, which we see as the ticket of entry at the utilities and economic imperative at the
generation business, and I'm happy to report that the third quarter was operationally strong.
And our color block charts highlighted operating performance and customer satisfaction for the utilities. Legacy Exelon
utilities remain almost entirely first quartile. I'm proud of our customer satisfaction results but am disappointed with
our OSHA results, and we are taking corrective actions and should get these numbers back to first quartile shortly.
At PHI, we are encouraged by the process (sic) [progress] (5:02) we are making, although some of this success has
been helped by good weather and limited storm activity. We still have a long way to go to meet the reliability
commitments we made, but we are working hard to provide the service our customers deserve.
I mentioned already that the nuclear team had a very good quarter with a
capacity factor of 96.3% and no unplanned outage days even with the summer's sustained heat. For the year to date, our
nuclear capacity factor is at 94.8%.
Constellation also had a great quarter, completing the acquisition of ConEd Solutions and beginning that integration.
We continue to see a robust renewable rate, with margins and contract durations holding at levels we discussed at the
Analyst Day. So I want to thank all of our employees for excellent operations over the quarter and professionalism in
what was a very hot summer with fantastic results.
On the regulatory team side, the utilities are very busy as we work through a full load of rate cases at PHI in particular.
We've completed one rate case at PHI. The New Jersey BPU unanimously approved the ACE [Atlantic City Electric
Company] rate case settlement in August, yielding a good outcome. It brought needed benefits to the New Jersey

customers months earlier than if we would have litigated the case. We appreciate the efforts of all the parties in New
Jersey in making this happen.
We are encouraged by the progress that we are making so far, but we're also aware that improving operations and
returns at PHI will take time. These are the first sets of rate cases. We plan to refile at each PHI utility again in 2017. It
will take two cycles to what we believe align our revenues with the significant capital being deployed to benefit our
customers, improve reliability, and help the environment overall.
Talking about our key priorities, for us it's finding an economically sustainable path for our financially challenged
nuclear plants. We're currently on very different paths, but expect clarity this quarter in New York and also Illinois. In
New York, we're making progress on finalizing the contracts with NYSERDA and expect to have them sign for all
three plants in November. This aligns with the expected approval from the New York PSC on the acquisition of the
FitzPatrick plant.
We expect the CES from Ginna, Nine Mile 1 and 2 to add approximately $0.08 to $0.10 of EPS. We can expect
FitzPatrick to add another $0.02 to $0.08 per share a year depending on the refueling reschedules.
As expected, a group of independent power producers filed a challenge in federal court. The lawsuit does not request a
stay or an expedited trial, and we continue to believe that the CES design is sound and that it will withstand any legal
judge.
In Illinois, we continue to work with a wide group of parties on a comprehensive energy package that would preserve
the Clinton and Quad Cities stations' operating right. It will advance the utility investment aimed at energy efficiency
and reliability and will support further growth in renewable energy production in Illinois. The timeline is short for the
resolution, with two windows during a six-day veto session in November and the beginning of December.
We remain hopeful that we can reach a constructive solution that truly is in the best interests for our state and our
fellow Illinois citizens. But absent of the action during the upcoming veto session, both facilities will close. We are
moving forward with the retirement of the plants. We have already notified PJM of our intent to retire Quad Cities, and
we'll inform MISO in the beginning of December if the legislation is not passed.
A few years ago, we asked you to wait a while we work through the process in Illinois, and we have appreciated your
patience. We are now very close to the ultimate resolution in both Illinois and New York.
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Jack, and he will walk you through the numbers.
Jonathan W. Thayer
Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. My remarks today will cover our third quarter and year-to-date results,
our updated 2016 guidance range, progress on our current rate cases, and our gross margin disclosures.
Starting on slide 9, as Chris stated, we had a very strong quarter financially and operationally across the company. For
the third quarter, we delivered adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.91 per share, exceeding our guidance
range of $0.65 to $0.75 per share.
Exelon utilities delivered a great quarter with a combined $0.53 per share of operating earnings. This was driven by
favorable weather at ComEd and PECO, where cooling degree days were 39% and 37% above normal respectively, as
well as lower O&M expense versus plan across all our utilities, primarily due to lower than normal storm activity.
Generation delivered $0.41 per share of operating earnings in the quarter. We had strong performance at our
Constellation business, where our generation-to-load matching strategy continued to provide value, and we benefited
from a lower cost to serve our customers.
On slide 10, the $0.91 per share in the third quarter of this year was $0.08 per share better than the third quarter of
2015. Upside came from favorable weather across our service territories, the inclusion of PHI, and higher distribution

revenues at both ComEd and PECO due to increased capital investment and increased rates respectively. This was
partially offset by a decrease in earnings at ExGen, driven primarily by increased taxes due to the inability to use the
domestic production activities deduction and lower capacity prices.
On slide 11, our year-to-date earnings of $2.24 per share are $0.11 per share higher relative to the same period last
year, driven by performance at the utilities. The primary drivers are favorable weather, increased distribution revenues
across all of our utilities due to higher rates and increased capital investment, and the addition of PHI. ExGen is down
$0.16 per share from this time last year due to increased decommissioning costs, increased taxes, and share count
differential.
Turning to slide 12, we are raising our full-year guidance range from $2.40 per share to $2.70 per share to $2.55 per
share to $2.75 per share, reflecting in particular the strong results that we've seen at ComEd and PECO year to date.
Turning to slide 13, we've laid out the schedule for the next six months of activity in all our current rate case
proceedings across Exelon utilities. As you know, we filed distribution cases in all of PHI's jurisdictions and expect
decisions spread throughout the third quarter of next year, providing needed revenue relief as we continue to make
significant investments on behalf of our customers. Our investments in our utilities are needed to improve the customer
experience and create value for customers.
As Chris mentioned, in August, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities approved a settlement authorizing Atlantic
City Electric to increase its electric distribution rate by $45 million. The new rates went into effect immediately, which
was seven months earlier than expected. This ruling recognizes Atlantic City Electric's commitment to enhancing its
energy infrastructure. Over the past five years, Atlantic City Electric has spent approximately $716 million in energy
system upgrades to benefit its customers. This settlement is a good start, but there's more work to be done in the other
jurisdictions.
We still have rate cases outstanding at the other PHI utilities. In these cases, we're asking for $326 million in revenue
requirement increases. These increases reflect recovery on multiple years of smart meter and other capital investments
meant to improve the reliability of the grid across all the PHI jurisdictions. We're expecting the Pepco Maryland
decision in mid-November, followed by Delmarva Maryland in February.
In addition, ComEd made its annual formula rate filing with the Illinois Commerce Commission in the second quarter
of this year, with a decision expected in December. ComEd requested a revenue requirement increase of $132 million
related to approximately $2.4 billion in capital investments made in 2015. These investments, which include $663
million for smart grid-related work, help strengthen and modernize the electric system. More details on the rate cases
can be found on slides 28 through 33 in the appendix.
Slide 14 provides our third quarter gross margin update, including our 2019 disclosures. We're including the 2019
numbers a couple weeks earlier than our normal course of [ph] DEI (14:25), as we wanted to package together some
interrelated updates for you today. Our total gross margin uses September 30 curves and does not include the impact of
the CES program in New York or the purchase of FitzPatrick. But we have included these impacts below the line to
provide a full picture for 2017 through 2019. We anticipate formally including both of them on our fourth quarter call.
2016 total gross margin increased $50 million during the third quarter, lifted by strong performance, primarily at
Constellation. We're highly hedged for the rest of this year and remain well balanced on our generation load-matching
strategy.
Total gross margin decreased from the second quarter to the third quarter by $100 million in 2017 and $250 million in
2018. The decline is driven by lower power prices on the unhedged portion of our output. We have seen power prices at
NiHub and West Hub for these years move higher since the end of September, with 2017 increasing approximately
$0.50 to $0.75 per megawatt hour respectively.
2018 prices have increased approximately $0.20 to $0.50 per megawatt hour respectively. And as a result total gross
margin on our unhedged generation has recovered since 9/30 by $50 million. At the end of the quarter, our hedge
position was approximately 7% to 10% behind ratable in 2017 and 4% to 6% behind ratable in 2018 when considering

cross-commodity hedges and reflecting our more positive fundamental view on the power markets. The majority of our
link remains concentrated in the Midwest to align with our view of power market upside at NiHub.
Total gross margin in 2019 is $6.8 billion, which is $450 million less than in 2018. The majority of the decline from
2018 is due to $175 million from lower capacity revenues, which we provided at Analyst Day, $125 million from a full
year of retirement for Quad Cities, and $200 million from a roll-off of in-the-money hedges versus 2018.
We see multiple reasons why we would expect a better realized power price environment than what's captured in these
numbers. First, forwards beyond 2017 and especially beyond 2018 reflect a highly illiquid market with limited real
price discovery. Liquidity will improve as we get closer to the delivery year, and that will help prices. In addition, our
work on power market shows too many plants continuing to operate even though they're not economically viable.
These plants will need to close like we've done with certain of our fossil plants and our planned nuclear retirements.
Second, our generation load-matching strategy and our portfolio management team at Constellation have a proven
ability to extract value out of various market conditions. Our Constellation business is set up to profit in periods of
extremes. This summer we captured better margin since our contracts are priced using forward summer market
volatility. And when we don't see that volatility, such as this summer, we capture additional value. We saw the same
thing during the Polar Vortex, a period with extremes but in the opposite direction. Our gross margin projections on
this page do not anticipate these events repeating and assume normal weather, leaving the opportunity for additional
upside.
And finally, the CES program in New York and the acquisition of FitzPatrick will add $500 million in gross margin in
2019 and annual EPS contributions of $0.10 to $0.18 per year annually starting next year.
Turning to slide 15, even though we don't believe this market will be a reality, we are acting as if it will. We're
reducing expected O&M expenditures by $100 million in 2018 and $125 million in 2019 at ExGen relative to what we
showed you.
At Analyst Day, adding to the $400 million of savings we've already taken out of the business. We are finding
additional savings as we focus our operations and reduce development efforts in generation as we close out the growth
CapEx program in 2017. We run an efficient organization but we'll continue to look for ways to reduce cost beyond
these reductions. Our focus at ExGen remains on maximizing our cash generation to meet our commitments of funding
utility equity needs and debt reduction. These efforts will help keep us on track.
Finally, turning to slide 16, our sources and uses slide, we expect adjusted cash flow from operations of $6.85 billion in
2016. In September the U.S. Tax Court ruled against us on the like-kind exchange issue related to our sale of fossil
generation in 1999. The outcome on the merits was not unexpected. We were fully reserved for the underlying claim.
However, we do not agree with the decision and particularly disagree with the decision to issue penalties, which we did
not think was likely or warranted. The law is very clear that we were entitled to rely upon the opinion of legal counsel.
We believe the court came to an erroneous conclusion, and we expect to appeal the decision early next year. We plan to
issue approximately $1 billion of long-term debt to support the payment to the IRS.
I'll now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks.
Christopher M. Crane
Thanks, Jack.
We do appreciate the time, and we've had a lot to be proud about at the company, but we're not happy with the outlook
that we see at ExGen. As Jack talked, we're taking actions. The limited liquidity in the forwards beyond 2017 and the
true lack of discipline by uneconomic generators are distorting the market. That said, we're not just going to sit around
and wait on the power markets to recover. As we said, we're taking further actions to control our future at ExGen,
aggressively managing our costs to prosper even against these forwards, cutting $100 million in cost from 2018 and
$125 million from 2019 on top of the $400 million we've already cut across the business. And we're pursuing the

compensation for the zero carbon attributes of our plants, as we've done in New York.
We are optimizing the fleet. All of this brings us back to the value proposition. We're targeting the best-in-class utility
EPS growth of 7% to 9% through 2020. The strong free cash flow at ExGen will provide the incremental equity needs
at the utilities as we focus on debt reduction at ExGen. We're focused on optimizing the value of our ExGen business
by seeking fair compensation from the carbon-free generation fleet and closing uneconomic plants. We will be
opportunistically selling assets where it makes sense to accelerate our debt reduction plans and maximize value through
the gen-to-load matching strategy, which had another big quarter. We'll continue to focus on sustaining strong
investment-grade credit metrics, growing our dividend in a consistent visible manner.
And I thank you for your interest, and now we're ready to take questions.
Q&A
Operator
Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Thanks, good morning.
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: Good morning, Greg.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: I'm looking at the disclosures on the utilities. You raised your guidance range by $0.05 at each of
the key utilities, but ExGen also is $50 million better on a gross margin basis. I know you usually think about this in
rounding terms, and that's less than $0.05. But as you think about Q4, where do you think you are inside the ExGen
guidance range assuming normal operations for the rest of the year?
<A - Jonathan W. Thayer>: Greg, I'd say we're feeling very good on the back of a very strong performance within the
Constellation business year to date. There are some timing elements that keep us in that same guidance range.
Obviously, the fourth quarter is an important one for that business, and we'll be tracking it closely. But I'd say we feel
good about how we're trending, and that's reflected in our comfort in taking the guidance up across the company.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Thanks. When I look at the delta from 2018 to 2019 in terms of the headwind from capacity, and
a lot of this you talked about at Analyst Day, capacity, mark-to-market on power curves, but then the offsetting benefits
of lower O&M, lower depreciation, lower taxes. It looks to me based on the fully diluted share count like that's about a
$0.15 delta today based on current forward curves. Am I missing something, or is that in the right ballpark?
<A - Jonathan W. Thayer>: Relatively speaking, I think you're in the right direction. I don't want to give 2019
guidance at this point, but that feels right.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Okay. And then can you give us some sense of timing on the process for the Mystic plants and
when we might get some visibility on price and timing to close?
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: I don't think that there has been any public statement on that. We've acknowledged
we're selling the plant. Beyond that, Greg, I don't think it's probably right for us to comment on the process.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Operator
Our next question is from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Thanks. Can I just ask about the – you made comments about feeling good around
how you're executing in Constellation. Any comments on trends in your margins and renewals? One thing we noticed
was that the new business to go for 2019, $950 million, is down a little from what you had for 2018 this time last year,

yet you've got ConEd Solutions in there, I would guess. So is that some pressure in what you've seen around margins or
more conservatism, or how should we think about those numbers?
<A - Joseph Nigro>: Good morning, Jonathan. This is Joe. We feel very strong we're going to be able to deliver on
2019. Part of the reason that number is down is because we've already executed more in that year than we would have
at this point last year for 2018, so that's why you see a lower number. Our new business to go, our new business in
total, the business we're going to create in total between 2018 and 2019 is roughly the same amount. And we're
comfortable that we're going to be able to meet these targets as we've done in the last 40 years.
As to your comment about margins and renewal rates in retail, as I mentioned at Analyst Day, the market has remained
stable. Our margins are right in line with what I talked about at Analyst Day. Our renewal rates remain strong. The
acquisition of ConEd, although we've only had them for a brief period, has gone well. We're very impressed with the
way they run their operation, and we're integrating that into the Constellation business. So the retail business remains
very stable and we're happy they're [ph] a part of it (26:11) at this point and continue to monitor it.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Okay, thank you. And then can I ask around the ExGen O&M guidance? Could you
give us a little more insight into what's driving the incremental savings? And then perhaps is this – obviously, one of
your nuclear competitors is seeing some cost pressures in that business. Can you talk about what your underlying
expense profile might be and how much you're having to cut in order to get to these net lower numbers?
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: I'll let Jack fill in the details. On our nuclear fleet overall, in the past 7 to 10 years, we
have made significant capital investment to prepare the plants for their extended life. You can see our reliability
numbers reflect the investment that's been made. So we do not see any significant increase in capital. Actually, we're
seeing a decrease in maintenance capital because of the massive improvements that we've made.
On the O&M side, there has been significant focus not only at Exelon but across the industry with industry initiatives to
try to find ways to take what were old processes that were put in place that may be much more efficiently executed with
the same results on a much lower cost basis, and that's the initiative that the Nuclear Energy Institute has been
performing.
I can't speak to other fleets, but I can tell you that we have a very strong focus on capital, a very strong focus on
efficiency. And the last thing we would do is cut into safety or reliability. And that's been a clear focus of mine
throughout my whole career, and it will continue to be; run the plant safely, reliably, and very efficiently.
<A - Jonathan W. Thayer>: So, Jonathan, just building on what Chris said, starting with that focus on safety and
reliability, as you might imagine, when you contemplate a program that saves $400 million across the company and
you're turning over many stones, you identify additional opportunities.
And so among – we've got almost – more than 100 initiatives that we've been looking at, and each will contribute
approximately from $1 million to several million dollars. But whether it's corporate efficiencies or organizational
design, nuclear fuel savings, contractor costs, insourcing rates, nuclear site security, automation, NRCP reductions,
property taxes, organizational design and centralization, such as within our engineering group, outage costs,
automation, it's just a long list of activities. And we do have good line of sight on these opportunities. And I think
building on the processes that we've put in place to target cost and seek efficiencies, I think our hope is that we may in
fact even find more than what we're sharing with you today.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Thanks a lot, guys.
Operator
Our next question is from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe.
<Q - Steve Fleishman>: Hi, good morning, a couple things. First just on the New York ZECs [Zero-Emissions Credit],
could you just clarify the thoughts on ZECs versus RECs [Renewable Energy Credit] because the IPPs [Independent
Power Producer] that filed the appeal seem to say there is a difference? So could you clarify maybe where they're

<A - Joseph Nigro>: It's Joe Nigro, Steve. We don't think there is really a difference. The program was fashioned after
the REC programs. The distinctions that plaintiffs are trying to create in New York are not real. But they face the
political problem, of course, that if they describe the lawsuit as also challenging, the renewable programs, that they're
going to have a good deal more opposition. But the programs function essentially identically. The ZEC program is
based on the cost of keeping resources in the market, just as the renewables credits are the cost of keeping resources in
the market, paying for the environmental attributes, recognizing that these assets get both fulsome market revenues as
well as attribute payments. But from our perspective, they function pretty much the same way.
<Q - Steve Fleishman>: Okay. And then moving to Illinois, just any more color? Are you feeling more optimistic
about being able to get a legislative bill this veto session than let's say a month or two ago?
<A - Anne R. Pramaggiore>: Hi, this is Anne Pramaggiore. I think what we're seeing right now is that there is a bit of
an opening of the door. The legislature has a temporary budget in play and Chicago public school funding is behind
that. And so I think we see an opportunity in the veto sessions. We're also seeing there's a lot of work to be done to get
there. We've got to pull together a coalition to come in with an agreed bill as much as possible, and we're in the process
of putting that together now. But we do think that there's the potential that this would be entertained in the veto session.
<Q - Steve Fleishman>: Okay. And then just lastly in the context of what you said about power views and long-term
liquidity, to the degree that let's say an Illinois bill passes and it includes benefits for all types of generation, just doesn't
that continue on the potential inefficiencies of the markets and keep some of the issues that are causing prices to be
lower? So I guess just how are you thinking about hedging and managing your portfolio against the fact that the more
of these you get done, the more generation stays around?
<A - Joseph Dominguez>: Steve, this is Joe Dominguez. I'll turn it back over to Joe Nigro in terms of managing the
portfolio. Look, the market is what it is. Today, we have over 30 states with renewable portfolio standards that
recognize the environmental contributions of virtually every resource in the market that does what our nuclear plants
do. So we're seeking to get fair treatment.
At the same time from a policy perspective, we think clearly for many years now that we think the right move is to put
the cost of collusion in the market; that is, in the case of climate, establish a price on carbon, and we're going to
continue to pursue those things. But obviously, there have been a number of headwinds that have prevented those
policies from being fully realized and fully recognizing the impact that carbon has on climate as measured by the
Federal government. So we haven't seen programs that trade carbon up to the social cost of climate. We're going to
continue to work on those things.
But the plans we have in New York and Illinois we think of as preserving those units for the day where we have that
best design in place, and we think that day is going to come eventually. But we need a bridge solution to keep the units
that are important to our customers in place, so that they're available once we do have a carbon signal in the market.
And that's how we reconcile it, but we have to take this world as it comes to us, and the world currently isn't our most
favorite design on putting a price on carbon in the market. We have these separate state programs, and it's important for
our customers that these nuclear plants be preserved, and that's what's driving our initiatives. Joe?
<A - Joseph Nigro>: And I would add just from a market perspective and a portfolio perspective a couple of things.
One is on the market side, I think the illiquidity of the market is somewhat independent of what Joe was saying. I think
it gets into the nature of market participants, as you're well aware. When you think about the financial institutions to
start with that added liquidity in this marketplace in years past, we don't see nearly the depth of that.
But what's interesting is that the power markets have been illiquid for quite some time. But when you look at open
interest, just on the gas market, for example, we've seen a change there where it's very front-end loaded versus the outer
years. And I think what's important with that is, and I'll give you an example. When you look at the price change in the
quarter in PJM in particular, versus the end of June versus the end of September, you saw that the price of gas in each
of those years when you include these basis prices [ph] such as rate (35:38), fell equally. Yet, we dropped power prices
more materially on the back-end of the forward curve than we did in the [ph] nearby (35:48) 2017, and that gets into

some of the illiquidity in the market.
As it relates to our portfolio, we take all these factors into account, both the same depth we're doing internally with our
other assets. We have an estimate of what other folks are going to do with their own assets. We've been very clear that
we've been aggressively managing our portfolio as it relates to our ratable plan, and we'll continue down that path.
The last thing I would add is that we talk a lot about the benefits of our generation load strategy and we do it in dollars.
It also has a huge benefit from a market perspective because it doesn't force us to go to that illiquid over-the-counter
market. We have a strong customer base and a very, very strong load serving business now that matches output of
generations of quantity of load very
Well, and we're going to continue to grow that. And we've done it both organically very well and through acquisition of
Integrys and ComEd, and that's been a big benefit also.

Your next question is from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: Hi, good morning. Congratulations on a great quarter and on further cost reductions.
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: Thanks.
<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: I wanted to hit on what you mentioned in terms of some of your peers who would appear
to need to shut down further plants, and we do see some of those same dynamics. But I was curious from your point of
view. What kind of catalysts or drivers should we be thinking about in terms of seeing more rational decisions and
further shutdowns? What do you see as some of the key catalysts?
<A - Joseph Nigro>: Stephen, I think the example I would give you is when you look at coal-fired generation. When
you look in the Eastern Interconnect between call it 2016 and over the next few years, we see almost 30 gigawatts of
coal expected to retire, with almost 2/3 of that being done by the end of next year. The obvious examples are some of
the plants that have been announced in Illinois and also in Ohio and the rationalization of that. Obviously, we've taken
our own actions with our own power plants. We've seen others do the same thing beyond coal. And we expect more of
that will continue if these low prices continue because when we look at it fundamentally, there are plants that are
challenged economically that are still running that really the economic rationale isn't there for those to continue to
operate.
<A - Jonathan W. Thayer>: Stephen, just to build on that. I think you've heard us make strong comments about a
focus on reducing leverage at the GenCo to 3 times debt to EBITDA. I think the reality is in this current pricing
environment you're going to start to see others look at their outlooks and look at their leverage statistics and focus their
efforts on generating cash. In order to do that, they're going to need to retire money-losing assets. So I think it will
force greater discipline on their part. We're already seeing some of that. I think you'll see there's some potential for
consolidation and asset optimization around that, and portfolio optimization. So I think we see a pathway for others to
be disciplined as we have, but obviously we need to see execution on that in that regard.
<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: Those are all great points. I wanted to shift over to the New York ZEC legal challenge. I
think you've laid out your points of view in terms of the legal position. In the event that in court the ZECs were either
overturned or remanded for substantial modification, can you speak to the impact to the acquisition with Entergy in
terms of the transaction impacts?
<A - Joseph Dominguez>: Sure. Stephen, this is Joe Dominguez again. So the way you ought to look at that
transaction is: the legal risk will shift to us really around the time we do the outage in January. So post-January, you
ought to think about us as effectively being the economic owner of that legal risk, subject, of course, to the approvals.
But we're not going to be able to walk away from the transaction if something occurs post-January that changes the

ZEC program. And the logic there is after the outage we effectively have our fuel in the machine and we've paid for the
outage costs, so we're going to be the economic owner at that point, again subject to regulatory approvals of the
transaction.
<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: Understood. And I guess the worst case always is that you do still have plant closure as
an option, so your worst case is capped and you still do have the potential for obviously a good outcome.
<A - Joseph Dominguez>: That's right. And we feel very strongly in the merits of the case. Otherwise, we would not
have done this.
<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: Great, thank you very much.

Our next question is from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.
<Q - Shahriar Pourreza>: Hey, Chris and Jack.
<A - Jonathan W. Thayer>: Hi, Shar.
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: Good morning.
<Q - Shahriar Pourreza>: The $0.02 to $0.08 of synergies from FitzPatrick, can you just remind us if that includes
any additional synergies of owning FitzPatrick next to Nine Mile?
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: It doesn't, and we'll evaluate that as we get into the integration. There are conversations
now in the nuclear integration team on what is the best way to optimize. The security fences are next to each other. It's
a very big site. So amalgamation of the complete site might be more expensive than it's worth, but there are other
elements on the site that we can look for synergies around the support services and the executive management.
<Q - Shahriar Pourreza>: Okay, got it. I don't know if you could mention the actual – is it enough to be a couple of
pennies or anything directionally, or not yet, too early?
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: It's too early. We've got to get in and see and make sure that we maintain our design
basis but look at everything possible we can to be more efficient.
<Q - Shahriar Pourreza>: Okay, got it. And then just lastly with the strong results year-to-date, are there any
opportunities to pull forward some O&M, and maybe how we should think about it for the fourth quarter?
<A - Jonathan W. Thayer>: I'd say with respect to O&M, we're going to manage our plan tightly. And generally
there's not that much opportunity to move things quarter to quarter. The planning required for the bulk of our O&M
takes months, if not years. And so I think you'll see us trying to land pretty darn close to what we've shown you in the
slides today.
<Q - Shahriar Pourreza>: Okay, great. Congrats on the quarter.
<A - Jonathan W. Thayer>: Thank you.

<Q - Christopher J. Turnure>: Good morning. I had some questions on Pepco, and I wanted to just get an update on
your latest dialogue with interveners in Maryland and DC and just how things are progressing there on their
understanding of you guys under-earning by so much and having stayed out of cases for so long there pre-deal.
<A - Denis P. O'Brien>: Hi, this is Denis. Great question. As we're going through the integration, I think things are
going very, very well. As we mentioned before, it's going to be a long haul in terms of rate cases being filed every 12 to
15 months for the next five years. We've had some good progress in New Jersey. We're in the throes of the case in
Maryland at this point, and I guess we'll know about November 15 the outcome of that. So a little hard to predict.
Maryland is somewhat challenging. We are continuing to work on improving its reliability, improving all of our
performance levels, as well as working to improve our image, reputation, and brand in Maryland. I think this is going to
be one of those things where it's going to take us a few cases to get through to a better level of performance. So we'll
see November 14 or 15 where we are, and we're going to make this happen. It just may take us a few cases to do it.
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: And in DC, we're early in the process. We've made our filing. We're in data request
now. Over 400, I believe, data requests are coming in. So there's going to be a lot of dialogue there, a lot of questions. I
think we'll need to provide the sound answers for the basis of our request.
<Q - Christopher J. Turnure>: Okay. And then excluding weather, were there other drivers behind the
outperformance or maybe the guidance increase for the Pepco utilities for 2016?
<A - Jonathan W. Thayer>: Primarily weather related, so hotter than normal temperatures as well as storms relative
to what we budgeted came in lighter. So beyond that, I think those were the major drivers.
<Q - Christopher J. Turnure>: Okay, that's all I had. Thanks.
