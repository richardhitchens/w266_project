With that, I'll it over to you, Peter.
Peter D. Hancock
Thanks, Liz, and thank you, all, for joining us this morning.
I'd like to discuss key highlights from the first quarter, the progress we're making towards our financial targets, and the
quality and strength of our balance sheet.
Turning to page three, book value per share excluding accumulated other comprehensive income and our deferred tax
asset was over $60, up 4% to the quarter and 14% from a year ago. We're confident that we will achieve our targeted
book value growth of at least 10% this year through improving profitability and active capital management.
Our ROE improvement is also on track even after considering certain noteworthy items in the quarter, which David
will discuss.
On the expense front, we continue to evaluate opportunities to simplify our businesses and provide the greatest value to
our customers. Again, we made progress in the first quarter, and remain committed to our annual targets through 2017
of10% book value per share growth excluding AOCI and DTA, and 50 basis points of normalized ROE improvement
and 3% to 5% expense reductions through 2017. Our first quarter results demonstrated our commitment to balancing
growth, profitability and risk.
Looking across our businesses, we saw improved underwriting results in commercial insurance. Within our consumer
segment, we continued to invest in our Japan integration, which will provide a platform for long-term profitability.
John and Kevin will provide additional comments on the performance of their respective businesses and how they have
been positioned for sustained profitability.
Our disciplined use of value-based metrics was evident again this quarter as we actively managed our capital structure.
Our year-to-date execution of debt retirement at spreads exceeding those of our debt issuance resulted in about $170
million of incremental economic value for shareholders. We also continued to purchase shares below our estimate of
intrinsic value.
In the quarter, we utilized a combination of open market purchases and a 10b-5 program to deploy capital according to
our objectives. This approach executes the deployment over long periods of time – longer periods of time compared to
the previous methods used.
Since our fourth quarter earnings call through today, we have repurchased 39.6 million common shares at a cost of $2.2
billion and have $3.8 billion remaining under our existing authorizations, including the new $3.5 billion share
repurchase authorization that we announced yesterday. We're in line with the $6 billion to $7 billion in capital return
that we indicated for the 2015 full year, which does not include further de-risking activities including non-core asset
sales.
Our annual shareholder letter reiterated initiatives we have in place to drive sustainable profitability through science,
technology and the application of value-based metrics in assessing and managing our businesses. We specifically
referred to floating or selling businesses that lack synergy with our core operations. To be clear, we believe that our
core insurance businesses largely meet our customers' needs and our economic return objectives.
We will also consider acquisitions that build our capabilities to meet our customers' needs, enhance our infrastructure
and are not overly capital-intensive. Our mission is to empower our clients and to be their most valued insurer through
our risk expertise and our financial strengths.
Turning to slide 4, during the quarter, we took further actions to simplify our balance sheet and reduce risk. The
continued active wind down of the direct investment book and substantial termination of CDS in global capital markets
has eliminated the need to separately report these results. We would expect this change to occur later this year.

The actions this quarter, along with the many steps we have taken to exit non-core businesses and streamline our
businesses have resulted in improved balance sheet strength, risk profile and sustainability of returns. Our de-risking
actions provide us with the capital flexibility to execute on our strategy to pursue profitable growth and provide the
services and products that best meet our customers' needs.
Finally, we are often asked how we are viewed under the lens of a non-bank SIFI regulation. It's important to note that,
as a result of our de-risking activities since 2012, our analysis suggest our balance sheet size, leverage and capital in
non-insurance activities is comparatively low relative to our non-bank SIFI peers. We work closely with our many
regulators and respect the value they bring to all stakeholders.
Now, I would like to turn it over to David.
David L. Herzog
Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. This morning I will speak to our quarterly financial results, the
progress towards our financial objectives and our capital management.
Turning to slide 5, you can see our total insurance pre-tax operating income was down about 7% from a year ago. The
comparison reflects unusually strong alternative investment returns a year ago, combined with the negative impact of
low interest rate environment that we're in. Consistent with our comments last quarter, we expect continued pressure on
investment income given the current interest rate environment. Our insurance earnings comparison was also impacted
by nearly $220 million swing in the worker's compensation discount between periods.
In the first quarter, we adopted a quarterly process for adjusting the worker's compensation discount based on changes
in the interest rate environment, which is consistent with our statutory reporting practice. While the change in discount
is reflected in our operating earnings, the corresponding appreciation in the fixed income securities that support these
reserves is recorded in the balance sheet and accumulated other comprehensive income, so from an economic
standpoint, they offset.
Excluding these discount changes, the total insurance operating income was up about 2% from the same period last
year. John and Kevin will provide more details on the commercial and the consumer operating results in their remarks.
Reported net income was $2.5 billion and included after-tax gains associated with sale of a portion of our PICC P&C
shares and the Prudential B shares which combined for just shy of $575 million in gains. The shares sold in PICC were
accounted for as available for sale and bring our ownership to 8.2%, down from 9.9%. The monetization of this portion
of the PICC P&C investment reflects further derisking of our balance sheet, given the significant share appreciation
since our 2003 initial investment. We continue to hold stakes in both PICC P&C and the PICC group and see mutually
beneficial opportunities to broaden our strategic relationship with PICC.
Turning to slide 6, we provide detail on corporate and other operations which was negatively impacted by a decline in
the mark-to-market earnings from the direct investment book and global capital markets. We continue to successfully
further wind down the direct investment book and global capital markets or DIB/GCM during the quarter, and we
recognized gains on the termination of the credit default swaps in both corporate debt, CLOs and the multi-sector
CDOs. We redeemed an additional $1.1 billion in purchase price DIB debt using cash and short-term investments
allocated to this book for this purpose.
Given the substantial progress and our further wind down of the book, we expect that we would no longer report DIB
GCM as a separate component of Corporate and Other. Over $2 billion of capital supporting the DIB and GCM will be
freed up beginning in the second quarter.
Parent company investment in AerCap and PICC generated $175 million in pre-tax operating income in the quarter.
With respect to our investment in AerCap, our carrying value is just over $52.50 a share, reflective of the equity
earnings pickup that we record each quarter for our 46% interest. This compares to a market price of about $46 to $47 a
share which may ultimately result in an other than temporary impairment charge later this year if the market price of

AerCap shares continues to trade below our carrying value or if we change our intentions with respect to the sale of
these shares.
You may have also seen that during the quarter, AerCap registered the 97 million shares that we own, which was a
requirement for any potential sale of those shares by AIG. This registration covers a three-year period. Additionally,
results of other operations which primarily include earnings from life settlements and global real estate holdings were
$235 million in the quarter and included about $170 million real estate gain for the step-up in value of some underlying
investments. Our reported operating after tax rate was about 33%, which was in line with our 33% to 34% rate.
Turning to our financial objectives on slide 7, we estimate our normalized ROE is closer to 7.8% for the quarter. Our
normalization takes into account lower expected caps, higher than expected alternative returns and negative impact to
the changes in the Workers' Comp discount.
General operating expenses, which are summarized on slide 8, were $2.8 billion in the first quarter, down 3% from the
same period a year ago. Favorable effects from foreign exchange were offset by timing of when we record or reverse or
true-up, certain accruals in the normal course, and the impact of interest rates and mortality assumptions on our pension
expense. Excluding these items, the decline in GOE from these various items, the largest of which was a reduction in
our real estate or rent expense realized from the rationalization efforts in that regard.
Suffice it to say, we're making progress, but we have a significant amount of work ahead of us. Further, I would
emphasize that the trends can vary from quarter to quarter. That being said, we remained focus and committed to
operational and cost efficiency.
Our capital structure is highlighted on slide 9. During the quarter, we deployed over $1.4 billion towards the purchase
of about 25.5 million shares of common stock plus the additional 3.5 million shares that were delivered in January with
the full completion of the ASR, which we initiated in December. We also purchased an additional 14 – over 14 million
shares for a little over $800 million in April, bringing the total purchases, as Peter said, to about $2.3 billion, leaving
about $200 million available under the prior authorization plus the $3.5 billion of new authorizations we just received.
We continue to manage the cost and maturity profile of our debt. In January, we issued $1.2 billion of 20-year notes for
inside 3.9%, $800 million of 40-year notes at a rate inside 4.4%, and $350 million of 30-year callable notes for inside
4.4%. Following the end of the quarter, we also tendered for $1.25 billion of purchase price parent debt. We ended the
quarter with financial leverage ratios including hybrids of 16.4% or about 15.8% when giving effect to the April tender.
We continue to be opportunistic in our debt capital management.
Cash flow to the holding company remains strong, and as you can see on slide 10, parent received total distributions
from our insurance subsidiaries of about $3.5 billion during the quarter, including the previously disclosed $2.8 billion
that were paid in January.
The total distributions also include almost $300 million of tax-sharing payments from our insurance subsidiaries. We
also expect insurance company dividends and distributions of somewhere between $5 billion and $6 billion for the
balance of the year.
Now, with that, I'd like to turn the call over to John.
John Q. Doyle
Thank you, David.
I will review the first quarter results for commercial insurance, and briefly comment on an acquisition and strategic
investment we recently completed.
Pre-tax operating income for the Commercial segment was $1.5 billion, an increase from the prior year quarter, and
reflects strong Property Casualty and Mortgage Insurance results.

Turning to slide 12, Commercial Property Casualty had positive growth and improved underwriting profitability.
Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, net premiums written increased 6% from the year-ago quarter. Renewal of a
single multiyear policy accounted for about 40% of this net premium growth.
We grew Property particularly in the Americas and Asia Pacific regions, benefiting from improved client retention
rates.
Financial Lines had a strong quarter with growth in the mid-single-digit range and in all regions. We continue to
optimize our casualty portfolio in the U.S., which led to a slight decline in net premiums in the quarter in that segment.
International Casualty also grew in the quarter. Specialty net premiums were flat when compared to the same period a
year ago with modest growth in Marine and Credit lines.
We continue to see a range of price activity across markets. In the U.S., rate change in Specialty was a positive 3.2%,
and Financial lines were also up by nearly 3%. We also continue to successfully raise rates where needed in the
segments of U.S. Casualty.
However, Property rates did decline by 5.4% in the U.S. for the quarter. Pricing outside of the U.S. is under modestly
more pressure, but rate adequacy is generally more attractive in these markets. We have confidence in the accident year
loss ratio trends and continued growth in risk-adjusted profitability due to our active management of business mix, and
from enhanced pricing, risk selection tools, and claims service.
Underwriting profitability improved with declines in the accident year loss ratio and general operating expenses on a
sequential and year-over-year basis. The accident year loss ratio as adjusted of 64.4 was eighth-tenths of a point better
than the same period last year and 1.5 points better than the prior quarter.
When compared to the prior-year period, the accident year loss ratio benefited from enhanced risk selection and pricing
discipline in Casualty, Specialty and Financial lines, particularly in the U.S., and lower attritional losses in U.S.
Property. Cat losses were also below expectations for the quarter, while severe losses were on plan. We continue to
expect 1 to 2 points of accident year loss ratio improvement in 2015.
We experienced modest net adverse prior year loss reserve development of $28 million for Property Casualty in the
quarter including premium adjustments. This included average development related to higher commercial auto claim
severity in Casualty, partially offset by favorable development in Property.
Generating operating expenses declined 6% from a year ago, primarily due to efficiencies from organizational
realignment initiatives and offset by investments in technology, engineering and analytics. Net investment income for
the quarter declined 3% compared to the same period last year to $1.1 billion, reflecting lower new money yields, lower
income on alternative investments, the effect of foreign exchange, and lower investment assets. We would expect
modest pressure on our investment returns to continue given the current interest rate environment.
Turning to slide 13, Mortgage Guaranty reported another strong performance with operating income of $145 million.
The year-over-year comparison for the quarter reflects a decline in incurred losses from lower delinquency rates, higher
cure rates and an increase in first lien net premiums earned as a result of higher new insurance written and an
acceleration of earnings on the cancellations of single premium business.
New insurance written showed a strong growth of 40% compared to last year driven by increased refinancings given
the low rates.
Turning to slide 14, Institutional Markets pre-tax operating income declined to $147 million for the quarter, primarily
due to lower alternative investment income and the impact of base portfolio returns from lower reinvestment rates. Fee
income increased driven by growth in reserves and assets under management primarily from continued development of
the stable value wrap business.
In March, we purchased NSM Insurance Group, a leading U.S. managing general agent and insurance program
administrator. NSM provides us with an access point to attractive markets including programs, small specialty
commercial segments and complementary distribution networks. We have worked with NSM for 15 years and expect to

build on this strong relationship.
We also recently acquired a minority stake in K2 Intelligence, an investigative consulting firm with particular expertise
in cyber security, which is a top-of-mind risk for our clients. I am pleased with commercial's improved results in the
quarter as we continue to advance our strategic initiatives and build on our vision to be our clients' most valued insurer.
Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin to discuss Consumer Insurance.
Kevin T. Hogan
Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone.
This morning I'll discuss the trends in our Consumer Insurance businesses and provide an update on our ongoing
investments in Japan.
In the first quarter, Consumer generated pre-tax operating income of $945 million. The performance of the business
reflects the sustained low interest rate environment and reflects stable Property Casualty underwriting results.
Turning to slide 16, operating income for retirement was $800 million for the quarter, benefiting from an increase in
fees due to increased assets under management. Investment income comparisons were negatively impacted by very
strong alternative returns a year ago and a decline in base portfolio income. Reinvestment rates were below the
weighted average yield of the overall portfolio, and average assets declined driven by the significant return of capital to
parent over the last 12 months.
As you can see on slide 17, base yields for fixed annuities and group retirement declined sequentially, consistent with
the anticipated 4- to 6-basis-point quarterly reduction I spoke to last quarter. We would expect that trend to continue for
the rest of the year should interest rates remain at current levels.
The impact to net investment spreads was partially mitigated by adhering to disciplined new business pricing and active
management of crediting rates. The outflow of older policies which carry higher crediting rates than current rates
offered also contributed to the reduction in our cost of funds, which has declined consistently for both fixed annuities
and group retirement over the last 12 months.
Assets under management ended the year at nearly $227 billion, 2% higher than a year ago. Strong net flows in
Retirement Income Solutions and positive separate account investment performance were partially offset by net
outflows for Fixed Annuities and Group Retirement.
AUM growth was achieved while paying out over $8 billion in distributions to parent over the last 12 months. Net
flows for Fixed Annuities continued to be affected by the low interest rate environment and we expect sales of Fixed
Annuities will remain challenged as we maintain our new business pricing discipline. We also expect Group
Retirement deposits to be impacted by a sustained low interest rate environment.
In the quarter, we experienced an increase in surrender activity in our Group Retirement business compared to a year
ago, in part due to several mid to large group surrenders. The retirement plan market has been impacted by
consolidation of healthcare providers and other groups in our target markets, which is impacting both new sales and
surrender activity in this business.
In Retirement Income Solutions, although recent market results suggest pressure on new sales of variable annuities, our
index annuity sales continued to gain momentum and macro trends support the growing customer need for quality
income solutions.
I would like to take a moment to comment on the Department of Labor's recent fiduciary rule proposal. While it is still
early to discuss in great detail, we, like our industry peers, are in the process of carefully reviewing this detailed 800
pages of proposed guidance so that we understand the regulation and can provide constructive responses to the DoL.

We would look for any final proposal to ensure both important protections for qualified plan participants, beneficiaries
and IRA owners, as well as the continued availability of valuable and broad-based product solutions, essential income
guarantees, and appropriate advice for these individuals to prepare for a successful retirement.
At AIG, we have the resources, expertise and commitment to the retirement space to respond quickly and to meet the
needs of consumers as the regulatory landscape changes. We believe that consumer demand for lifetime income
guarantees will continue to grow and that the insurance industry is uniquely positioned to meet this increasing need in
the years to come. We will monitor this closely, and we'll work with the DoL and the industry at large to achieve an
outcome that truly benefits the American consumer.
Slide 18 presents results for our Global Life business. Life pre-tax operating income of $171 million declined from the
prior-year quarter primarily due to lower alternative investment income and base portfolio income as well as higher
operating expenses from the investments we are making in distribution and technology in the U.S. In addition, Life also
experienced lower favorable mortality compared to the same period last year but still better than our pricing
expectations.
We realized a 10% increase in Life premiums from the year-ago period excluding the effects of foreign exchange,
reflecting continued growth in Japan and the acquisition of Ageas Protect in the UK. We also closed on the acquisition
of Laya Healthcare, Ireland's second largest primary health insurance provider, on March 31, and the integration of
Laya has commenced according to plan.
Turning to slide 19, Personal Insurance reported an operating loss of $26 million as underwriting results were
essentially unchanged but net investment income declined from the year-ago quarter. Net premiums written increased
1% from the same quarter a year ago, excluding the effects of foreign exchange. The increase was driven by premium
growth in all regions except the U.S. Japan grew by 4% compared to the prior year period driven by personal property
and rate actions in A&H.
The decline in the U.S. was primarily attributable to the declines in individual travel and warranty services as we
continued to maintain underwriting discipline in pricing and terms and conditions. The Personal Insurance accident
year loss ratio improved 0.6 points from the same quarter a year ago, reflecting better performance across all lines of
business.
Underwriting and rate actions taken in prior years in Japan personal property resulted in improved accident year loss
experience in that business. A U.S. warranty retail program also generated improved loss experience; however, the
benefit was offset by a related profit sharing expense, which contributed to the increase in the acquisition ratio from a
year ago. The Personal Insurance acquisition ratio increased primarily due to these warranty profit sharing expenses,
partially offset by lower direct marketing expenses.
The Personal Insurance general operating expense ratio was unchanged from the first quarter last year as both expenses
and premiums grew. General operating expenses increased from the same quarter a year ago reflecting the increased
technology-related project spend in the current quarter.
The Japan integration initiative had not fully commenced in the year-ago period. We continue to remain intensely
focused on our Japan integration initiative, and we are making good progress in these efforts. At this time, our outlook
for completion of our integration work is unchanged. Upon obtaining approval from the relevant authorities, we will be
able to provide more information on the target merger date, expected benefits, emergence profile, and updated program
expenses for the Japan integration.
To close for our Consumer businesses, we remain focused on achieving profitable growth and effectively managing
risk by executing on our customer-focused strategies, maintaining a prudent risk profile and targeting capital-efficient
growth opportunities.
Now, I'd like to turn it back to Liz to open up the Q&A.

Elizabeth A. Werner
Thank you. Operator, could we open up the lines for Q&A now?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We'll first hear from Jimmy Bhullar, JPMorgan.
<Q - Jamminder Singh Bhullar>: Hi. Good morning. First, I had a question for Peter just on your stake in AerCap.
The lock-up on part of the shares has expired already. So, is this a core holding or would you consider selling it at some
point? And if you do, what's your view on how you would use the proceeds?
And then secondly, you have been buying back stock on a consistent basis, but you haven't really raised the dividend
over the past, I think it's been five quarters that you haven't. So, if you could just discuss your reasoning for that.
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: So, as far as AerCap is concerned, it's certainly not core. We are looking at the various
options in terms of pace and timing of disposition and are very conscious of the value of that stake. And we'll make a
decision based on if – when and if we get fair value for that divestiture.
As far as redeployment of the proceeds, it would become part of the broader pool of capital that we generate through
both non-core asset disposal, de-risking of the DIB, and DTA monetization, and dividends from the OpCos. And we
have a sort of waterfall hierarchy of how we think of deploying that capital. We certainly want to prioritize organic
growth meeting our customers' needs.
We also are well aware of the opportunities to buy back shares if they are trading below what we view as intrinsic
value. And I think that as we start to near or exceed intrinsic value, we'll also want to explore dividend policies that are
a bit more consistent with peers. So I think that we recognize that we're in a sort of a transition period as we continue to
monetize non-core assets.
<Q - Jamminder Singh Bhullar>: And just if I could ask one more for John. On pricing trends in P&C, obviously the
market commentaries have gotten worse, especially on the commercial side. So how confident are you in the goals that
you had laid out for improvement in your combined ratio? And if trends remain the way they are, would you consider
that you would need to revise the targets down a little bit in terms of improvement?
<A - John Q. Doyle>: Jimmy, I didn't feel – I didn't see much different price activity in the first quarter than the fourth.
And as I said, it's – the Property Cat market is quite competitive, right? Outside of that, on average, things are fairly
stable and some companies are in better position to get rate than others, right? So, not all are equal. I think, for
example, I reported good financial lines rate increases in the first quarter. I think if you hear from brokers the overall
rate activity in that market is not quite so positive. And I think we're positioned very favorably in that market and are
able to get a bit of a different result than the market can.
Having said all that, the underwriting improvement, I remain confident, as I've said, in 1- to 2-point improvement
during the course of this year. It's not all about price. It's about managing the mix of business. It's about further
implementing and developing the tools that we've rolled out over the course of the last several years, both in
underwriting and in claims.
And then lastly, we saw it a bit in the first quarter here, our short tailed results last year, the attritional losses in property
in particular, were a bit elevated, and I would expect, not in every quarter, but I would expect over the course of the
year they will move back to more normal levels.

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll next hear from Randy Binner, FBR Capital Markets.
<Q - Randy Binner>: Hey. Good morning. Thanks. I appreciate the comments in the slide deck about de-risking that's
happened in the company over the last several years. I'm wondering what that means as far as a potential non-bank SIFI
off-ramp? And what I'm getting at is if there was an off-ramp and you could explore a structural change similar to what
we saw at GE, would that not be necessary now that you view yourself as having a more de-risked balance sheet?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: Well, AIG is regulated by about 200 regulators. The Fed is simply the designated
enterprise-wide one as a result of the SIFI designation.
To-date, they've been an extremely constructive coordinator of those regulators and have prioritized derisking exactly
along the lines that management would have done already. So, we see them as a very highly-aligned regulator with our
intentions to create a robust balance sheet to serve our clients.
The amendment to – the Collins Amendment, that occurred in the first quarter, which allowed the Fed to treat insurance
companies differently from banks, was a significant positive, in our view, in terms of the potential risk that future
application of the SIFI regulation would be detrimental. So, we are still awaiting greater clarity on exactly how SIFI
rules will be applied in the future. But so far, as I've said, they've been extremely constructive.
But the discussion of the off-ramp certainly means that there is a strategic question to be answered at some point down
the road as to whether, in the light of however those rules get applied and formulated, whether the optimal path is to not
be a SIFI. And as we think about the criteria for SIFI designation, it's really important that we recognize that it is not
simply size of assets. It's a multi-dimensional set of parameters, most of which we look very good on.
So, the other thing to remember is, should you get off this off-ramp, there are 200 other regulators that are also very
interested in how we run the company. So, it's not clear to me getting off that – an off-ramp changes management's
flexibility in any material way.
<Q - Randy Binner>: I appreciate that, but a quick follow-up. If there were a structural change in the company split, is
there any color or guidance you could give us on what the status of the NOL would be if, say, for instance, AIG became
a Life and a P&C company or domestic, international, whatever the split is, would that NOL be structurally in place
after that?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: I think we explained in probably quite enough detail in the shareholder's letter that there
would be significant tax – negative tax consequences or something like that.
<A - David L. Herzog>: And that language will also be included in the 10-Q.
<Q - Randy Binner>: All right. Thank you.

And next we'll hear from Brian Meredith, UBS.
<Q - Brian Robert Meredith>: Yeah. Good morning. Two questions here for you. The first one, just for John, I'm just
curious, can you talk a little bit about your strategy in the property insurance lines? You've had some good growth there
although we continue to see pretty significant rate decreases. Is it where you're attracted the business, just better
underlying loss ratios? Can you tell a little bit about that?
<A - John Q. Doyle>: Sure, Brian. So the real rate pressure in the Property market is really in the Cat market. And it's
in the wholesale market here in London, it's in the United States, the growth that we've seen in the last couple of years
has been around getting into the middle market in Property, which we were not a player in in many markets around the
world. It was also entering the large limit space as well.

We've made a very meaningful investment over the course of the last several years in our engineering capabilities. In
fact, we've hired over 500 engineers in the last four years and are now winning largely non-Cat business due to our
engineering capability, which I can tell you is not the reason why we won property business going back some time. So,
our analytics and capability in helping our clients manage their property-related cost of risk over time is the key there.
What I would also share with you is that outside of a couple of major markets, primarily the United States and the
United Kingdom, we chose to operate historically, I'm not quite sure why, but chose to operate in a subscale way. So,
our risk appetite in many other countries around the world was set by that country really trying to manage to a result, a
P&L result for that country.
So, we've increased our risk appetite in many smaller countries around the world. And beyond that being attractive
business for us from a Property perspective, it's also changed who we are to our customers in those markets. In many
countries outside of the United States, the commercial business is really a property-led market. And as we've improved
our capability there, our customer sees us in an entirely different way, and it positions in the future to write the casualty
and other specialty lines of business, unlike we had in the past.
<Q - Brian Robert Meredith>: I'm curious. Is any of the increase also because of the new wrap model? Does that
make the property look more attractive than the casualty?
<A - John Q. Doyle>: Sure. Yeah. Low rates and our wrap model – wrap – yeah, low interest rates. Thank you, Peter.
Not premiums. Not risk rates. So, lower interest rates and the wrap model is what's guiding, really of our strategies.
We're pursuing value, not volume. So, that's had a fair amount to it.
I guess one other factor, not so much this year over prior year, although, it played a little bit of a role, is lower
reinsurance cost over the course of the last several years as well. So you're observing really net premium written
increases.
<Q - Brian Robert Meredith>: Got you. And just one quick one for David. I'm just curious, on the DIB, you talked
about it's going to be I guess going away next quarter. Where are those results going to be reported? And I think you
also said that $2 billion of capital are going to be freed up from the DIB. Does that mean we're pretty much done with
the DIB as far as additional capital being freed up going forward?
<A - David L. Herzog>: A couple of things, Brian. The assets that will be freed up, some of it may be cash, may be
securities. We would look to report those in our financial supplement in the other invested assets. There's a schedule in
there. So you'll be able to see where those assets are because we still will get earnings off of those assets.
So you'll see the assets there and then it'll be in the Other line. And we'll make sure there's enough transparency around
the earnings results, so that you're able to see what the assets are, what the yields are. So there will be about $2 billion
that will come out in the very near term.
The other aspect of assets in the Direct Investment Book, Global Capital Markets are the residual interests in the
Maiden Lane III investment, and I know the team is working hard to likewise free that up. Now there are a lot of capital
requirements associated with that, but nonetheless, it does give us more flexibility by having that asset outside of the
Direct Investment Book. And then that asset would monetize in the normal course over the next several years. If we
choose to try to do something on an accelerated basis, that will be a discussion for another day.
<Q - Brian Robert Meredith>: Great. Thank you.
<A - David L. Herzog>: You're welcome.

<Q - Jay Arman Cohen>: Yes. Thank you. Just a quick follow up on Brian's question, that is, I seem to recall there
was about, I don't know, $6 billion to $7 billion of equity at the DIB, is that right?
<A - David L. Herzog>: Yes. That was – there was about $7 billion at the end of the year, and when we file our 10-Q
in the next day or so, you can expect to see about the same amount, and it's – and then again, you'll see an update to that
in the second quarter.
<Q - Jay Arman Cohen>: And the capital that gets freed up, I assume that's unencumbered, that you can do with what
you want at the corporate level?
<A - David L. Herzog>: Well, yes, it is unencumbered, but it would be then – we'll look at it like we do other available
or deployable capital in the context of the facts and circumstances at the time.
<Q - Jay Arman Cohen>: That's great. And then, David, for you another one. I seem to recall you mentioning that for
the rest of the year, you would expect the insurance to send to the holding company another $5 billion to $6 billion. Is
that – did I hear that right?
<A - David L. Herzog>: You did.
<Q - Jay Arman Cohen>: And that's in addition to what you did in the first quarter?
<A - David L. Herzog>: Yes.
<Q - Jay Arman Cohen>: So now, we're talking north of $8 billion.
<A - David L. Herzog>: Yeah, that's about the way the math works.
<Q - Jay Arman Cohen>: Okay. And then lastly, if you could just give us what you think the – assuming no more
debt capital management, the quarterly run rate for your corporate interest, that would be helpful, given all the changes
that occurred there.
<A - David L. Herzog>: Well, you can see that in the financial supplement, I think it was about – I want to say $275
million or so, this particular quarter. I think that's right. So, yeah, it was about $275 million in this quarter, in the
second quarter. We'll – again, on page 13 of the financial supplement, you will be able to see that. And I – again, that
may be down slightly given the timing of what we did. And again, you'll see the changes to that going forward. But,
again, we'll be opportunistic about how we deploy the capital and the remaining access or any future access to the
capital markets. They've been – the debt capital markets have been open, and we've taken advantage of what we believe
to cost-effective capital.
<Q - Jay Arman Cohen>: Yeah. It looks like some well-timed issuance. Thanks for the answers.
<A - David L. Herzog>: You're welcome.
Operator
And we'll now hear from Tom Gallagher, Credit Suisse.
<Q - Thomas George Gallagher>: Good morning. David, just one last follow-up to the last few questions about the
DIB capital. So, the $2 billion, you said that's already been freed up, the $2 billion of DIB and GCM Capital, so that's
already been taken out or are you planning to take it out shortly?
<A - David L. Herzog>: No. It'll – no, Tom, it will be done in the second quarter. So, it's not currently out. So, as I
said, when we file the 10-Q, you'll see in the disclosure about the Direct Investment Book, Global Capital Markets.
When you look at the net asset value that will be reported at that point in time, it is still in there. And as I said, in the
second quarter, i.e. now, we will move upwards of $2 billion out and then get to work on the – on an additional
extraction which would be principally the Maiden Lane III notes.

<Q - Thomas George Gallagher>: And what – and I assume the $2 billion would be counted as non-core and I think
you've been pretty clear with that. So, that could be additive to your $6 billion authorization if you determine that's the
appropriate use for it. I just want to make sure I should be adding the $2 billion on top of what you've already
announced?
<A - David L. Herzog>: It would be incremental to that. The dividends and distribution and our – the dividends and
distributions that I commented on were not subject to monetization of non-core assets. And the 2015 capital plan that
we – that management prepared and reviewed with our board and other various stakeholders was not contingent upon
the monetization of non-core assets.
<Q - Thomas George Gallagher>: And the Maiden Lane opportunity in terms of how much that could end up
harvesting, is that something we should plan on within this calendar year as well?
<A - David L. Herzog>: I'm not going to comment on that, Tom. It would be unencumbered, but I don't want to
comment on what we may or may not do.
<Q - Thomas George Gallagher>: Okay. And then just two other quick ones if I could. The core earnings definition
to get you to the 7.8% ROE this quarter, did that include the $0.08 of gains from the legacy real estate investments?
And if so, should we really be thinking about that as part of core, or should we be stripping it out?
<A - David L. Herzog>: Well, we – well, first of all, on the normalization in our definition of operating income, we
give the disclosure around the normalizations in the spirit of transparency. So, we're not redefining our principal
non-GAAP measure of operating income. The real estate is a – it may be legacy or it may be long-standing, but it is not
non-core. Those are investments that we make in the normal course and we consider them part of the operating income.
Now, they're going to be lumpy. They're going to vary from period to period. And so, again, we don't expect the same
kind or the same level of mark or the same level of monetization. And so, some portion of that, you can view it
however you'd like to view it. We view in total over a long period of time, that's part of the return on those invested
assets.
<Q - Thomas George Gallagher>: But I guess my question related to that, is there a pool of sizeable real estate
investments that could be harvested over multiple years that we should be thinking about as sort of a sustainable source
of gains that you would have there, or was this unusually large?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: I think that you should think about it in the broader context of our private equity and
alternative investment portfolio, some of which is held within the statutory balance sheet, some of which is held at the
holding company. And so, that is in the Fin Sup, and it totals about $35 billion. And so, the real estate portion of that is
about $4.5 billion. And we have an expected return on that entire portfolio, which we then normalize above or below
when we come up with our ROE calculation. So, I wouldn't think of it as any different than the alternatives.
<Q - Thomas George Gallagher>: That's helpful, Peter. And just one last quick one. I noticed you showed catastrophe
budget and earnings normalizing for catastrophes. That's the first time I've noticed that. Can you comment on what
your full year Cat load budget would be for 2015?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: We haven't done that, and I think that we would – had a substantial seasonality to it. And so,
I would treat it with a high degree of caution because which quarter the Cat hits in obviously is very sensitive to that.
But you do obviously have a whole lot more in wind season. But as we know, Super Storm Sandy just happened to fall
in the fourth quarter. So you got some – you got to be careful before you do that. We have not disclosed the full year
numbers. Short answer.
<Q - Thomas George Gallagher>: Okay. Thanks.

<Q - Meyer Shields>: Thanks. Good morning. Going back really quickly to the Global Capital Markets and the DIB,
is there any sort of run rate of income that we should anticipate this providing in the future?
<A - David L. Herzog>: As I've said, this is David. As I've said in the past, we would expect on that pool of assets or
pool of net assets somewhere between an 8% to 10% pre-tax return on the NAV overall. It's a reasonable proxy. It's not
that simple by any stretch of the imagination, but it gives you a signal of what our expectation is. And so, that'll give
you a sense of it.
<Q - Meyer Shields>: Okay. That's helpful. I didn't know whether that had changed. And then really quickly, John,
you talked about anticipating 100 to 200 basis points of I think it was core or adjusted loss ratio improvement. What's
the anticipated aggregate loss cost that's been baked into that?
<A - John Q. Doyle>: We do that obviously by product and geography. There's a pretty meaningful range. We haven't
disclosed an aggregate number to-date, but we obviously look at that when – and our actual rate activity and other
underwriting actions that we take when we make loss picks and loss-pick adjustments on a quarter-to-quarter basis. So,
that's obviously factored in then to what – the 100 to 200 basis point improvement is the accident year loss ratio this
year compared – as adjusted compared to prior year.
<Q - Meyer Shields>: Okay. That's fair. One last question if I can. The adverse development on commercial auto
liability, is that actual claim emergence or was that the product of an actuarial review?
<A - David L. Herzog>: No, it's auto is – relative to the rest of our portfolio in commercials, relatively short-tail lines,
so it's largely related to recent emergence and there was an increase in both frequency and severity, some underlying
economic strengths that led to it. So, it wasn't a detailed reserve review but emergence that we observed over the course
of the last few months and felt like we needed to take action on. So, of course, we're taking underwriting action as well
and with pricing, attachment points and the like and adjusting our underwriting approach as we look forward as well, it
will take a little bit of time, obviously, for those actions to turn in, but that is still factored into the underwriting
improvement that I anticipate during the course of this year.
<Q - Meyer Shields>: Okay, great. Thanks very much.
Operator
Thank you. We'll now hear from Josh Stirling, Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Josh C. Stirling>: Hey, good morning, and thank you for taking my call. So listen, Peter, I was looking at the
proxy, and you have a few different measures of how you measure executive performance. One of them is really
interesting. I think you called it contributive normalized ROE for the different segments, Commercial and Consumer.
And if I understand it correctly, I think it's intending to back out noise from Cats and alternatives and such normalized,
but also to back out the strategic investments, which are currently a big drag on your current earnings. And if I'm
reading it right, it's says your – absent all those things, your target right now for Commercial is about 16% ROE and
something like 26% in Consumer.
I was curious if you could help us think through how we should think about these in the context of both sort of reported
numbers and the long-term goals, which are obviously much lower, but also just maybe make it simple. I know this is a
long way off given all the investments, but can we kind of look at these as the targets that you're hoping to deliver once
you finish investing and start realizing the benefits of all the efforts to fix P&C?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: The proxy obviously is backward looking, and with the new Operating Committee, I have
had the chance to align the entire leadership team around the stated public goals that we disclosed in the last conference
call. So, I think in next year's proxy, you'll see a much clearer alignment between our publicly stated goals and the way
we pay people in the short term.

The long-term incentive is unchanged and is linked to shares leveraged up and down based on our total shareholder
return relative to a peer group, as well as our ability to maintain our credit default swap spreads within a range of our
peers, so that we are never tempted to over lever our balance sheets in the pursuit of short-term unsustainable
shareholder returns.
<Q - Josh C. Stirling>: Okay. If I can ask a separate question on capital then. I think, David, last year, I think you
itemized that in addition to core dividends based on earnings from Life and P&C, the shareholders could count on
liquidity from all the non-core assets, DIB , AerCap, et cetera, the DTA as being available for further buybacks? If we
take a long-term view, and I think this is probably, Peter, for you, I mean, math would suggest that all adds up to $50
billion or more over, say, five years. As we think about the long-term future of AIG, balancing the risk models and the
conversations with all the 200 regulators, as well as your guys own growth ambitions for organic and acquisitions, how
much of that free capital which you're going to generate do you think that we ought to imagine you're going to return to
investors?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: I think that it really is dependent on market opportunities. We've had a very benign capital
markets environment the last six, seven years since the crisis. I think that our clients depend on us to be there through
good times and bad. I think acquisition opportunities become more attractive in downturns than they do at the top of the
market.
And I think that we have some very attractive organic growth opportunities as we rebuild our international Life
business focused on the largest and fastest growing markets in the UK, Japan and China. And the opportunities for
supplemental health in a number of markets is attractive as well. Laya is obviously a small, but meaningful signal of
our ambitions there.
We are extremely focused on returning our excess capital to shareholders in the most efficient way possible. So,
through buybacks when we feel that we're trading below intrinsic and through dividends once we are trading above;
and a combination of the two once we're above. So I wouldn't hazard a guess as to what percentage of your number, not
mine, $50 billion we might do, but that's the general gist of our philosophy.
<Q - Josh C. Stirling>: Okay. Thanks, Peter. Good luck.
<A - Elizabeth A. Werner>: Operator, I think we have time for one more. If we can take one more question and then,
hopefully, reach out to everybody who is in our queue.
Operator
Thank you. And we'll take our last question from Josh Shanker, Deutsche Bank. Mr. Shanker, your line is open. You
may be on mute.
<Q - Josh D. Shanker>: Thank you. Thank you. Sorry about that. Two quickies. The general operating since last year
seemed much lower in the first quarter than the three that followed. Is there a seasonality to that or should we expect
that to flatten out over time?
<A - David L. Herzog>: There's generally a seasonality to it and a lot of it's related to project spend or compensation
accruals, et cetera. Peter, do you want to jump in to that as well?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: Yeah. Seasonality would just suggest that it repeats itself from year to year. And I'd just say
I'd use the word lumpy. And so, you're looking for the trend over time as opposed to any single quarter. We've got
projects which come in, as said, and then we've got severance that comes in sometimes. So, there's various things which
will make it lumpy.
<Q - Josh D. Shanker>: That's fine. And I just want to follow-up quickly on Randy Binner's question about regulators.
I understand that the board of directors approved the $3.5 billion authorization yesterday. To understand the
relationship with the Fed prior to the SIFI rules being codified, to what extent are they aware and to what extent have
you had their tacit understanding about your capital management plan?

<A - Peter D. Hancock>: We're very transparent with the Fed at every stage. They sit in on our board meetings. They
certainly scrutinize our capital plan. We have the right to amend our capital plan. They are very focused on making sure
the governance on how we amend or change our capital plan through time is done appropriately. And I think that, in
terms of constructive feedback from the Fed, they've been very focused on the operational integrity of how we generate
our stress tests that help determine our capital adequacy, and we've made a lot of progress in tightening that up.
So I'd say it's a very constructive engagement to make sure that we are prudent and measured in the way we return
capital.
