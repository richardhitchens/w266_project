To begin with our 12-week first quarter of fiscal 2016, for the quarter, our reported earnings per share came in at $1.09,
$0.03 below last year's reported figure of $1.12. There are several items of note, six to be exact, that impacted this
year-over-year comparison of Q1 earnings.
First, FX, in the first quarter, deferred currencies where we operate were weaker year over year versus the U.S. dollar
primarily in Canada, Mexico and Korea such that foreign earnings in Q1 when converted into U.S. dollars for reporting
purposes were lower by approximately $42 million or $0.10 a share than those earnings would've been, had FX
exchange rates been flat year over year.
The big weakness has started about a year ago. While, I certainly don't know what's going to happen tomorrow and
there's been continued weakness. Certainly, the biggest impacts look like the last four quarters. One of the benefits of
course is it has made purchasing land and building units in some of these countries little cheaper over the last year.
Number two, stock compensation expense was $36 million higher year over year in the first quarter or $0.05 a share.
We have over 4,600 people who receive restricted stock units. For many of them, it is a significant part of their annual
compensation. These grants are made annually each October in our fiscal first quarter. While these grants typically vest
over five-year period, accelerated vesting occurs when a recipient reaches 25, 30 and 35 years of employment with the
company. So factors driving this $36 million increase included additional levels of accelerated vesting given the rising
number of employees achieving long tenure with the company. This by the way is most impactful each Q1 given our
October RSU grant cycle; two, appreciation in our stock price; and of course, the larger number of employees in the
plants.
I'd like to note that because of the significant price appreciation or stock this past year, this year's annual RSU grant
which occurred in late October was reduced by an average of 12%. That is the number of RSUs granted to each
recipient. So while there was a $36 million year-over-year increase in Q1, the upcoming second, third and fourth
quarters of this fiscal year, the anticipated year-over-year increases are estimated to be about a third of this dollar
amount in each of the fiscal quarters. So, $0.01 to $0.02 earnings year-over-year impact each quarter – second, third
and fourth quarters versus the $0.05 a share impact in Q1.
Third point I'd like to note, there are two SG&A items that together negatively impacted this year's Q1 earnings. In the
first quarter, we recorded a $22 million charge related to two non-recurring legal and regulatory matters. The $22
million figure represented an eight basis point at SG&A and impacted our first quarter earnings per share by $0.04.
Point number four, IT modernization. As discussed in each of the past many quarters over a couple of years now, our
major IT modernization efforts continue to impact our SG&A expense percentages, especially as new systems are
placed into service and depreciation begins. In the first quarter, on an incremental year-over-year basis, these costs have
impacted SG&A by an estimated $20 million pre-tax or seven basis points – six basis points without gas deflation
which was about $0.03 hit to earnings in the quarter versus last year.
Point number five, last year in the first quarter we did call out that we had a $17 million benefit to gross margin related
to a non-recurring legal settlement so that benefited last year's first quarter by $0.03 a share.
And lastly, point number six, our co-branded credit card transition in the U.S. As you know when we transition into a
new co-branded credit card relationship in the U.S. next year, as we wind down our current relationship, new co-brand
signups have greatly slowed and in fact are now ceased. The short-term negative impact relates to moneys we earn for
new co-brand signups. Year over year in Q1, this represented a $15 million or $0.02 per share hit to our earnings. This
will continue to be a small negative impact to earnings in quarters two and three and possibly into Q4 based on timing,
at which time I'll be able to better outline how the new relationships should directionally impact our future results and
the future rewards to our members under the new co-branded credit card program. I look forward to sharing more
information at that time.
So six items of note; I added it up. It's about $0.27 of impact to our year-over-year earnings comparison. I know many
of these things you may have in your numbers and I know some of you don't.

Turning to our first quarter sales. In terms of sales for the quarter, our 12-week reported comp sales figure for Q1
showed a minus 1% decrease, plus 2% in the U.S., minus 9% in Canada, and minus 5% in other international. As we
stated in our release, if you take out the two big impacts of gas price deflation year over year and the impact of negative
FX, the plus 2% reported U.S. comp would have been a plus 6% for the first quarter, the minus 9% in Canada would
have been a plus 9%, and the minus 5% other international would have been a plus 7% such that the minus 1% reported
comp would have been a plus 6%.
And as we reported last Wednesday, in our November sales results for the four-week ended month ended November
29th, our comp sales increase excluding the impact of FX in gas was similar to the 12-week first fiscal quarter. The
total company comp increase of 6% and again ex-gas and FX in the U.S. a plus 6%, in Canada a plus 8%, in other
international a plus 7%.
In terms of opening activities and plans, we opened 13 new locations in Q1 Including two relos for a net of 11 new
warehouses during the quarter which ended November 22nd. That included seven in the U.S., one in Canada, one in
Australia, our eighth in that country, one in Japan, our 24th in Japan; and our second in Spain just outside of Madrid
and Getafe. That's our second unit in Spain. Two relocated locations were at Woodland Hills, California and Teterboro,
New Jersey.
In the second quarter, we had two new business centers planned to open, one each in Westminster, California; and in
Hackensack, New Jersey. And for all of fiscal 2016 we have a current plan to open up 32 net new locations. That could
come down a little bit based on timing as we get into the second half of the year, a few may be delayed but that's our
current plan. Of those assuming we were able to do all 32, 22 of them would be in the U.S., three in Canada, two each
in Japan and Australia and one each in the UK, Taiwan and Spain. Later in the call I will review with you our
e-commerce activities, our membership trends, additional discussion about gross margin and SG&A in Q1 and recent
stock purchase activities.
Again, very briefly, sales for the quarter reported were up 1.3% to $26.6 billion up from $26.3 billion a year ago.
Again, on a comp basis, reported number was down 1%, but ex-gas and FX was up 6%. For the quarter, our minus 1%
reported comp sales results were a combination of an average transaction size down 4% for the quarter. Again, taking
out gas and FX, it would be up 3% excluding those items, and an average shopping frequency of about 3.5% for the
quarter.
In terms of sales comparisons by geography, geographically for Q1, the better operating performing regions in the U.S.
were all three regions in California and the Midwest as well. Internationally, in local currencies, the better performing
countries were Australia, Taiwan, Mexico and Canada.
In terms of merchandise categories for the quarter, during the quarter which we look at September, October and
November, excluding FX and gas, within food and sundries which were up in the mid-single-digits year over year,
sundries, meat deli and spirits were the relative stand outs. Our hardline sales were up in the mid to high single digits
for the quarter. Majors or electronics came in positive for the quarter in the low double digit range. In addition to
electronics, better performing departments included hardware and garden/patio. Within the mid-single-digit softline
comps, our domestics, women's apparel and home furnishings were standouts. And in fresh foods where our comp sales
were in the mid to high single digits, produce was at the top of the four sub categories.
Moving down the line items on the income statement, membership fees. In the first quarter, membership fees were up
2% and 2 basis points, were up $11 million coming in at $593 million versus $582 million a year ago. Again, without
FX, the dollars would have been up 6%. I noticed in several of the preliminary notes from some of the sell side analysts
out there, they had expressed some questions about the strength in membership. And I might point out a couple of
things. In addition to being up 6% ex-FX, on a cash basis there was about another percentage point higher than these
numbers. As well, anecdotally, a year ago, we did a couple of things outside with social media which we didn't do,
small impact year over year, but something versus nothing.
In terms of membership, we continue to benefit from good sign-ups at existing and new locations, continued increasing
penetration of our $110 a year Executive Membership, and strong renewal rates at 91% – averaging up to 91% in the

U.S. and Canada and averaging up to 88% worldwide. Our new membership sign-ups in Q1 year over year,
company-wide, were up 7%.
In terms of members at Q1 end, Gold Star was – came in at the quarter end at 34.7 million, up from 34.0 million at year
end; Primary Business, 7.2 million at quarter end versus 7.1 million a quarter ago; Business Add-on remained at 3.5
million. So total memberships of 45.4 million at quarter end, up from 44.6 million, and including extra cards, 82.7
million cards out there versus 81.3 million, 12 weeks earlier.
At Q1 end, paid Executive Memberships came in at 16.4 million, which was an increase of 307,000, or 26,000 new
Executive Members increase each week in the 12-week fiscal first quarter. As you know, Executive Members are over
a third of our member base and over two-thirds of our sales in those countries where Executive Membership is
available.
In terms of renewal rates; in the U.S. and Canada, at quarter-end, we were at 90.6%, rounded up to 90.6%. We rounded
it down to 90.5% at the end of Q1. That's the impact that I mentioned a quarter ago in Canada with having to re-sign-up
the members with a new credit card program, a de novo program. That was a little – small of an impact. And I think
there was a little negative in the U.S. perhaps based on what I said earlier. Total worldwide remained at 87.8% at
quarter-end and at fiscal year-end.
Going down the gross margin line; our reported gross margin in the quarter was up 26 basis points coming in at
11.29%, up from 11.03%. As you know, gas deflation is a big impact of these figures, so I'll give you a couple of
numbers. I'll ask you to write down the normal four columns. For all of fiscal 2015, columns one and two would be
reported, and then without gas deflation; and then, two columns for Q1 2016 reported and without gas deflation. And,
of course, these basis point figures are the year-over-year change from a year ago.
Merchandise core reported was plus 11 basis points for all of fiscal 2015, but without gas deflation was minus 12 basis
points year over year; for Q1, it was plus 24 basis points and minus three basis points. Ancillary businesses for the year,
plus 29 basis points and plus 23 basis points; for the quarter, plus 11 basis points and plus four basis points. 2%
Reward, minus four basis points and minus 2 basis points; and for the quarter, minus three basis points and minus one
basis point. LIFO for all of last year was a 5 basis point pick up both for reported and without deflation; and for the
quarter, it was plus one basis points and plus one basis points. Others, last – for the whole of last year, plus 2 basis
points reported and plus one basis points without gas deflation; and this year that non-recurring legal settlement
impacted gross margin, that benefited gross margin a year ago, such that it was minus seven basis points reported and
minus seven basis points without gas deflation.
You add up those columns for all of fiscal 2015, reported gross margin was up 43 basis points, but up 15 basis points
ex-gas deflation; this year Q1, reported up 26 basis points, but without gas deflation minus six basis points, with minus
seven basis points of that minus six basis points being the one-time benefit a year ago. So again, overall, those are the
numbers.
In terms of core gross margins, which is the core business, food and sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods, as a
percent of their own sales, they were positive year over year in Q1 by 13 basis points and they were higher year over
year across all four of these merchandise categories with both hardlines and softlines showing stronger year-over-year
improvement than the year-over-year improvement in food and sundries and fresh foods. But nonetheless, all four were
positive year over year.
Ancillary and other business gross margin up 11 basis points on a reported basis, up four basis points without gas
deflation in the quarter. Many of these businesses, gas, pharmacy, food court, hearing aids and mini-labs, all showed
higher year-over-year gross margins as a percent of their own sales. Offsetting this a little was slightly lower
e-commerce gross margins, but, overall, a net positive there. The 2% reward was higher year over year due to higher
sales penetrations for Executive Members. This impacted gross margin in Q1 by three basis points to the negative, one
basis point of negative ex-gas.
LIFO, last year at Q1, we had a $2 million credit representing slight deflation in the U.S. inventory pools and a credit of
$5 million this year, also relatively small, but a net pick up of one basis point year over year in terms of that recovery.

Lastly, I mentioned the quarterly adjustment, a seven basis point hit in terms of the comparison, benefiting a
non-recurring benefit last year versus nothing this year. So overall, gross margins excluding gas were down six basis
points year over year, but up one basis point excluding that one-year charge – that non-recurring benefit from last year.
Moving on to SG&A. Our SG&A percentages Q1 over Q1 were higher by 28 basis points coming in at 10.54% this
year versus 10.26% last year, but excluding gas deflation, were lower or better by 2 basis points. I'll go in some detail
and you'll see that the core expense components of that actually were pretty good.
So again, four columns, columns one and two would be fiscal 2015 the year reported and without gas deflation, and
then columns three and four would be Q1 2016 reported and without gas deflation. First line item, core operations,
minus six basis points reported and plus 16 basis points without deflation for all of last year on a year-over-year basis;
in Q1, 0 basis point and plus 26 basis points. Central, minus seven basis points and minus five basis points for the year
and minus eight basis points and minus six basis points for the quarter. Stock compensation minus five basis points and
minus four basis points for the year and minus 12 basis points and minus 10 basis points for the quarter. Quarterly
adjustments, nothing last year, in columns one and two; this year minus eight basis points and minus eight basis points.
That represents that $22 million item that I mentioned early on.
So total, last year for the year over year we reported SG&A up or minus 18 basis points and without gas deflation better
or lower, so plus seven basis points. This year higher by 28 basis points so minus 28 basis points in the quarter reported
and without deflation plus 2 basis points.
Within operations, again, without deflation showed plus 26 basis points or lower by 26 basis points. Within that, our
core warehouse payroll was better year over year in the mid to high single digits. Benefits were lower or better in the
high single digits. And a combination of other expenses, a variety of them were better by or lower by 10 basis points
year over year. So again, kind of the core controlled operating expenses were all in pretty good shape this quarter.
Central expense was higher year over year by minus eight basis points or minus six basis points without gas. As I
mentioned earlier in the call, increased IT spending related to modernization showed higher year over year costs of
seven basis points, six basis points without gas deflation.
I already mentioned earlier the stock compensation, which was 12 basis points or 10 basis points without deflation. I
also mentioned that, again, because of certainly the stock price increase, but also importantly the fact that there's more
and more employees hitting 25 years service and in some cases 30 years service even in a few cases 35 years service
because they started back at Price Club, the total impact for the year, more than half of it based on our estimates is the
impact in Q1, with about a third or less of that amount in each of the upcoming three quarters year over year. So it's
still going to be higher year over year, but not as high as that increase was in Q1.
Finally, quarterly adjustments, again related to the $22 million non-recurring legal and regulatory items that I
discussed. So overall, good expense control, other plenty of things and hopefully I've been able to elaborate, shed some
light on the components of that.
Moving down the income statement, pre-opening expense was higher by $11 million or four basis points higher. We
had nine openings last year including one relocation, 13 this year including two. There are other preopening items in
terms of countries and some other things, but overall no big surprises there.
All told, reported operating income in Q1 was down $3 million, from $770 million last year to $767 million this year.
Below operating income, reported interest expense in Q1 came in at $33 million versus $26 million a year ago, so
lower by $7 million. Interest income itself was lower year over year by about $4 million, and the other component was
lower by $3 million year over year. That's primarily related to various FX-related transactions. Sometimes that's a
positive; sometimes that's a negative, never that meaningful for the year in its entirety, generally.
Overall, reported pre-tax income was down 2% versus last year, coming in at $762 million, down from $779 million
pre-tax a year ago. Again, several items impacted the year-over-year earnings comparison, which I discussed earlier in
the call.

In terms of tax rates, our corporate income tax rate this quarter was up about a percentage point, coming in at 36.1%
compared to last year's first quarter rate of 35.2%. The higher tax rate year over year resulted from a few discrete items
going to the increasing tax rate, not reducing it, and to a little extent lower earnings penetration from our foreign
country operations where tax rates are generally lower than our income tax rates for the United States.
Now for a quick rundown of other topics, the balance sheet, as has been in the recent past, is included in today's press
release. I'll point out a couple of items. Depreciation and amortization for Q1 came in at $271 million. Accounts
payable as a percent of inventory on a reported basis was pretty much the same year over year. Last year it was 101%,
this year 100%. Taking out non-merchandise payables, last year non-merchandise payables as a percent of inventories
was 92%, this year at quarter end it was 90%. Average inventory per warehouse on a reported basis was up a little over
3% or $524,000 to $14.9 million. Again, ex-FX, it would have been up about 6.5%, up $960,000 assuming flat FX.
About $250,000 is electronics and what we call majors and about $160,000 is apparel, both built up inventory heading
into the Thanksgiving week, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday. As you could have extrapolated from our November
reporting, where we reported the four weeks of November, the 12-week first quarter and a 13-week retail reporting
calendar of four weeks, five weeks, four weeks, the implication there of course was that the last week, which is really
the first week of Q2, which is Thanksgiving week, was pretty strong. The balance of the departments have been selling
well like hardware, housewares, and toys, so really no issues of inventory levels going into the last few weeks before
calendar year end. We're in pretty good shape.
In terms of CapEx, in Q1 we spent a little over $700 million and our estimate for the year is most likely CapEx will be
in the high $2 billions, say $2.8 billion to $3 billion. This compares to CapEx last fiscal year of $2.4 billion.
In terms of dividends, our quarterly dividend continues at $0.40 a share or $1.60 annualized. This represents a total
annual cost to the company of around $700 million. In terms of stock buybacks in Q1, we bought back a total of
898,000 shares for $130 million, so an average price of $144.88.
Next topic, Costco Online. We're now in five countries, having launched Korea November 10. We're in the U.S.,
Canada, UK, Mexico, and Korea. For the first quarter sales and profits were up over last year. Q1 e-commerce total
sales were up 15%. On a comp basis, a total and comp basis up 19% on a comp basis excluding FX. And again, it
represents a little over 3% of our sales. We've been asked a lot about, again the week of Thanksgiving, Black Friday,
Cyber Monday, you name it. E-commerce sales were quite strong, up 28% and up over 30% in local currencies.
New initiatives, again, it was a few years ago that we re-platformed the sites. We've continued to improve our mobile
apps and there's room to grow, but they're a lot better than they used to be. Combined, similar e-commerce merchandise
efforts with our in line efforts. We've added a few categories like apparel, HABA [Health and Beauty Aids], and KS
items. We've greatly improved timing of shipments by shipping out of more than just one depot across the country. And
again, we'll expect to see e-commerce in other international markets in the future.
In terms of some of the others out there that are buying from us, we continue to provide merchandise for sale on
Google Shopping Express. This is now being offered in six markets. The Bay Area has recently been expanded, L.A.,
Manhattan, and more recently Chicago, D.C., and Boston. We've increased our offerings in categories and currently
testing fresh foods available in a limited group in each of the San Francisco and L.A. markets. We're also providing
merchandise to Instacart now in 16 markets throughout the United States, boxed in three markets. And we're also doing
some business with Jet.com in the three cities where they have their distribution centers.
Outside of here, Alibaba Tmall, we currently offer just over 200 SKUs on the Tmall site, with a heavy emphasis on
Kirkland Signature items. It's going well, and we're certainly building some recognition for the Costco and the Kirkland
Signature names. We had a very successful Singles Day on Alibaba Tmall, receiving over 300,000 orders.
Next on the discussion list, expansion; again, last year, we opened net new units of 23, so it's about 3.5% square
footage growth. This year, again, plans for up to 32 units. If we achieve that, it would be about 5% square footage
growth, and I already mentioned where those would be. Also, as of Q1 end, some of you want to know what our square
footage is; at Q1 end, it stood at 100,547,000 square feet.

With that, I'll turn it back to Brandy and be happy to open it up for questions. Thank you.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Charles Grom with Sterne Agee.
<Q - Charles P. Grom>: Hey, Richard. Thanks a lot. First question, just a lot of moving parts with some of the
one-time items. And I know you guys don't give guidance anymore, but I'd be curious how the quarter overall
performed relative to the expectations that you would have budgeted back in August?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: We beat them.
<Q - Charles P. Grom>: You beat them? Okay.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yes.
<Q - Charles P. Grom>: Second question, when you look at new member sign-ups, how has the trend been by age
group? I'm curious of your ability to track younger customers given the success of Prime and other programs out there.
Have you guys started to look at the sign-ups by age group, et cetera?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: We have. I don't have the most current month's detail, but from a month ago at budget
meeting – we're getting – first of all, the average age of a Costco member has come down. I think a few years ago we
were about four years older than the average in the U.S., now we're a little under two years older. About a third of our
new sign-ups in recent months have been millennials and I'll make a point to provide a little more color on that each
quarterly earnings release.
<Q - Charles P. Grom>: Okay. And then last question from me, just on the gross margin, it's the first time in a long
time that all four categories have been positive. I'm just curious if you could provide a little color maybe by category.
What's driving that?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I think the one that's historically in the last many quarters that's always the one that's a little
volatile, and volatile is mostly defined as down year over year, is fresh foods. And that has to do with the fact that as
commodity prices have increased, we maintained prices, no doubt things like rotisserie chickens and the like.
I think there's been a little bit of deflation in some of those categories and some meat, but also our volumes are
particularly strong. When you've got a low double-digit comp – and produce is an example, that's going to help you
because sales are strong, availability of products is good, and spoilage is less. So those are the types of things that help
you in fresh foods. I think the strength in electronics has probably helped us. Those are the things that come to mind. I
don't have a – organics is helping. Organics, as I've mentioned before, is kind of a win-win for us. We get for us a fuller
margin, a more fair margin within the confines of what we limit ourselves to, and in our view, creates even a greater
competitive mode given that that's where sometimes retailers will try to make more.
<Q - Charles P. Grom>: And your organic penetration stands at what at the current time?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Organics – well, it's $4 billion plus, it's still growing very strongly, but I don't have the
detail in front of me. Sorry.
<Q - Charles P. Grom>: That's all right. Okay, great. Thank you.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: One other point on the softlines, I know – our apparel has been pretty strong too in terms
of apparel basics. And so that's generally a full margin business.

And your next question is from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.
<Q - John Heinbockel>: So, Richard, a question on the fresh food deflation, right, as we – and I guess maybe it
behaves a little bit differently by category, but if you think about meat and dairy in particular, is that less of a benefit to
you margin-wise and more of a volume benefit in term – just because you pass the declining prices through more
quickly than most of your competitors by design. And so it's probably more of a help to volume than margin or not?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yes, it's more of a help to volume. If anything, we'll bring the price down and we'll always
err to the low side. So if we have a calculated margin that's – I'm making the numbers up, but $8.15 a pound, it's going
be $7.99. So you have all those things working towards that. But that's what drives business.
<Q - John Heinbockel>: Yeah. And do you think the price elasticity on that is pretty high?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: When you have got a hot price on strip steaks or items like that, yes. When you can hit
another $1 a pound, if you will, lower, or few dollars a pound on some items, that can drive business. And needless to
say, you've been in at Costco and talk about massing out big, good looking stuff, fresh foods is where we shine.
<Q - John Heinbockel>: You said e-commerce growth was down a little bit. Is that purely mix?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yeah. There's been no comment – nothing that was called out specifically of why that is,
so I assume it's mix.
<Q - John Heinbockel>: All right. And then lastly, the levers that you've gotten in core operations was better than
we've seen in a couple of quarters, it was pretty broad based. Is there anything you're doing differently? Whether it's
managing labor, benefit, design, that would have – because comp wasn't that different versus prior quarters. So is
something you're doing internally to manage those items?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I wish we knew more here but, I mean, everything we do every day and I'm not trying to
be cute here, but certainly we continue to focus on things like, basics like overtime hours, every four weeks when we
have an all hands budget meeting here, each of the 16 or so Senior VPs or Country Managers of Operations get up and
talk about things that they've done in their region to be more efficient. And I think that pays off. We have focus items
that they talk about each month, they talk about other things, working with buyers to create more seamless movement.
All those things we really spend a lot of time on.
One of the things that I think benefited us are our assumptions for healthcare costs, notably U.S., where it's most
expensive and it's most inflationary. We've done a little better job of that. It was over – a little over a year ago that we
made a few changes to the plan in terms of primary caregivers – primary within the plan and that changed a little
behavior, not that big of an impact to the employee, but a better management of that. So I think we're still getting a
little benefit of that there, but it's in the core of payroll as well. And I think that's a combination of lots of little things
like I mentioned.
<Q - John Heinbockel>: All right, thank you.

Your next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Thanks. Thanks, Richard. Good morning. Curious if you can help diagnose the consumer,
I know we saw some volatility in your monthly comps and there's been some unevenness in other parts of retail. I
mean, you gave us some good color at November, but what do you think is going on? Does spending appear back to
normal? I don't know if it was just a temporary hiccup?

<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I mean, remember – I think it was October when we said one month does not make a trend
and then the first couple of weeks of November weren't terribly exciting and then it got more exciting. So – and middle
of November and late November was quite a bit stronger than the first part of November.
So again, I think we weren't really concerned when it was – when frequency was a 3 instead of a 4 but overall comps
continue to be well. Our markdowns are in good shape, even though inventory is a little higher. And – so I think we
still feel cautiously optimistic and certainly confident about what we're doing right now.
I think the kind of – if you would ask me what surprises me in the last month versus the last couple of months,
electronic has finally turned, and that's, I think, a function of people coming in, pricing keeps coming down. I think our
fresh foods has been great. The fact that many times I'm explaining that fresh foods', year-over-year margins are down
a little, they were up a little, that's all good. So I think that reflects well on us. I can't speak to the consumer outside of
that though.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Right. So other than electronics, the complexion of what consumers are spending on
looks back to normal, back to that – back to the old cadence?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yes, but that doesn't mean anything for tomorrow. But what's nice when I look at the
November results, which I have in front of me, underlying in the U.S., which is the big piece here, so it does take out –
eliminates the FX issue. Softlines was low double digits. Fresh notwithstanding some deflation and the average sell in
meat was good. Yeah. And so I hope it will continue. Stay tuned.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Okay. And just a follow-up on gross margin, because I guess the printed number is the
highest number since our model goes back to 2003. And you mentioned the four core categories were good. And I think
you would attribute it somewhat to mix, but big picture, right, the mix of product, that will probably keep benefiting
you. Can you give us a sense on the leverage with suppliers, how much of that side of the coin is helping you as well?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I don't think – I haven't heard anybody talking about major changes in leverage. I mean, we
are – I think if you ask our suppliers, generally, we are typically front and center with them. When freight rates will
come down, as you might expect, some suppliers are reluctant to – they're waiting for us to call them, not to offer it up.
And global sourcing, I think, is helping us competitively a little bit. So overall, I think we're still tough. I mean, there
have been some suggestions out there that some retailers are going back to manufacturers to insist on extra moneys.
When we read that and hear that – we hear it from, as you might expect – we have to understand that there are some
people out there that sell all of us and will share things each way. But you're going to find – we're going to go back and
make sure we get our share of that. So I think we continue to be tough. I don't think there's been any change in that.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Okay, thank you.

Your next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Can you describe what you're doing to
prepare for the transition to Visa? And as you make that transition, how are you going to inform your existing members
and new potential members of the switch?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, I'm glad it's – a lot of that's in the operations and membership marketing areas.
There's a lot going on, needless to say, between our company and the new issuer, Citi, that's going to be coming out.
There is going – Citi and American Express are currently discussing what they need to be doing in terms of that
transition. And again, contractually, there's not a lot we can say at this point, but rest assured, it's going to take several
weeks, that transition, but the assumption is that existing members with the existing co-branded card will be getting
new cards in the mail on or about the time of the actual transition. And it will be as – hopefully as seamless as possible
to them. Once we're allowed to communicate to our members about the new program, which, again, contractually, we
can't do that until that time, as you would expect, like anything we do, we're going to let everything know and put it in

big letters.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: And should we factor into our model a potential disruption from the transition? Are you
going to – will there be a period of when you take both Visa and American Express for a period of time?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: There maybe. Again, that's still in flux. I mean, there are some possibilities of that. But
whether there is an exact transition, a binary transition, or an overlap period of time, I don't really see a lot of disruption
on that side. It's, as you might expect, it's a royal pain to do this. But it's like – it's what we do.
You've got teams of people in operations that are working with our people in membership marketing and they're
working with the outside, the new outside provider to make it as seamless as possible, to have the communication out
there both in-store via e-mail, via letter. And so I think it's going to go a lot better than one might think. It's just a lot of
work to be done.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: Understood. And coming back to the topic of traffic. Three out of the last four months,
the traffic has been a little bit slower than the 4% you had been seeing consistently before that period. Are you just
running into a point where there is now either limitations on how frequently some of your members – some of your
most loyal members can shop or limitations on the throughput that some of the stores are having based on the level of
traffic that you're already seeing in those locations?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I think in terms of level of throughput, we keep doing a better job of that. In my view we
keep – in my own calculations we keep raising the number of annual volume – the amount of annual volume a
warehouse can do. I mean, certainly there's – there'll be somebody in line saying, God, why did I come at Saturday
afternoon. But at the end of the day, that's not an issue.
Look, I remember in calendar 2009, for calendar 2009, the first year after the bad economy hit, we had a frequency
number of around four, and I was reminding people that if calendar 2010 was zero, that compounded number of plus
two for those two years would have been better than our average over the prior 20 years. And now, we've enjoyed
seven years of fiscal – calendar 2009 through calendar 2015, that have been slightly above four on average on a
compounded basis. So at some point, it has to come down a little bit. We feel very good about where it is. We can't
look at any specific factor to say this is why – it used to be a four and the last couple of months it's been a three and a
half. We feel very good about where it is.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: Okay, thank you so much and have a good holiday.

Your next question is from Robby Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Robert F. Ohmes>: Thanks for take my questions. Richard, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more
about partnering with Instacart and Google and Google and – and maybe how that's going versus your expectations?
And also can you remind us, how if that – how the membership is impacted by that? If it were to roll out nationally,
how does membership fee get accounted for in that? And then I have a follow-up question. Thanks.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Sure, each one is a little different. I believe with Google you have to be a Costco member
to go through the Google Shopping Express network, so it doesn't impact membership at all. Perhaps it gets a few
members because there are some people that aren't going to come in, but now they can get some things delivered to
them. With respect to Instacart I believe it's the Instacart memberships, and, of course, they buy multiple memberships.
Net net it might be a slight decline if you assume that these were members that never came in and are now going to
shop – going to switch and shop this way. They used to come in all the time and now are never going to come in the
future.

I doubt that's very impactful. None of these are programs are huge relative to our numbers. We're agnostic. I think what
that shows is we're agnostic. We would sell merchandise to anybody that wants to be a member and buy from us. We
certainly help them and we work with them and respect the fact that they're all trying to grow their businesses. So I
think starting from the point that many out there were concerned that everything is going to go this way and what's
going to happen to all this brick-and-mortar; in our case, we see some changes and that increase and some of these is
that there is a slightly improvement in total comp, recognizing you've got a few more visits that are delivered but it's
still a very small thing. And so there's not a lot of knowledge I can give you beyond that.
<Q - Robert F. Ohmes>: Thanks. Just the other question was on the – with the success of fresh food and organic and
everything, are you still seeing space allocation grow to that area? And if so, where is it mostly been coming from?
And is there a maximum allocation you can give to fresh and organic food?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, first of all, a little of the space is flexible. So we're going to bring things out. When
you see palettes of produce out there that isn't refrigerated, the one – the stuff that can't be – that doesn't need to be
refrigerated, you'll see us there. We'll have some temporary coolers sometimes. The big growth – when we were
spending a lot on CapEx for what we call under the big phrase of remodel but it was adding lineal feet of refrigerator
and frozen, putting in more vertical stand-up coolers versus the coffin coolers in the deli and cheese areas. So we're
getting more out of our space. We've added space. My guess is that, there's less incremental space that we can do, but
we're still doing it to some extent.
And the other thing is that's an area where we can benefit by turning it faster as well. So a lot of our expansion was to
enable us to turn it fast, not only more square footage or more lineal footage or doors but our more vertical cases, but
have more merchandise out there, better presented, and easier to grab. And I think we've done a great job in that area.
<Q - Robert F. Ohmes>: And then just lastly the – I think it's the CapEx. I think you're saying it's going to be up like
$0.5 billion or so versus last year. Can you remind us what that extra $0.5 billion compared to last year is for?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Sure, roughly eight or 10 more locations, roughly a few more expensive locations
internationally. There's all that other stuff I talked about where we're adding, still adding a few gas stations, still adding
a few hearing aid centers. Depots or infrastructure which is, we think, a big competitive and profitable advantage to us.
84%, 85% of our goods now go through our cross dock operations where the average life of the majority of that
inventory is less than half a dozen hours. So we've got a lot there. I believe IT is – hold on. I've got the number here.
How much? I don't have it on here. I think that will be – year over year it's going be $60 million to $80 million. I don't
have it in front of me, I'm sorry, but that's a piece of it as well.
<Q - Robert F. Ohmes>: Got it, thanks very much.

Your next question comes from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.
<Q - Christopher Michael Horvers>: Thanks. Good morning, guys. So, Richard, I understand your comments on the
MFI growth and the underlying trend being very strong. But as you look at the MFI ex-FX, it seemed to have slowed
off of a strong fourth quarter, a trend that you saw through the third quarter of last year. So how much of this is social
media offers? Are we lapping some big international openings as well? Basically, trying to understand what the right
underlying trend in MFI growth is?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I don't see a big concern there. Some of this is social media and where we – I know –
anecdotally, one thing we did was a LivingSocial thing a year ago, which was very good. We've not done that again
this – at a corresponding time this year.
Yeah. And I've not seen any comments from our membership marketing people when we reviewed the quarter with
them of any concerns. There may be a little timing of openings of international openings, but, again, we don't see any
big trend there that's – that concerns us – trend change.

<Q - Christopher Michael Horvers>: No trend change. Okay. Understood. And then, can you help us think about the
gas. I know you get this question a lot, but you had some nice gas benefits last year; in the next quarter you're going to
lap, I think, what was an even stronger quarter, the second quarter a year ago. So maybe anything on how much gas
was a net benefit or a net detriment on a year-to-year basis, quantitative hopefully, but any qualitative comments just to
help as we think about this upcoming quarter?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: We'll tell you each quarter, but, in Q1, again, one would have thought, one includes you
guys and me, that gas profitability would have fallen down a little bit. It's still very good relative to our history, but
versus very strong numbers in Q1 a year ago. We had pretty good numbers this time. I think year over year it was
within $0.01 of profitability, flat to down less than $0.01 year over year. I think we also had very strong Q2
profitability. That may be tough to match, but we're early in the quarter and Q1 surprised me. Maybe I don't want to be
surprised there. But if it does come in a little bit, we'll certainly share with you if it's more than $0.01 or $0.02 delta.
<Q - Christopher Michael Horvers>: Right. So a tougher compare, but you were surprised to the upside on this case.
And taking that all into account, maybe it's not as bad as people fear out there.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Right, when I say surprised to the upside, I mean we were still down year over year a
shade. But again, last year was pretty strong and Q2 was even stronger. We'll see how this quarter goes. The fact that
gas prices and oil prices have dripped down a little bit, that generally bodes well for us. But, again, I'm not suggesting it
can be as well as last year; we'll see.
<Q - Christopher Michael Horvers>: Understood, and just one last question on the traffic side. I know you said you
don't really see a change in the box in the consumer. Does the fact that November was largely driven in the back half of
the month concern you at all, or is that just an indication of the consumer continuing to wait for the deals that come
around Black Friday?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: If I knew, I'd be doing something else. We actually looked at it as a positive. We were
starting to get a little concerned as it slowed down a little bit. I think the fact that we don't put as much emphasis on
Black Friday and Cyber Monday, it still did well, but we've got a lot of people coming in earlier that week for crazy
numbers of pumpkin pies and the like. All those things I think help us. The fact that electronics was as strong was a
surprise to us. So no, I don't think we look at it that way at all.
<Q - Christopher Michael Horvers>: Okay, understood. Thanks very much.

Your next question is from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Paul E. Trussell>: Hey. Good morning, Richard. I apologize for any background noise. I'm in the airport. But I
wanted to just go back first to your color that you provided on margins, just to make sure that I captured some of the
details that you listed out. When it comes to gross margins to start, I believe you spoke to the actual core of four
categories up once again 13 basis points, similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter. You noted that ex the cycling of
the one-time benefit from last year, gross margins would have been up an additional seven basis points. And regarding
the inventory levels, you stated that you feel pretty comfortable with those levels just given how strong the first week
of the second quarter was. Is that a fair representation of your color on gross margins? And how should we think about
that going forward?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yes, but mind you seven basis point of the one-time item, that's outside of – that's not – the
13 basis points is the core business, it's not like it's 13 basis points becomes 20 basis points.
<Q - Paul E. Trussell>: Correct, on the core, absolutely.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Right, yes, and we feel pretty good about that.

<Q - Paul E. Trussell>: And then regarding just SG&A again, just for my clarification, making sure my table is clear,
stock compensation you mentioned was up meaningfully year over year, $36 million I believe you said, so about a
$0.05 hit or so on a go-forward basis. That will only be about a third of the hit in the next few quarters?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: What I was trying to convey is that, because of timing, our annual grant to everybody is in
late October, because more and more of the recipients, particularly the recipients like myself who have been here 32
years almost, so you've got accelerated vesting. So the entire hit is now not spread over five years. So really that's a
timing issue. That's going to help you a little in the future. But the fact of the matter is because it's October, you've got
a big hit in October of Q1. So just taking the math of what we – if you think about it, the actual hit to P&L this year is a
function of those grants that have been made over the last five years, and then that's ratably one-fifth a year. Adjusted,
when it vests faster than that accelerated based on tenure.
So not only do you have more people in the plan today than you had – as a piece from five years ago gets fully
extinguished and you're adding a new piece, A) this new piece has many more people from five years ago, it has a
stock price per share a lot higher, and you've got the vesting, the vesting in my view being one of the key ones.
And so the way it hits, just simple math is, that $36 million year-over-year change is more than half of our expected
year-over-year increase in that line item. So if it was half, in each of the next three quarters, it would be about a third of
50% in each of those quarters. It's not quite that. But instead of being $36 million, it's going to be in the $10 million to
$13 million range or $8 million to $13 million range each period.
<Q - Paul E. Trussell>: Got it. And then the legal hit, is that fully contained into this particular quarter? And then also
on the IT modernization, how should we think about the cadence of those expenses going forward relative to what we
saw in 1Q?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: In terms of the $22 million, again, it's a couple of items that we're still in the process of.
That's our best guess of the impact. We don't think there will be any big surprises there. If anything, you try to be
reasonable and conservative.
Outside of that, in terms of IT modernization, it's a little bit of a broken record here, but there is a light at the end of this
tunnel incrementally. And I'm hopeful that sometime next year we'll see that flatten out and come down. But we've got
a lot going on there. And again, it's part of our operations. It will come down as a percent of sales at some point in the
future or come down certainly relative to the types of increases we've seen. But it's necessary. And we're starting to see
some deliverables finally.
<Q - Paul E. Trussell>: Thanks, Richard. I appreciate that clarification. Last for me is just on the international side.
The Canada and International segments have been able to have a reasonable spread versus the U.S. in margins. I
believe some of that's due to a little bit maybe less competition, maybe a little bit less labor cost. As you continue to
grow the business and expand into new markets, how do you think about the margins in those segments going forward?
Can it maintain a little bit of a reasonable spread versus the U.S.?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I think all things being equal, Canada is going to continue to be more profitable than the
U.S. And some of these other countries are going to continue to be even more profitable than that, not all of them, but
some of them.
We have no illusion that some of the ones that are really outsized profitable will come down a little over time. But
Canada is mature, still growing a little in terms of new units, still growing nicely in terms of local currency comps, and
it's nice that we're the only club in town. But that being said, we're still our own toughest competitor. We have a little
extra margin there, not a lot. We have a lot lower healthcare cost as a percent of sales. So there's other things that help
us up there, not just a little extra gross margin.
<Q - Paul E. Trussell>: Thank you.

Your next question is from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.
<Q - Brian W. Nagel>: Hi, good morning. Thank you for all the color at the beginning on the call on the one-time
items impacting in the quarter. Question I have – Richard, you called out electronics as a point of strength. Could you
comment specifically on the TV category? And to what extent some of the new innovations in TVs are helping drive
better electronics sales? And a follow-on to that is, as the holiday season now has gotten underway, what type of price
promotions you've seen throughout the sector on TVs?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I don't have the quarter in front of me. But for the four weeks of November reporting,
which would be through the Sunday after Thanksgiving, those four weeks ended then, within majors which was up,
again, ex-FX, in the mid-teens for the month. I think I said it was in the low double digits for the quarter. TVs for the
month were up both in dollars and sales in the mid-20%s, so it's quite strong. Now that may be because last year was a
little weak, I don't know, I don't have that in front of me. But it certainly was strong. I think there is a little bit more
promotions. Cell phones are strong. Tablets are strong – I'm sorry, tablets have come down a little bit, but phones are
strong and – those are the big things. Video games are strong. Again, all those other strongs or little weakers are
dwarfed by television sales within electronics.
<Q - Brian W. Nagel>: And to be comment on TVs...
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I think the technology, the 4K is helping, but the prices are coming down as well. I was
there across the street yesterday, and you've got smaller flat screens with great quality less than $200. You've got bigger
TVs less than $1,000; you've got as well as the giant HD, 4K, whatever, under $3,000 and under $2,000 depending on
what the size and the item and some of the new technology. So I think all those things are helping us a little bit on that
category.
I point it out also because it's one of those that I've been – we continue to get asked about as dot-com continues to take
market share of electronics and the impacts to the other brick-and-mortars over the last few years, I think Best Buy has
been a little better on TVs as well, but certainly this has been a standout for us of late.
<Q - Brian W. Nagel>: Got you, that's helpful, and one follow-up question. I know you addressed this in your
prepared comments too, but the inventory growth in the quarter. So if you look at it on a sequential, year-on-year
sequential basis, it did tick higher here in fiscal Q1. What was – what explains that?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: The two biggest components of that $900,000 ex-FX number year over year is electronics,
which was about $250,000 and that's planned and doing fine as expressed in the sales numbers. And apparel – and
again, we are out there at en masse. And these are basics. I mean, we're not going to be leftover with a lot of red and
green Christmas dresses, because that's not what we sell. I mean, you're going to – we're doing fine. So we feel – we
have no concerns about our inventories, our markdowns. Something I know we learned years ago the cheapest
markdown is the first markdown and the quicker you get rid of stuff that had problems, and our markdowns overall
have been nothing to be concerned about.
<Q - Brian W. Nagel>: Thanks a lot.

And your next question is from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Matthew Jeremy Fassler>: Thanks a lot. Good morning, Richard. Thanks for taking my question. My first
question, just wants to get a little more clarity around this transitional period as you have to cease sign-ups for the card.
You talked about it in terms of EPS impact on the quarter that you just reported and some residual impact over the next
couple quarters. As we think about where this shows up in the P&L, is there any discernible impact on the topline? And
if you could kind of dimensionalize the impact on the member fees as well, just to understand where we would model
for that to happen?

<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Needless to say, we don't have any new co-brand cards being signed up right now. So that's
impactful a little bit to the membership line, not a lot. 99% of – yeah, that's going to go to sales. You've got –
everybody who has a co-brand card currently is still using it. So there's no impact there. Again, what I try to do
recognizing that the $1.09 reported figure was going to raise some questions. We just looked at what are the things that
we can really look at. We have not – given that our sales continue to be strong, we're not really looking at that line to
see this – how much sales do we estimate we're losing.
I assume we're losing – in theory you're losing a sale for somebody that's signed up as a member that can't sign-up for
the co-brand card. They're still buying from us. They just don't – they don't have the co-brand card, they don't have that
reward, they've got – they're probably using some other AmEx reward card. Recognizing at its current strength, AmEx
is about 40% of our sales. There is still 60% of people that aren't using AmEx, whether they're using debit or a very
limited of an old house card from – we don't own it from years ago, or another AmEx card. So we don't see a big
impact from that. Is it greater than zero, the negative impact? Of course. But, again, given where our sales numbers
have been, this is something that – there's specific pieces that are monies earned for new sign-ups in the equation and
so we pointed that out.
<Q - Matthew Jeremy Fassler>: Got it. Second question. You talked about the seasonality of stock comp expense and
the bulge you saw this quarter. Just to confirm what you talked about – I guess, what you saw this past Q1 and what we
talked about for the rest of the year seems to be seasonally a lot like what you had last year, even though it's a bit
different from what you had over the prior few years. Is that an accurate way to think about it?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: That's correct. Yes. Yes.
<Q - Matthew Jeremy Fassler>: Okay, great.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: By the way comp is – it is part of our comp and it is part of SG&A. We have always prided
ourselves – for many years, we never changed the number of shares. So as the stock compounded at 19% a year, that
piece of 3,000 or 4,000 peoples' compensation improved dramatically. As you may recall, a couple of years ago, we
reduced the number per recipient at whatever level that was by I think 15%. And again, we just did it again in the grant
that just happened. Notwithstanding, you're still seeing this big increase because of just how that works.
<Q - Matthew Jeremy Fassler>: Great. And then just another quick follow-up on the demographic piece. You give us
a couple of interesting numbers. A couple different ways to come at that question, I guess, is the average age of a new
member changing for you? Has that been moving in one direction? You talked about it relative to the national average
and presumably that couldn't happen without the average age coming down. But without knowing what the national
average has done at our fingertips, kind of hard to know?
And then also, members in multifamily dwellings versus single family, if you think about millennials staying in that
kind of environment and multifamily in general gaining share from single family, I'm not sure if you're able to look at it
that way. Any sense of how you're faring with that cohort?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, I never – I haven't and I haven't seen any figures presented to me that way. I've said a
couple of times in the last many months when people talked about millennials. I think the good news is, we're getting
more of them and things like organic certainly help, social media helps a little bit. Millennials is going to be an issue
for the total pie in general. If people move home after college for a period of time, if they move into a smaller place, if
they get married later and if they have fewer kids, it's going to rain on all of us. So we certainly having – increasing the
share that we get of those people will help, but we're going to keep driving value and – given the flexibility and the
types of things we continue to sell and we'll see where it goes, but we have not looked at that. If we start looking at
that, I'd be scared.
<Q - Matthew Jeremy Fassler>: Thank you so much.

Your next question is from Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company.
<Q - Steven Zaccone>: Good morning. This is Steven Zaccone on for Oliver Chen. Thanks for taking our questions.
Just two quick questions. As you look to the remainder of 2016, are there any areas of the assortment that you have an
opportunity for improvement in your view?
And then secondly, we just had a quick question regarding the E. coli situation. Have you seen any traffic disruption
from the headlines? It does appear that you have the situation contained, but just curious if you've seen any traffic
disruptions. Thanks very much, Richard.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: On the latter, no. It was, I think, contained pretty quickly and the information was
communicated pretty quickly. And I believe that the last possible episode related to Costco of someone being falling ill
was November 1. So we're kind of past that. Thankfully, nobody was extremely hurt. There were a couple – there was a
few that did go to the hospital and I understand that they're all doing better now. So nothing new as it relates to that. I'm
sorry, in terms of the other question, in terms of what's new; again, it's more of the same. I can't give you anything
specific that's at the top of mind. Organics continues. KS, we're doing a few more things, but that's kind of steady as we
go.
<Q - Steven Zaccone>: Great, thanks.
Operator
Your next question is from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets.
<Q - Kelly Ann Bania>: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to ask another question on the transition to
Citi. As we get closer to that transition in the spring, just curious how you feel about it? It sounds like there's a lot of
preparations involved. And maybe you could just remind us what's different about this in the U.S. versus what you did
in Canada a couple of years ago and maybe what you've learned in that transition process?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, it just takes time. I think the big difference is, is in Canada, the new issuer was not
able – did not purchase the portfolio from American Express. And therefore, it's what's referred to as a de novo
program where customers – members have to sign-up and re-apply for credit.
And so that's a little more disruptive. It impacts – now, it's a MasterCard up there, and so there are many people up
there that have a MasterCard in his or her wallet already, so they still have something to use.
And then in terms of auto renewals, part of our renewal rate is the fact that you have some members that do auto
renewal, which as you might expect, statistically has a slightly higher renewal rate, because it's auto. And the
assumption here in the U.S. is, is that the portfolio will be – the transition will include the purchase of the portfolio.
And I think the language we've used in the past is, is that's what we anticipate, because there's always a chance that
something can happen, but we're working towards that end as you would expect the issuers out there.
So again, it's – recognizing that Canada is 10% of our company and the U.S. is 70%, so these are bigger numbers. I
would guess that if you look at the $15 million I pointed out as it related to just earnings – revenues we get for signing
up new co-brand cards, even if the same percentages occurred up there, it's – it wouldn't even be worth calling out in
terms of the company as a whole. So it's just – it's going to take some time. I'm just trying to share with you what I can
at this point. Nothing big is going to happen. We'll get through it. And we're very excited about the next many years
under a great program.
<Q - Kelly Ann Bania>: That's helpful. Any color you can provide on what percent of members do use the
auto-renewal? And anything else we should think about just modeling...
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I don't have that at my fingertips, but I probably wouldn't – we wouldn't share that. As
many as possible would be the answer. It makes it easier for the customer and certainly it gives them a reason to more
likely renew.

<Q - Kelly Ann Bania>: Got it. And then just another question. You mentioned, I think, two new business centers
planned for this year. I was just curious if you could talk about how those are working. Any relative profitability versus
a typical club? And just what you think about that format going forward?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: First and foremost, we're opening regular warehouse clubs. For a number of years we had
anywhere from, I think, six to eight business centers that were doing okay, slightly profitable but not setting the world
on fire. There were a lot of changes that were made to it a couple of years ago and they are growing nicely. They are
more profitable than they had been. And it's another avenue. It's going to be a lot smaller footprint in terms of how
many units we have than a regular warehouse, regular Costco warehouses, but we'll keep adding – we're doing this just
like we've done everything, pretty methodically. On a base of 10 or so we're going to open a couple. So it's not like
we've discovered something that's – we're going to go from 10 to 20 overnight, in one year.
So it's good and it's a positive business for us. And it certainly is a focus on the business member. We also will, from
time to time, identify items in the business center that makes sense to sell in all of our locations. So we think it's a
positive.
Some of the examples also is where we've taken an old Costco which is smaller footprint, perhaps not as well located
for our general population member where we'll – as we're relocating an old unit, we will convert that other one in that
city into a business center. So that's been helpful to us as well. We did that in South Atlanta. We did that in Chicago, I
think, in Bedford Park. I believe the New Jersey location is a relocation where Hackensack went to Teterboro.
I mentioned that we opened a new one Teterboro, that's a relo of Hackensack which is now over – that several month
period is being converted into a business center. So we think it's good. When asked what's driving our earnings growth
or what's driving our whatever, I've always said it's a lot of little things and this would be one of them.
<Q - Kelly Ann Bania>: Great, thank you.

Your next question is from Meredith Adler with Barclays.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Thanks. I have one quick question. Could you just remind me of – remind us of the timing of
the new credit card?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, our current relationship expires March 31. And there is a window of a few months in
there, post that that this could extend. So it will be sometime between April and December is my best guess at this
point.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Great. And then just – you're still – you guys are still working very hard on your technology
modernization. Can you talk about whether you've been pleased with the timing of everything and whether all the new
systems have been rolled out smoothly? I mean technology is notoriously late, but how is it going for you guys?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Smoothly would be an overstatement. I mean, I think at the beginning of time when we
talked about this, starting about three years or four years ago we said, this is our best guess. And I half-jokingly said
whatever you think it's going to do, it's going to take twice as long and cost twice as much. And anybody that's gone
through it, I think, generally experiences that, and we're experiencing some level of that as well.
That being said, we've got – everybody is supportive of it. The deliverables that we have had, sometimes they've taken
longer, they've cost more. We've learned from what we didn't know. And as we find out, we do a better job on the next
thing.
And so, again, overall, I think – again, it's costing a little more than we thought. It's taking a little longer, but we're
getting some deliverables over the last year like a new membership system, a new point-of-sale system; a big rollout of
really the foundation of our accounting system will be at the beginning of the new fiscal year. So we've got a lot going

Your next question is from Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research.
<Q - Charles Cerankosky>: Good morning, everyone. Richard, can you give us a little bit of color or some range on
how many stores might be open this year? You said 32 on the top end. How low could that be and where would you
expect some of the shortfalls to be?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, 32 is my best guess. If I had to guess what's the low end, 27 or 28. That just simply
means and – under 27 example, that means five in the latter half of the year and the original budget would have been
skewed out a little bit. Right now, I'm looking – we've got seven new units coming in Q3 in this plan, and 15 in Q4,
with about half of those, a little over – probably eight of those in August. So I'm sure a few of those are going to slip.
Okay, a couple of those have slipped back because this number was 35. So I'm guessing – so 28 to 32. Again, it's a
fluid number. I don't think we've lost any but we've – I know a couple of them we've already delayed. It might be a year
delay for zoning issues. One example there were – and again we found some things underground that we – that original
core testings didn't find. So you're always going to find some things out there like that.
<Q - Charles Cerankosky>: Okay. Can you talk a little bit about competitive behavior that you're seeing out there?
Whether it's a reaction of a more conventional stores to what you've been doing. There's not many retailers out there
showing the comps that Costco is. Are you seeing any reaction in your channel and outside your channel, and
especially as you enter some new countries?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Overall, no. I mean, we are and I've said it many times, we are our own toughest
competitor and I mean that. In our industry notably Sam's and to a little extent BJ's, but certainly many locations where
we compete head to head, we're in their locations literally every week and I would assume they're in our locations every
week. And we feel good about the competitive posture there. I think it helps that our average volumes are dramatically
higher and that allows you to do a lot of things, and I think the nature of our member. So I don't think we see any big
changes there other than we keep doing pretty good.
As it relates to traditional competitors, regionally we look at all kinds of things. In the Northeast, we look at companies
like Wegmans, which is a great supermarket retailer and they're opening more units. That's in our view our customer,
our high-end customer particularly in the quality of fresh foods, although our fresh foods numbers are pretty good.
So I think we're doing a pretty good job. We're helped by the fact that we can choose to do things like women's athletic
wear, active wear, or we can literally create $100 million of sales on full margin items that didn't exist a few years ago.
And I think our global sourcing initiatives and things like that gives us we believe an edge on things like produce. But
you can't do it if you don't do the kinds of volumes we do. So I think we've got some good advantages out there and we
are I think one of the best at not resting on our laurels. In terms of dot-com, again, we're pretty methodical about it.
Some of the things we're doing are helping, albeit from a perhaps lower base than it could have been, but it's growing in
the right direction in a lot of ways, and I think we're getting better at that too.
<Q - Charles Cerankosky>: All right. Thank you, Richard.

<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Hey, guys. I'll be quick. I know the call is going long. I just wanted, Richard, to get your
thoughts here and maybe have the numbers even, what the penetration rate for e-commerce and services like rental cars
and travel services and that type – insurance services, what the penetration rate is among your members. And do you
have – has it been growing?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: They're growing nicely. We do not give out that information. They're all pretty good
businesses. They've all grown slowly over time. Travel is doing very well. Things like car rentals, I can tell you I
visited some shareholders recently on some proxy issues. And during that, I was just giving an example though, of our
rental car business, which has grown dramatically in the last year to well over 2 million rentals a year, and a lot of that
is online. And in two different meetings, individuals who prided themselves on knowing how to get the best deal on car
rentals went online during the meeting were able to save on the same car from the same third-party agency significant.
So I'll share that with you guys too. Go try it and we've got to do a better job of communicating that.
So those businesses are growing. They're all generally small percentages of the total, so I think that creates more
opportunity for us. I think I read recently where if we were a car dealer, we'd be the second largest car dealer in the
country based on number of new cars purchased by our members through the Costco Auto Program. All those are
additional reasons to be a member. They're all very profitable and growing. And if they're very profitable, it means
we're going to keep getting even better values. So it's all good.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: And your e-commerce penetration rate, do you have that? Or is that something you don't
want to talk about, either?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: E-commerce, in terms of – what do you mean by penetration?
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: What percentage of the members are using your e-commerce offer?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I don't have that in front of me. It's probably not as much as it should be, and it will keep
growing. And I'm not trying to be cute. I just don't have that number in front of me.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: No, that's fine. And then when we're looking at these things and we're looking at frequency,
I would guess that these are outside your frequency. They don't get counted. Is that true?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Correct. Our frequency is front-end transactions at the warehouse. So it doesn't include
gas, pharmacy, optical. If you shop the front end, no matter where else you shop, it's just one transaction. So if you
shop just at the gas station, it's not a transaction in terms of our shopping frequency.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: And the e-commerce is not ringing up its transactions either – frequency? Frequency? It's
transactions but not frequency.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: E-commerce is like a warehouse, so that is adding up, but it's 3% of our business. So even
if it's growing at three times at 20%-plus versus 7%, it's de minimis to that number.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: All right, perfect. That's it for me. Thanks, guys.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Why don't we take two more questions? Hello?

<Q - Bob S. Drbul>: Hi, Richard. I just had two quick questions. On the credit card, I think the $0.02 hit this quarter,
is that expected to be something similar over the next few quarters in terms of the impact? And I guess the question
there is when you start to get to the new relationship, will there be additional marketing expense that you would also
occur in addition to what's impacting the business today?

$0.03, but call it $0.02 as a guess, and it's a guess. At the time of transition, there are monies baked into the deal. So I
don't see any big impact of that to any of our numbers.
<Q - Bob S. Drbul>: Got it. And you mentioned the Alibaba Singles Day. Can you just give us any insight in like how
you're looking at China and essentially what you're learning so far from that relationship?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: We've been asked about China for 20 years. And about every two or three years, it used to
be Jeff and Jim, and our Head of International, Jim Murphy. And now, of course, it's Craig and Jeff and our
International, Jim Murphy and a few others in real estate, and we keep looking. At some point, we'll probably open a
couple units, but we haven't pulled that trigger yet to actually go forth. I would say it's probable in the next five years,
but we've got a lot going on. And for 20 years, we've never been terribly concerned about we've got to get there now.
So this gets our name known a little bit, but it's not like we've strategically sat down and said hey, let's get our name
known for a few years and then go. The Alibaba Tmall thing happened because they came to us, and we didn't
appreciate how many Kirkland Signature items were selling on their site before we sold them directly and at a better
value.
<Q - Bob S. Drbul>: Great. Thank you, Richard.

Okay, your next question comes from Dan Binder with Jefferies.
<Q - Daniel Thomas Binder>: I got the last one. I'll try and be quick. As you mentioned earlier on the call, there were
some of these one-time items that we were aware of, some that we were not. Just in terms of things like legal and
regulatory, is there anything that we should anticipate in Q2 based on what you know today that we should be factoring
in?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: No.
<Q - Daniel Thomas Binder>: And then you mentioned a lower contribution from international which contributed to
the tax rate difference. I was just curious. Is that just related to startup costs in areas like Spain, just higher losses
associated with that, or is it something...
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Not at all. What I was talking about is, if you have $100 in Canada earned and year over
year in the quarter the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar is down 15%, we bring it down at $85 of income, not
$100 of income. And in Canada, the marginal tax rate, i.e., federal tax rate I believe is 26% currently versus – I could
be off a little bit – versus 39% in the U.S. In some other countries it's actually a little lower or higher. But generally
speaking, I believe the U.S. versus in the nine countries where we are, our effective U.S. tax rate on earnings in the
U.S. is quite a bit higher than anywhere else. So it's the penetration of foreign earnings to total earnings is that simple.
<Q - Daniel Thomas Binder>: Got you. So I had an opportunity to visit it your Getafe club in Spain. It was pretty
impressive. I think one of the areas that's surprising was the amount of local sourcing you're doing, especially in areas
like fresh. And we heard about some of the export activities with local vendors. I was just curious if you could expand a
little bit on what that opportunity looks like when you, not just for Spain but other countries you're operating in, how
much you're doing in terms of cross-border type sourcing for other clubs and whether it's the U.S. or Japan, et cetera. It
seemed like it was growing.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: First and foremost, the big thing is on multinational vendors getting the – a lot of times
with multinational vendors you've got two or three or four geographic world regions. And I remember when we went
into Australia, and now we have eight units instead of one or two or three a few years ago, still with only eight, there
are divisions of even multinationals that aren't prepared quite to sell us, make available certain things and certainly sell
us at global pricing. That can only change when they get us involved. And again, since we have that meeting here every
four weeks in the budget meeting, that's when that happens. And so I think a focus on that has helped us.

As it relates to going into these markets, the extent there are items in those countries, that helps us both ways. And I
think, if you will, I think we do a good job of that. Those are small little things that help long term. I'll give you an
example back in Japan a few years ago. I forget the name of the – there's a very well-known what's considered a very
premium tea that's a Japanese branded product that they initially were reluctant to sell us when we entered Japan, even
as we had 10 or so units. Once we worked with them to provide a co-branded Kirkland Signature by that brand name,
not only in Japan but it sells very well in Eastern Canada and along the West Coast and in California. All those things
are a net positive. It not only afforded us an ability to have a premium item with a decent margin and a new item in
these other markets where we're strong, that market potential allowed us I think to procure items faster in some of those
countries. So it's a win-win. But these are small, again, another small example.
<Q - Daniel Thomas Binder>: Great, thank you.

Okay. Well, thank you very much. We're around today if you have any further questions. Have a good day.
