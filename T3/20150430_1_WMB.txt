In our presentation materials, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This
disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it.
Finally, I'll mention that we will webcast our annual Analyst Day on May 13th where we'll provide an in-depth look at
all of our businesses and our extensive backlog of in-progress and potential projects. We hope you'll join us for that
session.
So, with that I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.
Alan S. Armstrong
Great. Thank you very much, John and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us, and I'll jump right in here on
slide two, a snapshot of our first quarter results. The highlight for the quarter was the completing of our merger of the
two MLPs to create the new Williams Partners, and with this milestone achieved, we created a leading natural gas
focused MLP that's positioned to drive consistent long-term value for our investors.
And this quarter's results also show the very strong underpinning of growth in our fee-based revenues that will drive
our growth for many years to come, and in fact all five of WPZ's operating areas had fee-based revenue growth and
four out of the five enjoyed double-digit percentage growth compared to first quarter of 2014.
And so the Northeast Gathering & Processing segment delivered an impressive 43% growth in fee-based revenues, and
that was even despite an outage on one of our – an ethane pipeline in the area. And the Atlantic-Gulf posted a very
impressive 22% gain due to the first of many new projects coming online during the quarter, and it continued build on
the strength of that business. And of course, Access Midstream, fee-based revenues continued their steady upward
march growing 11% over the prior year 1Q.
We expect this growth in fee-based revenues to continue as we had major projects like our Keathley Canyon only start
to contribute very late in the first quarter and big projects like the Rockaway Lateral and Leidy Southeast will provide
substantial growth in 2Q and beyond.
The weak spot for the quarter was NGL margins being off by $105 million versus the first quarter of 2014 and our
Geismar plant did not start consistently producing ethylene until late March. So due to the strong growth in fee-based
revenues and the strong contraction in commodity margin, actually 96% of our gross margin in the quarter came from
fee-based revenues.
Overall our first quarter 2015 adjusted EBITDA was up 12% to $918 million, and Williams received $515 million in
distributions from Williams Partners, which is up from $455 million in the first quarter of last year. Overall coverage
for WMB was at 1.14 times, and this was after increasing our quarterly dividend per share up to $0.58, which was up
from $0.40 last year.
WPZ's coverage was lower than we would have liked, but even with the major drop in NGL margins, it's just the base
Geismar volumes at the actual sales prices during the quarter had been producing, we would have fully covered our
distribution in the quarter. So again that's just the base Geismar volume not the expanded and just at the actual prices.
So really shows I think the strength that we're positioned for as we look forward to the Geismar volumes really starting
to kick in here in the second quarter and then get to our full expanded growth volumes in June.
I'm also pleased that we're reaffirming our guidance today as it relates to WPZ distributions and WMB dividends. And
for Williams our guidance is $2.38 per share in 2015 with 10% to 15% annual dividend growth through 2017 and all
that with growing coverage. And for Williams Partners we're reaffirming our distribution guidance of $3.40 per share
per unit, and 2015 was 7% to 11% annual healthy unit distribution growth through 2017 also with growing coverage.
So, we're also reaffirming our EBITDA and dividend and distribution growth for both Williams and Williams Partners,
but we do expect 2015 to be near the low-end of our ranges as we communicated in our 2014 year-end conference call.
And so this is really primarily due to three items here. One, the planning assumption that we've changed on the
ethylene prices that we think now from our planning assumption we've got that built-in at closer to the first quarter

actual prices of about $0.38 a pound for the balance of the year. And we think there will be some ups – we think there
may be some upside to this, but we certainly want to be closer to current prices with our assumptions right now.
Secondly we have been informed by a couple of our Northeast producing customers that they will curtail Marcellus
production as natural gas prices in the basin have been low, and they will continue if they don't see this improve. So we
have seen some price related curtailment. We haven't seen that fall into necessarily the drilling operations, but we have
seen it in terms of just physical shut in of production. And so this is going to dampen some of the expected growth from
our Northeast volumes. However, we continue to feel very strong about the overall health of that business as demand
for natural gas picks up and some of the extreme bottlenecks that exist in the Northeast start to be relieved.
And then finally we missed some revenues in the first quarter from Geismar, and we are currently expecting to not get
up to the full expanded plant rate until June. And as you know earlier we were expecting that to come on at the full
expanded rate in April. So those are really the three items that are driving us down towards the lower end of our range
for EBITDA and DCF.
So with that, let's move on to slide three. This list really shows some of the large scale assets that we are executing on.
As you can see it's a long list. And you can also see a tremendous amount of progress that occurred during the first
quarter here. An important trend that you'll see here is that a lot of these projects are really on the demand side of the
business. And so the natural gas market as we've talked about, we think is going to continue to expand. It was first
driven by low gas prices on the supply side, and now we're seeing the demand side start to pick up.
So whether in the near-term with projects like the Rockaway Lateral, Mobile Bay South III and Leidy Southeast or in
the longer-term projects like Dalton Lateral and Virginia Southside II. The demand side of our network is really
picking up and request for proposals continue to come in for many market-driven expansions.
And these projects when we talk about, for instance, like the Dalton Lateral, they don't just include the laterals into the
new markets, these projects also provide shippers with firm on our mainlines back to the supply point, so we are
expanding our mainline all the way back to the supply points as we build out those laterals, because as you know the
Transco system is fully subscribed. So really nice investment opportunities as the market expands.
We've also put some of the mainline portions of our Virginia Southside and Leidy Southeast projects in service early
and we've been very busy at the FERC filing certificate applications for projects like Atlantic Sunrise, Dalton Lateral,
Virginia Southside II and Garden State project.
We also are seeing the market into our NGL business coming to life with projects like Bayou Ethane and Texas Belle
being placed into service this quarter as well and on the supply end during the first quarter, we commissioned the
Bucking Horse plant in the Niobrara area and that will now be reported over in our West segment. We also
commissioned the Keathley Canyon Connector project and we reached an agreement to acquire up to a 21% interest in
the Utica East, Ohio gathering system from EnerVest.
The Keathley Canyon Connector, just little more on that. We did receive first production from Anadarko's Lucius
platform about midway through the quarter, but then in late March we began receiving a very large volume of gas from
Exxon's Hadrian field and so just a little more detail on that. The Lucius field as you probably know is an deepwater
oilfield and the Hadrian field is a gas field.
And so, really the power of that Keathley Canyon project because of the Hadrian field didn't get turned on until towards
the end of March. We really didn't enjoy a whole lot of Keathley Canyon Connector, but here in the second quarter that
facility is really ramping up very nicely and some very strong volumes coming off of that, as well as our Gulfstar
project continues to build in production and volumes there as well.
So as you can see, this list is fairly lengthy and is a testament to our great teams that are working very hard every day to
execute on this very aggressive and robust growth plan and we're really starting to see a lot of these projects come to
fruition and we're beginning to see the financial benefits of a lot of tremendous efforts by all of our project teams that
are executing.

And so with that let's move on to slide four. Just to close out here, first of all the ACMP/WPZ merger as we said really
we think puts us in the position for the natural gas MLP with strong cash distribution growth and investment grade
credit ratings. We do think it's the MLP to be exposed to amongst the large caps if you like the prospects of overall
market growth for both natural gas and natural gas derivatives. We've remained very focused and dedicated to our
strategy on that side and we really feel very good about where we're positioned on that.
And additionally, I would say on the merger, we've also built some confidence in the synergies and the cost reduction
opportunities as the combinations of our businesses has proceeded. We continue to commission and bring on these
large-scale assets and first-quarter is a great evidence of that which you are going to see throughout the next several
years a continued string of these big projects coming online and really driving strong growth in our cash flows.
I will remind you about 88% of our WPZ gross margin, we expect to come from fee based revenues. And as mentioned,
a combination of the strong growth in the fee-based revenues in the first quarter along with some very weak commodity
margins actually drove that up to 96% in the first quarter. So we probably will be below that number here in – sorry,
will probably be above the 88% number here in 2015 by a combination of very strong fee-based revenues and less
dependent on these weaker commodity margins here in 2015.
And in fact in about $9.3 billion of our 2015 through 2017 in-guidance growth CapEx, 99% of this growth CapEx is
focused on fee-based projects with nearly $30 billion of committed and potential growth capital through 2020.
So our strategy remains very sound and the backlog of projects to serve the demand side of the growing natural gas
markets continues to build and it's also continuing to firm up and we're very confident our plan is realistic and allows us
to continue to provide solid shareholder return in whichever commodity price environment develops.
All of this gives us great confidence that we will deliver high-quality long-lived cash flows from our competitively
advantaged assets. And finally, I want to give you one last reminder about our Analyst Day being held on May 13. And
as I said you can find information relating to this event on our website, as John pointed you to and we really look
forward to sharing with you our great future.
And with that we'll open the line up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you so much, sir. [Operator Instruction] We'll take our first question from Shneur Gershuni with UBS.
<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Good morning.
<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: I guess, my first question is you sort of talk about a host of projects, I think is about $9
billion worth of capital to be spent over the next couple of years. I was wondering if you can sort of talk about plans to
finance these assets. Is there enough EBITDA coming in place in 2015 that your leverage ratios can support you
investing mostly in debt or alternatively will you need to rely on the equity markets as well too?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Good morning Shneur, this is Don. I think the beauty of it is those projects come in fairly
ratably during this period. So I think you can look at it as a continuation of the kind of organic growth that we've seen
over the last several years. And we have a lot of that built into our near-term plans for 2015 as it is. So not to say that
there couldn't be some additions, but we think the capital additions would be relatively modest. It could require some
additional debt and/or equity but we think that would be pretty modest in 2015. Certainly as you can see in our
guidance the capital falls off somewhat in 2016 and 2017 and that will be filled with some of these organic projects as
they are contracted and/or sanctioned and we would expect the combination of debt and equity to finance those in the
future.

<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: Okay. Great. And just a follow-up to some of your prepared remarks you talked about the
potential for drilled uncompleted wells in the Northeast. Is this a scenario where we would see those volumes really
manifest itself in the second half of this year after the summer swoon in gas prices that we typically see? Or is this
something that could take longer to play out? And then if you can also talk about what the impact would be on the
legacy Access asset as well to in terms of the fee of service rate structure that you have in place?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yes. Sure I will take that in the two parts there. First of all just to clarify what we actually
are seeing is actual shut in of existing flowing production. So my comments around the drilling operations was
comprehensive to both the drilling and the completion. So we're not seeing a lot of drilled wells not being completed,
we're just seeing actual decisions to shut in production because of extremely low netbacks in some of the constrained
areas up in the far northeast part of the Marcellus.
On the second part of that question, yes, the areas that we would see that we would obviously see that pick up to the
degree that volumes were coming in lower. We would see that affect the cost of service calculations for the future if
those volumes didn't flow. And we will by the way Bob Purgason is going to be given a nice tutorial of that at the
Analyst Day and going to provide some more detail at our May 13th Analyst Day around the way some of those
contracts work in this environment.
<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: Cool. And one last follow-up. I was wondering if you can just talk about the Canadian
oilfields business for a minute. Margins have been challenged and so forth, kind of like what steps Williams is taking to
try and improve that and so forth or is it really just going to be dependent on the macro environment?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yes. Great question. I would say that first of all extremely low pricing in the quarter on
propane up there and so we actually saw Edmonton propane, a lot of you all probably don't follow Edmonton propane,
because you just see the Belvieu and Conway postings. But Edmonton propane really actually got down to around a
dime, so it was quite a bit lower than the value of natural gas in the quarter. So we did see some extremities up there in
the Alberta markets in terms of seeing very low propane prices and that certainly did hamper and will continue to
hamper.
The long-term solution to that is great projects like our PDH project which will provide great markets for those captive
propane barrels up there, the propylene market remain actually pretty good and we're railing that out of there as part of
our PDH project to the degree we go ahead with that which we're excited about that project still. And to the degree we
go ahead with that not only will that open up markets for the propane through the conversion to propylene, but also will
provide a new market for the propylene there via the polypropylene unit that would be built downstream of our facility.
And we wouldn't own that, but it would be part of the overall complex.
And so we're working to open up markets if you will for those stranded products and so that's really the effort that we
have growing about that. We also do have with that some structured contracts that will come that will put some collars
around the value of our products up there and help make that look more fee-based and take some of the extreme
volatility that we've seen there.
<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: Great. Thank you very much, guys.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Christine Cho with Barclays.

<Q - Christine Cho>: So I just wanted to touch on the acquisition of the 21% equity interest in UEOM. And given it
was immediately accretive, you guys still are – or at least WMB is waiving $43 million of IDRs between now and
2017. Is this because the JV is reinvesting in the cash flow back into the business or is there something else going on.
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Christine, this is Don. Good morning. Williams chose to waive the IDRs because it's a
business that also has quite a bit of growth, so the cash flows in the first capital years are not nearly as robust as they
are a few years out. So that's really what made it immediately accretive is really the willingness of Williams to support
the acquisition because we think it's strategic one and two, we think it will provide very attractive returns. Does that
answer your question?
<Q - Christine Cho>: I guess just to follow up – actually I will follow up offline. Pricing for Geismar at least for the
existing facility, I know that you have numerous contracts, but from what I understand at a high level, the reference
pricing is Mont Belvieu. But I think you are actually selling it in Louisiana. So are the contracts structured so that it's
Mont Belvieu plus some fixed number on top of that, maybe $0.02 or $0.03, because that's what the customer would
have to pay for transport if they were physically bringing it from Texas. And then it's some of the expansion capacity
that will be exposed to the actual spot pricing in Louisiana, which is currently $0.10 to $0.15 higher than Belvieu. Is
that kind of how I should be thinking about it?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah. Christine, actually those contracts are swaps back to – a lot of those are swapped
back to the Mont Belvieu market – at Belvieu market. And so there are exchanges between parties that have product in
the river versus – and parties that have demand at Belvieu. And so those actually are set up as swaps. And so you
shouldn't build anything on top of that. The way the business is structured – of course there was a number of different
contracts and there's quite a bit of complicity to it, but the way you really should think about it is that we have
customers that have a call up to about 80% of our production at Geismar and sometimes they will take all of that,
sometimes they won't.
If they don't take all of that then we have the 20%-plus whatever they leave for us to sell into the – physically sell into
the Geismar market on spot. And so that's really how you should think about that. So when we're operating at just the
base rate, we won't have any excess available to sell in to that market unless somebody doesn't call on that production
for whatever reason, they might have a plant down or they may be have a better price from somebody else and they
might not call on that volume. And at that point we'd be free to sell it into the highest value mark whatever that is. So I
think that's the right way to think about that.
<Q - Christine Cho>: I see, that's very helpful. And then what about the expansion capacity. Is that going to be the
same way or that's going to be actually exposed to spot pricing in Louisiana?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Well, you can think about a lot of the actual expansion bases – we're running about 70% of
total expanded, which is very close to base rate. And so at the number I quoted, at 80%, is 80% of the full expanded
rate. So...
<Q - Christine Cho>: I see. Okay.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: So, at the base rate, we don't have any excess provided...
<Q - Christine Cho>: I see.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: ... that people call on their volumes.
<Q - Christine Cho>: I see. Okay. That was very helpful. Thank you. And then I guess could you also talk about
expectations for the ethylene market maybe near-term and median term. It sounds like worldwide supply/demand is
pretty tight for the year and maybe were short in the U.S. next year. But any insight into what you are seeing would be
helpful.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yes I'm going to ask a John Dearborn to pick up on that one. Please, John.

<A - John R. Dearborn>: Yeah. Thanks Christine and thanks for the lead in on the subject as well. So I guess from
our perspective we would be a bit bullish on ethylene as the year wears on, but we don't want to set an unrealistic
expectation. But if we take a look at steadily increasing oil prices, strong demand, strong margins in the derivative,
certainly here in North America, we'll be filling some underutilized assets in the Louisiana market and we came into
the year with relatively low inventories. And so all of that I think would lend credence to a positive outlook on the year,
of course how the market performs is yet to be proven.
<Q - Christine Cho>: Great. Thanks so much.
Operator
And next we will move onto Carl Kirst with BMO Capital.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Thank you. Good morning everybody. John, can we just kind of keep on the threat of the
ethylene price for a second. And I guess I'm trying to think of basically to Christine's question, you're trying to
reconcile thinking that we would maybe be on a gradual strengthening through the year versus it sounds like, Alan what
you said for planning purposes we're kind of keeping it more flat at this $0.38 level. And so I guess I'm just trying to
better understand what's going to have to happen to kick the ethylene price back into the $0.40s or where our midpoint
of guidance is for 2016 and 2017 maybe. Is there a gating event we should be watching or is it something as simple as
quite frankly just global GDP here?
<A - John R. Dearborn>: Yeah. Thanks for the follow-on question. No, I think there are a number of factors that
could play into the prices moving up. I think this is just the natural tightening of the market as these markets – the uses
of ethylene grow year-upon-year globally and is a very large market at somewhere above 2% a year – somewhere
above 3% a year, I'm sorry, these global markets grow every year. So that's implied, and there's not a lot of supply
coming on in the next year or so. And so you could imagine there's going to be a continual increase in just basic
[indiscernible] (27:59) demand. Of course we're going to unrestrict the markets a little bit here between Louisiana and
Texas. That should be helpful to the Gulf Coast – certainly to the Gulf Coast market.
Then I think the third factor that could play into this is with relatively low inventories coming into the year of ethylene,
and we always predict rather high utilization rates on crackers, we've had a pretty good first quarter, but if there should
be some mishaps in some crackers around the system in the Gulf Coast, of course, that could provide a negative supply
shock to the market which would of course have an impact on prices.
So I just think it's a general growth in the ethylene consuming market that's going to continue to see us enjoy some
positive pressure here. But I can't ever predict as how quick it's going to move. If we look at polyethylene today,
polyethylene is selling somewhere around the $0.60 range. And so there is certainly plenty of margin in the chain. It's
just a matter of how it gets split between each of the products sold in the chain.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Okay. No, that's very helpful. Thank you. Alan, and I understand you guys are going to be doing
a deep dive here quite shortly. But is there any additional color perhaps to share, say, for instance on Appalachian
Connector at this point whether it's on a slow burn or I guess if there's anything incremental to add at this point.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yes, not a whole lot to add there at this point, Carl. I would just say the market is
continuing to try to shape around that. And I would say, it's a mix between – on our project is a mix between producer
push and market pool and trying to find the right balance of that. And obviously one of our primary goals there is to
make sure that we have the very best market outlets available for our upstream assets coming out of OVM. And so
that's an item that we've focused on pretty tightly and has, I would just say, added some parameters and constraints to
the project. And so that's one of the things though that from our vantage point, we're very focused on. We're very
serious when we talk about connecting best supplies to best markets, we're very serious about making sure we
accomplish that. And so that's really been one of the complicating factors on that, but we will have more to talk about
at the Analyst Day on that.

<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Would it be fair if – I think the last timing update is potentially a late 2018 and service if it all
came together. Kind of working backwards, is it fair to say, well, to meet that date you need to get commercial viability
contracts by the end of 2015 as far as the potential target.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yes, I would say given some of the difficult areas; that includes a Appalachian Trail
crossing and some forest served some – right around some forest service, I would say that's getting pretty late if it
pushes back that far. So, I think, people are going to learn some lessons on that effort in terms of trying to get built
through that difficult area.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Understood. Appreciate the color. Thank you.

And our next question Chris Sighinolfi with Jefferies.
<Q - Christopher P. Sighinolfi>: Hey, Alan, how are you?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Great. How are you doing?
<Q - Christopher P. Sighinolfi>: I'm great. I just had a couple of questions. I'm not sure if this is one for you or for
Don. But just looking at the project sort of calendar, I forget which slide that is. It looks like the CapEx on Atlantic
Sunrise came down by a touch from the time you reported it in 4Q, it looks about $200 million. Just wondering what
drove that?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yes, sure. Well, I'll tell you, that's pretty exciting news. And I would say that the – if you
think about all of the resources and whether it's steel mills or skilled labor, if you think about all of the resources that
were supporting some massive drilling operations here in the U.S. and the fact that those have now slackened, we're
really starting to see that come through, even though it's a different area of the business, we are really starting to see
that come through in our sector of the business as well. And so that reduction was based on a number of things. One
was a firm, we've now acquired our – pipe is purchased, and we saw that come in dramatically lower than our
expectation for the price, with the price of steel coming down, and we also are seeing much softer prices on the
contractor rates for construction practices as well.
So the team is doing a great job of really looking for any and every opportunity on that. And so we had quite a bit of
contingency built into that. And so we're just taking – one of those is just actual prices of steel coming in much lower
than we expected, and some of the rest of that is taking some of the contingency out that we had built in there.
<Q - Christopher P. Sighinolfi>: So Alan is that something we're likely to see on some of the other projects you are
advancing, or is it just given where Atlantic Sunrise was in the development phase at the time of the price collapse, it
was sort of squarely manifested on that project? And then as a second question, I think you had talked about a seven
times multiple anticipated on that project in particular. Is that now likely to be improved versus that prior estimate or
given your assessment as to what was sort of captured originally if it's unchanged.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yes, no, you are right. That will fall right to our bottom-line because that project was
negotiated rate project. So whatever capital we saved comes to us on that. And on the first part of your question around
will we see it, that kind of savings transcend into other projects, I would say absolutely. We're seeing some pretty big
relief on major equipment, on steel prices and importantly on the availability of engineering and skilled labor resources.
And so we certainly will see that come through.
I would say though that before we write that into our books, while that is subsiding, I would say the regulatory
environment for projects continues to get more and more difficult. And so we have to leave some contingency in there
for that. So the actual cost of construction for these projects I think is definitely – answer to that as definitely that is
coming down. But clearly like we've seen on projects like Constitution where the regulatory format is – and several
people have say so over it and sometimes are mutually exclusive requirements, those kind of complications I think will
continue to hit the industry particularly in areas where there's heavy population centers like in the Northeast where a lot

of the growth is.
<Q - Christopher P. Sighinolfi>: Yeah. No, understood, understood. I guess switching gears my second question
would be in regards to the ACMP side of the business, I think you guys reiterated the CapEx deployment plan there,
roughly 21% of the $9.3 billion. Was the CHK CapEx reduction already sort of anticipated by you in that number or is
there a downside to perhaps how much CapEx gets deployed put in the ACMP side in conjunction with the slowdown
over Chesapeake?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah. Let me have Bob Purgason take that.
<A - Robert S. Purgason>: Yeah, Chris. I think what you are seeing is the big build-out on our systems has largely
already occurred. So even though we're seeing a slight kind of current decrease in capital in general, just you are not
going to see something significant because the infrastructure is built out.
<Q - Christopher P. Sighinolfi>: Okay. So, I mean, in terms of the cost of service modeling that we had done
historically on ACMP, you had a major driver of that as simply how much you could deploy in any time period. I guess
what I'm getting after is do you have much in the way of sort of visibility on that side of it, certainly, as we move past
2015 or are we sort of just cautiously trading along and watching what the producer CapEx might shake out to be?
<A - Robert S. Purgason>: Yeah. Well, again, I think, we'll talk some more. In fact, I've got some good examples of
how the cost of service models respond to this environment coming up at the Analyst Day. But again, remember, the
bulk of that build-out was in the early years that's occurred, and we had planned always for the capital to tail off in the
out years. And then you have adjustment there for some contractual growth that happens as a result of that levelized
rate. But, again, it's, I'd say, on plan to what we had expected in terms of current performance.
<Q - Christopher P. Sighinolfi>: Okay. Great. Well, thanks, guys, for the help today. I look forward to more color on
the 13th.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Thank you.

And next we'll move on to Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Good morning, Craig.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Don, to start with your answer to the equity issuance question, it didn't exactly sound like what
I thought I heard on the last call when maybe you might have described 2016-2017 base case budget involving de
minimus equity issuance. Are you, perhaps, more agnostic as you see how commodity pricing shakes out and how does
the CapEx deflation pressure Alan just referred to reflect on those kinds of decisions?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Craig, thanks for the follow-up. Again, I was commenting on again what – I think we have
a modest amount of equity required to execute the plan that's in our guidance. However, obviously, we have a lot of
other projects on the burner here. And I was really commenting on the fact that some of those additional projects would
require some additional financing. I think that was part of the question. And that additional financing would be a
combination of equity and debt. And the real guidelines there are really maintaining our credit metrics and credit
ratings. So that will really be the guide. In terms of the way we're thinking about UEO right now, we're really thinking
of that as more of a 13% acquisition versus the 21%, because we do expect that our partner will step up and acquire the
8% that they have a right to acquire.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: I got you. So the base plan hasn't changed at all in terms of funding, despite some of the
first-second quarter headwinds you all described?

<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Yeah. There are some, I'd call it, modest changes. Obviously, the UEO was certainly not
part of the plan.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Sure. And any further thoughts – I am sure you'll discuss it in a couple of weeks here, but
around ACMP/WPZ merger-related commercial opportunities and CapEx savings over and above the $50 million cost
synergies?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Let me take that. I think the commercial opportunities continue to be very exciting,
particularly in kind of the West Virginia and Southwest PA area. And so that's very attractive. And as well I would say
the combination of our joint venture opportunities between – in the Utica are also presenting some nice opportunities
and the combination of the liquid clearing outlets for that business are very attractive to us as well.
So, I would say the opportunities have probably been maybe even a little better than we thought because we've got
Access with providing basically a greater reach and some great capabilities in terms of well connect and compression
addition in the area that really allows us to kind of expand the reach for OVM. So, we've got several bills that we're
working right now that are very fairly substantial and really are just firmly as a result of having those two capabilities
brought together. So, we remain very excited about that.
On the CapEx – sorry on – further on synergies, a measure I like to look at is what percentage of our overhead or our
G&A costs are hitting us as a percentage of our fee-based revenues. And that has come down pretty dramatically here
over the last – as we look in 2014. In other words, we take all of our G&A expenses compared to fee-based revenues in
2014 and look at that into 2015, that's come down pretty dramatically. And it's hard to move that number very big
because they're just such big numbers. But that's just a measure that I like to watch and that's improving very nicely
which tells me we're able to use the scale of our overhead to grow our business and bottom-line improve our net
margins. So, both of those things are very positive.
And I would say as well on the CapEx side we're – and general expense side, we're finding things where we're able to
take the best contract offerings, where we buy chemicals or lube oil or things like that on our procurement side and our
supply chain management side, we're finding some good synergies there in taking the very best prices amongst the two
entities.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Great. That's helpful. And last question, again, I'm sure we're going to hear some more, but is
there anything more to speak on with regards to PDH and Geismar 2 opportunities?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: I would say that as I mentioned earlier the cost reductions that we're enjoying on the
pipeline side, we're also seeing that on some of the heavy equipment side for project like PDH. And so as we're refining
those estimates on PDH to come forward for our final investment decision on PDH, we've got a lot of positive tailwinds
associated with lower cost on that and we're hoping to be able to provide a little more detail about where we are on that
at the Analyst Day meeting in terms of contractually. But I would just say generally the PDH project is moving ahead
nicely and we're nearing having all the facts and figures in place to make a final investment decision on that.
And then on Geismar 2, really strong interest in the project and I'm pretty excited about the way that's positioned with
some pretty attractive partners. And I think that one is moving at the pace we would expect and we're excited about that
as well. So both those projects I would say continue to gain momentum.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Great. Thank you.

<Q - Brandon Blossman>: Alan, moving kind of to the longer dated end of your project backlog and thinking about
what's out there including potential projects, it looks like quarter-over-quarter, one, you've rolled forward a year, but
two, you've added $5 billion to that big picture outlook. Is that just a function of rolling forward or is there quite a few
incremental projects in that outlook?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: There are a few incremental projects in the outlook and I would say that we also – I'm
proud to say are firming up some things as well as some projects in the kind of the medium-term that we've added in
there that just kind of came to us unexpectedly that have been added. So several of the market type expansions for
instance on Transco, but we've also got some sizable opportunity [indiscernible] (45:30) as the market continues to
build out for the LNG, Transco of course is externally well-positioned to serve many of the LNG projects.
And so we've gone through some very successful open seasons, and so that's adding some projects and as well we've
got some opportunities into serving Mexico that have come on the radar screen as well. So overall, it's a combination of
new projects kind of in the medium-term that have been added in and are firming up very nicely and further out on the
backend some of these new projects that has Transco serving markets in the southern end of its system.
<Q - Brandon Blossman>: Okay. That's helpful. And I guess fair to assume that we'll hear more about that on the
Analyst Day or all those projects. Thought question for you even bigger picture. Are we kind of firmly moving – as it
relates to Transco, but gas transport in general, are we moving from a temporary supplier driven project queue to much
more weighted towards the demand sinks and demand center project driven...
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: We absolutely are and I'm really excited to see that. I think all along we've thought that this
natural gas market growth has been supply-led and obviously that's put lower prices out which has just further
encouraged the confidence in the demand side to start taking advantage of that, and we're really starting to see that
come through on our systems on the natural gas side.
But we also I think we remain really excited about that as it relates to the natural gas liquids and the Petchem space and
positioning ourselves to be able to serve that growing market as well. So I would say the natural gas market expansion
is upon us and we're seeing that through all these RFPs and all this growth in our system.
And we've tried to be ahead a little bit of the NGL Petchem build out and we're very confident that with the expansion
going on in that space, it's going to take a lot more plumbing and storage to serve that growing market. And we've
positioned ourselves well for that and the Bayou Ethane project and the Texas Belle are just kind of the frontend of
those opportunities for us.

And our next question comes from Eric Genco with Citi.
<Q - Eric C. Genco>: Good morning. I'm just wondering is – kind of piggybacking on some of these CapEx questions.
Is there some built-in conservatism to your maintenance CapEx guidance of $130 million because roughly $15 million
this quarter seemed, is it really just seasonality or is there sort of a hint there that maybe that's some built-in
conservatism?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah. No, I wouldn't go put that in the bank. That is seasonality and we typically see that
in the first quarter. We've got winter weather and we've got the cruise tied up on meeting peak demand. We had some
extreme peaks on our system here in the first quarter. And so that's a really bad time to be doing maintenance on your
pipelines. And so you will see those dollars increase here over the summer months. You'll see as our work crews are
out doing the maintenance on our pipelines, you'll see that pick right back up.

<Q - Eric C. Genco>: Okay. And then my second question, I was hoping you could expand a little bit on sort of the
Canadian side of things. Is the Canadian PDH facility at-all included in some of the CapEx guidance that you've given
for the MB side of things?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: No, it is not included in guidance.
<Q - Eric C. Genco>: Okay.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: It is in that potential pie, the $30 billion, but it's not in the $9.3 billion guidance.
<Q - Eric C. Genco>: Okay. I am just trying to I guess get a sense of the different pieces of what's there, because as I
kind of look through the projects that are there, it looked like the Horizon upgrader comes along 4Q 2015, is that
[indiscernible] (49:40) 3Q 2015, Texas Belle 3Q 2015. And then kind of looking at that relative to the CapEx guidance
of $260 million for growth for 2015, $185 million for 2016, I guess what are some of the $185 million in 2016 and just
to try to understand, how the capital spend is going there because it really – if you look at – and I understand that there
are some commodity issues at work there, but given kind of the way it looks like some of those things are coming on. I
just want to understand what I'm missing, because it looks like for an incremental $35 million of EBITDA over that
period of time to put $445 million in over those two years and I'm just trying to understand that and what's missing?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: I'm not sure exactly what you're looking at.
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: The segment capital guidance.
<Q - Eric C. Genco>: It's on slide – maybe it's not 70, but it's probably close. There.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: And so your question is where is the profitability from all of that capital spend, is that your
question?
<Q - Eric C. Genco>: Well, there is that, and then maybe also just the timing of what is – what's going on in 2016 that
requires the $185 million?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Okay.
<Q - Eric C. Genco>: If Horizon comes on 4Q 2015 and then the ethane pipe and then – well Texas Belle in 2015,
where is sort of the – where is that going and what's the incremental?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah. Great question. And as I mentioned on the previous response, we really are excited
about being kind of on the tip of the iceberg of building out the infrastructure for the Petchem expansion. And so a lot
of that capital in 2016 is focused on building out for what we think is a growing position on the Petchem side there.
And so we're putting quite a bit of capital to work building out some of these legacy systems that we bought a couple –
two or three years ago, we bought quite a bit of latent pipeline down there from parties like Exxon and BP and Explore.
And so, this capital is putting a lot of those pipelines to work making interconnections, extending them, expanding
them and pushing them into those markets. And so that's what a lot of that capital is.
<Q - Eric C. Genco>: Okay. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: And you can see some of those projects on, I believe it's slide 37, I believe it is. You can
see some of the detail. And we will be providing some more detail in the Analyst Day on that.

the second half and what variables could lead to an in-service date at the frontend versus the latter part of the year? And
maybe expand your answer to talk a little bit about some of the regulatory challenges of some of these projects that are
listed on page 18 of the data book and your expectations with regard to how they apply to the expected in-service dates.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah, sure. I'll tell you what, I'm going to answer the last part of that question and then I'm
going to ask Rory to give you a little more detail on the Constitution project and what's going on.
The projects that many of which are on 18 there, many of those projects are along our existing right-of-way. And so to
the degree they are along our existing right-of-way, much less public resistance and certainly that's one of the huge
advantages of Transco is that it's already got right-of-way in the extremely heavily populated areas that are very
difficult to establish any new routes in. And so most of those projects are expansion along that existing right-of-way,
you can see that one big exception is that leg coming down on Atlantic Sunrise, but our team has really gotten ahead of
that and has done a nice job of getting out and getting some of the tougher areas of right-of-way pinned down on that
one.
And so I would say we're very fortunate to have the established right-of-ways that we have. And I would say
Constitution is an example of one where we didn't have existing right-of-ways. And I think is kind of foreshadows what
the industry is up against in terms of getting new pipelines built in areas like this. And particularly as you get further
into New York and New England area, it gets more difficult as you get into those areas.
And everybody wants lower priced energy, but nobody wants the pipeline in their backyard, and that's simply the issue
that we're facing there. And we really need some political leadership to really establish an energy policy that would
encourage and help the public understand the benefit of having these lower-priced energy into their areas. On the
Constitution piece I'm going to turn that over to Rory to talk about the detail of the permitting there.
<Q - Mark La France Reichman>: And just real quickly, is the challenge more at the state level, it's more at the state
level than the federal agencies, correct?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: It is certainly. In general, that is correct. In the case of Constitution, it is almost squarely on
the state there. But the challenge is, is when the feds have delegated their authority to the state, and the state doesn't see
it as something they critically need. That's the reason we have interstate commerce laws is so that one state can block
another state from enjoying the benefits of infrastructure. And yet in some of these cases for whatever reason the feds
have delegated some of their authority, and that is where we run into some of these problems. Rory, if you will take the
permit, please. Thanks.
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: Okay. Yeah, that was a great runway to kind of where we are at from a regulatory standpoint
to get this project in service. I think everybody is aware that some time ago we got our FERC certificate for this project.
But as Alan pointed out, some of the permitting had been delegated to the State of New York.
We have most everything we need other than the New York DEC final permit on this project. We do have all of our
land and right-of-way [audio gap] (56:43). We are what I would call in the final throes of working through some final
details on some wetland issues and the New York DEC, I feel like has really rolled up their sleeves, they are working
with us very closely on trying to get the remaining questions answered. And we're very optimistic that we're going to be
getting a permit here in the next couple of months. And I believe there's also Corp of Engineers permit that would
follow that, but that's more of a sequencing issue than an issue where we expect any type of dispute or anything like
that.
Once we get started and like I said we believe that will be in a couple of months and take about a year to construct.
That's not exactly right, but for planning purposes, just figure a year or so. If we get the New York DEC permits and
then the permits from the [ph] Corp of Engineers, which will follow say middle of the summer then we can be in
service in the middle of the summer in 2016. If they come in later, just kind of use that year timeline as how much we
would move back the in-service date.
But I would just say in general right now I feel better about this Constitution project and where we are at than I have in
the last two years. Things have really been coming together. People have been very engaged at the agencies. They're

trying to do their job, and I think because of the climate in New York, their standard is very high. But they're just going
to make sure they have all of their ducks in a row, and I think we're very close to that point.
<Q - Mark La France Reichman>: So the DEC is taking public comments until May 14, then you think that they
could file or grant the permit say in the June timeframe?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: I think that's the case. This latest refiling that we did with New York DEC was merely
procedural. In fact a year prior we had done the exact same thing, but we basically canceled and refiled with all the
existing information that we've been building up in the project. And in fact the New York DEC came out and said that
they required to have this open comment period, but they said, look, if you've already commented, we got your
comment, we're going to be using and considering all of the previous comments that have been supplied. So the
additional 14 day period would be for if there are any new comments that hadn't been already covered by the previous
comment period, then those would come in. But I think all of that's been run down to ground pretty sufficiently, and I
don't really see that as introducing any new risk into the timeline that we see before us now.
<Q - Mark La France Reichman>: And not to flog it too much more, but – so this was for the water quality
certificate application. So what about the air title permit related to the compressor station upgrade?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: I think we've got all that. This water issue is the issue that's really kind of the last big push we
need to get through.

Thank you. And next we'll move on to Brian Lasky with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Brian Lasky>: Good morning. Just curious on the shut-in volumes, can you just quantify the impact of that for
the quarter or just the magnitude going forward?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: I'm sorry, could you repeat that...
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Shut-in volumes.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Oh, shut-in volumes.
<Q - Brian Lasky>: The shut-in volumes, yes, can you just quantify that?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Sure. One of the probably most obvious pieces on that is Cabot has made some
announcements on that, and we expect that to be between about 300 million and 500 million barrels a day of shut-in
volumes over a number that would grow, and we think that's probably for about five months or six months. And most
of that we think will just be here in the second quarter during the shoulder months. And so they can make good money
at very low prices up there, but when the systems are full up there, and there's not enough market, they really get the
spot, incremental sale gets extremely low and puts pressure on their other production. Since they're such a large
producer in the region, they tend to put pressure against their own sales. And so we think this is short-lived and maybe
second and into the third-quarter a little bit, but that's about it. And so that's the amount we expect.
<Q - Brian Lasky>: Got it. And then just I was wondering if you could just walk us through high level, I'm sure you
are going to go through this more at the Analyst Day, but just high level, how you guys are thinking about volumes
across your – your gathering and processing in the Western and Northeast through the balance of the year, if you could
just provide a high level trajectory, how you're thinking about that?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yes, sure. I would say in the West volumes continue to remain pretty flat, pretty steady out
there, and the rate escalators that we have in our contracts over time have basically kept our fee-based gathering

revenue is extremely flat in the West despite some pretty light declines. And so I would think we would expect that to
continue. I think the bigger question will come into the 2016, 2017 timeframes in terms of what kind of continued
drilling might occur.
The one area we are seeing some continued activity that our team has done a great job of capturing is in the San Juan
basin, particularly with the Mancos play, and the team has done a great job of continuing to capture that business, and
of course, the volumes in Bucking Horse will continue to grow and that plant just got really, as we speak, is really just
getting lined out to build a ramp up to full throughput on that facility. So those are kind of the drivers that I think will
keep us relatively flat, and we'll just have to wait and see what holds for 2016 and 2017 depending on gas prices and
how those move over time.
In the Northeast, I would say, continued very, very impressive production rates from wells, particularly the Utica dry
that we really have – to some degree have not built into our plan, but we're seeing more and more evidence that the
combination of the Utica dry along with the Marcellus wet particularly around our OBM system has some pretty
powerful combination of economics for producers, and of course the other side of that coin is the great success that
they're having is continuing to put pressure on the bottlenecks and constraints getting out of the area.
And so, again, I think we're excited about seeing all this demand pool coming into the market on our Transco system
because we know where there are some great supplies that can help feed that for years to come and continue to grow
the market steadily, but I think we're going to continue to see pretty moderate drilling in the Marcellus and the Utica, as
forecast. I don't see really big changes to that, and I think really the only surprise to us for the quarter was just the
shut-ins due to low prices was really the only surprise we've seen on the volume side.
<Q - Brian Lasky>: Got it. So would you characterize what you've seen thus far in the first quarter as pretty consistent
with what you are planning in the guidance?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yes.
<Q - Brian Lasky>: Absent the shut-ins?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yes. Very close to it, yes. Staying right in line with our expectations.
<Q - Brian Lasky>: And then maybe just one last question. You talked a little bit about the dry gas Utica and one of
your competitors was out there talking about potential opportunity there. I was just wondering if you guys could talk
about the competitive dynamics for some of those opportunities that you're seeing right now with the increase in the
number of MLPs up in the region and also in light of what's going on in the broader commodity environment?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yes, I would just say whoever has got the pipe in place and has the best market outlet is
probably going to win that business up there, and we've positioned ourselves very well to get that accomplished. And
anybody can always come in and buy business and so forth, but I think we're positioned to really make a nice return on
our investment by just capturing the business that we're well positioned to capture in the area, and so I think we'll
continue to do that.
But clearly one of the key issues up there is going to be a multitude of market outlets, not just any one market outlet,
but multiple market outlets, and we're trying to make sure as we grow our system, we're really investing our efforts in
making sure that we've got best market outlets for the gas up there, and so that's involved a large team on both our
marketing side, on the gathering end as well as our team from Transco and our Atlantic Gulf team really trying to make
sure we're providing the very best market outlets for the producers up there. And just like that's always been a winner
for us out West, we think that'll be a winner for us in the Northeast as well long-term.
<Q - Brian Lasky>: Thank you. And just one final on Appalachian Connector there. Do you have to negotiate directly
with the Park Service there? Is that how that one works? And does that require an act of Congress. Can you just maybe
just walk through the regulatory process for that project in particular, and kind of what you guys have baked in to your
timeline in terms of the regulatory schedule?

<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yes. Maybe we'll get into that level of detail a little more at the Analyst Day. I would just
say we worked pretty hard to stay away from areas that would require that kind of protracted permitting requirements
in the area. But it's an area that requires some pretty careful orchestration to step through, and we will provide some
more detail on the Appalachian Connector at the May analyst meeting.
<Q - Brian Lasky>: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you very much.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Abhi Rajendran with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Abhiram Rajendran>: Hi, guys good morning.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Good morning.
<Q - Abhiram Rajendran>: A couple quick questions. Now that the commodity backdrop has stabilized a little bit, do
you have any update on the drop-down of the remaining NGL, petchem projects to the WMB level? I know last update
you guys gave was that was going to get pushed out maybe to later into the year, but any updated color there will be
helpful?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Abhi, this is Don. Really no update at this point, we can talk more about it at the Analyst
Day, but there is no urgent need to do it and certainly we feel better about it when equities are trading better. So that's
kind of where we stand.
<Q - Abhiram Rajendran>: Okay, got it. And then last quick one for me, looking ahead to Analyst Day, are you guys
thinking about reintroducing the segment level guidance which you had last year to kind of help get some color by
segment what's going on in terms of volumes and margins and what not?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yes, Abhi, I would just say, we haven't confirmed that yet and so just stay tuned for
Analyst Day.
<Q - Abhiram Rajendran>: Okay, got it. Thanks very much.
Operator
Thank you. And next we'll move on to Timm Schneider with Evercore.
<Q - Timm A. Schneider>: Hey, good morning, guys. Most of my questions have been answered, so I have a macro
question for you guys. How do you see the Northeast NGL scenario play out, right? So you have one of your peers is
saying they're going to be running at 90% utilization just firing NGLs into the basin. You're getting into the shoulder
season where it's no real propane demand. There's a lack of storage. How do you think about realizations up in the
Northeast and getting those NGLs to a home where they're actually needed?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yes. Great question, Timm. And as you know, we've been concerned about this since the
Bluegrass days and we remain very concerned about the clearing of liquids out of the area. And I think unfortunately
the answer is they're going to get cleared out of there by rail, and just as evidence what's going on in that space, our
Conway rail facility for the first time that I can ever remember is – even though we've dramatically expanded our rail
position, our rail rack position there at Conway, our inbound, which I don't ever remember this occurring, our inbound
capacity on rail is fully contracted for the summer months. And so I think that tells you kind of what's going on, which
is all those products getting put on rail and it's going to any home it can for storage and Conway is an attractive place
for that. And of course, Conway then has great access into the Belvieu market to when it's needed there as well.

So, I think that's what we're going to see. I think we're already seeing it. And I think the wholesale marketers of the
NGLs have realized that's one of the few places that you can clear those liquids and then sell them into the market as
the market demands them. So, I think that's what we're going to continue to see, and we're the beneficiary of it there
with Conway, and if anything, we're probably guilty of under-pricing that service, given how strong the demand has
been there for that.
<Q - Timm A. Schneider>: That's interesting. Can you tell us how much it is to rail from East to Conway?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: No. I don't have the detail on exactly what that rate is.
<Q - Timm A. Schneider>: Got it. And in terms of building additional storage in the Northeast specifically, I realize
it's all about ground storage because it's depleted reservoirs and it doesn't really work for NGLs. Do you have any sense
of how much more it is to build storage in the Northeast than in the Gulf Coast?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Well, if you don't have a salt formation, you really don't have a very attractive place. There
are a few projects that we've been looking at through the Access team and looking at some areas to try to develop that.
But I would just say it is the scale of opportunity is very limited for storage because we don't have the big salt lenses
like you do in either the Conway area or the Gulf Coast area, and it's those salt lenses that provide the opportunity for
storage. Without that it's very difficult and frankly that's one of the reasons that the Gulf Coast – petchem space has
continued to be prolific for year after year after year is one it has access and ports, but also it's got the great advantage
of salt dome storage for both the feedstocks as well as the finished product. And that's in the olefin space. And so those
are the big advantages. And frankly, I don't see that changing anytime soon, so very expensive to build any kind of
storage capability in the Northeast because mostly it's going to be above-ground storage capabilities.
<Q - Timm A. Schneider>: So is it your view that the Northeast, in fact, does need another export solution over call it
the next two years, three years?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yes.
<Q - Timm A. Schneider>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Thanks, Timm.

Thank you. And next we'll move on to Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.
<Q - Jeremy B. Tonet>: Good morning.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Good morning.
<Q - Jeremy B. Tonet>: Thanks for all the color this morning. It's been very helpful. Just wanted to touch base, there's
been some chatter in the marketplace for the potential of a family level consolidation to improve the family's cost of
capital. Our impression has been that there's not really any rush or need to do something like this right away that we
can give the post ACMP structure a chance to prove itself and earn a re-rating from the market. I was just wondering if
you could provide any thoughts on Williams' cost of capital and any other updates or thoughts on family level
consolidation if that makes sense.
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Jeremy, this is Don. I think we've discussed that periodically in the past in terms of the
pros and cons. And we do believe that WPZ is positioned to improve its cost of capital. So, we really don't have really
anything to add here today and we can certainly talk more about that during Analyst Day.
<Q - Jeremy B. Tonet>: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks.
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Thank you.

And our next question comes from Christine Cho with Barclays. Ms. Cho, please check your mute function.
<Q - Christine Cho>: Sorry. I just had two very quick follow-ups. The 80% swap at Geismar to Belvieu, when does
that roll off, if at all?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: There is a multitude of contracts there, Christine, and so none of them, they don't all start
in, but typically, they're not real long-term contracts that are established in that market. But there's a variety of terms on
those contracts.
<Q - Christine Cho>: And then with the maintenance CapEx, I know you addressed the regulated maintenance CapEx.
But what about for the well connects. I mean if we're seeing a slowdown in drilling and completion, could that number
come in lighter than you expected?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yes, slightly. But as Bob pointed out, we've got a lot of catching up to do still. We're still
working off of quite an inventory of getting caught up. So even if the drilling does slow down, the well connects will
still keep coming for quite some time.
<Q - Christine Cho>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Thanks.

And our next question comes from Ross Payne with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Ross Payne>: How are you doing, guys?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Great. How are you?
<Q - Ross Payne>: Good, good. I was wondering if you could give us a little more detail on the Geismar startup kind
of getting pushed back into June. Are there any other issues outside of the heat exchangers that you talked about in Q4?
And has anything really changed from Q4 to where we stand today in terms of trying to get it up fully to specs?
Thanks.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yes. Thank you. And appreciate the question allows to expand on that a little bit because
we really haven't hit that much today. Couple of things I really want to point out there. One is that we did have the
major equipment for the expansion up and running. And in fact as we sit here today, we're utilizing many of the
components of the expansion facility. So contrary to what probably you'd be led to believe, it's not like we've just got
the base plant sitting over here running and the expanded plant is sitting idle. We are utilizing in this period a lot of the
big elements like the furnaces, for instance, on the expanded facility. And in fact, we had the major equipment up and
rolling when we had this transformer fail on us.
And so I think that's very good news because we've been able to test all the major components, and in fact, we're using
this time period to put load test on the expansion parts of the facility. But at the end of the day this EBR system is what
is bottlenecking, if you will, the production on the ethylene side of the plant, and until we get that transformer back in,
then we can't go on with the rest of the plant.
So the good news is, we're not sitting here wondering about the rest of the major equipment in the expanded plant.
We've actually been able to utilize it and get it up and tested. And so really there is nothing simple in a big complex
plant like this, but to try to put it in simple terms, we've got the plant – the expanded plant has been up and tested and
it's a matter of getting this transform repaired at the manufacturer's facility and getting it plugged back in. And we did
run that compressor that this transform drives and everything was fine with that compressor, and so it's just a matter of
getting the transformer plugged back in.

<Q - Ross Payne>: Okay. And in the last conference call, you guys talk about the heat exchangers getting up to about
70%. Are you comfortable now that they can get all the way up to 90% plus or are there other things you need to do on
that front? Thanks.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Again, we've kind of had the luxury – and fortunately, we've had a luxury of time of
getting some of those things lined out. And we had some [ph] fouling (1:19:42) and some residue oil coating on some
of those highly efficient exchangers, and we've gotten those cleaned up and they're performing very well now.
