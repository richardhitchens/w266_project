I would now like to turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Stephen Hemsley.
Stephen J. Hemsley
Good morning and thank you for joining us. We plan to keep our prepared remarks brief today. Just a month-and-a-half
ago, we held our annual investor conference and fourth quarter results are very much in line with or slightly stronger
than we discussed at the conference. So our focus is now well into 2017.
We ended the year with modestly stronger than expected growth across our businesses and as the story has been
throughout the year, customer retention and expanding relationships played a central role in our member and revenue
growth for both UnitedHealthcare and Optum.
To briefly recap 2016, revenue of $184.8 billion grew nearly $28 billion or 18%, as earnings from operations advanced
over 20% to $13.3 billion. Net earnings advanced 24% to $7.3 billion and adjusted net earnings per share grew 25% to
$8.05 per share for the year.
Fourth quarter 2016 results included $47.5 billion in revenues, more than $3.5 billion in earnings from operations, net
earnings of $1.9 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $2.11. All of these results were at or modestly ahead of the
expectations set at our investor conference in late November.
Operating cash flows for the year were $9.8 billion, 1.34 times net earnings, within our range of expectation, despite
timing changes in several state payments. We look forward to the opportunities of 2017, as we continue to drive our
agenda of quality based Net Promoter or NPS performance and growth. Building on the momentum of strong NPS
gains in 2016, in that vein, we began 2017 with one of the stronger operational starts to a new year we have ever had.
We remain fully committed to meeting or exceeding the 2017 outlook we previewed with you at our investor
conference, and as Dave Wichmann and Larry Renfro will discuss, we have solid growth momentum going into 2017.
So we will turn to their commentary beginning with Larry.
Larry C. Renfro
Thank you, Steve. Customers of both UnitedHealthcare and Optum have been responding to our focused NPS quality
and value efforts. These are the building blocks of valuable, deep, long-term relationships. Customer retention was a
factor in UnitedHealth Group's 2016 growth and that continues as we enter 2017.
The healthcare customers we serve turn to us to solve large, complex problems. UnitedHealthcare, for example, is
increasingly helping states manage care for their medically complex, highly vulnerable and most costly populations.
We also continue to assist employers with effective, innovative programs to support the needs of their retirees and
employees challenged by chronic health issues.
For Optum, 2016 was a distinguishing year for developing and deepening relationships across healthcare, as we deliver
more value to the marketplace. In the first quarter, we announced a strategic relationship with Walgreens, offering more
choice and greater savings to both consumers and their sponsors.
We also entered into a technology partnership with Availity, a leading health IT provider, to meaningfully improve
connectivity and processing for payers, care providers and consumers. In the second quarter, several large organizations
engaged Optum to deliver pharmacy care services in 2017, in response to our progressive clinical model, the whole
person care.
Quest Diagnostics joined us in the third quarter, in a collaboration that will span several of Optum's businesses starting
with Optum 360. We were honored to receive several important multi-year contracts from the Department of Veterans
Affairs and we partnered with Allscripts across OptumInsight and OptumHealth.

In the fourth quarter, we were pleased to announce a new relationship with CVS health that will strengthen their retail
and our pharmacy care service offerings to the benefit of consumers.
Moving into this year, last week, we announced we will join with Surgical Care Affiliates, or SCA. This combination
will expand the breadth of care delivery capabilities at Optum, as we continue to evolve a comprehensive ambulatory
care platform, including primary, urgent, surgical, and home care, all designed to deliver higher value and quality
healthcare to consumers and payers. Surgeons operating in SCA centers perform nearly 1 million surgeries annually, in
over 200 locations, across 33 states, with consistently high quality consumer satisfaction and improved value.
In SCA, we will grow and build upon a leader we know well in the high growth market, a market where we have
already gained meaningful market presence, experience, and insight through OptumCare. The momentum inside our
businesses comes from the growth and depth of these relationships and the breadth of sustainable value we can offer.
In 2016, Optum revenues grew 24% to $83.6 billion, as earnings from operations grew 32% to more than $5.6 billion,
slightly ahead of our most recent outlook. Fourth quarter 2016 was the first anniversary of the Catamaran acquisition
and we were pleased with the operating earnings growth of 18% in the quarter for Optum overall, led by 27% growth at
OptumRx. Margins reached 8.1% in the fourth quarter and were 6.7% for the full year, up 40 basis points over 2015.
Looking to 2017, OptumInsight's year-end backlog grew 21% to $12.6 billion. As we stand back from Optum and look
at our progress, we're advancing the quality and consistency of our services to customers, simplifying our business,
strengthening our leadership team, and focusing our resources and investments in the most important growth trends in
healthcare.
While there is more to be done in the United States and globally, the opportunities continue to grow even faster and
larger. We are optimistic about our outlook for 2017, with revenues exceeding $90 billion and earnings from operations
in the range of $6.2 billion to $6.4 billion.
In 2017, at Optum and across UnitedHealth Group, we are committed to grow by developing stronger relationships,
delivering consistent value to strengthen NPS, and helping make health systems work better for more people.
Now, let me turn it over to Dave.
David Scott Wichmann
Thank you, Larry. UnitedHealthcare also enters 2017 with strong momentum. Fourth quarter and full year 2016
revenues were well balanced, growing by double-digit percentages in every product category. Medical costs remained
well managed, with the commercial medical cost trend ending the year in line with expectations at approximately 6%.
2016 was one of the strongest organic growth years in our history, with more than 2 million medical members joining.
UnitedHealthcare continues to build well diversified growth momentum, as customer and consumer retention rates
continue to improve broadly, with notable strength in small and mid-sized commercial groups and in Medicare.
In the full risk commercial group business, we grew by 205,000 people in the quarter and 375,000 people for the year,
providing a positive starting point as we enter 2017. This growth was broad-based, appropriately priced and balanced
across geographic regions, products and customer types.
In the self-funded segment, the market has been stable, with strengthening employment rates helping us grow within
existing customers. In 2016, UnitedHealthcare grew to serve an additional 335,000 commercial fee-based consumers,
including 20,000 more in the fourth quarter.
As expected, individual business declined in the fourth quarter. Premium deficiency reserves taken earlier this year
were sufficient and we maintained an appropriate and prudent residual reserve for claims not yet received. Consistent
with our commitments to you early in 2016, we do not believe our ACA compliant individual business carries any
financial exposure forward into 2017.

Turning to Medicare. In 2016, we grew our medical membership organically by 625,000 people, about two-thirds
through Medicare Advantage. 2016 was among our best Medicare growth years, but we expect 2017 to be even
stronger. Our positive Medicare Advantage performance in 2016 was driven by the combination of premium and
benefits stability, rising Stars performance and improved service and clinical performance, all leading to record
retention rates. These same factors are driving 2017 growth. We expect to serve nearly 1 million more seniors with
medical benefits this year, including more than 0.75 million seniors in Medicare Advantage, balanced and diversified
by region, channel and product.
Moving to Medicaid. Adding 100,000 people in the quarter brought our full year growth to 585,000, once again,
broad-based and organic from new programs in both new and existing states. In 2017, we will introduce services in the
states of Virginia and Missouri, and plan to enter Colorado via the pending partnership with Rocky Mountain Health
Plan, further expanding the number of state partners we serve.
As we recap the year, UnitedHealthcare revenues of $148.6 billion grew 13% year-over-year, virtually all organic, as it
has been over the past several years. Every business grew revenues by double-digit percentage in the fourth quarter and
for the full year 2016. Earnings from operations exceeded $7.6 billion and grew 13% or over $900 million.
Turning to UnitedHealth Group as a whole, our fourth quarter revenues of $47.5 billion grew 9% over last year. The
fourth quarter consolidated medical care ratio decreased 190 basis points to 80.8%, slightly outperforming our recent
investor conference outlook. The full year care ratio of 81.2% improved 50 basis points year-over-year, with core
businesses overcoming both the pressures in the individual market in the first half of 2016 and the higher levels of
reserve development in 2015.
The full year operating cost ratio improved 30 basis points to 15.2%, in line with our investor conference forecast.
As we step into 2017, there are a number of positive indications that reflect our continuing momentum. Our focus on
quality and NPS is intensifying and bearing results. Consumers continue to engage more deeply in their health, earning
$255 million in healthy behavior incentives in 2016. We began the year crisply in customer installation and service on
record levels of new and diversified growth across Optum and UnitedHealthcare.
Optum enters the year with record backlog, people served and adjusted scripts and with Optum Bank crossing the $7
billion mark in consumer health assets under management. Optum is pursuing a strong vision as a health services
organization, unlike any in existence today. We will continue to develop our business to fit that vision in 2017.
Our merger with SCA will significantly expand our capabilities for consumers, payers and hospital partners at
OptumCare, while establishing presence in new markets. UnitedHealthcare enters the year with strong retention rates
and new business growth across all three lines of business, and we are seeing improving performance and earnings
contribution from our hospital company and health plan in Brazil.
We should touch briefly on Penn Treaty, an industry topic we first discussed in 2010 that finally seems to be resolving.
Penn Treaty is a financially distressed long-term care insurance company with no affiliation to us. While we have never
sold long-term care policies, under state laws, health insurers will be assessed a share of the guarantee funds needed to
protect Penn Treaty's policyholders.
We expect to accrue an approximately $350 million operating charge for our portion of the assessment. This charge
will be funded over several years, and the cash will be largely recovered through premium tax credits over time. While
this outcome is well-known, current accounting practice only allows this charge to be recognized when a final court
order of liquidation is entered. When that ultimately occurs, we will incorporate the impact in GAAP earnings while
excluding it from adjusted earnings per share.
To wrap up, we remain committed to our outlook for 2017 revenues of $197 billion to $199 billion, adjusted net
earnings of $9.30 per share to $9.60 per share, and cash flows from operations of $11.5 billion to $12 billion. Only 17
days into the year, we think this posture strikes an appropriate balance of optimism and prudence.
Steve?

Stephen J. Hemsley
Thank you, Dave. You may notice a separate press release this morning announcing that Tim Flynn has joined the
Board of UnitedHealth Group. Tim is an exceptionally creative and solutions oriented executive, the former global
managing partner of KPMG. Tim has deep financial and global operating expertise. He's also deeply versed in
corporate governance and we are thrilled to welcome Tim to our Board of Directors.
We'll close with a few words on the overall domestic healthcare landscape. To be clear, we have no better sense than
anyone else concerning the timing or any ultimate actions with respect to the Affordable Care Act. So any questions
and responses on that subject need to have that clear context. And as you would anticipate, we will not speculate on
hypothetical or provocative questions in this area this morning.
Our posture has remained consistent for some time now. We remain positive and constructive with respect to what
ultimately evolves in the next phase of healthcare change. We see the opportunity for robust state-based healthcare
markets, offering flexible commercial benefits, flexible Medicaid available to eligible, as well as paying beneficiaries,
well-structured and managed high-risk pools, exchanges where states choose to sustain them and much more.
We believe all of these taken together can represent effective, local, state-based coverage systems which can well
accommodate those currently in the ACA individual exchanges as well as serve as channels to further expanding
coverage if that remains the focus.
We see this approach as being simpler, offering more flexibility, more choice, and more affordability to both
consumers and state and federal sponsors. And as we have for many years, we remain staunch advocates for affordable
coverage, infrastructure that supports a modern healthcare system, including a strong and diversified future oriented
healthcare workforce and improvements to government-sponsored benefits that incorporated better use of technology,
information, and care resources for Americans.
UnitedHealth Group, Optum and UnitedHealthcare remain fully committed to our mission, to help people live healthier
lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. Today, we see more opportunities to serve and grow in
the next 10 years than the past 10 years. We remain an adaptable, innovative and restless enterprise. We see many ways
we can work. Our work can continue to improve, if we stay focused on that mission, and we're committed to pursue
that goal in 2017 and the decade ahead.
We thank you for your interest today and, now, we'll take questions, again, one at a time, please, and we'll try to
respond to as many as we can today.
Q&A
Operator
The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Matthew Borsch with
Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Matthew Borsch>: Yes, hi. Thank you. Good morning. I just was hoping that you could address the question of
the Pennsylvania Medicaid contracts and how the latest development in the rebid might or might not have affected your
guidance relative to what you had already baked in for those contracts.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Sure, I'll have Austin do that, but those will not affect our guidance at all for 2017. Austin?
<A - Austin T. Pittman>: Sure. First, let me say that our commitment has been and still is to focus on the service of
the people in Pennsylvania. That's what we get up and do every single day. So we're staying very focused there.
As for the Medicaid program or health choices, as you know, we currently serve about 220,000 Pennsylvanians. The
procurement process, as has been noted, has been particularly troubling to us, both the lack of transparency and the
material shift in the outcome itself. If you recall, we went from retaining our existing footprint and expanding statewide

in the initial award to being eliminated from the program through this latest protest and rebid process.
So we have formally protested, as others have. We're pursuing all of our available options to get transparency. As we
get acquainted with the details, we'll take further action from there. In the meantime, as I said at the start, we'll stay
focused on serving the people of Pennsylvania.
<Q - Matthew Borsch>: Okay. So just on the guidance, I had thought that your Medicaid enrollment adds for this year
included maybe a material number for Pennsylvania. Was I wrong about that?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: No, I just think that this process will take some time. I think the protest will extend and I
think we also have other opportunities throughout the course of the year. So I don't think that a single state like that will
affect our outlook.
<Q - Matthew Borsch>: I got it. Okay. Thank you.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from David Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - David Howard Windley>: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Acknowledging that your intent in
OptumCare is to be multi-payer, I wondered if you could comment on how much of UnitedHealthcare's medical cost is
flowing through OptumCare, what your goals for that might be, and then, how Surgical Care Affiliates folds into that or
leverages that opportunity? Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Sure. I think we'll have Larry kind of comment on that. I guess I would focus on the fact
that we serve multiple payers through our OptumCare platform, have for some time that the portfolio continues to
expand, SCA fits right into it. Do you want to pick it up?
<A - Larry C. Renfro>: Sure. David, I'm going to go back a little bit and talk about how we kind of got where we're at
with OptumCare, where we are in terms of SCA at this point in time. So if you go back in time, five years ago, we had
this One Optum plan that we put together, and as part of that structure, we had a 75 market strategy.
Now, all of this relates to UHC and how we have positioned Optum from the start. So with the 75 market strategy, we
kind of looked at the marketplace at a $500 billion marketplace that now has grown to $1 trillion. And as part of that,
we have looked at what the growth pillars are going to be in the future and OptumCare is a piece of that, and that's
where SCA will fit.
And as SCA is a great organization that we're bringing in, that's going to add scope and scale, it's going to be very
complementary to what we're doing. So we feel pretty strong about SCA. We feel pretty strong about OptumCare being
a big piece of our strategy going forward in the future to get to the breadth of the market that we are trying to penetrate.
I might ask Dan Schumacher to comment a bit about the UHC side. Dan?
<A - Daniel Schumacher>: Sure, thank you, Larry. Good morning, David.
<Q - David Howard Windley>: Hi.
<A - Daniel Schumacher>: As you look at surgeries broadly, obviously, the overwhelming majority of those still take
place in a hospital setting, both inpatient and outpatient. And so, the reality is that there's a huge opportunity for greater
penetration for surgeries to take place in an ambulatory setting. And when you look at the kind of quality that can be
demonstrated through an ambulatory setting, as well as patient satisfaction, that frankly runs north of 90 when you look
at the Net Promoter Scores and you see a cost profile that runs about half of what you would expect in a hospital
setting, there's tremendous opportunity.

And within UnitedHealthcare, for some time, we've been focused on site of service for several years and we've made
some headway, but the reality is we think there's an opportunity to really accelerate and we think the partnership with
SCA provides a great potential.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: And if I'm not mistaken, and I'll ask Dave Wichmann correct me on this, a little less than
half or roughly a half of the activity flow that goes through OptumCare is UnitedHealthcare and only about 12% of
SCA is UnitedHealthcare; is that true?
<A - David Scott Wichmann>: That's right, Steve.
<Q - David Howard Windley>: Excellent. Thank you.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Yeah. Next question, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from James, Sarah with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
<Q - Sarah E. James>: Thank you. United felt strong Medicare growth in January. The penetration for the overall
market went up more than I've ever seen in January versus December jump. So can you talk to your view of underlying
long-term growth for Medicare Advantage, either for United specifically or the industry, and your view on where MA
penetration could go now that we have the younger population aging in? If you have any numbers around how much of
your 2016 growth was from fee for service, that would be helpful as well. Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Sure. I think Steve Nelson can handle this.
<A - Steven Nelson>: Sure, thanks, Steve. Good morning. Steve Nelson. Maybe I'll talk a little bit about our growth,
not speculate on the broader industry, but we did see a higher penetration this year, as you noted, and so, the program
continues to be really popular and very effective.
Just commenting on our growth, to reiterate what Dave said in his prepared comments, the growth that we see coming
out of AEP is very strong and in line with the guidance that we provided in our November investor conference. And
one sort of important point there is about 85% of our full year guidance, actually, comes to us on January 1. So the bulk
of that membership is already with us.
We have some pretty good insight into the mix as well. And Sarah, as we've talked about before, about half of that was
from our group business. So we have a lot of insight into that membership. In fact, a lot of times we have claims
experience there. And then, we also had broad growth across all of our geographies, markets and products. So it's really
the product stability, the product portfolio that offers choice is really resonating in the market.
So there are several drivers that I would attribute to at least our growth, as we are experiencing this kind of strong
growth for 2017, again, the product portfolio that we've worked hard over the past several years to put this in place,
also, really strong engagement and with our distribution partnership across all of our channels, really strong brand in
the market for UnitedHealthcare, and then, also the investments and the improvements we've made in, as Dave noted,
in our Stars quality, and also, in our member experience. So I think this really positions us well to receive this growth
and to continue to grow not only in 2017 but beyond.
In terms of the conversions, it's a little early to get into specific details about the conversions from fee for service, but
again, there were some market share growth and Medicare Advantage overall, and I think it's a testament to the
effectiveness of the program where you see higher outcomes, lower costs and very high satisfaction.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Thanks, Steve. Despite the fact that MA has been underfunded over the last several years,
it continues to take share with the take, 1.3%, 1.5% market share shift of the indication. That's been pretty steady
despite the fact that it's been underfunded. It is clearly the most popular form of Medicare. It serves lower income
groups. It has great retention value, and we would think that that will continue so that the share of Medicare Advantage

will ultimately continue to grow and take its place in terms of the government programs.
Next question, please.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Stephen Baxter>: Hi. This is Steve Baxter on for Justin. A question for you about the OptumInsight backlog.
Appreciating that the backlog here is at a record level, but we noticed that it was flat sequentially for the first time since
2013 heading into the ACA implementation. I was hoping you could speak to what you're hearing from clients and, in
particular, are you seeing any uncertainty with hospital buying patterns just given the uncertainty of where we might be
going with repeal and replace?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Sure, Larry, do you want to take it? Or Bill Miller?
<A - Larry C. Renfro>: I will start...
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Okay.
<A - Larry C. Renfro>: ...and then, I will hand it to Bill. I think that if you look at the fourth quarter, you'll see that
we had a pretty strong fourth quarter, especially OptumInsight, and Bill will speak to that in a second. So all of our
financials were in line with our expectations.
One thing that to keep in mind when it comes to technology services and how we look at Optum360 across the board is
that we're very diversified, when we really service 300 health plans, 4,500 hospitals, over a couple hundred government
agencies and so forth. So we have a lot of opportunity and it's a diversified opportunity.
So Bill, just comment on the quarter.
<A - Bill Miller>: Yeah. Thanks, Larry. Thanks, Steve. Yeah, we're real happy with our performance in Q4 and a part
of that confidence in going forward and with respect to the pipeline and the backlog is there's several metrics that we
look at. And while hospital is one sector that we work with, you understand that we have really wide constituencies of
payer, provider, life sciences companies and government, and across the board, we're seeing enormous growth in our
pipeline. Our sales and some of the size of the sales at each of those geographies of clients has grown dramatically
year-over-year.
And if I look at and search for slowdowns, we don't see it, because if you look at the solutions that we provide, they're
mission-critical, they're implementing modern technology, they have proven ROIs. So we're not seeing the slowdown
that perhaps is being felt in other places because of our diversity, the mission-critical nature of our solutions that we
bring to market. And so, we're seeing wide adoption.
And with respect to the backlog, while there may have been a little flatness quarter-over-quarter, if you look at the
year-over-year growth, it's a tremendous story. If you look at any given quarter, we're going to burn through some
backlog. There's projects that get completed. And so, that doesn't concern us. I think we look at the year-over-year
metric and feel really positive.
And heading into 2017, I think if you look at how much time we spend in the market, the way we've developed our
products and the interviews that we do with clients and the expansion of all of our key clients, it sets us up for another
really successful year, despite the fact that there is some uncertainty about ACA and others. That uncertainty almost
always creates opportunities for Optum, because clients are looking for ways to thrive and survive in these uncertain
times and Optum becomes a really relative and significant client and partner to talk to in those contexts.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Yeah, I couldn't agree with that more. Next question, please.

We'll take our next question from Peter Costa with Well Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Peter Heinz Costa>: Good morning. Thanks for the question. Can you give us some more specifics on a couple
outliers in the quarter, in particular, the unfavorable development in the fourth quarter and the higher interest in other
income in the quarter?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Sure. We'll split those out. Maybe Dan, the development and John Rex, the investment
income.
<A - Daniel Schumacher>: Sure. Good morning, Peter, Dan Schumacher.
<Q - Peter Heinz Costa>: Dan.
<A - Daniel Schumacher>: Maybe let me offer a couple of comments about medical overall, and then, more
specifically to your question around development. As you look at our consolidated medical care ratio for the quarter, it
was a little better than what we had discussed at the end of November. And then, inside that, I'd tell you that our
medical costs continue to be well controlled. And the other thing, as you look at development sort of quarter in, quarter
out, I think it's really important to remember that it's on a base medical spend on an annual basis of more than $115
billion. So when you look at the outcomes this quarter, in particular, it isn't particularly meaningful.
Looking specifically at this quarter, I'd tell you that as you look across this both from a geography perspective, look at
cost categories, I don't think that there's anything that is worth highlighting. I would tell you that it probably orients a
little bit more towards our government businesses, and underneath that, we've talked over time about some of the
efforts we've had around incentives related to quality and the underlying use that comes with that. And we've seen
some of that this quarter and that's showing up in those outcomes. But importantly, and overall, I'd tell you that our
medical baselines for all of our businesses were tracking in line with our expectations as we closed the year, and that
means that we're starting 2017 where we had planned.
<A - John Franklin Rex>: And, Peter, this is John Rex on investment income. So really two major elements driving
most of that. Put it in the category of just larger balances outstanding due to the growth we're seeing at UHC and
Optum Bank. So those are larger interest-earning balances across those books.
In addition, higher realized capital gains for our investment portfolio. So we did some proactive portfolio realignment
ahead of the Fed interest rate actions to capture some of that value and prepare to reinvest at higher rates going forward,
as those occurred. And so, we wanted to be proactive, as we were anticipating those events. And I'd say I think both
those elements rather balanced in terms of the higher investment income that you're seeing in the quarter.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Thank you. Next question, please.

We'll take our next question from Scott Fidel with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Scott Fidel>: Thanks. Steve, I wanted to ask a thematic question here just as we enter into the whole discussion
around corporate tax reform. And just thinking about the minimum medical loss ratios in that context and clearly, it
hasn't seemed like the minimum MLRs have proven to be that big of a deal the last couple of years, but just now, as we
think about sort of corporate tax reform, and then, sort of leveraging the benefits of that, do you think it might make
sense for the industry to, perhaps, sort of get more proactive on rethinking the minimum MLRs and maybe lobbying to
have some relief there? Or basically, the question is do you think that minimum MLRs could end up offsetting a lot of
the benefits to shareholders from corporate tax reform or not?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Yeah, so again, Scott, we're not going to really engage in commentary around policy or
what could or couldn't happen. The only comment I'd make about MLRs and why they were probably not as

controversial is because, for the most part, our offerings were pretty close to those MLR levels anyway, so that's pretty
much across the board. So that's why I think that they were managed and digested across the industry.
And beyond that, we're just not going to comment on what tax policy could be or what might come forward in terms of
changes in the ACA. And our commentary with the marketplace has really been more broadly about what could be
simpler, more sustainable, local market-based coverage approaches, and so, that's kind of where our level of
commentary has been.
<Q - Scott Fidel>: Yeah. Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Okay, sure. Next question, please.
Operator
Okay. We'll take our next question from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ralph Giacobbe>: Thanks. Good morning. I just want to go back to the SCAI deal. Obviously, it looks like a
platform deal in what's a fragmented market. So I guess, one, I just wanted to make sure I understand the strategy. Is it
to sort of accelerate the M&A pace or is it a little bit more of a test model, if you will, for now?
And then, how will you navigate and maybe have you had conversations with all the sort of various partnerships and
JVs, some of which are obviously with other payers as well as hospital systems that could create some friction?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Sure. Larry will comment on this, but we think this step is an important development step.
So we think this is the market leading platform we can build on. So we do think it's important and it fits nicely into the
whole narrative of a more comprehensive local market-based ambulatory care platform. So that's kind of the high level
thinking behind it.
Larry, do you want to pick it up?
<A - Larry C. Renfro>: Sure. And I'm going to ask Tami to talk about the footprint so that you get a feel for the
footprint and how everything is kind of going to work together inside Optum in regard to SCA and why it's a primary
focus for us. And then, I'm going to ask Amir Rubin really to talk about what's been going on in the diligence side of
this and what the business looks like.
I will caution you that we are in an approval process. So during this approval process, there are certain things,
obviously, that we can't do. But I think I can lay out kind of the strategy and these folks will be able to kind of back it
up. I probably didn't do a good job a few minutes ago of explaining it, but this goes back five years. This is a strategy
that we put in place to really go after what I would call the OptumCare business. It's one of our primary pillars for
growth.
We started with primary care, and I think that we've been growing primary care over the last few years. We probably
are around 21,000 physicians at this point. The second part of OptumCare was our urgent care with MedExpress and
other centers that we have set up with urgent care. And so, we're up to 250 centers there. So obviously, the surgery
center kind of starts to play out and add capabilities for us as we go forward.
So this is all about growth, and this is about us maintaining a position with the ambulatory side to really make this
move forward, not only here, but also globally. Because as we look and I won't stray here, but just for a second, but I
will tell you the work that we're doing in Brazil, the work that we're doing in London, what we're expecting to do
across Europe and so forth, this is all a process that would fit nicely in all of those markets.
So let me turn it over to Tami to kind of go through the footprint.
<A - Tami L. Reller>: Great. Thanks, Larry. And maybe just a couple of OptumCare broader perspectives and
numbers to give this context before Amir talks specifically about SCA. If you look at OptumCare today, it already
represents more than 50% of OptumHealth revenues, and obviously, this is an important growth platform, so we expect

more in the future.
Also, if you look at OptumCare, today, we have a footprint in 28 primary care markets and expect to expand into four
to six new markets per year. And so, as we look at the opportunity between OptumCare broadly and SCA, which today
has 200 locations in 33 states, which we noted earlier, there is an opportunity there to really look at that much more
holistically and make some good growth come from that.
Larry also noted more than 21,000 positions today and we would expect to continue to grow that as a nice clip into the
future as well. OptumCare probably 2,000 per year, as we move forward, so a tremendous amount of growth ahead
across the OptumCare platform.
<A - Amir Dan Rubin>: Great. And this is Amir Rubin. Just to add to Larry and Tami's comments. We did a detailed
due diligence process and we were very, very impressed with the exceptional SCA leadership and the model that SCA
has developed across the country. You heard from Steve's opening remarks, SCA has over 200 centers in 33 states, and
these are terrific centers with outstanding quality, accredited and certified by the highest accreditation bodies, NPS
scores, Net Promoter Scores of 90 on average, really high Net Promoter Scores, with delivering outstanding surgical
procedures at half the cost of inpatient settings, in partnership with surgeons, in partnership with health systems, many
of whom are our clients and serving communities very effectively.
As you heard from Tami, we're excited too, there's a nice overlap, probably about 50% overlap with the SCA market
and the OptumCare market. And moreover, SCA and its surgeons and the health systems that it partners with are now
looking to move even more complex cases into the ambulatory arena, such as joint replacements, hips, and knees, and
really, on the front end of delivering high quality, high service, and value-based care, serving all payers,
UnitedHealthcare, as you heard from Dan Schumacher, and across OptumCare, we serve over 85 payers that we were
very excited to continue serving the broad payer market, partnering with our health system clients and aligning with
physicians in the community
<A - Larry C. Renfro>: So this is Larry again. Let me just make one comment. So if you looked at our 75 market
strategy that we've been executing against today, we are in 28 markets. With this acquisition, we will pick up about 17
more markets. So about 50% of SCA markets overlap with us, but there are 17 new markets. So this is going to
accelerate our growth, obviously, and this is a very, very key point in the growth of OptumCare.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Good question. Thank you. Next, please.

We'll take our next question from Josh Raskin with Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Joshua Raskin>: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow up, I understand, Steve, you don't want to speculate
on potential regulatory changes, et cetera, so without getting into any details on what you're expecting, I guess, one,
have you spoken with the incoming President-Elect or his team? And then, are there any changes that you've made
strategically already? So forgetting about what can happen in the world, but is there anything you're doing in the
markets today that would relate to some things that you think could potentially happen?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: So Josh, I would have preferred to answer the last one compared to this one. We've
maintained a presence broadly in the healthcare sector, again, policy sector, and have been consistent for some time.
And I think you've seen our materials with respect to really advancing a simpler state-based healthcare system around
investments going forward into the healthcare sector, around affordability and good sustainable ways to advance
affordability.
So thematically, very much involved and we have been offering specific ideas with respect to that. It aligns with the
businesses that we've had and the philosophy and the mission of our enterprise about helping people live healthier lives
and about making the system work better for everyone, everyone being all the participants in the healthcare
marketplace. It has been more at, what I will call, a high level, and then, invoked more specifically when called upon.

We think that's a sustainable way. We have been on this for some time, prior to the outcome of any elections, et cetera.
So we would have been indifferent in terms of who would have proceeded that these would be the kinds of themes that
we think will drive a better and higher performing healthcare system that could serve more Americans.
And we continue to be on that track and I think the setup of our business, as we've said many times. The participation
across the expanse of the benefit markets and the continued diversification in the important markets with Optum
serving areas where we think we can bring our competencies around expertise around information and insights about
how healthcare could be organized and resources used more effectively and the virtuous application of technology to
drive a more modern healthcare system, those are things that are really native to our businesses at this point in time.
Very adaptable, so adaptability is a very important theme for us. We can move these things around to approach the
marketplace in different ways. And we think we have been developing the kind of assets and capabilities to serve a
healthcare system and can accommodate a variety of approaches. And so that has kind of been our philosophy and that
has been our narrative with the policy community and the expert community, and we'll continue to stay in a positive
constructive posture in that way, because I think this, as we've said many times, will continue to evolve, both as a
marketplace and in terms of national policy.
So I don't know what I can tell you more than that. That's kind of the philosophy we bring to it and it's the same
philosophy that we speak in Washington and in state capitals. And I think it has and I think it will continue to serve us
well and I think be positive to the healthcare marketplace.

We'll take our next question from Michael Baker with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael J. Baker>: Thanks a lot. I was wondering if you could comment or give an early read on the PBM
selling season in terms of potential for activity versus what we saw for the last selling season.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Mark, do you want to comment?
<A - Mark A. Thierer>: Yeah, Michael, good morning. It's busy. It's busy. This last year, we really felt good about the
big wins that we posted. It was the largest selling season, obviously, in our history, but at this point in the selling
season, we're cuing up for lots of new employers and health plans are coming to market as well.
So I would say right now, our pipeline is larger than it's ever been. And I will just take a moment and tell you in this
business, you have to start your new business well, because the market checks and it's a small business. And we've been
just had our best [ph] 1/1 (51:00), I think, in the history of the business. Our readiness and our preparation for some
very large scale clients was, I think, superior and we're gauging this by how our clients are reacting and the NPS scores
that we're seeing.
And so, this successful [ph] 1/1 (51:18) on last year's selling season sets us up very well for the 2017 selling season. As
I said, the pipeline is robust. We are pushing our new value prop and we do think that the synchronization message is
totally resonating and clients are migrating toward it. So we're feeling pretty good about our opportunities in 2017.

<Q - A.J. Rice>: Thanks. Hello, everybody. I might just ask a two-part question on the international business. I think
the comments were made in the prepared remarks that you're pleased with the progress you've made down there. And I
noticed that fourth quarter you had good enrollment in Brazil, it looks like and you have to go back to the fourth quarter
of last year for positive sequential enrollment as well. I don't know if there's something seasonality that drives that or
some other dynamic that's going on. But can you just sort of give us an update on where things stand there and where
you're at relative to contribution margins?
And the other aspect on international I was just going to ask you about is I think you guys have commented that there
are some contracts that Optum is looking at, particularly in the UK, potentially. Can you give us any update on the
timing on when we might see those?
<A - David Scott Wichmann>: A.J., it's Dave. Thank you. I think I'll take the first part of that and then ask Larry to
comment on the Optum contracts, in particular. A.J., I wish I could say that was organic growth down in Brazil, but it
was actually a small acquisition that we completed of both a health insurance company and a healthcare delivery
company. So it's an integrated delivery system that serves the ABC region near São Paulo. It's named Santa Helena and
it is a very strong, well-performing local delivery system there that really serves the lower end of the middle class
broadly. So it added about 250,000 lives or so to our quarter.
Maybe I'm not really sure how to respond to the contribution margin comment, but I will say that we do see an
improved outlook for Amil and now what is called Americas Serviços Médicos, which is our large national healthcare
delivery system, predominantly hospital-based, in Brazil. Of course, the political and economic instability certainly
aren't helping the business today. But we have seen nice progress and we have an improved outlook for 2017 for the
business.
You've probably noticed that we made a couple of augmentations to our leadership team down there. We just brought
on Claudio Lottenberg, who was the former president of the Albert Einstein Health System. He's a fantastic leader, very
well regarded across Brazil, and we think will be a terrific addition to our business.
We also named Luiz de Luca to run our Americas Health System. He came to us from Samaritano, which was the large
hospital that we acquired in São Paulo. And then, we've also added a number of other positions in the business. I think
strengthening leadership, and importantly, as we come across a five-year anniversary, looking to make sure that we
have a very strong leadership team in place as we transition a generation.
Our new team is performing very well. They're focused on a more modernized health system and building a strong
healthcare infrastructure. And we think that this will – we continue to remain bullish and optimistic about not only the
prospects for Amil and Americas Serviços Médicos, but also Brazil broadly.
Larry, you want to touch on Optum?
<A - Larry C. Renfro>: Sure. A.J., it's Larry. I think on the last earnings call, we talked a little bit about that we had
been building a foundation in London, in the UK area, and we had spent past year really getting ourselves positioned in
what I would call the new model of care. We would know it over here as the ACOs. As they are starting to take their
trust and trust over there with other hospitals and they're starting to put them together in certain segments of the
country.
And they're looking for services that we provide, whether that be hospital-type services or what we're doing with
OptumCare. That's why there's a very large overlap here when you start talking about OptumCare and what we might
be able to do in the UK area.
We are in bids and discussions with about five different areas. I won't go into them from a competitive standpoint. And
we believe in the first six months to nine months of this year, we should start to see some outcomes. There's no
question that it got delayed with Brexit, and they've had some change in terms of leadership and we've had to establish
ourselves with new leadership, which just takes time. It's not an issue of them wanting to. They understand our model.
A lot of the ministers have been here and they have visited our locations to see the integrated care and how we operate
and so forth.

SCA should be a positive in terms of how we might look at that eventually, not right away in the UK. So I guess one
part of the question is we've got these local areas that we're talking about that we're in bids on right now, six months to
nine months, we should start to see some outcomes there and we feel pretty solid about that.
The other path we're going down is on, what I'll call, national programs. And the big national programs is, what I would
call, a national database where we could bring our data and analytics into play. Again, we're in the process with that,
and I would think that timing might be a little sooner. It might be more like six months, three months to six months on
a decision there. So we're feeling pretty good about it. We've got a good team. We're moving some senior leaders over
to the UK. And again, I think that, come summertime, we should start to see some results there.

We'll take our next question from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kevin Mark Fischbeck>: Great, thanks. I guess you said in the commentary that the exchange performance was
better year-over-year. Was that simply just a lack of a PDR from the prior year or were you actually seeing
stabilization? I think last quarter you said that the Q3 results in the exchanges were stabilizing. I wanted to see the color
there in Q4.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: I think broadly stable.
<A - Daniel Schumacher>: Yeah, Kevin, Dan Schumacher. I think the point we're making there is last year we
recorded the premium deficiency reserve to provide for losses in 2016. And so, when you look at it on a year-over-year
basis, you had the drag in 2015, and then, we resolved the PDR and the exchange is in the fourth quarter this year. So
that's the improvement we're talking about year-over-year.

into 2017 of your merger synergy plan are you through? And then, I guess, related to that would be, what sort of trends
are you seeing from both manufacturers and rebates on the cost side? And what are the trends like on the client side, as
you look at your margins? Thanks.

synergies. We met and actually exceeded our $0.30 commitment in the 2016 plan year. We've not provided a specific
outlook on synergies for 2017, but I'll tell you that we've got running room in the plan and work to do still to extract
synergies from the combination. So that has exceeded our expectations and have been very solid, and I would like to
just tip the hat to the operating team who has made this work happen. It's been exceptional.
You asked about rebates and the picture going forward. This is the thing that we're paid to do. We're paid to go to the
supply chain on behalf of our clients and extract savings for the benefit of the consumer and, obviously, for the plan
sponsor. And so, we think that we've created a business model here where we have best-in-class contracting capabilities
that we take not just to the pharmaceutical industry, but we take it to the retail chains, we take it to the biotech
manufacturers, and we take it to the generic manufacturers, as well as the wholesalers. So this entire supply chain, this
is our job to extract savings for the benefit of the member and for the benefit of the plan sponsor. And the outlook for
that, in this coming year, is really very solid.

question to what I asked at a different way. We've also noticed some interesting trends on utilization despite some
spiking from the ACA in hospital-based utilization, particularly inpatient care.
And I'm wondering if you can help me to understand what steps you're taking on and what you can attribute your
management of cost trend presumably related to appropriate controls on appropriate sites of care, and what the outlook
might be given that you're now bringing OptumCare into a higher level of scale and capabilities with Surgical Care, for
your ability to further improve your cost trends, to improve coordination and appropriateness of site and timing and
place of care? Thank you.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Well, you've kind of defined the space in the question. So you clearly have grasped the
idea, but the ambulatory platform that we are forming is, in fact, a very important and viable proposition in and of
itself. It represents the more organized, more informed, deployment of resources in terms of ambulatory care and very
much focused on the appropriateness of setting.
It also plays to themes that are clearly moving in the marketplace where these services are moving into these better
venues and, in fact, technology is a very powerful element behind it, both in the process and so forth. So it creates a
better resource platform to serve consumers, and that has implications for all that we serve. It is a multi-payer platform
and UnitedHealthcare is an enterprise that is very effective in advancing on those and it provides them an advantage in
terms of how they deploy it and integrate it into their offerings. So it's kind of that is a start.
Do you want to pick it up, Dan?
<A - Daniel Schumacher>: Good morning, Sheryl. Dan Schumacher. The only thing I would add, if you kind of look
at it over the last eight years, right, we've been able to drive down on a per capita basis inpatient, right? And inside that,
we focused a lot kind of in those early years around the conversion of inpatient to outpatient. I think this is sort of a
continued evolution, as we focus more on the site of service to how do we get that outpatient into the ambulatory
setting.
So we've been continuing to introduce more steps and controlled measures on the front end, but more importantly,
trying to put in incentives at the surgeon level that really can help drive to the most appropriate setting. So you have the
combination of both the benefit structures with the consumer providing strong motivator, and then, likewise, on the
delivery side, trying to put incentives in place with the surgeons to be able to drive towards the more appropriate use.

So we really look at this partnership as an opportunity to really strengthen our value orientation, both in our product
designs as well as in our relationships with the professionals that are providing these surgeries.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: And the OptumCare platform is free-standing value all by itself. So we basically have a
kind of a two-dimensional agenda going here. And I think that was the core of your question and you grasped what
we're doing in OptumCare very well.
<Q - Sheryl R. Skolnick>: Thank you.
Stephen J. Hemsley
