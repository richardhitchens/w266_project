MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Welcome to Oracle's first quarter fiscal year earnings conference call. It's now my pleasure to turn today's conference
over to Ken Bond, Senior Vice President. Please go ahead, sir.
Kenneth Bond
Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's first quarter fiscal year 2017 earnings conference call.
A copy of the press release and financial tables, which include the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations and other

Safra Ada Catz
Thanks, Ken. Good morning – good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q1. I'll then
review guidance for Q2 and turn the call over to Mark and Larry for their comments.
Clearly, we are pleased with our results, with the most obvious thing being that we overachieved again in the cloud,
especially in the United States. As you all know, we have pivoted the organization to go after the cloud, and we are
outperforming even our most aggressive expectations. This has resulted in our growth rate continuing to accelerate as
we scale in the cloud, something our competitors are not similarly experiencing.
We continue to use constant dollar growth rates on our quarterly calls, so we can have some measure of consistency
across the quarters as well as to reflect how we measure the business. This quarter, the effects of currency movements
were more than expected, mostly because the surprise Brexit vote happened after our earnings call, resulting in a 1% to
3% headwind in most revenue categories, including 1% to total revenue and EPS, which was $0.01 lower as a result.
Cloud SaaS and PaaS revenue for the quarter was $815 million, up 82% from last year and above the 80% high end of
my guidance. While this excellent growth rate was helped a little by recent acquisitions, organic growth accelerated
from both Q4 and Q1 of last year. Actually, organic SaaS and PaaS growth rate has accelerated for seven straight
quarters.
You can also see the continuing revenue acceleration of our cloud business in the SaaS and PaaS billings and deferred
revenue. The gross deferred revenue balance is now nearly $1.5 billion, up 49% in U.S. dollars. SaaS and PaaS billings
grew 49% in U.S. dollars this quarter, up from 38% last quarter. We put the billings numbers up on our website for you
to see the details. Our SaaS and PaaS business has now grown to the point where the dollar growth in SaaS and PaaS
revenue exceeded the dollar decline in new software license. Together, SaaS and PaaS subscriptions and new software
license grew 16% in constant currency.
As our SaaS and PaaS business continues to scale and grow dramatically, the gross margin also continues to expand.
The Q1 gross margin for SaaS and PaaS was 62%, up from 40% last Q1, and we expect to see further improvement in
fiscal year 2017. And from there, we'll be targeting 80% over time. Combined with cloud infrastructure-as-a-service
revenue of $171 million, which was up 10%, our total cloud revenue in the quarter was nearly $1 billion, up 63% in
constant currency from last year.
Total on-premise software revenues were $5.8 billion, with software updates and product support revenues at $4.8
billion, up 3% from last year. Attach and renewal rates remain at their usual high level, as our growing installed base of
customers continues to power earnings and cash flow. New software license revenues were slightly over $1 billion,
down 10%, reflecting the continued migration to cloud.
Total hardware, including hardware support, was down 11%, with hardware systems product revenue of $462 million
and hardware support revenue of $535 million. Our engineered systems grew mid-double digits, led by Exadata that
grew over 30% in the quarter.
For the company, total revenue for the quarter was $8.6 billion, up 3% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income
was $3.4 billion and operating margin was 39%.
I need to remind you that the large debt offering we did last quarter cost about $0.005 in EPS in the quarter. The
additional interest was not in my guidance, as the debt offering took place after the guidance call. For Q2, I expect the
added interest will lower EPS by more than $0.01 without the matching benefit of NetSuite's contribution earnings,
which will be accretive until the deal closes.
G&A expenses were also higher than usual in Q1 because of some legal fees, which will be lower in the second quarter
and largely gone by Q3 as a result of the settlement of one case and the end of two trials.
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was higher than projected due to the geographic mix of earnings, which is
driven by our overachievement in cloud revenues in the U.S., resulting in a tax rate of 25.5% and EPS being $0.01
lower at $0.55 in U.S. dollars, but still up 5% in constant currency. The GAAP tax rate was 22.8% and GAAP EPS was

$0.43 in USD, up 11% in constant currency.
Operating cash flow over the last four quarters was $13.7 billion. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $299
million. Free cash flow over the last four quarters was $12.6 billion, up 5% from the last year. We now have
approximately $68 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately $14.3
billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $9.5 billion, up 5% in constant currency.
As we've said before, we are committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic
acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt, and the dividend. In terms of acquisitions, we continue to focus on
finding the right companies with the right valuation that make both strategic and financial sense. This quarter, we
repurchased 49 million shares for a total of $2 billion. And the board of directors again declared a quarterly dividend of
$0.15 per share.
For those of you curious about NetSuite, I can report that we have now cleared antitrust reviews everywhere except the
United States where our waiting period expires at the end of September.
Now to the guidance. I am going to give you guidance for Q2 and then some updated comments for the fiscal year. All
of my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. And while we feel good about our own
performance and transformation, I am always keeping an eye on the macro environment, especially abroad.
If current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, we expect to see SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow
again 78% to 82%, little bit more than I guided last time. Software and cloud revenue including SaaS and PaaS and
IaaS, new software license and software support is expected to grow 3% to 5%. Total revenue growth is expected to
range from 0% to 3%. EPS is expected to be between $0.59 and $0.62 in constant currency. Were it not for the higher
tax rate and interest expense, we would expect EPS to grow approximately 4% or be $0.06 higher.
Over the full year of fiscal year 2017, I am raising the outlook for fiscal year 2017 SaaS and PaaS revenue growth from
65% to 67%. I continue to expect the SaaS and PaaS gross margins will exit Q4 higher than the 62% reported today, as
our cloud business continues to grow dramatically.
With that, I'll turn it over to Mark for his comments.
Mark V. Hurd
Thank you, Safra.
First, we just had a great quarter. And I want to thank everybody at Oracle for their hard work, all of our employees.
I'm going to give you a lot of numbers. Let me start with booking and revenue growth rates. I'm going to give them to
you year on year in CD unless I state otherwise.
Cloud bookings ARR was $271 million in USD, a 42% growth. As a reminder, ARR growth last year was 166%. SaaS
bookings were $165 million, and PaaS, IaaS bookings were $106 million. As Safra said, SaaS, PaaS revenue was up
82% and I just want to repeat the seventh consecutive quarter of organic growth acceleration. Our ERP EPM revenue
grew 70% quarter-on-quarter, the seventh consecutive quarter with sequential growth that was greater than 50%.
In Fusion HCM, we grew 131%, nearly four times the growth rate of Workday. And CX separately up double-digits in
sales, marketing and service. Data-as-a-service was up 75%. Platform-as-a-service up 22% quarter on quarter. Overall,
we grew 82%, the highest global growth rate of any scaled cloud company.
SaaS/PaaS billings grew 49% in the quarter, up from 38% last quarter. Deferred SaaS, PaaS revenue was up 49%. SaaS
customer metrics, we closed 776 new SaaS customers in the quarter. We had 677 expansions. 125 customers who
bought SaaS also bought PaaS. 346 new CX customers, 488 expansions. 173 new HCM customers drove that great
result, inclusive of 69 expansions. 344 ERP EPM customers and 135 expansions. Our active base is now 2,800
customers with 1,000 live, 10x Workday.

Over 50% of our ERP EPM customers were net new to Oracle. They've never purchased an Oracle app before.
Two-thirds of our new customer wins were Fusion. 334 go lives in Fusion, our best quarter ever. 2,032 PaaS customers
that were new in the quarter. Our installed base is now 11,000 PaaS customers. 1,671 new infrastructure-as-a-service
customers that are supplemental to our PaaS customers. Together, our installed base of PaaS and infrastructure is now
at 18,892 customers. As a point of clarification, PaaS and infrastructure customers are counted for each service that
they use.
In closing, this was just a very solid quarter for us not only in revenue, but bookings and billings. Look forward a few
predictions. Q1 bookings were solid at 42%. I believe Q2 will be better, could even be much better. Q1 revenue was
fantastic at 82%. It's one of the reasons, as Safra described, we're raising our guidance from 65% to 67%, and I just
want to close by saying we are the fastest-growing scaled cloud company in the world.
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry.
Lawrence J. Ellison
Thanks, Mark.
We're very excited about the rollout of our Generation2 infrastructure-as-a-service data centers. These new data centers
give us the significant cost and performance advantage over Amazon Web Services. Plus, our new bare metal offering
makes it possible for our customers to lift and shift their entire existing corporate infrastructure, data and applications,
without any changes whatsoever and move it to the Oracle public cloud. You just can't do that with Amazon Web
Services. Lift and shift the entire network, DM, database, data, applications, move all of that across to our data center
without changing anything, a real advantage.
So, for the first time, we have this big technology advantage in infrastructure-as-a-service. We expect this will enable
Oracle to accelerate our infrastructure-as-a-service business at the same high growth rates that we're currently
experiencing in both SaaS and PaaS.
With that, we're ready for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.
<Q - Raimo Lenschow>: Hey, thanks for taking my question, a question for Mark. Mark, the bookings number looked
impressive and you hinted at better numbers in Q2, but you also in the press release talked about the $2 billion that you
want to achieve for this year, which actually means a slightly better than 42% growth for the year. Can you talk a little
bit about the drivers that drive that strong number and to drive the acceleration there? Thank you.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Sure, yes. Obviously to your point, we grew 42% in the quarter. I actually – as good as that
was, we could have done better. That's how strong our pipeline is right now. And as I told most of you that as we've
gone through this cloud transition, we've got a pipeline and we understand now, as more data has come clear to us, how
that translates to performance, and our performance continues to get better. And I think it's all of the things we've
talked about. Not only have we gotten more salespeople than we had before, they're better trained. Our customers are
more aware. We have more references. We have more go-lives, and all of that feeds together.
In addition, we not only have more products, we're going to release more products yet even this week or next week at
OpenWorld, but more of our existing products are available in more geographies. So for example, as we've released
ERP, ERP actually has not been available in every geographic market in the world as it now is. So you've got a
culmination of all of these factors that lead into it, but we're going to have a very strong bookings year, as I've

described.
<Q - Raimo Lenschow>: Thank you.
<A - Kenneth Bond>: Next question, please.
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Keith Eric Weiss>: Excellent, this is Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley, and thanks for taking the question. From
our perspective, it looks like over the past two years, we've seen Oracle make a large push away from professional
licenses towards subscription-based SaaS offerings on the applications side of business. And now it appears that that
push is shifting more on the database tech side of the business, steering more business towards platform-as-a-service.
So one, is that a correct assumption that the focus is more on database tech going towards platform-as-a-service? And
two, how should investors think about the impacts of that shift in FY 2017 in particular?
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Okay, this is Larry. We started our Fusion applications efforts a little over 10 years ago.
So we started rewriting all of our applications for the cloud about a decade ago. And when those applications were
ready, we moved aggressively to sell those applications. We believe that's what customers wanted. They wanted
cloud-based applications, not on-premise-based applications. We made the huge investment in rewriting all of our
applications. And those were ready before – and we were ready to move into SaaS applications before we were ready to
move into infrastructure-as-a-service or PaaS. We were just ready sooner. So we pushed that.
Again, the interesting thing here is we are just beginning to move our database customers from on-premise into the
cloud. Microsoft has already done a very good job of moving their Office customers from on-prem into the cloud, and
that's the overwhelming basis of their cloud growth. The overwhelming basis of our cloud growth are new customers
for applications. So we haven't started shifting our base yet, which I think is very interesting. We got these applications
ready. We're gaining share right and left, as I say. We mention Workday a lot because they're our primary competitor
for HCM and ERP in the cloud. And as Mark pointed out, we have 10 times more customers than Workday is in ERP.
And we've sold more – but more than half of those are net new customers. So that's us gaining share in that business.
We're now beginning to move our installed base into the cloud and this is a lot expansion. It's not like they're going to
stop running on-premise. We believe this is for the next decade. This is a coexistence story. They're going to continue
running some of their stuff on-premise and they're going to move some of their stuff into the cloud, and those two
things have to coexist. And our unique offering to our customers in database is the fact that we support the identical
software on-premise and in the cloud, and you can move data and workloads back and forth very, very gracefully.
That's our PaaS offering. And by the way, if you're a SaaS customer, your application is built on top of our database
and our middleware. So you buy SaaS with PaaS. You often buy together, as Mark pointed out.
Finally, so PaaS was ready second. We were moving aggressively to PaaS. Now, what we're looking for to do is the
third leg of the stool, which is to push into infrastructure-as-a-service, where we have an all-new and very formidable
competitor, Amazon.com, who we think now with our new Generation2 data centers, we have a big competitive
advantage over Amazon.com, and people will be buying our PaaS and our infrastructure-as-a-service together. So we
sell PaaS twice. Sometimes we package PaaS with our application SaaS together, and this new business selling PaaS
with infrastructure-as-a-service where they're building a lot of custom applications or moving existing applications into
the cloud.
The way to think about it is our SaaS business has got the new business – a lot of new customers. We're just beginning
to shift our installed base from the on-premise into the cloud, which is enormous potential for us, and we think we
make a lot more money by moving customers off premise into the cloud because we do a lot more things for the
customer. We help this customer save money, but we also provide, with our database, storage and networking and
compute and all the associated support services. So we think – again this is the beginning of still more rapid growth for
Oracle.

<A - Mark V. Hurd>: One thing I would not want you to walk away with is you said shifting from SaaS to PaaS.
We're not shifting. We're supplementing. I mean, this is – in SaaS, we have more energy and more momentum than
we've ever had. We are not taking our foot off that accelerator. We are supplementing – by the way, let me be clear to
Larry's point. If we could push a button and move all of our on-prem Oracle database customers to PaaS, we would do
it. It is economically beneficial to us. Secondly, we think it's the way customers also want to buy now. But there is this
transition that Larry talked about that we are going through, but I don't want you to think SaaS and PaaS have some
interrelationship to the energy we put on. We have separate, actually, sales organizations that do both. Our energy is on
both. We think both are tremendous opportunities, about to be supplemented by our infrastructure offerings that Larry
referenced.
<Q - Keith Eric Weiss>: Okay. Thank you, guys.
<A - Kenneth Bond>: Next question, please.
Operator
And our next question will come from the line of Sarah Hindlian with Macquarie.
<Q - Sarah Hindlian>: Hi, great. Thank you. It's Hindlian. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the
momentum in the cloud, Larry, Safra and Mark. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about what is driving
some of the success you're seeing there. I know you mentioned conversions on the pipeline are strong and referenced
customers are now live. But are you seeing any success around the streamlining of cloud purchases through the new
accelerated buying experience? Or is this more sales compensation changes and of course product functionality
improvements that's driving the success in the cloud? Some more comments and color would be very greatly
appreciated.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Well, for sure, I think it really is very much all of the above. So let me just address the
accelerated buying experience because the most important part of it is that we end up being able to service our
customers much more quickly, much more efficiently. Our salespeople become so much more productive. They can
spend more of their time, really the bulk of their time, with customers outwardly facing making them successful,
instead of inwardly facing dealing with our own back office.
So this has really unleashed a massive amount of productivity. Obviously having many references is critical to the
success of a software service because customers all talk to each other and the happier customers lead to more happy
customers, which is, by the way, one of the reasons we love Oracle OpenWorld because tens of thousands of our
customers come and they share their positive experiences, and that just gets more and more customers excited and
participating. And then, of course, the sales force has an enormous amount of success, which ends up leading to just
more success, more productivity. The entire thing is just a very, very virtuous cycle, all of which starts with having the
best product. That's really the bottom line ultimately. As Larry mentioned, we spent a decade, frankly it's a little over a
decade, in building these products. We had leading products to begin with, but we started and re-wrote them all,
focused exclusively – really focused on the cloud and that's what ultimately shows through.
<Q - Sarah Hindlian>: Thank you, Safra.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Thank you.

Our next question will come from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies.
<Q - John DiFucci>: Thank you. I'm going to ask another question about the cloud. When we look at your traction
here, and it's been much better than we would have thought, especially in this quarter, which is usually a seasonally
slow quarter, I don't think we've seen a company of scale move to cloud with the kind of gusto we've seen here. But

Larry, you mentioned the cloud move here was mostly new. I think you said customers, but I think you meant new
workloads. When should we expect to see more customers actually transition current workloads from on-premise to the
cloud, and how is this going to affect the aggregate bottom line, I mean, in the near term?
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: By the way, we meant new customers.
<Q - John DiFucci>: Okay.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Not new workloads. We meant new customers.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: He didn't misspeak. He meant new customers. And let me just, John, give you a flavor in the
quarter, and I didn't do this for the interest of time, but just to give you an idea of new customers in the quarter in just
SaaS ERP. We closed Adventist Health, Bharti Airtel, Weco, Saks, Tesco, Texas Instruments, UCLA, Wake Forest
University, Baptist Medical Center in HCM.
<Q - John DiFucci>: So were these customers never customers of Oracle before?
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: It's an app.
<Q - John DiFucci>: Okay.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: It's not a matter – we just make a distinction between moving an existing application customer
from, let's say an Oracle E-Business Suite customer to Oracle Fusion ERP in the cloud.
<Q - John DiFucci>: Got it. Got it.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Versus taking an SAP customer and moving them from SAP to Oracle Fusion applications.
<Q - John DiFucci>: Understood.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: And I think – let me just try to tie back to the point Larry was making earlier. Most of what you
see in our cloud revenue number is customers that more than 50% were customers who were not an Oracle application
customer before they became an Oracle SaaS customer. So these are really new customers and then, to your point, that
are bringing new workloads that we have not had before. The exciting part, which again I'll go back to what Larry said,
was the core of our on-prem user base, particularly in the database arena, has not moved. And that is a huge opportunity
for us that the only people that can move them to the cloud as efficiently and effectively are us.
<Q - John DiFucci>: Right.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: So, that's why this is such an – maybe we don't do as good a job explaining it as we feel like
here because what we've seen so far is what you would think of, John, is normally the hardest stuff going out and
finding net new customers.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: And that's we've done. So I'd like to distinguish it again what I said before. Microsoft is
holding onto their Office customers by moving them from on-prem into the cloud. We are not holding on – just holding
onto our on-prem customers, moving our application customers to the cloud. We're doing that too. We're holding onto
our apps customers by moving to the cloud, but more than that, we're gaining – more than half of them are net new
customers. So, that's very different than what you see is going on in Microsoft, and our big installed base which is the
database were preeminent. We really haven't begun – we're just beginning, in the early stages of holding onto them and
moving them to the cloud.
So it's a bit of a different story between us and Microsoft. That exciting prospect of moving those database customers to
the cloud, that's in front of us. And that's what makes it – I congratulate Microsoft on doing what they've done. It's the
right strategy for them. Ours has been what we've said to we want to do that, but we want to do more and we think we
have the opportunity. Safra mentioned another very important metric. Our renewal rates are where they've always been,
which tells you the bulk of our base that's on-prem is still yet to move, and it tells you and supports the story about how
much from us is just plain net new opportunities, John, for us.

<Q - John DiFucci>: Great. That's very clear. I did ask a question though on the effect on the bottom line too here at
least in the near term. because Safra was clear with the impact to some of those extra items to the guidance for EPS
relative to what expectations were anyway. But is there going to – is this going to – we know it can be suppressive to
margins at least initially, and we've seen that, but at the same time it looks like – and this is the first time...
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: I'll let Safra comment again, but I want to make sure it's clear what we were saying. This
is actually the fact that we've done a very good job in the U.S. growing our cloud business. That eventually had the
strange effect of raising our tax rate.
<Q - John DiFucci>: Got it.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: This is the best bad news you could get. So we're in a situation where I hate to say we've
over-executed, but that's how you feel. And yet to be clear, John, our bookings in Europe are very strong. And so this is
going to normalize. This is just a point of us putting – or moving those bookings into revenue.
<Q - John DiFucci>: Got it.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: So in due course as we have more balance between our international cloud sales and our U.S.
cloud sales, the tax rate should drift back to where it normally is when we have the same mix. It's just now we have a
disproportionate amount of our cloud revenue in the United States. We expect that to balance and we expect the tax rate
to go back. Where the bookings balance, it's just the current period revenue that we've got today, but this is overall I
view a very good story. Let's not lose the fact of the other number that Safra described very early. Our margins are now
at 62% in our SaaS/PaaS margins, which we talked about way back when they were at 39% as we were investing in
infrastructure to prepare for what we have now. And so I think the margin story, John, is also beginning to solidify as
we continue to grow and put revenue on top of the base.
<Q - John DiFucci>: Great, that's all very helpful. Thank you.

Our next question will come from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Heather Bellini>: Great, thank you so much. This is a question for Safra. Safra, support grew – software support
grew 3% year over year, but was flat sequentially. I'm wondering if there's any color you could provide here on the
trends in that business. And also, if you can, share with us how you think about the tradeoff between support and cloud
revenue and how you think about the sustainability of that software support stream. Thank you.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Sure. So of course, you have to remember we're going from Q4 to Q1. So our Q1 new license
is our seasonally lowest one anyway. Now as you know, our focus is now on cloud. And so as new license becomes a
smaller number, especially in Q1, it means that it does not – that the support base does not grow as much. There's also a
little bit of currency, but you should ignore that. So that's the first thing.
Now, I know you're probably worried that all of a sudden support is going to go negative, the base is going to go
negative. We don't foresee that happening because the base is continuing to grow. Even though new license amount is
not growing year over year as much or is actually shrinking as more of our customers pivot to the cloud, we still sell
new licenses, which means the base does continue to grow, and it grew 3% year over year. So I think I've – I don't
know, you had a few parts to your question, but that's really what's going on here. We don't – yeah, that's it.
<Q - Heather Bellini>: Great. And if I could just on that point, just with the support trends that you're seeing, is this
still a year where you forecast a bottom in operating income? I'm sorry, fiscal 2016 being the bottom, my apologies.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Yes. Yes. Yes, it is. Absolutely.
<Q - Heather Bellini>: Great.

<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Absolutely. And I do want to say one more time again, and also Mark mentioned it, our
retention rates, our renewal rates in our support business remain very, very high. In fact, they're a little bit higher this
quarter than in other quarters. It's all within a band of very high. They remain that way.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: And so they are high, Heather. But again I want to reiterate that, as I've said before, not on this
call, when a customer does move to the cloud, we actually get more money. So we actually do more things for the
customer. We now do their hardware. We get all the database. We get all the middleware. We get a multiple on the
support dollar. And as our – so our support dollar goes up when it converts into a cloud revenue dollar. And back to the
margin story we talked about five minutes ago, those margins in the cloud, as we see them approaching the levels that
Safra described earlier, this is good news for us. So, yes, the renewal rates are what they are. We predict support to be
the way we've described, but this is not bad news as we begin to move our base to the cloud. This is actually good
news.
<Q - Heather Bellini>: Thank you.
<A - Kenneth Bond>: Next question, please.

Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Kash Rangan>: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So, Safra, I just wanted your comment on gross
profits. One of the things we look for in cloud transition stories is when do gross profits start to grow. And clearly, after
a two-year slump, your investment's starting to pay off. Your gross profits were up for the first time in two years, I
believe. Can you talk about the disparity between the gross profit growth rate, which obviously is quite important and
the operating income growth rate? Is that a bit of a lag effect here?
And also, if I could ask either Mark or Larry, on the PaaS side, can you just give us a little bit more color, what kind of
projects are customers picking Oracle for when they sign a PaaS deal, particularly given that you've surprised us with
the announcement of a number of new customers for the PaaS, and I would have thought that that could be just typical
Oracle database customers, but it looks like something new could be happening. If you could shed some light, that'd be
great. Thank you.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Sure. So, first, you really should take directions from what's going on in our gross profit line
for the most strategic part of our business, which is moving to the cloud and software and software-as-a-service, and
that is going to be very much followed up. One of the things we do have that is costing us is that our hardware business
outside of our engineered systems is getting smaller, and the expense line has not adjusted equally. As you can imagine
– you know us pretty well – that's something that's very straightforward for us to finish out during the year, and that is
our expectation.
In addition, you also talked – or you may have mentioned currency and tax and things like that. So obviously, currency
is something I can't project and I think after the Brexit vote, I'm pretty sure nobody else has projected it correctly either,
but the way it affects us, just so that you know, is that the U.S. at Oracle is ahead of Europe in our move to the cloud
and in outside of the United States. However, as Mark mentioned, the bookings are very, very high. So bookings that
were booked in the United States over the past year are turning into revenue already in the United States. Since the
number is smaller in Europe, the bookings – the revenue numbers are smaller, the bookings are approaching those of
the United States, and those are going to start flowing through revenue. That will in fact impact our tax rate and
readjust it back to the lower rate that you may be used to. So, that's going to take a little while and that should go
through.
In addition, as you know, we do have some significant borrowings. And as a result, we have a very large amount of
cash on our balance sheet right now, which is not earning very high results. We are looking forward to closing the
NetSuite deal, which we believe to be accretive and that will also be helpful.

<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: The other part of your question – this is Larry – is we sell PaaS too, but PaaS is sometimes
attached to SaaS. Think of it like salesforce.com. They have their Force.com platform where you use to extend the
Salesforce applications. We have our platform that people use to extend our SaaS applications. So SaaS – you buy a
number of SaaS applications or a suite of SaaS applications, then you buy a certain amount of PaaS to extended build
data marts, data warehouses, other things, add features and functions, use PaaS for that.
Also, the bigger opportunity is when you buy PaaS and infrastructure-as-a-service together, where you're either writing
brand new net new custom applications or you're lifting and shifting an existing custom application to our
infrastructure-as-a-service and then moving the database associated with that application to our PaaS. That's actually
the bigger opportunity. And you're beginning to see that start to drive our PaaS business higher, and of course it will
accelerate the growth rate of our infrastructure-as-a-service business as well.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: I may add just one last thing. Exadata-as-a-service has been a very strong PaaS offering. We
count Exadata-as-a-service, meaning you can now get Exadata in the cloud as you can get it on-premise. And our
Exadata service – Exadata-as-a-service offering has been a strong PaaS offering, so we actually don't even add that into
the engineered systems numbers that Safra described earlier, and that's really the strength and popularity of Exadata.
We also have pretty good sized business now, Bill (sic) [Kash], in PaaS, which is a cloud integration services business
inside our platform as well. So everything Larry has said, all the dev/test stuff, the supplementing of our SaaS
offerings, Exadata, and the data integration services are at the core of our most popular PaaS offering.
<Q - Kash Rangan>: Okay.
<A - Kenneth Bond>: Thank you. Next question, please.
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.
<Q - Kirk Materne>: Thanks very much. Mark, given that guys have a view into both the on-premise and the cloud
world, I was wondering if you could give us some sense on where you think larger, say, Fortune 1000 types are in
terms of moving their ERP systems to the cloud, as while CRM and HCM seem to be past the tipping point, there's
some debate as to how fast some of the bigger companies are going to move ERP. And I was just kind of curious what
you see in your pipeline. And is that necessary – does that have to happen for you guys to hit your AAR forecast for
this year? I'm just trying to get a sense on where we are on that front.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: The answer to your last question is no.
<Q - Kirk Materne>: Okay.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: And the answer to your first question is faster than I would have thought two or three years ago.
And so some of the names I read earlier are scaled companies. When you see somebody like a Tesco moving, when
you see an HSBC moving, when you see some of these brands, and we have all types of brands in our list of ERP
customers, ranging from GE and others, as I've described, to newer companies like Lyft and others that are newer hot
mid-market companies that may have not even had a set of financials before, and it's really all of the above. And I think
the thing we get excited about is the reason we talk about Workday probably as much as we do is we see them at least
with a SaaS offering. Our core on-prem competitor historically hasn't really done anything.
So when they try – when you look at their base, as their base begins to look for some of the benefits that our base now
has the opportunity to take advantage of, we think there's a possibility for a relatively sizable market share shift over
the years as we move forward. So, Kirk, I do think you're going to see tire kicking and you see it now of many scaled
companies that are the biggest companies in the world, and you see them showing up on our list of recorded wins.
<Q - Kirk Materne>: Great, thanks for the color.

And our last question for the day will come from the line of Joel Fishbein with BTIG.
<Q - Joel P. Fishbein>: Good afternoon. I just have a quick follow-up on the database. Clearly you have very strong
momentum in the cloud application business. Can you give us a little bit more color on where the database cycle will
show up and what's the best way for us to measure it? That would be helpful. Thanks.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Well, again, next week at OpenWorld then Sunday, we're announcing the latest version of
our database, and it's going to be available in the cloud and on Exadata. We think, I think, you're going to see a very
rapid uptake of the new version, and we expect those customers to consume some of it on-prem, but also a significant
amount of their new database consumption is going to be in the cloud. So I think 12 – Release 2 is going to move
customers to the cloud more quickly than they otherwise might move.
<Q - Joel P. Fishbein>: Great, thank you.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Okay.
Kenneth Bond
