Thank you, Paula, and good morning, everyone. Consistent with the first quarter, Entergy's second quarter performance
was in line with our expectations. Operational earnings per share were $0.83 about where we planned it to be, and we
are on track to meet our full-year guidance. Given market conditions and recent business developments, current
indications point to Utility, Parent and Other earnings near the lower end of the 2016 range that we outlined on Analyst
Day, still meaningful year-over-year growth in the base Utility business.
We remain on track to achieve our financial outlook for 2017. To achieve the expected growth, we made notable
progress on our 2015 to-do list as shown on slide two. These important tasks are key steps in forward-looking – in
moving forward with our near and longer term strategies for the Utility as well as Entergy Wholesale Commodities.
At the Utility, the strategy we are implementing is centered on our opportunity as well as our obligation to invest
capital in order to replace aging infrastructure, strength and reliability, maybe economic development and other growth
needs, and ensure that the environmental profile of our generation fleet is in line with the evolving regulatory
framework. We are also taking steps to facilitate this investment by combining the Louisiana utilities. In July, Entergy
Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed a unanimous settlement to combine the two companies. Pending
action from the Louisiana Public Service Commission later this month, closing is on track for the fourth quarter.
In May, the New Orleans City Council approved several significant matters, paving the way for more economic and
efficient service for the city's residents. First, the transfer of the Algiers assets in New Orleans to Entergy New Orleans,
which ships approximately 22,000 customers to the Utility. And second, the $99 million securitization financing, which
includes three components: The recovery of Hurricane Isaac storm costs, $75 million in cash storm reserves for electric
restorations, and nearly $6 million for restorations for the gas system. This financing, completed in July, gives Entergy
New Orleans a fully funded storm reserve. We have come a long way since the devastation of Hurricane Katrina 10
years ago.
The New Orleans City Council recognizes that our city is stronger when its power infrastructure is stronger, more
efficient and more reliable.
Taken together, these actions will benefit Entergy New Orleans and its customers in several ways. Stakeholders will
benefit from a more streamlined and efficient regulatory process. The Utility will be better able to attract capital at
reasonable rates because it will have an expanded balance sheet. It will also have stronger liquidity, which will make it
[ph] definitely (04:21) stable, and it will secure lower cost efficient generation needed to more reliably serve its
customers.
We're also pleased that representatives of the New Orleans City Council expressed interest in exploring Entergy New
Orleans purchase of one of the units of the Union Power Station. We will be filing an application later this month
seeking city council approval for this transaction. The purchase of the Union unit will take the place of the power
purchase agreement that had been previously approved by the city council. We believe the purchase of the Union unit is
an ideal way to meet New Orleans generation needs at approximately half the cost, but building a comparable new unit.
We made other notable progress on the generation investment front. In May, we announced the results of the request
for proposal for long-term capacity in the Amite South region of Louisiana, which generally covers the southeastern
part of the state. Consistent with the views of an independent monitor, the Entergy operating committee elected to
proceed with the self-build option.
Next summer, subject to regulatory approval, we will begin construction of the St. Charles power station, a natural
gas-fired combined-cycle generating plant located in Southeast Louisiana along the Mississippi River industrial
corridor.
Entergy Louisiana plans to file for regulatory approval with the LPSC in the third quarter of 2015. We anticipate that
the plant will begin commercial operations in the MISO market by summer of 2019, one year ahead of the schedule we
presented last November at EEI.
In June, Entergy Texas distributed the final documents for its 2015 RFP, which seeks both limited and long-term
resources. In the long-term portion of the RFP, Entergy Texas is seeking up to 1,000 megawatts of CCGT capacity and

energy located in the western planning region of the state, beginning in the summer of 2021. Entergy Texas intends to
offer a self-build option into the 2015 RFP that can provide its customers long-term capacity, energy and in-region
reliability benefits.
Entergy recently provided notice that it plans to issue another RFP for new CCGT capacity beginning in the summer of
2020. Again, this is one year earlier than we previously indicated. This RFP will seek long-term capacity and energy in
the west of the Atchafalaya Basin planning region, or WOTAB, and will include a sel- build alternative. Capacity is
needed in this region of Southwest Louisiana to mitigate supply constraints, as well as to modernize aging
infrastructure. Selections for both RFPs in Texas and Louisiana are targeted for early to mid-2016.
Regarding the four-unit Union Power Station transaction I mentioned earlier, we continue to anticipate a closing by the
end of 2015. Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana are on track to purchase their respective units. In
addition, as I stated, Entergy New Orleans is now positioned to seek regulatory approval to purchase one of the
facilities' 495-megawatt trains in place of Entergy Texas. We heard the positions of the commission staff and other
parties in Texas and do not see a viable path forward. We have concluded that the parties in Texas prefer a long-term
market-tested capacity solution located in the state of Texas. Our RFP is seeking exactly that. Our objective is to obtain
the support of the staff and customer groups for our approach to meeting generation resource needs in Texas.
We look forward to continuing to work with the Public Utility Commission of Texas and other stakeholders to develop
strategies to meet the state's future generation resource needs. We also continue to make productive investments in
transmission. In April, we announced that in the fourth quarter of 2015 Entergy Arkansas will begin construction –
constructing a new approximately $62 million transmission line from Monticello to Reed crossing parts of Drew and
Desha counties. The project will include expanded electrical facilities including a new substation in Reed to move
power more reliably and efficiently into the region. Also in April, Entergy Louisiana filed for certification of
approximately $57 million transmission line in Southeast Louisiana, with an in-service date of December of 2018. This
project is expected to lead to $515 million in savings to Louisiana customers over its first 20 years, which will be
realized through a lower fuel adjustment cost. We are taking advantage of miser market opportunities to meet the needs
of the changing generation landscape.
In May, we announced a significant $30 million transmission investment to upgrade the connection of New Orleans
metro area to Ninemile 6, a MISO generating facility, which currently supplies the area was placed in service in the
1960s and will soon be deactivated. The upgrades we're making now are required by MISO prior to deactivation.
In June, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed for certification of an up to $187 million transmission project with an
in-service date of June 2018. This project will expand capacity in the WOTAB region in order to strengthen reliability
there. It will also facilitate industrial growth.
Improvements to ETI's transmission system are progressing, including upgrading of existing transmission lines and the
construction of three new transmission lines receiving PUCT approval in 2014 and 2015. The new transmission line
projects totaling about $165 million will add approximately 64 miles of 230 kV transmission lines along with other
transmission facilities. These projects are expected to be in service by the summer of 2016.
Entergy Mississippi has four transmission projects in various stages of development. These projects represent more
than $280 million in investments in Mississippi to support economic growth and provide additional reliability.
In-service dates are scheduled in 2018.
As we have said many times before, one of Entergy's priorities is to invest in infrastructure to better serve our
customers while maintaining reasonable rates. Our rates across all classes are approximately 20% below the national
average. Industrial rates in Louisiana and Texas are 15% to 20% below the national average. In addition, there is every
indication that natural gas prices in the United States will retain their competitive advantage for some time in relation to
the rest of the world. We believe that these low energy costs, combined with our competitive power rates and other
regional advantages, will continue to attract jobs and businesses to the communities we serve.
The resulting increase in industrial and other sales can and will facilitate our investment opportunity. It is important to
remember, however, that there are significant drivers of the need for that investment in addition to sales.

On that note, I know many of you have questions as to why industrial sales were lower this quarter following seven
straight quarters of robust growth. Macroeconomic factors, as well as outages by some of our large customers, masked
expansions by others, as well as the fact that other new customers began to come online. Drew will provide more detail
in a minute, but the vast majority of projects in our plan that were in advanced stages of development earlier this year
remain on course.
The fundamentals driving the industrial renaissance in our region – low natural gas prices, sophisticated connected
infrastructure, a ready, talented workforce – all remain strong. We therefore continue to be optimistic about the
opportunity for sustained industrial growth in our region. The significant economic development prospects for
Southeast Louisiana, in particular, have garnered recognition from the federal government.
Last month, the U.S. Department of Commerce named the New Orleans-to-Lake Charles chemical corridor to a
program launched in 2013 designed to accelerate the resurgence of manufacturing in America. This designation may
result in federal incentives and grants for the 12 new regions selected, of which ours is one. Entergy is proud to have
worked with local officials and other stakeholders to help this area achieve this distinction.
All of this progress, as well as that made in the first quarter of this year, is due to the sustained hard work of Entergy
employees, Entergy's collective efforts to work more collaboratively with our regulators and other stakeholders, and of
course, our regulators' commitment to balance the best interests of our customers, our communities and this company.
I will say again that we remain on track to execute our investment program that is the backbone of the commitments
we've made to our customers and other stakeholders. We continue to make progress on short and mid-term objectives
and expect substantial gains to result from that progress. We are doing what we said we would do, and there is every
reason to believe that we will achieve the financial performance that we have targeted.
EWC strategy revolves around executing well on what we control: the operations of the plants and the commercial
transactions to hedge the risk. In the second quarter, our plants ran well. Aside from Indian Point 3, the EWC nuclear
fleet delivered approximately 92% capacity factor, which includes a 34-day outage to refuel Pilgrim. As many of you
know, the transformer outage at Indian Point resulted in a 16-day shutdown of Unit 3.
You have heard me say before that EWC is a volatile business. We felt the negative impact of that volatility this
quarter, much as we've felt the positive impact in past quarters. Average Northeast power prices for the second quarter
were more than 40% below last year's levels. Moreover, forward power prices continue their decline following an
average of more than 6% for our plants in the Northeast since the end of March this year. These low prices are coupled
with a market structure that does not reflect the value of nuclear power.
Congress continues to indicate its concern about these specific market structure challenges. On July 8, the chairs of the
Senate and House Committees and Subcommittees responsible for energy and power, Senator Murkowski and
Congressmen Upton and Whitfield communicated this concern in a letter to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
Chairman, Norman Bay. In the letter, the Committee chairs raised concerns about organized wholesale electricity
markets, including the impact certain market rules were having on reliable base load plants, including nuclear plants,
and ultimately on consumers. Entergy shares these concerns, and we are encouraged by FERC's willingness to consider
these issues. We are also hopeful that FERC will take substantive action as soon as it can.
Our mission at EWC is today what it has always been, to optimize asset value and minimize risk. We continue to
pursue this mission through effective commercial operations and by vigorously pursuing fair regulatory processes and
frameworks. The latter would include an improvement in the design of the Northeastern power markets as well as
constructive outcomes on Indian Point.
On that note, over the years many different studies have provided clear evidence of Indian Point's importance to the
region. We saw the release of another last month by the Nuclear Energy Institute. This study found that Indian Point
contributes an estimated $1.6 billion to the economy of New York State annually and $2.5 billion to the nation as a
whole, all while contributing to New York State and national clean air goals. Quantification of these important benefits
reaffirms the value of this facility and provides yet another reason why we believe Indian Point must and will operate

into the next decade at the least.
That said, based on 2015 guidance, EWC is currently less than 15% of the Entergy's earnings. Our robust Utility
growth, grounded in $8 billion of investment and $3 billion to $4 billion in rate base growth, both through 2017, will
continue to reduce this percentage.
Also, as most of you know, the U.S. EPA issued the final version of its Clean Power Plan yesterday. The rule is
complex and it will take time for us to conduct a full analysis. While we continue to be concerned about the legality of
the EPA's approach, that analysis will focus on five key issues: one, the compliance timing; two, the requirements the
rule will impose on each state; three, a state's ability to elect a mass-based approach and establish a trading-ready plan;
four, the impact on the nation's existing nuclear fleet, which in 2014 comprised nearly 63% of the U.S.'s emissions-free
generation; and five, the overall impact the rule could have on our customers. You should expect to hear more from us
on the final rule in the weeks and months to come.
In conclusion, I would note that, as we have said in the past, our business is a long-term play. Short and even mid-term
volatility is embedded in it, but that does not track from this company's strong fundamentals. We are confident that the
growth opportunity in our utility service area is intact, that we have a solid strategy to realize that opportunity, that we
remain focused on managing risk and preserving optionality at EWC, and that we will vigorously pursue our business
plans and continue to make productive investments that help achieve long-term growth. As a result, Entergy's
performance for the quarter as well as the year is in line with our expectations. Earnings expectations for 2016 remain
in sight, and we're on track with our 2017 outlook.
As we noted last quarter, we expect that the stability and financial flexibility created by our actions this quarter, this
year and indeed over the last several years will put us in a position to begin to act on one of our major objectives of
sustained dividend growth, starting with the discussion with our board as early as this fall.
With that, let me turn the call over to Drew.
Andrew S. Marsh
Thank you, Leo. I'll start by covering our second quarter results and then I'll turn to our longer-term financial targets.
Slide three summarizes consolidated earnings per share. In second quarter of 2015, Entergy earned $0.83 per share, in
line with our expectations. Additional details on results are provided in the press release and slides published this
morning.
I'll cover some highlights on results starting on slide four, where Utility, Parent & Other had combined earnings per
share of $0.87 on an adjusted basis. This compares to $0.98 per share last year. Details of quarter-over-quarter
variances can be found in Appendix B-1 of the release and here are some of the key points.
Despite a 1.5% decline in sales volume quarter-over-quarter on a weather-adjusted basis, our overall net revenue
variance was positive. This was partly driven by capital investments that benefit customers, such as the new Ninemile 6
plant. Residential sales growth also contributed, as well as new industrial customers and expansion projects.
The increase in net revenue was offset by a corresponding rise in related depreciation, operations and maintenance
expenses and other items. O&M increases not offset in net revenue included increased nuclear-related expenses of
about $0.09. Lower half was from increased Nuclear Regulatory Commission oversight at the Arkansas Nuclear One
plant. Earlier this year, ANO was placed in Column 4 of the NRC's reactor oversight process. The increased levels of
costs for ANO are expected to continue into 2016.
I'll take a moment now to talk a little more about industrial sales volume this quarter on slide five. In total, the segment
was down 1.5%, driven by our existing customers. Refineries were down the most quarter-over-quarter due to their
turnaround season. We anticipated a more significant turnaround season than last year, however, it was a bit more
extensive than we expected due to macroeconomic factors such as high product inventories and the strong dollar.

Chlor-alkali was also down quarter-over-quarter and more so versus our expectations. Utilization from this sector was
lower than anticipated due to unplanned outages, compounded by margin pressure from lower demand and the markets
recently added supply, including our customers.
The decline in our existing large industrial groups masked growth from expansions and four new customers who began
to ramp up this quarter. Continuing a trend from last quarter, these new customers and customer expansions are coming
online and ramping up more slowly than expected. I'll talk more about that later as part of our forward-looking view.
Switching over for a minute to EWC, slide six indicates operational earnings per share this quarter were about
breakeven as expected. You may recall that we said on the first quarter earnings call that the bulk of 2015 earnings
were completed at that time. The quarter-to-quarter decline was driven by a $5 per megawatt-hour decrease in revenue
on the operating nuclear plants and lower volume from the 34-day refueling outage at Pilgrim compared to none last
year.
This decline in EWC nuclear revenue was the primary factor in the operating cash flow change as shown on slide
seven. Also reflected was improved net revenue at the Utility, largely triggered by productive investments put in
service to benefit customers.
For the full year view on slide eight, today, we affirm our 2015 earnings per share guidance with a midpoint of $5.50
and a range of plus or minus $0.40. Recognizing we still have the summer to go, we remain on track at each of our
segments to meet full-year expectations. You may recall that we expect some tax items to come into play this year, but
we currently do not expect any tax items in the third quarter.
Slide nine recaps the 2015 guidance midpoint for Utility, Parent & Other adjusted for weather, tax, and special items,
and 2016 and 2017 midpoint outlooks. These outlooks are consistent with our previous disclosures last year at Analyst
Day and at EEI. The slide also provides 2013 and 2014 results on a comparable basis. This presentation illustrates how
the base business has grown, with expectations for continuing growth through 2017.
The two main drivers for this growth are making productive investments and improving our Utility return on equity as
shown on slide 10. Importantly, our plans for capital investment to modernize our infrastructure, maintain and enhance
reliability and meet new compliance standards have not changed. Our 2016 rate base growth includes the Union Power
plant acquisition, which approved by the required regulators, would contribute roughly $0.02 per share per month in
2016. While we have made some adjustments to the structure, our regulatory procedural schedules in required
jurisdiction still allow for us to close by the end of the year.
In addition, we have moved up the projected in-service date of the St. Charles Power Station project. Assuming LPSC
approval next summer, the new construction drawdown schedule will accelerate about $0.03 per share of AFUDC into
2016 and $0.08 per share into 2017.
Approximately, 90% of our $8 billion of planned investment from 2015 through 2017 will fall under a formula rate
plan rider or other constructive regulatory mechanism. This percentage includes the forward test year FRP proposed in
the Entergy Arkansas rate case. New rates will be effective by early 2016 for the rate case and in early 2017, the
changes are warranted in the first FRP review.
Regarding sales growth for the balance of the year, we're already seeing evidence that the refining sector is once again
performing as expected. However, with the chlor-alkali markets challenged, the balance recently added supply. Overall
usage from these customers for the remainder of the year may not reach the levels we had anticipated.
Still, new customers and expansions are coming online. Previously, we had indicated that the vast majority of our large
industrial customers were already under construction or had reached their final investment decisions. This is still the
case. However, we have seen them trail their own expectations the last couple of quarters.
Of 17 large industrial projects expected during the year, 14 are complete or under construction. Of the 14, most have
experienced delays getting online and a few have lower ramp rates than expected or lower peak usage than expected.
Of the three that are not under construction, they currently are delayed and represent only about 0.1% of our expected
industrial sales next year.

O&M expense is another element of managing our return on equity. We're anticipating some benefit over time from the
roll-off of temporary nuclear-compliant cost at an approximate 50 basis points to 75 basis point increase in discount
pension rate to 4.75% in 2016 and 5% in 2017.
Looking further ahead, we expect our capital investments in plant infrastructure, transmission and other distribution
system improvements will ultimately lower O&M cost for our customers while enhancing reliability in our service
territory. We will persist in looking for every opportunity to control O&M cost as part of our plan to meet our
commitments to all our key stakeholders.
Given current considerations, such as capital investment, rate actions, cost changes and interest rate assumptions, our
financial outlook continues to support our previously stated expectations for Utility, Parent & Other earnings per share.
As illustrated on the slide, for 2016, we're currently near the lower end of the range.
For EWC, EBITDA projections have declined as shown on slide 11. Our expected energy and capacity prices have
dropped by $1 to $2 per megawatt hour since March 31. As you know, wholesale prices are volatile. We continue to
follow our hedging philosophy that allows us to benefit from upward price movements while protecting against
operational and credit risks.
All in all, our actions this quarter and plans for the future represent sizable Utility, Parent & Other earnings growth
potential in the coming years. The fundamentals in the Utility business to achieve this growth are in place, including
our solid credit profile reflected on slide 12. Backed by these credentials, we are maintaining a sound financial
foundation to make investments and better serve our customers.
We will continue to executing the plan we've laid for you. Every plan faces challenges; we are confident in our ability
to meet them and succeed. Our mission as a company is to create sustainable value for our four stakeholders: our
owners, our customers, our employees, and the communities we operate in. That mission is foremost in what we do
every day.
And now, the Entergy team is available for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Greg Gordon from Evercore. Your line is now
open.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Thanks. I have two questions. At what point, and when we're looking at the 2017 midpoint
outlook, do you re-assess the ramp rate on the industrial projects that were already up and running and the expected
in-service date of those that are still in queue? And give us a full update. It would seem that you really wouldn't have
visibility with any degree of certainty until some point in early to mid 2016, is that fair?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Theo?
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: Hey, Greg. This is Theo Bunting. As part of our planning process, we try to get as much
information around it as we possibly can. And I think in terms of when you would expect us to see some updates
relative to that, we'd probably be pointing toward EEI in that timeframe. And as you said and as Drew has mentioned in
his opening comments, that information does change from time to time and our expectation is we'll try to stay abreast
with that as best as we can and continue to update it as new information becomes available so that we can relate into
our overall expectations.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Greg, this is Leo. I'll just add while – and we've said this since the beginning as it relates to the
addition of these customers, they're big projects, $1 billion investments; some cases, $10 billion dollar investments.
Schedule is always an issue in that kind of thing. Our sector has the same issue when we build big projects that are first

The issue here is while it's common and some may come early, some may come late, they may ramp differently the
investment profile that we've got between now and then, it remains intact. And as you recall, the way the business
model works, rate base growth is kind of what we're targeting here. And so, if you look out there, whether they come in
a little bit late or a little bit early doesn't really change when these power plants come. The only changes we've made – I
think Drew outlined them in a little more detail , so did I in the script – is a couple of the capital projects that we had
are actually coming up earlier than we had originally planned, just given the timing and the need. And it's a
combination of this growth from the sector, but also the need to replace the aging infrastructure that we have and the
opportunity to get these things done and constructed.
So it's not just the sales piece of it that we need to look at it from a timing standpoint. It's coming; some of it's coming
later because of the size of the projects and other factors, but the investment profile that we've got over the next several
years and through the first part of the decade is pretty much on track.
<A - Greg Gordon>: Okay. Understood. So to get your guidance aspiration for 2017 then, if we flex expectations for
top line revenues from industrial, you'd have to either readdress your expectations for revenue requirement from other
customer classes or flex your costs then?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Yeah, I think that's true in a short-term basis. As we have said, these productive investments,
we would expect to ultimately get into rates. And if the sales aren't where we would expect them to be in any given
period, you're right, we would have to adjust in another area.
<A - Greg Gordon>: Okay. Second question is on EWC. Obviously, the power curves have come off quite a bit in
New York and New England. Can we attribute that to winter premiums coming off or is it summer discounts getting
steeper, some combination of both? And do you think there's any market activity that you can see in the foreseeable
future that might reverse that trend?
<A - William M. Mohl>: Greg, this is Bill. A couple of things. I mean, obviously, we've seen gas prices come off
tremendously, probably $1 since last summer. We've also seen some folks take some steps to try to mitigate gas supply
issues, that type of thing, in terms of using LNG facilities for base loading of plants, that type of thing. So I think
there's a number of issues in the market that have driven those prices down.
As we look forward, we are slightly bullish gas prices. As we look into 2016, that increases a little bit over time. But
we are seeing some movement in New England in terms of some market structure improvements that would come on in
the 2017, 2018 timeframe and some energy price formation issues that could be constructive. I don't anticipate at this
point seeing the numbers we saw in 2014. I mean that was largely driven by the polar vortex and kind of the aftermath
of that, but we do see some constructive positive steps from an energy price point perspective.
<A - Greg Gordon>: Yeah. And the reason I asked is because you moved your hedging – the construct of your hedges
around a bit for next year and hedged up just a fair amount more, but there were no demonstrable changes in your
hedge profile beyond 2016.
<A - William M. Mohl>: Yeah.
<A - Greg Gordon>: Is that a fact? Is that a function of your point of view?
<A - William M. Mohl>: Yes, that is a function of our point of view. And to be frank, what we're seeing out in the
market as well. There's little bit less liquidity out in the market, and obviously we don't want to put ourselves in a
situation where we're locking in at these low prices at this point in time. So we're evaluating that as we go, and we think
there's some upside.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates. Your line is now open.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Good morning.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Morning, Paul.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Morning.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Just, I guess, I wanted to sort of follow up on that letter that you mentioned from Murkowski
and some other Republican leaders regarding market reforms. And I noticed it as well. And I guess what I'm wondering
is, I mean, how quickly do you think anything from that will actually come about? And I mean – I don't know. I mean,
they also [ph] sort of threatened legislation if they couldn't get it done (36:05). I don't know. I mean I just was
wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit more what you think the practical benefit of that would actually maybe
be?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Sure. As it relates to that letter, I think it's on track with our general thoughts in terms of what
needs to happen in the market. We've had similar discussions with the ISOs and a number of other stakeholders. We
think that, in general, depending on what gets implemented, there is upside potential of, say, $3 to $6 a megawatt-hour
as a result of these changes to energy price formation.
Now the question on timing, this will come probably in increments. And as you look at the timing of being
implemented, you're probably looking at a timeframe of 2017, 2018 before they could actually make those changes to
their systems and get those in place where we would see that uplift.
Now the exception there is what we've got going in ISO New England as it relates to the Winter Reliability Program.
That's currently being reviewed by FERC as we speak, and we could see some uplift there in the upcoming winter if we
get a decision in our favor as it relates to that. So it will kind of evolve over time, but we see that happening across the
next five years or so, three to five years.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: And it will be series of steps is what we're talking about, I guess, as opposed to one sort of...
<A - Leo P. Denault>: That's what I would think, Paul, is it's -- I think just having discussions with the ISO, there is
some practical issues you have to deal with in terms of how you can change the systems associated with that, and so
they're more than likely would be steps taken along the way as opposed to one just big massive change.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. Great. And then just on Friday, there was a order out of FERC that denied the
authorization that some of your subsidiaries were seeking for to issue and sell securities and what have you. And I can't
recall seeing that before with FERC. I think of it as kind of run of the mill; maybe I'm wrong. So I was a little surprised
to see that they rejected it.
I know that you guys can – it's without prejudice, you can re-file. Just wondering, is there any significance to this? Or is
this just sort of a hiccup that happened because of the format which they seemed to be unhappy with or how you guys
reported it? Could you just elaborate a little bit more on that?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: I think you hit on most of it in terms of the format. They have a way of using
backward-looking results to assess what the coverage ratio ought to be, and we had suggested some changes to that and
they didn't want to put them in. So, I think it is a bit of a technical challenge, but we should be able to put the new filing
in and get that complete fairly quickly.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. Thanks a lot.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Thank you.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Thanks, Paul.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Weinstein from UBS. Your line is now open.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Hi, good morning. It's Julien.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Hello. Good morning, Julien.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Bill, perhaps first question just as it relates to Texas and the station and the decision to
pull that out, just being curious, could you jive that with the RFP and what the ultimate thought process is around
pursuing self-build options or acquisitions under rate base, I suppose? What drove the decision? Provide a little context
there and ultimately next up.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Theo?
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: Hi, Julien. This is Theo. As Leo indicated, I mean really in Texas, it came down to – it
was clear that a clear path in Texas that the parties really preferred a long-term capacity solution located in the State of
Texas. And as he said earlier, our Western RFP is seeking just that.
Our objective in Texas is to obtain support of the staff and other customer groups for approaches that meet the
generation resource needs in Texas. And I mean, clearly, as the record indicated, as it relates to the Union transaction,
that was not the case. And as Leo mentioned in the script also in his opening comments, there's been an interest
expressed in the New Orleans and we'll pursue regulatory approvals in New Orleans with the City Council relative to
that.
The second part of your question, I'm not sure I understood when you said kind of what's next.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Right. I suppose fundamentally, there's not necessarily any opposition to doing rate
base or [ph] self build (41:06) option per se, right? This was more about a locational angle on the plan rather than your
ownership of the unit per se, correct?
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: We don't believe there's any opposition to self-build. Matter of fact, if you go and
explore the record, there were mentions by the other parties around another option being a self-build option in Texas.
So we don't clearly believe there's any opposition to it. It was just a preference from the interveners and other parties in
Texas. And clearly, I think that our views and comments relative to other options made it clear that a self-build is
something that could be pursued in the future.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Got it. And then separately on transmission, I know you've provided some background
here, but I'd be curious. I suppose MISO did an out-of-cycle study on [ph] MISO South(41:56) during the quarter.
Could you elaborate on that and as it relates to the studies that you discussed yourself at the various utilities and
ultimately how that jives with your capital budgeting process and if that's already reflected in your CapEx expectation?
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: Sure. I mean, we had one out-of-cycle project, I believe, which was the Lake Charles
project. But in terms of just transmission and MISO, in general, I mean as you know, we have a fairly robust
transmission investment in 2015 through 2017 capital cycle. We really nearly doubled in 2015 versus 2014. And as Leo
went through his opening comments, he mentioned a number of transmission projects that are currently in the process
of being approved and will be on the way shortly, approximately almost $800 million of transmission projects. So, we
feel good about the fact that we've got transmission opportunities.
In terms of the MISO study, the [ph] BOR (42:59) study in that MISO accelerated six projects into MTEP15. And
largely, most of those projects were already in our plan, but what we do see potentially is an opportunity for
acceleration of some of those projects. And the fact that MISO was moving forward in that process give us higher
confidence that these projects will be approved by MISO.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Then perhaps just to clarify, is that already reflected in your CapEx outlook as it
pertains today?

Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Eggers from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Hey. Good morning, guys.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Leo, just on the industrial outlook and kind of maybe the longer-term prospects, can you share a
little bit about how much time you're spending on economic development and kind of courting industrial customers,
you're pretty busy last year. How was that changing, if at all, right now?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: I'll let Theo jump in, but we continue to work that process across all of our jurisdictions. Seeing
a lot of success, obviously, with things that are under construction in the near term in the Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas
and others. But as we've mentioned earlier, as we went through our reorganization last year, one of the things that we
had done was beef up the business and economic development functions and we continue to have those folks out
working the process, things like the region designation here in Louisiana, other things we're working to make sure that
we help continue to promote the region.
So I guess how much time we spend? Quite a bit. Some people it's their – we have a department that's their full-time
job working with the states and obviously the states aren't backing off of this either. All of them are working very, very
diligently to try and help bring economic development.
So that includes we continue to utilize our site selection database. We continue to try and pre-certify sites. We continue
to build transmission into areas that could house more manufacturing, but for the fact that they're not necessarily ready
yet. So all of those things, both in our activities from economic development, operationally, and also from the
regulatory process, we're continuing to push forward on all of that.
Now, Theo, I don't know if you want to add anything.
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: I guess, Dan, one thing I'll add in addition is we continue to work very closely with
states in which we serve. And as Leo mentioned, we and the regulatory environment itself, I mean, if you'll look at
some of the transmission projects you mentioned that we've done, some of those transmission projects are specific
around working to foster economic development in the regions. And so we have a lot of people dedicated full-time to
helping the regions that we serve grow. That's part of our growth story.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Okay. So, I guess, if I think about the economic growth from here, maybe I'll say it differently.
If you look at the industrial demand – or industrial recruitment today, are the whiteboards more full or less full than
they were six or nine months ago? I mean, is the population of opportunity changing as you talk to customers?
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: I would say we are continuing to pursue more opportunities and try to keep that pipeline
growing. I mean, that's our objective quite frankly is to do as much as we can to continue to see a growth in the
pipeline. In terms of kind of where we are now versus six months ago, I'd have to go back and look at the data
specifically, but it is something we focus on. And we understand that having a strong pipeline is really a key to having
success in the economic development area.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Okay.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Dan, I'll just add the investments that we're making in the system, again, make the area more
conducive. So we're modernizing the generation fleet. We're improving the fuel cost because of that. We are improving

reliability because we're building – things like the Lake Charles transmission project that's going to not only help serve
the customers that are under construction down there, but it's going to beef up the system down there to be able to
handle more. So we can kind of get out.
While we're replacing the aging infrastructure, beefing up the reliability to meet new requirements and to meet existing
construction of those facilities, it puts us in a better position to bring those in. So the investment profile helps fulfill not
only what we're doing right now, but bring other stuff in as well.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: And I guess, Bill, separate from market reforms, when you guys think about your model and
your point of view, do you see gaps against the $4 where you think New England, New York prices should be today
and maybe help quantify what you think the delta is with the sell-off in power prices?
<A - William M. Mohl>: Yeah. I think what we're seeing obviously from a supply perspective is continued growth in
the supply in Marcellus. Obviously, that is creating a discount to Henry Hub. And as we look forward in terms of our
pricing, we don't see those numbers going above $4 anytime in the near future. I mean, we see that staying fairly
consistent with now, but again I said we're bullish.
So we see it rising, but not getting above that level. So, that's kind of where we sit and obviously, the power prices are
commensurate with that, I mean, as you look at that from an energy price perspective.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: And that's true. I'll just add that once you get out a little further on the curve, and Bill
mentioned this earlier, there's a bit of a liquidity discount that's out there. And we've seen this in the past as you [ph]
roll the prop (49:12), some of that comes out of the market and improve things a little bit. But some of that had gone
away last year, but it seems to have reasserted itself again.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: So I guess but for some backwardation because of liquidity, you think the curves are pretty
realistic to where the fundamental value is?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: No. I said we're still slightly bullish. For 2016, we're a little bullish and that kind of increases as
we go out over time, but it's relative to where we were a year ago. It's obviously a lower price level.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Okay. Got it. Thank you, guys.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Well, good morning.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning, Jonathan.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Good morning.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Leo, could you just help us kind of parse your statement about the dividend still being
potentially up for discussion in the full? When we look at your Utility, Parent & Other, the low end of guidance for
2016 would put the payout ratio above the 65% to 75% target a little bit. So are you going to be thinking about other
things beyond payout?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: What we're looking at is a long-term perspective, Jonathan, in the growth in the business. So I
think that the way I've characterized it in the past is that we're looking out several years, we're looking at sustained
dividend path. We're not going to jump around with it to follow when earnings go up a bunch, when you raise it a lot.
When they don't go up raise it a little, we're trying to get ourselves more of a glide path view about the long-term
prospects of the company.

And as we've said, we look at the investment profile that we have for the aging infrastructure, for the reliability
requirements, for environmental needs, as well as the growth we're seeing in the business and that helps facilitate all of
that. And we see an upward sloping long-term trajectory that would indicate to us that the time is right to look at when
to start to follow that earnings path, and that could be as early as this fall.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Anthony Crowdell from Jefferies. Your line is now open.
<Q - Anthony C. Crowdell>: Good morning. Just two quick questions. I wanted to follow-up on Dan's question. Your
view on gas, I mean is it closer to the $3 number or the $4 number? And second, in your comments, Leo, you had
stressed or stated that EWC makes up roughly 15% of the consolidated company's earnings. Where is the sweet spot
there with EWC?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Do you want to talk about gas?
<A - William M. Mohl>: Yeah. I think on the gas price, I mean you guys know where it is right now. We're closer to
the $3 level than the $4 level at the front end of the curve.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: As far as the sweet spot, I mean I wouldn't say there's a sweet spot or not. It's just a fact of the
matter is right now, the investment profile that we have in the Utility is very, very robust. The opportunity for returns
are very good there, the need for the investment because of, as we've mentioned before, 75% of our non-nuclear
facilities in the Utility are over 30 years old.
I mentioned MSU plant, for example, in my prepared remarks. That's a plant that's been online since 1960s. And there
are more efficient ways currently, once we beef up the transmission system and meet the MISO requirements, to be
able to serve that load and deactivate that unit. We've deactivated 25 units since 2010 and we continue to go on a path
to have more and bigger units in that realm as we add to the system.
The risk/reward trade-off is just better at the Utility than it is at EWC for our deployment of capital. So, it's less than
15%, and I'm being generous with that because I take out the tax benefits that were showing up in the 2015 numbers
before you get close to 15% in 2015. And if you just project out forward what's happening with the Utility business and
the growth profile we have there, 15% becomes smaller. The 15% becomes smaller and smaller as we go through time
given that trade-off.
So there's no sweet spot; it's just a fact. And as it relates to the business itself, it's a different business, should have a
different investor mix, should have a different dividend profile, should have a different commercial reality. And so our
objectives right now are to grow the Utility business, and we have no plans to grow the EWC business, the merchant
business given that risk-reward trade-off and the different investor base. But the fact is over time, between now and
2020 in particular, we're going to become more and more and more a utility. That's just a fact.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Hey guys. Just – I wanted to make sure I understood something on the Utility capital
spending levels and the Utility demand trends. It strikes me that your tone today was that the demand trends, a little bit
softer or maybe a little bit more delayed than expected, but then when you talked about the capital spending trends and

the generation, it seems, as if several new projects have moved forward a year or so. Just curious, it seems like if
demand were pushed out a little bit, maybe projects would get pushed out, not accelerated, but can you just kind of
walk me through the difference there?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Well, I'll start and let others jump in, Michael. But the – remember, for almost a decade, we've
had a, I think we called it the portfolio transformation strategy, where we've been working to replace the generation
fleet. Over the course of the last several years, maybe not quite a decade, but maybe close, we've seen an ever-changing
landscape of reliability requirements out of the NERC, and certainly a continuation of environmental policies, et cetera,
whether it's MATS or now CPP or what have you.
All of those things have created a real need for us to continue to modernize our generation fleet, to add new
transmission facilities, and to make investments in environmental compliance, and we're going to continue to do that.
We're at a point now where we – as we change out that generation fleet, it's turning more and more, absent the Union
projects, turning more and more to the construction to replace that aging fleet.
So that, that part of the process is reasonably agnostic to what the demand growth is. You're changing out a megawatt
for a megawatt because you're getting a more efficient new power plant in place versus one that where the O&M's
creeping up, et cetera, because of its age, and that just happens over time. So, that's really not changed one way or the
other. The growth, whether it's a little bit delayed or not, is still pretty crisp, and we're making plans to build generation
to replace the aging infrastructure as well as meet that new demand. If a plant slips a year, that doesn't really change the
capital program. And in fact, even as long ago as the Analyst Day, when we were asked, "so what could beef up your
capital program?" we said, "well, not very much because it's a long – you got a plan this stuff in advance." So even
back then, we had mentioned that the capital program around the edges wouldn't change a lot as long as the demand
growth stayed in a reasonably close proximity to what we were seeing. And so delays one way or the other were what
we mentioned back then might have some impact, that projects might move around, but that they were still going to
show up.
So, all it is is sharpening the pencil on the need for the facilities and when we can get it done based on age of the fleet,
the interaction with the transmission system and when this stuff is showing up. And right now, there hasn't been big
enough shifts in anything to change the construction program versus where we were. Yeah, a couple of projects we're
going to market test for an earlier project. We are bringing the new – the new generation here at St. Charles project
online a little earlier. We brought Ninemile 6 online early, and I think we've learned from that in terms of the timing it
takes. So we were embedding in some of these projects how long it would take to go from planning to development to
construction, and we've proven we can do it faster and at lower cost. And that's what happened at Ninemile, and that's
what we'd anticipate what happen at St. Charles project and likely happened in some of the other stuff as well. So, we
are – the construction program meets many needs. Sales growth is one of them and an important one. We have to be
ready, willing and able to serve these customers when they show up, and if they show up six months later than they had
planned, we still want to be there with a reliable system when they show up. And that's really all we're doing.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it. And then one question on the EWC. What do you see as the impact, and do you
think it's already embedded in market expectations for some of the new pipeline projects, maybe Constitution, which is
coming online in New York. There's also some smaller pipelines that actually came on in New York pretty recently, as
well as some of the more longer dated projects, the Eversource and Spectra project or the Kinder Morgan one to get
new gas up into New England.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: I think, the Eversource-Spectra project is one that is kind of included in the current market
expectations. Obviously in New York, I think, those are progressing well and are also kind of already included in the
market. I think, the issue is going to be, how did some of those get paid for specifically in New England, and how --
what is the cost recovery mechanism going to be and how is that going to work? Is it going to go through the legislative
process? And then, yeah, but I think a lot of that is built in to expectations kind of going forward.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Thanks, Michael.

Thank you. And our final question will come from David Paz from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.
<Q - David A. Paz>: Hey, good morning.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning, David.
<Q - David A. Paz>: I believe your 2017 Utility outlook expected 3.25% or a 3.75% retail sales growth on average.
Just want to make sure, is that still – does your outlook still expect to reflect that CAGR?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Well, I mean, we have continued to look at them, and as Theo mentioned, we'll have a fuller
update later this fall probably the EI, but our expectations given a number of changing variables are that we're still in
the middle of that range.
<Q - David A. Paz>: Great. And do you just – do you have – I don't know if you have given this before, but have you
– what would every 100-basis point change in that CAGR do to your 2017 target, all else equal?
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: I don't know that we published a rule of thumb on the growth rate of industrial change.
Certainly, yeah, a 1% change in our existing base is about $0.11.
<A - Paula Waters>: Or total [indiscernible] (01:02:19).
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: Yeah. So it's like $0.02 for industrial $0.04 for commercial, $0.05 or so, $0.06 for the
residential piece. So I think – and that's a 1% change across all segments. So on the existing piece, but I don't know that
we've published a rule of thumb around sensitivities for the industrial change in the growth piece 1%. It will be a little
different than the existing piece because the existing piece has the demand charges built into it already. And so you
would only be seeing the variability around the energy piece that we – that we actually sell the customers. So – and
that's about 50% of the margin for the industrial piece. So, I don't know – it seems like that might be about $0.04, but I
don't have those numbers in front of me.
<Q - David A. Paz>: Okay. No, that's helpful. Thank you.
Operator
