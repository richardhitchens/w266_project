MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Entergy Corporation Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings
Teleconference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the
conference over to Paula Waters, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please begin.
Paula Waters
Good morning and thank you for joining us. We will begin today with comments from Entergy's Chairman and CEO,
Leo Denault, and then Drew Marsh, our CFO, will review results. In an effort to accommodate everyone who has
questions, we request that each person ask no more than two questions.
In today's call, management will make certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties
that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.
Additional information concerning these risks and uncertainties is included in the company's SEC filings.
And now, I'll turn the call over to Leo.
Leo P. Denault
Thank you, Paula, and good morning, everyone. Today we're reporting fourth quarter operational earnings per share of
$1.58, consistent with the guidance we gave you last quarter. It was a good quarter overall, although developments
related to resolving lingering risks and uncertainties resulted in a few nonrecurring expenses. Namely, we had two
regulatory charges in the Utility related to long-standing matters, and we reported two additional asset impairments,
reflecting the changes in strategic direction for the EWC business.

With those things now mostly behind us, we've initiated 2016 guidance with the midpoint in line with our expectations.
We also affirmed our 2017 and 2018 Utility, Parent & Other financial outlook. 2015 was a pivotal year for us. We
accomplished much of what we set out to do, working in the interests of all four of our stakeholders. For our customers,
we began making investments in our long-term capital plan to continue modernizing our infrastructure and maintain a
reliable and efficient system.
Meanwhile, we controlled the overall cost on our customer builds and obtained new legislation and regulatory actions.
These accomplishments facilitate our ability to continue improving our service to customers. Our employees, we
continue to purchase, to pursue our organizational health initiative soliciting feedback from our workforce and using it
to strengthen our culture and enhance our organization.
For our communities, we continued our focus on education, putting particular emphasis on workforce development. We
began a $5 million five-year workforce development initiative in partnership with the communities we serve. The first
round of grants will be announced soon. We also contributed approximately $3 million throughout 2015 in support of
education through organizations such as Teach For America, STEM NOLA, Jobs for America's Graduates and City
Year, among others. Our employees echoed our commitment giving more than 95,000 hours of their time to support
education and other causes.
Combined with our work in other areas like assistance to low income families, these contributions are accomplishing
several objectives. We are creating economic activity when trained and educated people enter the workforce. We are
creating valuable resources and a competitive advantage for our region, helping to attract new businesses. Our efforts
work for us as we need new skilled employees. And perhaps, most importantly, our efforts provide an opportunity to
those that might not otherwise have one, so that the cycle of poverty can be eliminated for a family for generations to
come.
For our owners, we successfully executed on our strategy designed to provide long-term growth and stability, and
therefore increased our dividend by 2.4%, the first increase in more than five years. We'll continue working towards
our objective of steady predictable dividend growth. We also strengthened our credit profile as recognized by the major
rating agencies with several positive changes in the outlooks for our ratings along with a rating upgrade for Entergy
New Orleans by Moody's.
Nevertheless, in some ways, 2015 was a year of challenges and evolution. Our total shareholder return for 2015 was
disappointing. However, our return since September 30th have placed us second overall among our 20 utility peers.
Your positive reaction to successes and other actions since the third quarter of 2015 validates the momentum we see as
we move into 2016.
At EWC, we took steps to reduce volatility and getting clarity on the future of the business. Closing Pilgrim and
FitzPatrick was not the path we wanted to take. After pursuing many alternatives, they ultimately were the only options
remaining for us. We know they are tough decisions for those involved. And we are committed to supporting our
employees who work at these plants and their communities, throughout this difficult transition.
I'll take a moment now to expand more on some of our fourth quarter 2015 accomplishments beginning with the
Utility. I've mentioned the necessity to continue to modernize our infrastructure and maintain a reliable system. To this
end, our purchase of Union Power Station has received the necessary retail regulatory approvals. One last approval is
pending from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Upon closing, the purchase of this plant will provide lower
cost, reliable generation to our customers for many years to come.
2015 also saw the start of our regulatory process for the St. Charles Generation Project, a 980-megawatt combined
cycle gas turbine plant to be constructed in Montz, Louisiana. We've requested approval from the Louisiana Public
Service Commission to proceed with the construction of this new modern plant which will provide economic and
reliable power for many years. The targeted and service date is June of 2019.
In addition to approval of more than $700 million of transmission investments in all four states of our service territory
as part of the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, or MISO, MTEP15 process, we initiated one of the largest

transmission projects in our history. This project includes two new substations, expansion of two existing substations,
and 25 miles of new high-voltage transmission lines around the Lake Charles, Louisiana area.
We will both enhance reliability for existing customers in that area, as well as support new load in this growing region
of Louisiana. The Louisiana Public Service Commission approved a certificate of public need and necessity at its
Business and Executive Session in December. We expect construction to begin in the first quarter of 2016.
Our regulatory frameworks are now better aligned to facilitate future investments to enhance the efficiency and
reliability of our system to benefit our customers. We're seeing the results of this improved framework in the settlement
of our Arkansas rate case. The settlement reflects a net $133 million base rate increase and a 9.75% authorized return
on equity effective at the end of February. It also sets the framework for the formula rate plan with a future test year in
the coming years. The Arkansas Public Service Commission is expected to act on the settlement and issue an order later
this month.
With this new regulatory structure, we will have increased financial flexibility and ability to execute on capital
investments in response to our customers' needs. Affirming this view, Moody's revised EAI's outlook to positive in
April, following the adoption of the legislation allowing for a forward test year FRP and the filing of the rate case to
use the new FRP. Moreover, the new regulatory structure will help Entergy Arkansas support economic expansion,
creating jobs for our customers in these communities and spreading fixed costs over more sales and helping to maintain
a rate advantage.
We will be able to provide similar benefits to our customers in Mississippi as Entergy Mississippi's first FRP with
forward-looking features was approved earlier in 2015. In addition, we've been partnering with Mississippi state
officials to help bring 2,500 jobs to Hinds County through a $1.45 billion tire plant in our service territory. Mississippi
lawmakers approved an incentive package for Continental Tires, one of the top five worldwide automotive suppliers, to
build a new facility near Clinton. This announcement further demonstrates how Mississippi is a premier location for
automotive production as they join Nissan and Toyota in the state.
In Texas we're using some of the new rider mechanisms to provide similar financial flexibility and the ability to support
the needs of our customers. We've reached a settlement for an incremental increase to our distribution investment rider
of just over $5 million, effective at the start of the year. The Public Utility Commission of Texas approved the
settlement last week. We also are nearing completion of the regulatory view of our request for an incremental $13
million revenue requirement under a similar rider for transmission investment. We expect a proposal for a decision later
this month and the commission consideration in March.
Finally, we reached a milestone on December 29 when we received the final approval from FERC to end the system
agreement among Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Texas and Entergy New Orleans, the three operating companies that
remain parties to the agreement. This is an important step toward simplifying our regulatory structure and reducing risk
and uncertainty for us and our customers. It will allow us to put greater focus on the distinct opportunities at each of
our retail regulatory jurisdictions as well as our core operations without the distractions from the near constant
inter-regional litigation associated with this agreement.
Along with our plans for capital investment. we are carefully monitoring the effect of these investments on our
customer's bills. Based on the most recent EAI data, our average rates are over 25% below the national average.
Historically low natural gas prices also have helped lower customer bills and are offsetting some increases in base
rates. As a result, our customers will continue to benefit from some of the lowest rates in the country, while also
benefiting from a more modern and efficient electric system.
Looking back at EWC in the fourth quarter, we've worked towards a resolution on the future of each of our plants,
advancing our strategy to both provide capital to invest in other opportunities and to reduce risk and volatility from this
part of our business. We closed on the sale of our 583 megawatt Rhode Island CCGT on December 17. This plant was a
good investment for us. Its sale now frees up resources we can use to support other opportunities.
The New York ISO recently determined that retirement of FitzPatrick when combined with several other facilities will
result in a resource adequacy shortfall in 2019. However, we expect there will be more cost effective solutions to fill

this need. And ISO New England determined that there is no reliability need associated with the Pilgrim retirement in
June of 2019. As a result, we will move forward with plans to close those plants. As we've said before, these difficult
yet necessary steps are not what we wanted.
On a positive note, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued the license amendments for Palisades, reflecting
updated guidance, inspection and analysis on the reactor vessel head embrittlement. These amendments confirmed that
the plant meets the appropriate criteria to run till the end of its extended license and will not be forced into an early
shutdown. At Indian Point, we continued to pursue license renewal and each of our paths to resolve the Coastal Zone
Management Act and Clean Water Act requirements remains open.
The NRC confirmed that our timely application for a renewal enabled the continued operation of Indian Point
following the original expiration date of the unit's license this past December. Additionally, the NRC issued a draft
update to the Indian Point supplemental environmental impact statement, which reaffirmed the NRC's previous
conclusion that the environmental effects of Indian Point's continued operation are not an obstacle to license renewal.
And lastly, Vermont Yankee announced that it will be ready to begin the transfer of spent fuel into dry cask starting in
2017, two years earlier than originally planned. We're seeking approval from the Vermont Public Service Board for a
certificate of public good so we can begin construction of the storage pad to complete the safe transfer to dry storage.
Now it's time to look to the future. Last year's strategic accomplishments have ultimately set us up to undertake an
equally ambitious list for 2016. You can read the list on slide three. Several of the items listed are related to closing out
the regulatory agenda we began in 2015, and using the tools we have to execute on our capital investment plan. These
regulatory items include the now-approved distribution rider and the pending transmission rider filings in Texas, and
making our first forward-looking formula rate plan filings in Arkansas and Mississippi, as well as the second combined
Entergy Louisiana FRP filings, using a 2015 test year.
Also on our to-do list are steps which help continue to modernize and enhance our utility system. As I said earlier, we
requested approval from the Louisiana Public Service Commission to proceed with the construction of the St. Charles
power station. We will make selections in our request for proposals for Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Texas long-term
resources in the coming months. We will begin construction of the Lake Charles transmission project as well as
numerous other significant transmission projects.
Lastly, we continue to move forward with the process for installing smart meters on our utility system. Smart meters
are a foundational investment in the grid modernization opportunity I spoke about at EEI. These types of investments
are another way for us to lower cost and improve service for our customers. Some benefits of AMI include operational
efficiencies, timely information provided to our customers, so they can better understand and control their usage and
faster outage restoration and improved system reliability for our customers.
The next step involved further engaging our regulators and other stakeholders to discuss this investment and its
associated benefits, and we continue to evaluate other investments in the grid that can benefit our customers. The
operating companies anticipate making regulatory filings where applicable for the smart meter investment between the
third quarter of 2016 and the third quarter of 2017. A piece of the three-year capital plan laid out on our slides today is
earmarked for this initiative, and we will share more with you over time on AMI, as well as what might be next.
At EWC, we continue to make plans and preparations for transitioning the FitzPatrick and Pilgrim nuclear plants to the
decommissioning phase. At Pilgrim, we will make a decision, by midyear, on whether to refuel the plant for another
two-year operating cycle.
I'd like to take a moment to personally thank the more than 1,200 employees at both our Pilgrim and FitzPatrick plants
for staying focused on continued safe and secure operations. I want to acknowledge their professionalism, dedication,
and hard work, throughout this time of transition. After all, the underlying objective that supports all of the initiatives
on the to-do list is the imperative to get the fundamentals right. Without that, nothing else works. That means
continuing to deliver safe reliable power and natural gas to our customers at the lowest reasonable cost.

These actions combined with our other ongoing initiatives will contribute towards meeting our objectives in the interest
of all four of our stakeholders, that is the execution of the journey we set out on three years ago. We have set clear
objectives to create sustainable value for all of our stakeholders. For owners, deliver top-quartile returns through steady
and predictable Utility, Parent & Other earnings growth and dividend growth, while reducing risk particularly in the
volatile commodity exposed generation business.
For our customers, deliver top-quartile customer satisfaction through anticipating customer needs and exceeding their
expectations, while keeping rates reasonable. For our employees, earn the top-quartile score for organizational health
by providing a stable environment with a healthy culture that provides clear direction to our employees and attractive
opportunities for career development. And for our communities where all of us live, maintaining an active role in
making things better. This includes helping to bring jobs through economic development, helping ensure we have a
trained workforce available to fill those jobs, giving both our time and financial support, and operating in a socially and
environmentally responsible way.
These objectives form the basis of our strategy: investing in the Utility to benefit customers while maintaining
competitive rates, with ready access to capital and timely and predictable investment recovery, providing the financial
strength and flexibility we need to make these investments, and reducing volatility from our merchant business and
freeing up resources to invest in other opportunities. This strategy has driven the plan for execution we've laid out on
the 2016 to-do list.
From objectives to strategy all the way through execution, we've made great progress. We have a clear vision for what
we still must do. We have the tools in place to do it. We will talk more about this journey at our Analyst Day on June 9.
Please mark your calendars now and we'll have more details as the day gets closer.
With that I'll turn the call over to Drew.
Andrew S. Marsh
Thank you, Leo, and good morning, everyone. Today I'll discuss fourth quarter and full year 2015 results followed by
our guidance for 2016 and our outlook to 2018. But before we get into details, the punch line is that our results and
expectations remain in line with all that we have discussed with you.
Now let's jump into 2015. Results for the quarter are summarized on slide four of our presentation. Operational
earnings, excluding special items, were $1.58 per share, up from $0.75 a year ago, and in line with the expectations we
shared last November. Most significant special items include EWC's noncash impairment of our Palisades unit and the
sale of the Rhode Island State Energy Center. Operational earnings for the business increased due to tax items partially
offset by utility charges, warm weather, and low wholesale power prices.
Looking at Utility, Parent & Other results on slide five, operational earnings per share increased quarter-over-quarter,
the main driver was income tax as a result of the business combination for the two Louisiana operating companies,
which was completed in October. This item contributed $1.50 to fourth quarter earnings, after reserves, to share $107
million with customers. The customer sharing is reflected as a reduction in net revenue. Unfavorable weather partially
offset the tax items.
Slide six shows our adjusted view of Utility, Parent & Other earnings, which excludes weather, and normalizes for
income tax items. The adjusted view was lower than the same period a year ago. However, as Leo mentioned, this
quarter's result included two charges totaling $0.35 per share. Considering those charges, the underlying business was
in line with our November expectations.
Volume increased for both residential weather-adjusted sales and industrial sales. The residential growth was 1.6% and
sales to industrial customers increased 0.6% as shown on slide seven. We continue to see gains for new and expansion
projects, adding approximately 300 gigawatt hours, or 2.7% to our industrial sales this quarter. However, volume from
existing industrial customers declined due primarily to weakness in the chlor-alkali sector, and an extended outage for a
key customer, which we mentioned last quarter.

Recently, we have also seen weakness in the metals and wood product sectors. On the positive side, sales to existing
petroleum refining customers increased on higher production due to continued favorable market conditions.
EWC fourth quarter results are summarized on slide eight. Operational earnings were $0.16 in the current quarter,
$0.23 lower than the fourth quarter in 2014. The most significant factor was lower wholesale prices. The nuclear fleet
revenue was $44.00 per megawatt hour this quarter, down from $54.00 in 2014, excluding Vermont Yankee.
Closure of VY contributed $0.05 to the decline. Conversely, the effects of last quarter's impairments reduced fuel,
non-fuel O&M and depreciation expenses, which helped earnings $0.14. Income tax variance of $0.13 also contributed
to the offset. Slide nine shows operating cash flow this quarter about $50 million lower than the same quarter in 2014,
biggest driver was reduced net revenue at EWC.
Now I'll quickly go through full year results summarized on slide 10. Operational earnings for 2015 were $6.00 per
share, up from $5.83 in 2014, once again in line with the expectations we shared last November. Higher earnings at
Utility, Parent & Other drove the increase.
As shown on slide 11, Utility, Parent & Other operational earnings per share results were $4.97 in 2015 compared to
$3.64 in the prior year led primarily by the aforementioned income tax items.
One slide 12, adjusted Utility, Parent & Other results came in at $3.08 excluding weather and normalizing for taxes
lower than in 2014. As with the charges the fourth quarter adjusted EPS would have been $3.43, which was also in line
with our previous expectations.
Slide 13 summarizes EWC operational earnings, which declined year-over-year to $1.03 per share in 2015 from $2.19.
Lower prices were the largest driver accounting for $1.06 of the decline. Another $0.20 was due to Vermont Yankee
and the effects of the impairment provided a $0.14 offset.
Full year operating cash flow shown on slide 14 was just under $3.3 billion in 2015, around $600 million lower than
the prior year. The most significant factors were about $300 million of Hurricane Isaac-related securitization funds
received in 2014 as well as revenue from our EWC business.
Now that we've wrapped up 2015 results, we are initiating 2016 operational earnings guidance. Details on our 2016
assumptions as well as sensitivities are provided in the appendix of our presentation. Consolidated operational earnings
per share guidance is $4.95 to $5.75 per share with a midpoint of $5.35 on slide 15. We're also issuing an adjusted
Utility, Parent & Other guidance range of $4.20 to $4.50 per share with a $4.35 midpoint, consistent with our
communication since last summer.
Recall that our adjusted measure reflects normal weather and statutory taxes. The possibility exists for significant tax
items this year as early as the second quarter, but there is too much uncertainty to put those possibilities into the
guidance at this time. Starting with the Utility, Parent & Other adjusted view, we expect $1.27 per share of growth.
Rate actions and sales growth are the largest drivers as well as lower non-fuel O&M and the effect of the 2015 utility
charges.
Depreciation expenses also expected to increase by about $0.30, including Union. The Union acquisition is expected to
contribute a little more than $0.20 to the bottom line in 2016. As you know, we have not closed that transaction yet and
2016 earnings would be reduced about $0.02 for every month of the way. The Arkansas settlement agreement, as filed,
would help Entergy Arkansas move much closer to its allowed return levels. We expect the Arkansas Public Service
Commission to issue a decision soon.
Our industrial sales growth in 2016 continues to be driven by identifying new and expansion projects in our service
territory rather than our existing customer base. Approximately two thirds of our new and expansion projects are
already in service and continue to reach steady load levels in 2016, and the remaining third comes from projects that
are scheduled to come into service this year, most of which are in the final stages of construction or early stages of
testing. Nevertheless, these new projects continue to have timing and ramp rate risks which could impact results.

Our industrial sales are also exposed to market and commodity risks associated with the broader economy. As a result
of these risks, our overall industrial growth expectation for 2016 is now at 2.9% and overall retail sales growth is at
1.9%. We see Utility non-fuel O&M at about $2.5 billion or about $0.20 lower than 2015 due primarily to pension and
OPEB costs, which are expected to decline about $0.29. This includes a slightly higher pension discount rate than we
expected at EEI. A change in the discount rate offsets higher ANO column 4 expenses now projected to be $50 million
in 2016, about flat year-over-year. We also anticipate lower expenses for fossil and nuclear in 2016 as well as higher
expenses for the Union plant operations.
Turning to EWC, its guidance midpoint is $1 per share, about the same as 2015 results. Lower energy and capacity
prices are expected to largely offset the effects of impairments recorded in 2015. Effects from the 2015 impairments
which affect multiple line items are $0.49 per share year-over-year. Our guidance based on year-end prices assumes
average energy and capacity revenue of $48 per megawatt hour. Despite our 86% hedge position, there is $0.25 per
share downside sensitivity to a $10 per megawatt hour drop in prices, and prices have been lower by about $4 since the
beginning of the year with the warm winter weather.
EWC's pension and OPEB expense will also decline about $0.10 year-over-year, offsetting higher Pilgrim column 4
costs and inflation effects bring net non-fuel O&M to a little less than $0.10 lower along with decommissioning trust
earnings, about $0.10 lower in 2016.
Looking ahead to first quarter results and based on what we know today, we're expecting operational earnings generally
in line with first quarter consensus of around $1.10 per share. This considers milder weather experienced so far this
year including $0.07 of negative effect already in January and we don't currently anticipate any significant tax items in
the first quarter.
Moving to our longer term views, slide 16 shows our Utility, Parent & Other adjusted earnings per share outlook which
is unchanged since EEI. The foundation for our objective to achieve steady and predictable Utility, Parent & Other
growth is rate-based growth from the Utility investment plan. The 2016 through 2018 capital plan is about $1.1 billion
higher than the preliminary estimates provided at EEI but primarily because the Union acquisition was delayed into
2016. As we have discussed, our capital outlook is also supported by regulatory mechanisms which provide increased
financial flexibility to execute on capital plans and by longer term retail sales growth which can help mitigate rate
effects for our customers.
We also see continued O&M improvement as the assumed pension discount rate increases slowly over time and ANO
column 4 spending rolls off. There could be some level of continued spending to maintain ANO performance
improvement upon column 4 exit or additional cost as a result of the NRC's inspection. We expect any prudently
incurred incremental costs to be recoverable.
The nearer-term changes to our sales growth for 2016 do not have an impact on our long-term 4% to 5% annual
industrial growth expectations through 2018. We continue to see large industrial projects coming online to drive the
growth. Overall, our annual retail sales growth is still expected to be in the range of 2% to 2.5% which implies
residential and commercial as slightly less than 1%. Finally, it is important to remember that our capital plan is driven
more by our need to modernize our aging infrastructure and maintain reliability and less by our need to support load
growth. As a result, our strategic objectives, investment thesis, dividend growth and resulting earnings outlook remain
on track.
Slide 17 provides our EWC outlook for EBITDA with separate estimates for the nuclear plants that are closed or
planned to be closed. The current forecast is based on market prices as of year-end. As I mentioned, market prices have
declined since that time.
One other thing that we closely monitor is our cash and credit position. Slide 18 summarizes our cash flow and credit
metrics. Efforts focused on improving cash flow and de-risking the business create both value and stability. Our goal is
to remain solidly in the investment grade credit rating range for all our rated entities while we support the growth of the
rest of the business.

Not on the slide, but certainly germane to the credit position, is our pension liability. Despite a slight negative return on
our pension assets in 2015, we were able to improve our funded status by about $250 million. Although many factors
impact that number, the reality is that we continue to take sustainable steps to manage our pension obligation in a
methodical way. This includes program changes, liability management efforts, and investment of nearly $800 million
over the past two years. Over the next three years, we expect to contribute over $1.1 billion to our pension trusts,
including almost $400 million in 2016.
Before closing, I'd like to acknowledge that David Borde is with us today on the earnings call. We recently announced
that David will assume Paula Waters' role as Vice President of Investor Relations in mid-March. You'll have the
opportunity to meet David on the road in the coming weeks. David's background on Wall Street, both as a lawyer and
an investment banker makes him a strong fit for the investor relations role. He also worked as part of Entergy's
corporate development group before becoming a key team member supporting Theo and the Utility strategy through his
role as director in the utilities finance business partners group.
David will continue to pursue the standard of excellence we have strived to achieve in our disclosure and our relations
with all of you. At the same time, Paula is not going far. She has been given new responsibilities within Utility where
she will oversee top line growth strategies including economic development and revenue forecasting in support of the
five utility operating companies. We appreciate Paula's remarkable tenure in investor relations as she has been
instrumental in helping us clarify our discussions and strengthening our relationships with you, the analyst community.
Thank you, Paula.
And now the Entergy team is available to answer questions.
Q&A

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Dan Eggers of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
<Q - Daniel L. Eggers>: Hey. Good morning, guys.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Good morning.
<Q - Daniel L. Eggers>: If I jump to the back of the slides, you have updated CapEx numbers and the CapEx
increased quite a bit from what you had at EEI. I know part of that's probably Union slippage. But can you just help us
think about the rate base growth and the effect of bonus depreciation on the rate base growth net of the increase in
CapEx?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Yeah, Dan. This is Drew. And so we previously discussed that for the first couple years we
already had an expectation for bonus deprecation baked into our financials. And so getting out to 2018 there's really not
much impact on our overall rate base expectation. In fact, it still remains right in the middle of our previous ranges that
we provided. So really quite minimal impact on us overall through the guidance range – or through the outlook range.
<Q - Daniel L. Eggers>: And then what was the rest of the increase beyond Union to fill in the 2016 to 2018 CapEx?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: I think it was mostly just minor project adjustments. I don't think that there's any major
elements in there that would be worth calling out at this point I don't think.
<Q - Daniel L. Eggers>: And I guess on load growth and kind of the expectations for that number to bounce back after
– maybe a little slower for 2016 than expected. Where do you rank your confidence in that reset in growth today versus
say six months ago or at the last Analyst Day? And what is the visibility to that underlying industrial gain?
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: Hey, Dan. This is Theo. I think from our perspective we'd rank that confidence higher, a
little higher than we had say a few years ago at the Analyst Meeting because primarily a lot of the projects have
advanced relative to that point in time. And also we've gotten a better line of sight on what's really happening from an

economic perspective as relates to what you're seeing with commodity markets.
As we talked about at EEI, as you look 2015 through 2018, basically 95% of that growth of what we call new and
expansion projects were related to projects that were in advanced stages, and we continue to see that to be the case.
That's not to say that we see some projects, smaller projects maybe fall off as we've gone forward. And if you also
recall at EEI that 95%, about 70% was made up of basically a handful of large projects that were in advanced stages.
And those projects were primarily in the steel kind of thing, cracker. We did have an LNG project. We also have
projects in the ammonia area as well as methanol. So they were spread across a lot of your various segments.
As we continue to get closer, and as we move closer in time to the expected construction, date-of-completion dates of
these projects, clearly we get more visibility around where those projects are just by the sheer passage of time. I think
the other thing that we have gotten more visibility around is what's going on with our existing customers, and gotten
more granularity as to what's happening in that particular area. We don't really see much growth when we talk about the
4% to 5% coming from our existing customer base, but as we've talked about in the past, our existing customers, our
large industrial customers are on fixed-demand-charge type contracts. And so we may see volumetric fluctuations, we
really don't see accompanying fluctuations in revenue when you talk about downside situation.
So I think our confidence is higher. I mean, clearly as Drew said in his script, there are still existential factors that can
affect what we're seeing, and we monitor this on a very regular basis. And we try to get as much intelligence around
this as we possibly can, both from a customer perspective as well as a macroeconomic perspective.
<Q - Daniel L. Eggers>: So you're not seeing an erosion in these existing customers because of an economic
slowdown kind of on a global basis? So you're not expecting them to do worse? You'd expect them to stay where they
are? Is that effectively what's embedded in guidance?
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: I mean I would expect that – there's always a risk they could do worse, but we have
adjusted our expectation around that group based on what we see and what we know today. And we did adjust it
downward as compared to where we were a number of months ago.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: And, Dan, this is Drew. And of course you've seen in the last couple of quarters, we've seen
lower growth in the industrial sector. But the new and expanding customers have been growing the industrial space
about 3% and existing customers have been detracting from it about 2.5%. So we are expecting a little bit of that same
thing in 2016.
<Q - Daniel L. Eggers>: Okay. Got it. Thank you, guys.

<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning, Julien.
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: Good morning.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: So just to follow up a little bit on Dan's last question, if you will, can you comment on
sort of the non-industrial trends? I suppose just if you try to look at the mix, 60/40, I suppose it would imply something
shifting there as well, but I'll let you elaborate.
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: Julien, are you relating to just the 2016 period or the same period Dan was referring to?
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Well actually, let's stick with 2016.

<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: Okay. I think when we think about growth in kind of the non-industrial sector for 2016,
first I'd start by saying, if you look at the quarterly GSP across the Gulf South region, we see numbers probably
anywhere from 2.5% to 4% in the 2016, 2017 timeframe. Also I think if you look at what we've experienced even in
2015 for the companies within that region, we have residential sales growth ranging from 1.5% to about 3.5% on a
weather adjusted basis. We had commercial sales growth basically in the 1% to 2% on a weather-adjusted basis in that
area.
And so as we look forward we see, for example on the commercial side, major projects that happened in 2015 that have
a full year effect in 2016 that contribute to what we view as fairly reasonable sales growth expectation on the
commercial side. In the residential area, we do – are seeing pockets of what we call, maybe the multiplier effect related
to the industrial growth that we see again in that Gulf South, that Gulf Coast regional area.
And I'd also say that one thing that we can advantage of in 2016 is another day of kilowatt-hour sales. That has some
small impact on our expectation in 2016 as well. So around 1% which is where we are when you adjust – when you
take out the total growth and impact of industrial. Again, the macroeconomic effects we see or impacts we could see at
the industrial level we could see at the residential and commercial. But we've as I've said in response to Dan's
questions, we've done a lot of work around updating our expectations relative to that and at this point we feel fairly
comfortable with where we are.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Just to be clear then, you're saying not much of a change on the non-industrial?
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: I would say, you mean 2015 over 2016 in terms of not much of a change or where we
were thinking?
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Yeah, on the sales growth. Yeah, exactly.
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: If you look at 2015 weather adjusted I think residential was about 0.6%, commercial was
about 0.4%. I think what we're saying in 2016 in our assumption is something closer to 1%.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: And that's consistent with where we were at sort of the November timeframe. That – the
residential commercial expectations haven't changed much.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Got it. Excellent. And just a quick clarification if you can on the expectations for
FitzPatrick and the retirement timeline. Is there any scenario here that you could be looking at implementing a ZEC or
whatever you want to call it, scheme? Perhaps margin positive, presumably.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Bill, do you want to?
<A - William M. Mohl>: Julien, this is Bill. At this point in time, there is no clarity or certainty around what that
program is and what the actual value associated with it would be. So we have no plans as it relates to changing our
focus on shutting down that plant on January 27. We do support the concept of a clean energy standard and think that
that makes sense, but we really need to understand the details of it and assure that it is actually implemented.

<Q - Paul Patterson>: We're going to miss Paula. But anyway, just want to touch base on the Palisades impairment
and how that impacts 2016 – well the Palisades and I guess the other impairment in the wind and what have you, and
how that impacts 2016 guidance. If I heard you correctly, you said there was a $0.49 impact, and I understand it's sort
of complicated so I don't want you to go through any laborious detail. But just in general, so if you can highlight what
that is? Did I hear that correctly, I guess, I mean?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Yeah. So, Paul, it's Drew. A couple of things there. So I think that it spread across a couple
different categories when you think about these impairments. There's an impairment piece that's in net revenue for fuel.
There's an impairment piece which is in O&M for refueling outage expenses and then there's an impairment piece
which is in depreciation for the asset itself. And so we've actually broken down for you in the back, in the appendix, on
slides 46 and 47. We give a lot of detail about the plants that are still ongoing and the plants that are planned to be
closed or are closed, and talk about where you can see those impairment effects for those three buckets.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Do those impacts – I mean the impairment was done in the fourth quarter. Do those impacts,
how do they go into 2017, I guess?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: In to 2017?
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Yeah, I mean are they continuing or how – do you follow what I'm saying? It just seems like a
large number.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Yeah. Well, I mean it is. I mean if you think about all those plants that were impaired are
still going to be operating in 2016. So you're still going to see the effects of that stuff. Once you get into 2017, as Bill
said and we announced on January 27, we'll be shutting down FitzPatrick. So you won't see those same kinds of effects
as that starts to fall away. But Pilgrim and Palisades will still be there. So you'll still see those effects for those plants
continue to go on.
Now, once we refuel Pilgrim I guess it'll be a little bit different if we make that decision. And that would be – I think
those costs would be expensed if we go down that path. And so it'll change things a little bit at that point. But you'll still
continue to see those impairment effects for those two assets because they're still operating in...
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Right.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Potentially beyond 2017.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: I guess what I'm wondering is with respect to Palisades, I mean what caused this big write off
in a contracted plant? It wasn't completely clear to me. Is it just the lifespan has been changed? Or your market
expectations after the contract has expired?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Yeah. So I think what changed there is the fact that we made decisions around the other
single-unit assets. So Pilgrim, FitzPatrick and Vermont Yankee were all single-unit assets. Palisades was the only
remaining one out there, although it did have the contract. Because of our decisions for the other three we had to, again,
more closely assess the probabilities associated with the life expectancy of the Palisades unit. And when we did that, it
failed the accounting test for any impairment. And we're continuing to operate the plant till 2022.
The operational decision is different than the accounting decision. We'll make a decision around Palisades when it's
appropriate to do that out in the future. And that'll depend on the circumstances that exist at that time, the market
conditions at that time, et cetera. But from accounting perspective we were forced by our other actions to take a close
look at the Palisades unit.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. And then just finally on the midpoint outlook, it's a $0.40 range. And just in terms of the
term midpoint, how should we think about that? Is there some range outside of that that we should be thinking about?
Or just elaborate a little bit on that terminology.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Well, this idea was something that we originated, that idea of a midpoint outlook back at
Analyst Day in 2014. And our expectation at that point in time was that by the time we got out to that date because it

was pretty far out there that our midpoint expectation might shift around a little bit. And so what we tried to do is signal
to everybody about where it would land. But when we get out to that point, we would give you the actual guidance and
give you a midpoint for where that would be.
So I guess similar to 2016 where we landed at $4.35 which was at the bottom of our range of potential midpoints, I
guess there could be a little bit above or below the ranges that we're talking about. But so I guess to answer your
question directly, yeah there could be a little bit above or below in those out years but we're not at this point
communicating anything differently than just the range that we have.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Paul, this is Leo. This may or may not be helpful, but what we expect is the midpoint of
guidance to fall within that range.

And the next question is from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning, Stephen.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Good morning.
<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: I wanted to just add on to Paul's question on thinking about slide 47 and also slide 40.
There are a number of line items, but I guess in total when we look at some of these nuclear plants that may be shutting
down at some point in the future, as I understand it, I guess you're including the revenues from power generated but
some of the expenses are not included in sort of adjusted earnings. On a total basis from these nuclear units, what's the
amount of expense that is effectively going to be excluded from adjusted earnings for these plants in say 2016 or
beyond?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Well, in 2016 I think it's about $50 million of capital that would fall into that category and I
think that's on slide 40. And then I think if there are any fuel expenses if we'd make that again that decision to shut
down Pilgrim, there could be some additional expenses that end up in that same category. But I think that's what we
would be talking about, Stephen, mainly.
<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: Oh, okay. So $50 million you said capital. Would that be something that would be an
expense but will be excluded from adjusted earnings? Or is that CapEx? I wasn't clear on that.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Well, it would otherwise be considered capital, but because of the situation where those
plants are expected to shut down, the accounting will force us to put that as an expense. So you'll see it in the
as-reported as an expense, that $50 million in capital. We'll break it out for you as a special item so you can understand
what that is, but that's the way it would be portrayed I believe in the financial statement.
<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: Okay. And what amount of fuel expense is being excluded from adjusted earnings?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: I don't know that I have that number in front of me right now. So we'll have to give that to
you later, Stephen.

<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: Okay. Understood. And then on ANO and column 4, I think you laid out pretty clearly
the cost of I believe $50 million in 2016. Could you give a little color in terms of your assumption in the plan in terms
of when you are able to move that out of column 4? And sort of what are the key challenges or steps that need to be
taken to make that happen?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: I'll answer that. So, just from a financial perspective, we don't have any cost beyond 2016.
From a operational perspective and the NRC, I think there's a longer process there that goes on. And so while we may
stop incurring costs, it may be a little bit longer into 2017. I think there's a possibility it could go even longer than that.
But I don't believe that would necessarily be our expectation that the NRC would make a rating change there.
<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: Okay. Understood. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Praful Mehta of Citigroup. Your line is open.
<Q - Praful Mehta>: Hi, guys. And, Paula, you will be missed and welcome, David. So quick question on the capital
plan and your point that it's the aging infrastructure that drives the growth in the CapEx not as much the load growth.
But I'm assuming at some point you do need load growth to kind of maintain your competitive rates and keep that rate
and attract more I guess CapEx and more load into the region.
So what is the minimum load growth that you look at from an industrial perspective, given the decline in load growth at
least for 2016, how would you see the load growth out in the future? And is there a minimum level that you would
track to say you need that kind of load at least in terms of load growth to support the CapEx plan while keeping the
rates in check?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: So, Praful, that's a good question. One thing to keep in mind is as you look at that capital plan,
as you said, the generation piece of this is driven primarily by every year that goes by, new technologies improve the
heat rate, the cost efficiency, the environmental output of the new plants, plus the old plants get older and more costly.
So as time progresses, certainly we have the ability to benefit our customers with a more reliable, more
environmentally friendly and lower production cost unit. And so we're doing that over time just like anyone would. It
just so happens that this kind of seems to happen in big chunks in terms of when the facilities are required. So we're in
the process of doing that.
Recall that we've never been long generation also. So we're short generation. We anticipate being short generation out
into the middle of the next decade even with if we were to have significantly lower growth. So the need for the
generation will continue to exist and what we've mentioned before is we have some flexibility around the timing as it
relates to the CTs. We have the deactivations of the units and certainly PPAs that roll off that are all part of the mix. So
it's a combination of a need but it's also us making sure we have a risk mitigation strategy for the company and for its
customers associated with how we put that in place.
So I know there is no at this industrial load growth number that we would give you that we say we no longer need this
investment. But the fact of the matter is we would continue to be short with the ability to be in MISO and utilize the
market over time as we go out there. And we really don't see that changing under too many scenarios. The transmission
investment is driven in large part by changing reliability requirements, the similar type of activity as it relates to new
technologies and the ability to improve the operations of the system as we go forward. Plus again the age of the
infrastructure requires some upgrading as well as does our entry in the MISO provide us with the opportunity to make
deliverability of assets that before we couldn't into the market going forward as well.
So in the transmission that we're doing from a reliability standpoint, a lot of that like the Lake Charles project, a lot of
the load that we are going to serve there is already there so it's a beefing up of the reliability, improving the
infrastructure plus load growth that we already see under construction. So that's pretty solid as well under a variety of
load growth scenarios. And then as we talked about before, we're also embarking on the AMI side of things and as we

go forward there could be other things that would certainly show up that could either replace things that may or may
not fall out or up or extend that capital growth going forward on the distribution side, which is going to become more
and more important, again in the benefit, to benefit our customers.
So I guess the bottom line here is there's an opportunity for us to continue to invest this capital because of where the
structure is and where the state of the technology is, and we're also managing it in a real risk, a risk mitigation kind of
strategy. Again, not getting long on the generation side, not getting out over our skis on the transmission side and the
like to make sure that we are well within the bounds of anything that might happen on a load growth point of view. But
you are right, the main benefits that we have from load growth are that it continues to provide us with that competitive
advantage whereas I mentioned in my script we're today, over 25% below the national average in our rates. That
contributes to our ability to attract new business into the region so that we have the capability to do that more. And so
things like the Continental Tire example that I mentioned, all the stuff that's under construction that Theo mentioned.
All of those in addition to us managing our cost levels with decline in natural gas prices, all of that go to contribute to
that late advantage continuing and hopefully growing over time, and so you can't really say at what load growth you do
not do capital. It's very robust over a variety of load growth scenarios but we have to be mindful of the risk mitigation
strategies that we put in place so that when we build those new plants or those CTs, but also the other cost bending that
we can do as it relates to our normal O&M fuel costs and production costs as we put these new plants in place for
example that help us maintain that advantage. It's more complicated than just one number I guess is the answer. But it's
pretty robust across a variety of load growth scenarios.
<Q - Praful Mehta>: Gotcha. Thank you, Leo. That was extremely helpful color. And finally, just a quick question on
taxes. I know you reduced your NOL balance, I think in the last call. Now with bonus helping you as well, do you see
yourselves being cash tax payers through the 2018, 2019 timeframe? Or is there a minimal cash tax during that period?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Praful, I think what we said is we expect our cash tax rate to be around 10% through that
period that you're talking about. And as I mentioned earlier, bonus depreciation was baked in for a good bit of that. So
we would expect it to be about the same over that timeframe.

Thank you. And the last question will come from Charles Fishman of Morningstar. Your line is open.
<Q - Charles Fishman>: Thank you, and good morning.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning.
<Q - Charles Fishman>: On Arkansas, Leo, I recall that when you took your current position this was one of your top
three goals was to get an improved regulatory framework in Arkansas. And now that you have it, I guess looking back
– and again, I thought you said that your strategy was to tell Mississippi – or excuse me, to tell Arkansas that look at
the industrial development in Mississippi. If you have a favorable regulatory framework, that can certainly support that
development. I guess my question is, was that the argument that helped win the day, number one? And I guess a related
question would be, is there any more tweaking you'd like to see in Arkansas maybe besides a little higher allowed
ROE?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Well, I'd say first of all there's no argument that was had with anybody on anything. And I
know you just used that term, but I don't want that to be a term that's out there. The fact of the matter is that all of our
jurisdictions, Arkansas, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, all of them, we're all interested in the exact same thing. We're all
interested in growing the economies of the jurisdictions and the states in which we operate, and the same with the city

of New Orleans. We've spent a lot of time with all those jurisdictions, including Arkansas, sitting down with them. Our
jurisdictional CEOs have done a wonderful job, their regulatory folks have done a wonderful job, Theo's done a
wonderful job of making sure that we sit down and find common ground with all of them around bettering the economy
of the state.
And you know, Charles, I started out with the four stakeholders and our objectives for them around first quartile TSR,
first quartile customer satisfaction, et cetera. When we bring jobs to the state, we do good for the company. We could
do good for the community. We could do good for our employees. It's great for the political environment as well. So all
we've done is we've sat down and discussed that with our regulators, as well as the politicians in our regions, to
describe to them our desire to participate in that with them and help them achieve their objectives.
And so what we've crafted in Texas with riders, in Arkansas with the forward-looking FRP, with Mississippi with the
forward features FRP, the way assets are recovered in Louisiana, New Orleans, et cetera. What we've accomplished
with them is that common ground about how giving us the financial flexibility to make you all comfortable with the
investments that we have through the regulatory process helps us attract the Big River Steels, the Sasols of the world,
the Continental Tires of the world to come to our region, to buy power from us, to help us invest in the infrastructure
and then create tens of thousands of jobs. We're working on this together to be able to do that.
So I wouldn't say that anybody won the day in Arkansas other than the state of Arkansas, and we participated in that in
a small way. And they worked together with us to create something that allowed us to do that, and I would say that it's
no different than the workforce development program that I mentioned in my script where we're spending $5 million
over the next five years to help train people to work at those plants that we've helped attract. And that's good for all
four of our stakeholders as well as we do that. So it really has been the last few years of extraordinary collaboration,
foresight by our regulators and us listening to them as much as them listening to us.
<Q - Charles Fishman>: Is there anything in Arkansas with respect to regulatory framework that you'd like to tweak,
let's say?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Well, I'm not sure that, that's something that we would need to do a lot of at the moment.
Certainly there's always things that we want to accomplish, but really that's going to depend on the environment. As we
go forward, we go forward with the great modernization, we go forward with AMI, we go forward with different things
than what we have today that might require some further collaboration with those folks. But right now we've got to
make filing under the first forward-looking FRP and get that underway before we start worrying about changing things.
<Q - Charles Fishman>: Okay. Well, I think you're being a little modest because I know this was one of your goals in
Arkansas and I think you did accomplish it. So congratulations, and that was my only question.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: All right. Thank you.
