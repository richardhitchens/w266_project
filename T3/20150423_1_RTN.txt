With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. Tom?
Thomas A. Kennedy
Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone. Before we get started, I'd like to welcome Toby O'Brien to his first
earnings conference call as CFO, a role which he officially assumed on March 2. Toby will walk you through
additional details regarding our first quarter financial results in just a moment.
I'm pleased to report that the company delivered solid operating results in the quarter, with sales, EPS and cash flow
that were all either in line or ahead of our expectations. Our International business continued to grow in the quarter and
represented 28% of total revenue. International also represented 34% of our total bookings in the quarter and our
International backlog was 41% of total backlog at quarter's end. This backlog percentage will go higher with the $2
billion International Patriot Award we announced last week, which was from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
I would note that we continue to see strong demand signals beyond our recent bookings activity for our solutions from
our global customers. In the quarter and the weeks immediately following, you have seen important parts of our global
growth strategy play out. We've announced significant recent bookings across our portfolio, particularly in the
International Patriot, that position the company for future growth. And we announced a strategic investment and
partnership to harness rapid growth in the global cybersecurity market. Overall, we've made a considerable progress on
these three fronts and continued to move forward with our growth strategy.
During the quarter, we also raised our dividend by 10.7%, the 11th consecutive annual increase, and we remain on
track to reduce our shares outstanding for the year. This reflects our long-term trend of returning cash to shareholders,
something we will continue to do in line with our balanced capital deployment strategy.
We've come out of the gate strong after the close of the first quarter with approximately $3 billion in bookings within
the initial weeks of the second quarter, including the $2 billion Patriot booking from Saudi Arabia and a $507 million
booking to upgrade the Evolved Seasparrow Missile, a premier ship defense missile for the U.S. Navy and international
customers.
I'd like to take a moment to talk about our Patriot Integrated Air and Missile Defense franchise. Over the past 15
months, we have received nearly $7 billion in bookings for Patriot production and support services from a range of
customers. This includes the recent Saudi $2 billion award, as well as the Kuwait, Qatar, South Korea and the U.S.
Army. This provides the company with years of production work in backlog and predictability to the manufacturing
outlook and the opportunity to achieve higher production efficiencies.
Looking forward, we continue to see significant opportunities for Patriot. Earlier this week, we were notified that the
Patriot was selected by Poland for their medium-range Integrated Air and Missile Defense System. We'll be working
with our Polish customer on the final offering and anticipate receiving a booking in 2016. Additionally, we're in the
final down select process in Germany. If selected, we anticipate that this will also translate into a booking opportunity
in 2016.
Patriot continues to evolve, ensuring that it will be capable of meeting next-generation threats. Over the next few years,
you'll see us. in collaboration with our current and future customers. add new capabilities, including a 360-degree
AESA radar capability and other enhancements. These capabilities will position Patriot to be the leading integrated air
and missile defense solution for the next several decades.
But as you know, Raytheon is much more than just Patriot, and to that point we've seen considerable recent order
activity domestically and internationally across a wide range of our systems and products, particularly in our missiles
business. Demand for missiles is being driven by the evolving threats, as well as our incorporation of technological
advances into our products. One example of this is AMRAAM, where we received a $539 million award in the first
quarter for the latest version of the missile. We received a similar size award in December of last year, so within the
past six months alone, we have received more than $1 billion in orders for AMRAAM.

We continue to make important progress on many other key programs that will drive future growth. For example, on
Small Diameter Bomb II, the premiere precision weapon for both current and next-generation platforms, we completed
systems verification review in early April. This sets the stage for milestone C, which will be completed the
development phase allowing the program to move into low rate initial production.
Our Next Generation Jammer program remains a significant part of our electronic warfare initiative. The program
continues to execute on or ahead of schedule and cost and also completed key testing milestones in the quarter.
Turning to a broader market perspective. domestically, I'm encouraged by recent developments on the fiscal year 2016
defense budget process where both the Administration and Congress have presented an initial budget proposals that
could exceed previously established budget caps. Many of our leaders agree that the cap levels are not sufficient to
contend with today's dynamic threat environment, and are therefore seeking ways to add more resources. While we
won't speculate on what the final funding level for DoD will be in 2016, even if the Budget Control Act caps are not
raised at all, the DoD base budget funding will be several billion dollars higher in 2016 than 2015. Bottom line is the
trajectory of the DoD base budget is finally starting to trend upwards.
Late in the first quarter, we announced a settlement with the U.K. Home Office relating to Raytheon Systems Limited
eBorders contract. Under the settlement, we received a cash payment equal to approximately $226 million in exchange
for the resolution of all claims and counterclaims of both parties. Toby will walk you through the details in his remarks.
As we announced earlier this week, consistent with our strategy to position Raytheon for global growth. We are now
entering into a partnership with Vista Equity Partners combining their premier commercial cybersecurity business,
Websense with Raytheon Cyber Products to form a new company. This new company will provide a broad set of
integrated defense-grade cybersecurity products and services to the global marketplace. We are very excited about this
opportunity. We see significant revenue synergies, and look forward to closing sometime late in the second quarter.
In conclusion, I'm pleased with our performance in the first quarter and progress in setting the foundation for future
global growth. And I'd like to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication for this great start to the year.
With that, let me turn it over to Toby.
Anthony F. O'Brien
Okay. Thanks, Tom. I have a few opening remarks, starting with the first quarter highlights, and then we'll move on to
questions. During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning.
If everyone would turn to page three. We are pleased with the solid performance the team delivered in the first quarter,
with sales, EPS and operating cash flow, all at or better than our expectations. It's a good start to the year, and we're
positioned well for achieving our full year outlook.
Our EPS from continuing operations was a $1.78, and on an adjusted basis, EPS was a $1.26. I'll discuss this in more
detail in just a moment.
Operating margin was solid at 15.9%, and included the previously announced eBorders settlement with the U.K. Home
Office. And on an adjusted basis, our operating margin was 11.5%. Sales of $5.3 billion, were slightly higher than our
guidance.
During the quarter, the company bought back 2.8 million shares of common stock, under the share repurchase program
for $300 million. And we announced last month that we increased our dividend by 10.7%. We have now raised our
annual dividend every year for the past 11 years.
I also want to point out that we're raising the guidance that we provided in January to include the eBorder's settlement.
I'll discuss guidance further in just a few minutes.

Turning now to page four. Let me start by providing some detail on our first quarter results. Company bookings for the
first quarter were $4.5 billion. International awards represented 34% of the total, and on a trailing fourth quarter basis,
the book-to-bill ratio is 1.07. A couple of key bookings in the first quarter included a $769 million award for Patriot
from the Republic of Korea and a $539 million award for AMRAAM for the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy and
International customers.
And as Tom mentioned a few minutes ago, just after the end of the first quarter, we received significant orders from
both domestic and international customers. We're off to a strong start in the second quarter, and the year-to-date
bookings will help drive our second-half performance.
Backlog at the end of the first quarter was $32.5 billion, and on a funded basis was $23.7 billion, an increase of almost
$1 billion compared to the first quarter 2014. It's worth noting that we ended the first quarter of 2015 with
approximately 41% of our backlog now comprised of International programs.
If you'd now move to page five. As I just mentioned, for the first quarter 2015, sales were slightly higher than the
guidance we set in January. As a reminder, the first quarter of 2015 had one less work day than the first quarter of
2014, and this equates to about $100 million in sales overall. As we said in January, we expected the first quarter to be
the most challenging. We still expect sales to ramp-up throughout the year.
Looking now at sales by business. IDS had first quarter of 2015 net sales of $1.4 billion. The change from Q1 2014 was
primarily due to the planned completion of certain production phases on International Patriot programs. We expect IDS
sales to increase as we move through the year, as the recently awarded Patriot International programs begin to ramp-up.
In the first quarter of 2015, IIS had net sales of $1.4 billion, compared with the same quarter of last year, the change is
primarily due to our training programs. Missile Systems had first quarter 2015 net sales of $1.5 billion, the change from
the first quarter 2014 was primarily due to both the Tomahawk and SM-3 programs. And SAS had net sales of $1.4
billion. Secure communication systems programs contributed to the change versus last year.
Moving ahead to page 6. We were pleased by our overall company margins. Our operating margin was 15.9%, and on
an adjusted basis was 11.5%. As a reminder, our first quarter 2015 adjusted margin excludes both the favorable
FAS/CAS adjustment which was worth 90 basis points or $0.10 per share, and 340 basis points or $0.42 per share for
the eBorders settlement. And as we discussed on the last earnings call in January, compared to 2014, we expect our
margins for 2015 will be impacted by a change in program mix as well as higher IR&D and program investments. We
continue to invest in ourselves with the objective of positioning the company for future growth.
So, looking at the business margins. The change in margin at IDS was primarily driven by a change in program mix on
International Patriot programs nearing completion. IIS margin in the first quarter of 2015 benefited from the eBorders
settlement that I previously discussed, which contributed $181 million to operating income. Without the settlement, IIS
margins would be 7.5%, or in line with our expectations.
Missile's margin was up in the quarter compared to the same period last year. This year's first quarter benefited from a
$25 million or approximately 170 basis point favorable resolution of a contractual issue, which was previously
expected later in the year. And SAS margin of 12.7% was down compared to the same period last year, primarily
driven by higher net program efficiencies in the first quarter of 2014. Overall, the company continues to perform well.
Turning now to page seven. First quarter 2015 EPS was $1.78, and on an adjusted basis was a $1.26. EPS for the first
quarter 2015 was better than expected, primarily due to the eBorders settlement and from timing at Missiles.
On page eight, we are updating the company's financial outlook for 2015, which now includes the impact of the
eBorder settlement.
As Tom mentioned, earlier in the week we announced the Websense transaction. We expect this transaction to close
late in the second quarter and we will update our financial guidance, subsequent to the closing. We still expect our full
year 2015 net sales to be in the range of between $22.3 billion and $22.8 billion.

We have raised our full year 2015 EPS, which is now expected to be in a range of between $6.67 and $6.82. We expect
adjusted EPS to be within a range of between $5.49 and $5.64, which is unchanged from our prior guidance.
As a reminder, we have not included the possible extension of the R&D tax credit in our 2015 guidance. If the
legislation passes, it would favorably impact the effective tax rate by about 110 basis points, and our EPS by about
$0.10.
As I mentioned earlier, we repurchased 2.8 million shares of common stock for $300 million in the quarter and
continue to see our diluted share count in the range of between 305 million shares and 307 million shares for 2015, a
2% reduction at the midpoint of the range.
Operating cash flow in the quarter was in line with our prior guidance. As a result of the eBorder's settlement, we now
see our 2015 guidance for operating cash flow to be between $2.4 billion and $2.7 billion. We received the settlement
payment in the second quarter. And as you can see on page nine, we've included guidance by business, which is
unchanged from our prior outlook except for IIS and total company margin, which now include the eBorder settlement.
On page 10, we provided some directional guidance on how we currently see the quarterly cadence for sales, EPS and
operating cash flow for the balance of 2015.
As we discussed on the call in January, sales are expected to ramp up throughout the year. In the first half of 2015, we
still expect sales to be down on a percentage basis. Sales in the back half of the year are expected to be in line to
slightly up versus 2014. And if you compare second half sales to first half sales, we expect to see mid-single-digit
growth.
As you may recall, our 2014 bookings finished strong, particularly with respect to International. This, taken together
with the combined first quarter and early second quarter 2015 bookings, are all key drivers of our second half sales
expectations. And, as we discussed on the January call, our effective tax rate in the second quarter is expected to be
impacted by a favorable non-cash tax settlement of $88 million, or $0.29 per diluted share.
Before concluding, I'd like to spend a minute to talk about our capital deployment strategy. We expect to continue to
generate strong free cash flow and maintain a strong balance sheet going forward. We will remain focused on
deploying capital to create value for our shareholders, including internal investments to support our growth plans, as
well as share buybacks and dividend increases that are subject to board approval. And as we sit here today, possibly
smaller targeted acquisitions that are – that fit our technology and global growth needs.
In summary, we saw good performance in the first quarter. We continue to execute well. Our bookings were ahead of
last year's first quarter, and sales, EPS and operating cash flow from operations were all in line or higher than the
guidance we set in January. We remain well-positioned with our domestic customers' priority areas and continue to be
aligned with the evolving priorities of our international customers. Our objective is to drive the business to maximize
value for our customers and shareholders.
With that, Tom and I will now open up the call for questions.

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Howard Rubel of Jefferies. Please proceed.
<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you.
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Good morning, Howard.
<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: Toby, just as an observation first, I was thinking with this 20% margin, now that Dave is
not here to respond to it – aren't you thinking about maybe – you know where I'm going, setting that as his incentive

<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: That's good input, Howard. We'll definitely take that into consideration.
<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: But in all seriousness, IIS sort of is a collection of businesses that have some interesting
opportunities and when we look at the growth profile it seems to be challenged relative to the overall environment. Can
you explain and elaborate a little bit upon not only what Websense is going to do, but where your initiatives are there to
enhance that business?
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Hey Howard, this is Tom. Let me take that. Number one, one of the strategies that IIS is
actually executing very well is to expand its cyber capabilities and core competencies into both the international and
now the commercial market space.
And as we've discussed on prior calls, we have had some significant wins on the international marketplace. And so,
we're showing that we're globally competitive in the cyber arena. And so we're seeing an expansion in that area. We're
also seeing them expand in their training worldwide and some of it's under the Warfighter FOCUS program, but we're
also expanding into other areas of training into international markets with direct with the international governments. So
that's another big area that they're moving out on.
The other play is essentially upgrading a lot of the systems that are out there in terms of adding in information
assurance capability, taking the knowledge that they have gained from the GPS OCX program and leveraging that into
other programs.
And then, the last one is, hopefully you've been watching and noticing that they've been winning quite a few programs
out there, and for example, they won the LISC program, they've also just recently won the NISC program. So they been
winning more than their fair shares of programs and we – we're very, I would say, upbeat relative to IIS in their ability
to continue to grow and exceed the industry in their area, in terms of growth.
<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: And then just as one other follow-up question in a slightly different area. You've also
expanded Missile Systems beyond just Patriot, and for a moment, could you just address how the NASAMS' offerings
are? I think you still have some opportunities there in Poland and elsewhere?
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Yeah. It's a great question, and a lot of people, the NASAM system or sometimes called
SLAMRAAM gets overshadowed by the Patriot, but – our last big win on the NASAMS was in Oman back in 2013.
<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: Yeah.
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: And that was about $1.3 billion for the system itself, and then there was another $300
million worth of AMRAAM activities with [indiscernible] (24:24) FMS contract for a total deal of $1.6 billion.
That system is deployed now or being deployed in six countries, a very – I tell you, it's a very great system, and the
other area that we are pursuing right now, we should learn in 2017 is a pursuit in Poland. This is the – we already got
selected for the Patriot system for their – I would call it their medium integrated air missile defense system, this is the
lower tier missile defense system below Patriot and we're in a competition for that. Again, 2017 they're going to make
their selection.
<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: Thank you very much for your time.
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Yeah.

<Q - Robert Stallard>: Tom, a first one, you mentioned obviously the Poland decision, but also that Germany is
moving towards a down select. Do you think this is a sign that European defense spending might finally be stabilizing?
And do you see other opportunities in the region?
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Well, number one is we do see other opportunities in the region. It is being driven by the
geopolitics that are going on right now, especially in Eastern Europe. Poland is building up their defenses and making a
major play in that area, again under the auspices of a strong defense is a strong deterrence, and we're also seeing that in
other Eastern European countries also. Germany is in need to upgrade their systems. So, I think you're right, there's a
little bit of maybe sense of urgency, but this was in their plan to do this upgrade for several years.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Okay. And just a quick follow-up on Websense. I don't think you mentioned it on the call the
other day, when do you expect it to actually be accretive on a GAAP EPS basis?
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: I'll turn that over to Toby.
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Yeah. So, on a GAAP basis, Rob, we're probably looking about three years to four years
down the road before it would be accretive, and that's due really to the amortization of two non-cash items: one would
be the intangibles associated with the transaction, and then also would be amortizing some deferred revenue. They have
a subscription model where the revenue's recognize ratably over the life of the contract, but the payments are all
upfront and we're going to fair value that. And that amortization tails a lot, a bit shorter that's about a two years to three
years whereas the intangibles will go out over seven years.
That said, we do think the best way to look at this business is more akin to a cash basis and adjusting the results for the
impacts of these two items, the deferred revenue and the amortization of the intangibles, and on that basis, it would be
immediately accretive to earnings.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Okay. Thanks, Toby.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr of Cowen & Company. Please proceed.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Yes. Thank you very much. So the competition claims that Germany wants to have
360-degree capability and open architecture, neither of which Patriot provides, and yet you guys are the incumbent.
Tell us about the factors you think are going to be important to Germany's decision, and when they might reach it?
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: I don't know exactly how they're going to make their decision. I do know that they will be
making a decision in the next year. And what they are looking for is, they need a strong system to provide a deterrence,
and so we believe Patriot provides that number one. And two is, we believe we have the system that we can get in their
hands the soonest, in other words we're in production, we can – we can deliver right out of the factory in I would call it
the quickest time possible.
The other element is the fact that they have – a lot of their folks are already trained on using the Patriot, and so even
though we've upgraded the Patriot, put in modern man stations, there is a lot of the maintenance and training is already
behind them, so they've already have that in place. So we think the Patriot provides the most economical but yet
strongest deterrence capability for them moving forward.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Okay, terrific. And then your R&D was up from 2% of sales to 2.7% of sales. Could you tell
us, where did you spend it? What did you spend it on? And how much of that is covered by IR&D?
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Okay. So that is all IR&D, number one I'll answer that. But we are continuing to invest in
technologies has been crucial to our recent competitive success. I'll give you an example, on the GaN technology we
started investing in 10 years ago, when folks thought GaN – you couldn't make GaN work, and we continued to invest
in it over years and essentially we proved them wrong that it can work and it can provide a great capability, and that put
us in a great position on multiple wins, AMDR, Next Generation Jammers, 3DELRR. And there is actually a few radar

competitions coming up now. So, we do invest to essentially establish discriminators for us to go win in the future. And
that's where we're putting our efforts moving forward.
The areas, and this is actually part of our strategy is to invest into what we call new emerging areas, so we are investing
in next generation radars, high energy lasers, hypersonics, in fact, we just recently won a major hypersonics contract
from DARPA, its call the Tactical Boost Glide program that was for the development and demonstration of
technologies to enable air launched tactical range, hypersonic Boost Glide systems. So we've been investing in that
area, and having – that gave us the technologies to go win this advance DARPA program.
We also are investing in undersea capabilities. We believe the undersea offers a lot of significant opportunities moving
forward based on the whole arena of Anti-Access/Area Denial. EW that's part of our strategy to continue invest in EW
and grow our business in that area. That's kind of a few of the areas that we're investing in. We believe we have already
are establishing discriminators in each of those areas, and based on where our – the roadmap is for our customers we
believe that these are the right places for us to invest in.
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: And Cai, this is Toby. I would just add too the level of spend at the 2.7% that's pretty
much in-line with what we talked about in the January call, of 2.7%, 2.8% of revenue this year for the reasons Tom just
described.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Great. Thank you and congrats on the Patriot wins.

Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland of Barclays. Please proceed.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Yeah. Hi, good morning, guys.
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Good morning.
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Good morning, Carter. How are you doing today?
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Doing great, great. Thanks, Tom. So just a question, I wondered if you might expand a little
bit more specifically on GaN and some of the prior comments about upgrades and really when you look at the approval
of the exportability of that technology, can you talk to specifically what sort of upgrade opportunities that may enable,
and what sort of kind of size we should be thinking about those, or timing? What does that mean for that franchise
longer term?
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: I'll start with the AMDR. We are working with the Navy to ensure that the AMDR will be
exportable to our coalition partners who use those type of radars for their ships. We are also – the 3DELRR program
was a model program for OSD for exportability and so we won that program. It is in protest right now, but that program
uses GaN, so that's number two. We are also and I mentioned in my script that we are working on a 360 AESA radar
for the Patriot, and that is a GaN-based radar and we are working to ensure that that is exportable also.
So in terms of who would buy these systems? With Poland coming onboard, there are now 14 countries that have the
Patriot system, and if you said you had to go off and you wanted to have an opportunity to replace those radars, the
existing radars on those Patriots – this is just one example, it would be 200 plus radars that would be up for grabs to
replace to – or with these 360 AESA radars, or AESAs for Patriot. And this is, I think a great opportunity for us taking
forth these new advanced radar systems to both our domestic and international customers, but we see significant
opportunities in the future for this – taking this GaN technology into the radars and into the international marketplace.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: How do you think about the timeline and the timing of those kinds of opportunities as you
look across the base of Patriot customers? And when they get around to that kind of upgrade, is this a three-year to
five-year kind of opportunity for the market, the 200 radars, how do you think about that?

<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: I'll answer one. On the Patriot, we have customer knocking on our door today. So it's a
matter of getting through a development and then transition to production and then putting it forward. And we're also
working with our U.S. customer on that timing and to ensure that we have essentially all the licenses and everything
else to be able to do that. So, I think bottom line, there is pent up demand for the – for those AESA radars and we're
looking to fill that demand.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: And just another one to switch gears quickly. I think at one point, we were expecting a
re-compete of Warfighter FOCUS. Where does that stand these days in terms of an RFP on that and maybe you can just
remind us of what to expect on that front?
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Well right now for those who don't know, the Warfighter FOCUS is a – is an IDIQ
program that Raytheon runs for the United States Army, that is a program that we are actively engaged in today. It's
running very well. I think it's serving the army and also their international customers very well. So I think they're very
pleased with it. We believe that that program will continue. There is – the army is looking at some acquisition changes
in terms of what's the follow on to Warfighter FOCUS that has gone through several changes recently. And I don't
think right now has settled out in terms of what the final arrangements will be.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Okay. So, just stay tuned.
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: I think stay tuned. But for – and from Raytheon's perspective, it's meant more stable work
relative to Warfighter FOCUS since that change has not occurred.

Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Good morning.
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Good morning, Rob.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Hi guys. Couple of questions, two different topics. The first is on the – Toby, on your
sales guidance, which is essentially down 2% to flat at the ends of the range there. What are the relative growth rates
you now see for domestic versus international within that?
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Yeah. So for the total year what we'd be looking at for domestic is to be down in the
low-single digits and for international up in the low-to-mid-single digits.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Okay. And it sounds like the international again may be a little backend weighted given
the recent awards – or the growth accelerates?
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Yeah. You got that exactly, right. I mean I think if you want to think about the cadence
throughout the year and obviously with international growing versus domestic declining, we'd see second quarter sales
flat to up from Q1 from a sequentially point of view, and then sequentially growth in the back half of the year. And it's
exactly as you said Rob, it's driven by the new awards from the end of 2014, plus what we're seeing here in the first
three plus months of this year and their natural ramp as they start up.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Okay and then just with respect to the comment on European demand stabilizing and
growing here, is there any currency impact on margins that we should start to contemplate?
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: So that question came up at a prior call. I'm going to – I'll give you what we're seeing.
Number one is most of our business is tied to the U.S. dollar. For example, all of the FMS contracts we had, the foreign

military sales contracts are all in U.S. dollars. And then a lot of the – our customers especially in the Middle East, their
currency is pegged to the U.S. dollar. So even on direct commercial sales there, we don't have any impact.
And we do have two landed companies. We have Raytheon Australia and Raytheon Systems Limited. They tend to
work with their own working capital, in essentially RSL it's in the British pound sterling and then in Raytheon
Australia, it's the Australian dollar. So they tend to work...
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: I was going to say I understand that it's conducted in U.S. dollars -
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Yeah.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: – but to the extent that these guys are based for example in euros, the European guys,
they've got to translate. So does that maybe adjust their demand, their pricing appetite?
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Yeah. Toby is going to give you the exact numbers here. Toby, why don't you just give
him the numbers?
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Yeah. So, I think from – the two type of potential exposures we have is around where we
– if we have a mismatch between U.S. dollar and a different denominated currency. As Tom said, that's very minimal
because most of our contracts are matched to the dollar. In the cases when we have that, we hedge it using foreign
exchange contracts.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Okay.
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: With little to no – minimal exposure there. And in the cases where we have these foreign
entities like in the U.K. and Australia, where they do operate in a non-U.S. dollar functional currency, again they are
generally getting paid in that same currency. So, in Australia, they operate in the Aussie dollar. They get paid from
their customer in the Aussie dollar. And we do have some translation risk right when we convert those foreign
denominated financial results back to U.S. dollars, but again historically that has been pretty minimal.

Your next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay of Wolfe Research. Please proceed.
<Q - Hunter K. Keay>: Hey, thanks everybody, I appreciate it. More on IRAD follow-up maybe to Cai's question,
little bit of a different angle though. You guys said the long-term IRAD should still be in the high 2% range of sales. If
global defense budgets continue to improve, does that go higher or does it go lower? I mean my guy would say it will
go lower but threats are very dynamic. The competitive environment is still very difficult. So I would think that there
would be some level of sort of elevated investment on an ongoing basis that may be needed. But assuming the
backdrop of better defense spending from – on a global basis, where should that long-term IRAD go?
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: So let me kind of back you up in tying this to our strategy. So we go off and we look at
our strategy, we look at what the demand needs are from the customers, and then we go look at what gaps we have in
terms of technology that's required to go fulfill them over a period of a three-years window, a five-year window and
then a 10-year window. And then based on that, we look at what technologies need to be developed. And then what we
are – we'll look at in terms of funding those technologies to be ready at the time that they need to be ready at for us to
be competitive in the marketplace.
And it's all driven by the – our strategy and by what we – the capability needs of the customer. And it's not driven by
sales and some exact percentage of sales. That's just how we do it. Essentially it's a bottoms up buildup based on the
demand cycle from the customer. And then also what our technology gaps are.

<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: And I'd just throw in there, and it plays exactly into what Tom's saying, when we make
these decisions on how to invest where and what level it's all with an eye towards returning value to shareholders,
increasing value to shareholders, driving growth – profitable growth. So it's a little difficult to generalize looking
forward, whether that relationship that percentage would go up or down for all the previous reasons.
<Q - Hunter K. Keay>: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot for that. And let's talk about Next Gen Jammer for a minute, if you
would, and can you help us understand, how it's going to kind of spool-up over the long-term and give us an idea how
you're thinking about some of the follow-on increments? What are the some of the pacing items for those? What's sort
of the competitive set and maybe help us think about, in a best case scenario, the potential opportunity for you guys
longer term? Thanks a lot.
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Yeah. So right, real quick, on Next Generation Jammer for those who don't that's a
electronic warfare, essentially it's a pod, self-contained pod, generates its own power to – that gets converted into
electrical energy to drive jammers in the – within the pod. There is two of those pods per Growler, it's the S-18G,
which is the electronic warfare platform for the United States Navy. And so we are – we won a major contract for that a
couple of years back, it's actually uses that GaN technology. So there is a technology that we had invested in 10 years
ago that helped us win that program. And we see that program having quite long legs. Number one, we are going into
the development phase now and then it'll eventually get into transitional production and then enter production. As I
mentioned, it's on schedule, it's on cost and it's hitting all of its milestones, and we think that's going to be a very
successful franchise program for Raytheon in the future.

Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Good morning.
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Good morning, Sam. How are you doing?
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Okay. Couple little questions. First is, why is cash flow from operations up only about $100
million when I thought the eBorders settlement was a £150 million?
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Yeah. So the eBorders settlement, you got that number right, it's about US$226 million,
but the payment came in on the first day of the second quarter.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Right. But I'm just saying for the full year outlook you're only increasing $100 million?
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Yeah. Sure, Sam, so first I'll start, and as you said, we increased the year by $100 million,
we are also going up a $100 million in the second quarter as part of that. It is attributable to the eBorders settlement,
but it has been partially offset, this is getting at the crux of your question, by some changes in program milestone
collections as a result of some later timing on awards within the year. So the cash isn't gone, it's just, it's a timing issue
for that $100 million, if you will, between 2015 and in 2016. We do have a range of $300 million in our outlook or our
guidance there. So our expectations are to be within this range.
Overall, we continue to see strong operating cash flow in 2015. The range now expected to be between $2.4 billion and
$2.7 billion. We do see still the majority of the cash flow being weighted in the second half of the year, really driven by
the timing of significant program milestones.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Okay. That's great. And then can you talk a little about the IDS segment. Just looking at the
margin this quarter, and how do you get them to [ph] 15% (45:36) this year? Are there certain milestones or contractual
resolutions or is some of this the direct foreign sale of the recent award. What it is that drives that margin up?

Page 12 of 16
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Yeah, sure. So in Q1, as you pointed out, right, the margin were down, that was as
expected, and consistent with what we said in January, that was driven by the mix due to – unfavorable mix due to the
planned ramp-down on certain of our international Patriot Programs. So looking forward, clearly we see the margins at
IDS improving, primarily in the second half of the year. That overall business mix will improve, just as you said, as
these new international programs from the end of 2014 and the awards here in the early part of 2015 start to ramp up
and move through the production cycle. So the mix gets more favorable, but not till the second half of the year.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Okay. And if I can add one more. Tom, just want to, summarize in terms of some of the
commentary about the acquisitions. Is it fair to say that we'll see more balanced capital deployment and not $1
billion-plus type of acquisitions from here on out now that Websense has been announced?
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: As we sit today and we'll continue to look for value-added target acquisitions that do
position the company for future growth. We don't see, as I sit here today, a large acquisition of the size of Websense.
But there could potentially be some smaller acquisitions to fit some technology areas that we need to be successful in
that market space.

Your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment of Sterne Agee CRT. Please proceed.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Yes. Good morning, Tom, Toby.
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Good morning.
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Good morning.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Question on – question I guess clarification back to Rob's comment on kind of domestic
versus international. Clarification Toby, on – you said that domestic being down a little bit low-single digit
international up. Does that continue at that same pace into 2016 or do we see domestic improve kind of given Tom's
comments about the 2016 budget?
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Yeah, so, let me answer it this way. Clearly with the awards that we've seen again coming
out of the end of last year and into 2014 (sic) [2015] (48:15), we'd expect to see strong performance into 2016 on the
international front. On the domestic side of it, tied back to the comments that Tom made earlier, relative to where the
domestic budgets are going, we'd probably see our domestic profile start to flatten out towards the end of the year and
we could start to see some improvement going forward.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Okay. That's helpful. And then just lastly on – congratulations on all these Patriot wins. Tom,
you mentioned kind of 14 countries that now have that deployed, I mean how do we think about that long term? I mean
we ask this I think every quarter about what inning are we in in terms of missile defense orders out of the Middle East
and Asia, but how do we think about the opportunity longer term outside of kind of what you just mentioned Poland,
Germany, et cetera?
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: So, outside of the bringing on a whole brand new country like we've done with Poland,
we hope to do with Germany what we did do with Qatar. There are also the upgrade capabilities with each of the
partner countries that have the Patriot system. And right now, we've been doing something called Configuration 3 Plus.
You may have heard us talk about that on the – on some of the calls, that's a major upgrade to the Patriot system that
we're off and working with the – our customers on.
And as of today, there is 72 fire units that are still there for upgrade potential and we are working with those customers
to upgrade those systems. And then I also mentioned previously, the upgrade for the 360 AESA radar that will be a new
upgrade for all the Patriot systems, and there's over 200 of those radars to be upgraded.

So I think the way of looking at it is, that these 14 countries are a market of surround and around Patriot. And so we are
working with those customers to continually to upgrade those systems to counter the evolving threat. So there is a base
program that does software upgrades and other things as the threat changes and that we work across those countries.
And then also as new technology comes onboard to improve the capability of this system, that we then insert that
technology across those 14 countries' Patriot systems. So it's essentially it's a market on its own that we look to
continually to upgrade and provide a support activity. So it's a great franchise business and it also does for the
customers, it allows them to share in the cost for the – any software upgrades for the evolving threat, and then also to
share in the – in the cost of the development of new technologies. So it's a great -it's a great win-win situation for both
sides.

Your next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski of Drexel Hamilton. Please proceed.
<Q - Peter Skibitski>: Good morning, guys. Nice quarter.
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Good morning, Pete. How are you doing?
<Q - Peter Skibitski>: Good, good. Hey on Poland Patriots, I was wondering if you can give us some more color on
maybe ballpark some of the characteristics of the contract. There is a lot of numbers floating out there, some of them
are talking about more than $5 billion. Can you give us a sense of how many batteries it's going to be, maybe ballpark
the size and length? And then when you talk about 2016 booking, are you talking earlier in the year or later in the year?
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: So, just real quick. So right as of today, and actually of Tuesday, we were down – we
were selected by Poland to provide the Patriot solution for their Integrated Air and Missile Defense System. And then
as part of that activity, we have provided various I would call it options for the Polish Government, variants of Patriot
and quantities of fire units, and how to set them up in their country, so we have been working with them. But now the –
some additional work is required to move forward to definitize what that exact configuration will be for the Polish
government.
As part of that effort, we are also have been working with Polish industry. We have 25 plus agreements with Polish
industry in terms of doing co-production and potential co-development activities all in support of the Patriot system. So
the bottom line is, we're in – we'll be in negotiations with the Polish Government to act to define exactly what this
configuration is, and as we get that information and get more clarity on that, we'll be providing that to you guys to
ensure you understand where that program is going.
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: And I think Pete, given all that Tom said, while we can't exactly predict when the award
would come think back half of 2016, because there is some work to be done to work through all those steps.
<Q - Peter Skibitski>: Okay, got – got. And then just on the streak you guys are on with Patriots, is it fair to say that
the IDS being your highest margin business that maybe has the best kind of mid-range growth outlook for the firm?
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: I'll take it on first and then I'll let Toby come in and he can put some numbers on some
things. But the bottom line is at IDS with all these Patriots coming in, in some case bumper to bumper, in some case
coming in on top of each other, what that's doing and that's allowing us to stack all this up in the factory and to gain
significant, I would call production efficiencies, and getting IDS margins back to what we've traditionally have had in
that business.
So, essentially it's replenishing the backlog for that factory and allowing us to gain those efficiencies as we move
forward.

So that's the good news on IDS. But don't forget IDS has also won some major programs. For example, the Air and
Missile Defense Radar program that they have, that they're off and running, they also have won the 3DELRR, which is
in protest.
So in addition to the Patriot franchise, getting reinvented to certain extent, and all the upgrade potential for, they also
have some brand new franchises that are on the horizon that they have in hand, and the AMDR is in development, that's
going to be transitioning into production. That's going to go into both U.S. domestic and also international coalition
partners. And then, we have the 3DELRR which is in protest right now, but when that comes out to protest assuming
Raytheon is on the right side of that, that is another program that has a significant – actually was set up by OSD to be a
international program on day one. So, a brand new franchise for them there.
So bottom line is, is IDS is much more than just Patriot moving forward, and I have that same – I can give you that
same play for each of the other businesses. All the businesses are coming up with I would call it new franchises and
they are also reinventing their existing franchises. We talked about AMRAAM. AMRAAM has just gone through a
whole new upgrade program, it's called the AIM-120D, it's a brand-new missile, great capabilities, and so it's
essentially been reinvented, and just in the last year over $1 billion worth of AMRAAM orders. So this is going on all
throughout the company, across all our product lines and across all our pursuits.
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: And I would – Pete, I'd just add that specific to IDS when we talk about mix that's
probably the one business within the company that can have the biggest swing or the most impact because of mix, in
part given the nature of the beast with the large $1 billion plus dollar contracts that drive that within IDS. So, that
combined with the loading up the factory here does give us confidence that we will be seeing improvement over time in
the IDS margin as we had previously talked about.

Okay. Your final question comes from the line of Doug Harned of Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Hi. Good morning. Thank you.
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Good morning, Doug. How are you doing today?
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Good, good. I wanted to ask on IDS, because if we go back historically, the business
could be doing 16% even 17% type margins. And I know today, on the positive side you've got more international
work, a higher percentage of that there which would be good. And the negative side, in the near-term a lot of new
programs which you probably are booking at lower margin. Can you talk about what the percentage of international is
and then, can we expect this to go back over time to those 16%, 17% type margin levels that we used to see?
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: So Doug you – you are asking a very interesting question to two individuals who used to
actually run that business, I don't know if you remember that or not. But we have a deep domain understanding of what
it – you know what it takes to drive the margins in that business. So Toby is going to walk you through this and you
couldn't have asked two people that are more familiar with that business.
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Yeah. So you know IDS does have the largest international content of our four businesses.
You know, it has been running close to about 50% you know 50/50 domestic, international, and obviously that mix in
and of itself putting timing aside does help to drive the margin profile.
As you pointed out, we have run you know going back last year 16%, in 2013 a little over 17%, and you know
depending upon the timing of some of these other programs that you alluded to, which you know they are development

programs they are being booked at lower margins, things like AMDR, Tom mentioned 3DELRR, you know as those
move ultimately through production they'll help lift the margin.
But it is possible to see margins start you know over time, but it will take a couple of years you know once this backlog
really gets into kind of full steam on these international Patriot awards before we would potentially see them you know
climbing back up to those past historical levels.
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: I think Doug one thing which really has two guy who've run that business very excited
about what we're seeing is the I would call it the bumper-to-bumper work, you know that we mentioned just over the
last 18 months, close to $7 billion worth of new bookings, and that doesn't include Poland. And when you – if you lay
in, layer in Poland on top of this others you have essentially a full factory going up almost to 2022. So that allows us to
really work the efficiencies, productivity really allows us to work with our suppliers across the board. Gives us levers
that you don't have when you just have one contract. And so we are very upbeat about IDS here over the next several
years. We will – both Toby and I will be definitely probing to ensure that they meet our expectations. Having run the
business we know which levers they are, and if they don't have their hands on those levers we'll make sure those hands
get on those levers very quickly.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: And then shifting gears a little bit, two technologies that have become an increasingly
high priority in the Pentagon, have been directed energy weapons and railguns. Two thing that you all been working on
for quite a few years. Could you talk about the outlook for those technologies? Are these something that you see – in
what timeframe, contributing materially to your revenues?
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Well, number one is we're – you're absolutely correct, we have been investing in these
technologies for many years, especially the high energy laser. We see that as core to our business. We have great
domain expertise in that area. We believe we have a great new technology in that area that will allow us to gain market
share. We are working with the U.S. government in on several programs relative to high energy lasers.
I think the bottom-line is going to be Doug is, when is the U.S. government ready to move forward into a major EMD
program on one of these systems. The power levels have to get up to be something that you'd actually want to – I would
call it, put into service, and the technology that we have allows us to get to those power levels. But again then you do
need in the market – this marketplace you need essentially a customer sponsor who is willing to work with you and
take you into EMD program and then transition production also to go through all the testing required to get one of these
systems into the hands of our Warfighters. But I think it's – we're on the cusp of moving in that direction.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: But it sounds like it's a few years off. Is that...?
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Yeah, a few years off I would say, but it's not – we're not talking decades.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Okay.
