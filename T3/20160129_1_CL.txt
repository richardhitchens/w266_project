Bina H. Thompson
Thank you, Chanel, and good morning, everybody, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2015 earnings release conference
call. With me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan,
Corporate Controller; and Elaine Paik, Treasurer.
We are delighted to have finished 2015 with continued strong organic sales growth in the fourth quarter. The 5%
growth was well within our targeted growth rate of 4% to 7% and is impressive coming on top of strong growth in the
year ago quarter. Our gross profit margin was up 20 basis points despite continued pressures from foreign exchange
related transaction costs. And although down on a year-over-year basis, our advertising as a percentage of sales was up
sequentially from the third quarter. As you will hear in more detail as I go through the divisions, our market shares
around the world are growing. Innovation has played an important role and will continue to do so as we enter 2016.
Our Global Growth and Efficiency Program is on track and our ongoing funding-the-growth initiatives continue to
deliver substantial savings. Our balance sheet is strong and working capital is under very good control.
As you read in this morning's press release, we have taken the decision effective December 31, 2015, to change our
accounting method for our Venezuelan operations and, as a result, in future periods, we will no longer include the
results of our Venezuelan operations in our consolidated financial statements. As we stated in the press release, we
expect the EPS impact in 2016 resulting from the change in accounting for our Venezuelan operations will be about
negative of $0.10 for the full year. And we would expect this impact to be negative $0.02 to $0.03 per quarter.
So, let's turn to the divisions. First was North America. We are pleased with the continued solid organic sales growth in
this region. And as mentioned in the press release, our market shares increased year-to-date in toothpaste, manual
toothbrushes, mouthwash, liquid hand soap, body wash, liquid cleaners and fabric conditioners. And as you would
expect, innovation was an important contributor to these excellent results.
In the third quarter of 2015, we launched Colgate Total Daily Repair toothpaste. This toothpaste re-mineralizes
weakened enamel to help prevent cavities and maintain stronger teeth as well as kills bacteria that cause gingivitis for
healthier gums. In addition, we engaged in a targeted outreach to consumers with diabetes. People with diabetes are
two times more likely to develop gum disease. We reached both dentists and consumers and developed retailer
partnership. And as a result, our overall market share for Colgate Total toothpaste grew to 10.3% from 10% at the
beginning of 2015.
Our Colgate Optic White toothpaste franchise is growing as well, up to 5.7% at our last read of 2015, thanks to the
launch of Colgate Optic White Platinum Express White. With the help of a comprehensive IMC plan, support from
dental professionals and strong in-store activities, Colgate Enamel Health toothpaste has grown share as well. And
toothpaste innovation will continue in the first quarter. Building on the success of our whitening franchise, we are
launching Colgate Optic White Platinum High Impact White which provides four shades visibly whiter teeth in six
weeks and starts working in just three days. Also, we are introducing premium priced Colgate Enamel Health Mineral
Repair toothpaste with an accompanying mouthwash and whitening toothbrush. The toothbrush and mouthwash help
replenish natural calcium for stronger enamel.
To bolster our toothbrush business, we are launching Colgate Kids Interactive, the only talking powered toothbrush
featuring kids' favorite licensed characters which coach you to better brushing. The brush features a two-minute timer
to help ensure effective brushing. Also in the first quarter, Tom's of Maine is launching Tom's Natural Rapid Relief
Sensitive toothpaste with a clinically proven arginine and calcium carbonate formula to provide rapid relief and long
lasting protection. With no artificial dyes, sweeteners or preservatives, it will be premium-priced.
Our liquid hand soap share was up 90 basis points year-to-date and our year-to-date body wash share increased 80 basis
points. More innovation this quarter should help maintain this healthy momentum. In liquid hand soap, we are
launching Softsoap Foaming Hand Soap for kids that make hand washing fun as well as Softsoap Pure Foaming Hand
Soap with a simple formula that is dye free, alcohol free, has 100% natural fragrance, yet effectively cleans and
purifies. And in body wash, we are launching Softsoap Luminous Oils, one variant with avocado oil and iris, and the
other with macadamia oil and peony, designed to leave skin feeling soft.

Turning then to Europe/South Pacific, we are delighted with the return to positive organic sales growth in this region.
Across Europe our market shares increased in toothpaste, toothbrushes, body wash, underarm and fabric conditioners.
In the toothpaste category, we have seen strong results. In France, our market share is up 80 basis points year-to-date to
22.4%. In Poland, we grew share 160 basis points to 47.6% year-to-date and in Italy, we increased share 30 basis points
to 24.6% year-to-date.
Similarly in manual toothbrushes, our market shares increased year-to-date. Overall, in the region, our market shares
are up 120 basis points to 24.7% year-to-date with excellent results in areas such as the UK, which is up 340 basis
points to 39.3%; Germany, which is up a full point to 21%; and Italy, which is up 60 basis points to 16.4%. And as in
the U.S., our innovation grid for the first quarter in Europe is very full. In the toothpaste category, we are introducing
Colgate Total Deep Clean which features high cleaning prophy silica, the same ingredient dentists use for in-office
cleaning. The product provides a deep-cleaning user experience and is unique among the current variants in the Colgate
Total portfolio. In addition, we are restaging the Colgate Total toothpaste premium line with a new design that better
communicates higher quality, healthier and scientific and therapeutic benefits. New icons visually convey the variant
benefits, enhancing differentiation, relevance and shopability.
In the toothbrush category, we are launching Colgate 360° Expert White Toothbrush + Pen, the toothbrush and
whitening pen that has helped increase market shares here in the U.S. under the Colgate Optic White name. And in
personal care, we are re-launching Palmolive Gourmet shower gels with high density creamy formulas and a new
packaging technology that provides a premium look with high quality satin finishing and very strong shelf impact.
Vanilla pleasure, chocolate passion, peach delight and strawberry touch will enchant consumers at point of sale. Also in
personal care is the Palmolive Skin Garden line, a premium offering with a regimen approach. The shower gel, bath
foam, liquid hand soap, bar soap and body lotion contain irresistible fragrances, natural ingredients rooted in the garden
such as violet and honey, peony, pear and Mirabelle plum, sensorial and vivid textures and cutting edge packaging, all
reinforcing the Palmolive equity.
And as we told you last quarter, our Sanex business is performing well and we have new news to report here as well.
Our line of Sanex Advanced Shower Oils is bringing the shower oil trend from pharmacy to mass. The shower oils
provide a feeling of comfort in the shower and are formulated to minimize the risk of irritation. These are even suitable
for children, a new consumer target. Also inspired by the pharmacy channel are our new Sanex Advanced Body Balms
in a new stand-up tube format with a thicker, richer formula and premium pricing. Sanex Men will also be launched,
which is the first mass personal care range truly focused on men's skin health. As you know, we have a very strong,
market leading home care business in this region. And an exciting innovation in this category is a line of Ajax specialty
sprays which facilitate difficult everyday tasks in the kitchen. Priced at a premium, individual variants tackle different
surfaces: the oven and microwave, vitro-ceramic and stainless steel.
So, turning then to Latin America, despite some macroeconomic challenges in certain countries such as Brazil and
Venezuela, the division delivered solid organic sales growth. Severe devaluations across the region have necessitated
fairly significant price increases. But despite that, our regional market shares are solid and increased year-to-date in
toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, mouthwash, toilet soaps, shampoos and liquid cleaners.
In Brazil, our toothpaste market share continues to climb, up 100 basis points year-to-date to 72.4% with the most
recent read at 73.4%. Innovations across our portfolio contributed to this success. In Mexico, despite continued
competitive pressure, our market share is up 120 basis points to 80.8%. One of our newest innovations, Colgate
Maximum Cavity Protection with Neutrazucar, increased 70 basis points and is now almost to two points. Our market
leading manual toothbrush share is up 350 basis points year-to-date across the region. This excellent performance has
been driven by innovation in the super premium category with products such as Colgate Slim Soft and Colgate 360°.
In toilet soaps, we increased our leadership share 40 basis points to 30.9% year-to-date. Protex and Palmolive continue
to hold the number one and number two positions in the region, and we achieved record shares in Mexico, Colombia
and Guatemala. More innovation is planned for this year. In the oral care whitening category, we have three exciting
launches. In toothpaste, we are launching Colgate Luminous White Advanced Expert, which delivers three shades
whiter teeth. A companion Colgate Luminous White mouthwash with an alcohol-free zinc and anti-tartar salts formula

that helps deliver an anti-stain white smile, and Colgate Luminous White Advanced toothbrush and whitening pen with
a claim to provide whiter teeth in two days, will both be launched later this year.
In mouthwash, a graphics re-launch of Colgate Plax 2-in-1 mouthwash clearly explains the benefit "see the removed
bacteria for a fresh and clean mouth" and should drive growth for the category. In personal care, under the Protex
name, we are launching a range of bar soap, shower gel and liquid hand soap: Protex Pro-Hydrate. Developed from the
consumer insight that to have healthy and moisturized skin, it is necessary to deeply clean skin before moisturizing.
This innovation has a formula that eliminates 99.9% of bacteria and has a macadamia oil complex that glides over your
skin for a soft sensation. A similar range under the Palmolive equity will be Palmolive Almond and Omega Oil with a
nourishing formula.
In underarm, a re-launch of premium priced Lady Speed Stick Clinical and Speed Stick Clinical will provide the
benefits of superior sweat protection, neutralizing the source of bad odor, hypoallergenic, anti-stain technology and
advanced skin care.
Turning then to Asia, while organic sales growth was somewhat muted in this region in the fourth quarter, we are
pleased that volume increased in our larger businesses, Greater China and India, and this despite some overall slowing
in category growth rates. And as elsewhere, innovation has helped drive growth. In India, our toothpaste share is up to
54.7% year-to-date. Colgate Sensitive Pro Relief Repair and Prevent and a re-launch of the rest of our sensitivity line
have met with success. In addition, Colgate Total Charcoal with a unique antibacterial formula which reduces bacteria
on 100% of your mouth surfaces has added market share. Elsewhere in the region, our toothpaste shares were a little
soft on a year-to-date basis, but market shares for the fourth quarter increased versus fourth quarter 2014 in China,
Thailand, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and Pakistan. Our year-to-date toothbrush shares are also up in India, the
Philippines, Malaysia, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Pakistan. A particular success has been Colgate Slim Soft Charcoal
Gold toothbrush with less than 0.01 millimeter charcoal gold slim tip antibacterial bristles for deep gentle cleaning. In
the most recent period, it achieved 2.1, 3.6 and 2.2 share points respectively in Malaysia, Hong Kong and Singapore. In
the fourth quarter in Hong Kong, we launched our Colgate Optic White Toothbrush and Whitening Pen, and it has a
6.4% share in the latest read.
Our mouthwash business is strong. Across the region, our market share is up to 25.7% year-to-date, up 70 basis points
year-on-year with the most recent read at 26.5%. And we have some exciting innovation launching this quarter. In
China, where natural ingredients resonate very strongly with the consumer, we will be introducing Colgate Naturals
toothpaste. There are five variants: Tea Tree Oil Gum Care, Lemon Zesty Radiating White, Jasmine Chamomile
Healthy Refreshing, Lotus Jade Green Soothing Gum and Seaweed Salt Pure White. The packaging visually
communicates the different ingredients.
And we have a number of new products in the toothbrush category: Colgate Slim Soft Sensitive, a silky soft brush for
sensitive teeth and gums, Colgate Super Flexi Black with a flexible neck and improved handle, and a line of mid-tier
brushes for kids with tapered bristles. To maintain our momentum in mouthwash, we are launching in China Colgate
Plax Extreme Icy Mint mouthwash, which delivers long lasting prevention of bad breath with dual mint essence as well
as anti-bacterial protection.
Then going to Africa/Eurasia. As you know, currency headwinds in this part of the world have necessitated some
significant pricing in countries such as Russia, but market shares are solid and growing. Our year-to-date regional
toothpaste market share is at 33.2%, up a full point from the yea- ago period. In Russia, our share is up 260 basis points
year-to-date to 34.5%, reaching a record high of 35.2% in the most recent period. In South Africa, our market share is
up 80 basis points year-to-date to 49.6%. And our recent launch of Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection with Sugar
Acid Neutralizer in both these countries has contributed to these strong results.
In manual toothbrushes, our market shares are up in many countries across the region. In Russia, our year-to-date share
is up 260 basis points to 48.4%. Excellent in-store execution played an important role in these results. In Israel, two
new products, Colgate Extra Clean and Colgate Slim Soft, helped increase our year-to-date share by 300 basis points to
51.2%, with the most recent share read at a record 55.6%. Our bar soap business is strong as well, up 80 basis points to
21.7% on a year-to-date basis. And in South Africa, the Protex brand is helping grow the business, and our market

share is up 20 basis points on a year-to-date basis. In Russia, Palmolive is leading growth, driven by promotional
support as well as strong in-store execution. Our year-to-date share is up 50 basis points.
And we have some exciting innovation for this part of the world as well. This quarter, we will be launching Colgate
Total Pro Breath Health toothpaste across the division. The differentiated packaging with icons on the pack clearly
explains the benefits which include a unique breath freshening technology: ON12 Complex. Another toothpaste launch
will be the Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Repair and Prevent line extension. This premium priced toothpaste repairs the
cause of sensitivity and prevents further sensitivity from gum recession. And an innovation for the Russian market is
Colgate Altai Herbs Ginseng with an exclusive blend of Altai herbs and ginseng.
In the Personal Care category, we are re-launching our existing line of Palmolive Aroma Sensations body washes and
adding two new variants, Feel Good and So Dynamic.
Finally with Hill's, Hill's finished the year with a strong quarter, both here and abroad. All three brands: Prescription
Diet, Science Diet and Ideal Balance, are doing well. In fact, Hill's Prescription Diet, our flagship line of therapeutic
pet foods, became a $1 billion brand in 2015. In the U.S., superstore retail consumption is growing in both PetSmart
and Petco, which contributed to our solid results.
In Europe, our Ideal Balance line is now fully rolled out across all key countries and doing well. We are seeing a steady
build of distribution and volume. Our integrated marketing campaign is focusing on trial and repurchase. And we are
very excited about our upcoming innovation. Just launched at the North American Vet Conference is Prescription Diet
Derm Defense for dogs. This diet is the first and only nutrition formulated to reduce signs of environmental allergy by
helping to disrupt the internal allergy response and create a barrier against future episodes in dogs. It is available in dry
and delicious stews forms, and of course will be supported by a full IMC campaign to engage the increasingly
millennial vet population.
Hill's will also be entering the wearables space. Hill's has formed a strategic alliance with AGL to advance veterinary
health care with the development of a wearable sensor for dogs that is sophisticated enough to distinguish the acts of
scratching and shaking from running. Coupled with a robust data and analytics platform, it is designed to more quickly
alert veterinarians and pet owners to potential health concerns as part of an ongoing monitoring program. It will be
recommended for dogs that need to be regularly monitored, including those with dermatological conditions, arthritis or
obesity. New news in the wellness category is premium priced Hill's Science Diet Healthy Cuisine for dogs and cats,
which uses our new alginate technology to deliver superior looking tasty wet food. The new formulas are loaded with
tasty morsels, tender vegetables and savory sauce.
So, before I wrap up quickly, I want to cover two more housekeeping items relative to your models. Net interest in
2016 should be between $30 million and $45 million (sic) [$35 million] (21:25) per quarter with the loss of interest
income in Venezuela. Average diluted common shares outstanding were 896.5 million for the three months ended
December 31, 2015. Because we had a GAAP loss in the fourth quarter of 2015 due to the one-time charge for
Venezuela, this number excludes 6.6 million of net incremental common shares outstanding assumed issued from the
exercise of in-the-money stock options as they are anti-dilutive. We would expect the 6.6 million shares to be included
in diluted common shares outstanding in the first quarter of 2016 as they should not be anti-dilutive in this period.
So in summary, we are extremely pleased with the way that we finished the year. Our organic sales growth was strong
around the world, our gross margin increased and our market shares are healthy. Colgate people around the world are
all focused on our strategies and priorities thereby delivering these consistent strong results. Our Global Growth and
Efficiency Program is on track as is our ongoing funding-the-growth programs. Our innovation pipeline is full and we
are excited about the many new product initiatives we just told you about. So we expect this momentum to continue
into 2016 and look forward to sharing our progress with you as we go throughout the year.
So, Chanel, that's the end of my prepared remarks. I should like to turn it over now to Q&A.

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Hey. Good morning. So, Ian, you had very strong pricing in the quarter, both at the
corporate level and in Latin America, but the volume reaction looked more severe than what we've seen traditionally in
your business, particularly in Latin America. So I was hoping you could just discuss consumer demand elasticity in this
current macro environment if you're seeing any different behavior versus the past with the macro slowdown we're
seeing in Latin America?
And then how that may impact your desire to take additional pricing going forward to offset incremental FX pressure?
And then that's the consumer level, but at the competitor level, what are you generally seeing from your competitors?
Are they following, and can you characterize the competitive environment that you're seeing? Thanks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yep. Thanks, Dara, and before I jump in, let me just take this belated opportunity to wish
everyone on the call a happy, healthy and safe 2016 in this volatile world. And when we turn to that volatile world,
we're actually very pleased with the results in 2015, as Bina said, with consistent 5% organic top line growth in the
quarter and in the year. And with our gross margin building from the second quarter to 59% in the fourth quarter, which
is the highest in two years in that environment, which positions us well to see margin expansion in 2016. And I'll come
back to that when we, no doubt, talk about margin.
But turning to how we think about the business in the environment everybody is operating in, first of all, we seek to
have clarity and consistency of strategy. And we've had that for the last decade with a simple and focused strategy that
starts with consumers and ends with the leadership development in the company to deliver our products to those
consumers. Then you have the balance between the consistency of the results by quarter and our ambitions for the
longer-term, which are captured in the Global Growth and Efficiency Program in terms of building the organization we
want for the future, and then of course, the decisions we make on the ground and the agility that's required to deal with
events as they unfold.
Now, if you look at Latin America to the specific question, obviously, the foreign exchange headwind there, as it was
in Africa/Eurasia, was the most severe we experienced in our world for 2015. And when we think about the consumer,
we think about the brands and the health of our brands and the development of the market share of our brands. But
obviously, we need to be focused on rebuilding the margin, which is the fulcrum for investment in a business. So in
both those divisions, we took a conscious decision to take pricing to help recover gross margin and suffered the volume
decline you see.
We feel, however, very comfortable because of the performance of our market shares. Whether you look at the value
market share in local currency, as Bina talked specifically to Brazil, or whether you look at the volume market shares in
that region, they're up. So the consumer is staying with us, and the consumer is staying with us across the portfolio of
brands that we have.
And as we think forward into 2016 now, I guess a couple of things to say, and it relates to the gross margin. First of all,
the enormous translation headwind we faced in 2015 will still be there in 2016, but it will be at a lesser level. Second,
the general commodity pricing environment year-on-year will be flat to modestly down. Third, we have our
funding-the-growth program, which we talk about every call, which we expect to build the same way it has done for the
last several years. We have the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, and on top of that, we have pricing. But we
have less pricing in 2016 than we had in 2015, and half of that pricing without Venezuela is still rollover pricing into
2016.
So our planning expectation is that we will see the balance between volume and pricing move back a little bit more to
volume and less to pricing, and that will include Latin America, and we expect our market shares to continue to grow.
So the consumer behavior hasn't changed. We haven't seen down-trading, and we are confident about the reversal back
to volume more and price less in 2016 for Latin America and the overall business.

And we'll take our next question from Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: Hi. Can I just follow up on that last one just in terms of the outlook maybe in the
near-term to manage expectations? I know the comps in Latin America on the volume side are really tough in the first
half of 2016. So do you think we're going to see negative volume growth maybe for the next quarter or two, potentially
even worse than we just saw in the fourth quarter in Latin America? But then broadly, I also wanted to ask more
strategically, Asia, the slowdown in category growth that you're seeing there, it surprises me that we're seeing a
slowdown in category growth given the very low per capita consumption levels. I get it in Latin America, but not so
much in Asia. So can you talk about Asia specifically? China and India, I think, you called out. Do think there's
something more structural there? Do you think there's going to take a longer time? You really think it's an economic
factor that's leading to the slowdown of the growth? If you can talk about that, that'd be great. Thanks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yeah. I think in Latin America, the expectation is to see – not to see the kind of volume negative
that we had in the fourth quarter as we step our way into 2016. Obviously, it will build across the year, but, no, we don't
expect a repeat of that level.
When you turn to Asia and if you look at the emerging markets in general, the local currency growth rates in categories
is still mid-single digits, maybe slightly off that in the fourth quarter. We haven't seen anything dramatic in terms of a
change in behavior thus far. We're obviously very focused on that, Wendy, as you would suppose we would be. And
pleasingly I can report that the market shares in China and India, as Bina mentioned with India, are both up nicely in
2015. So we stay close to it. Right now, we continue to see categories growing around mid-single digits in local
currency terms.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Steve Powers with UBS.
<Q - Stephen R. Powers>: Great. Thanks. Just one more on the volume, if I could, just to clean it up. Ian, can you just
talk whether the volume softness that you've seen in response to pricing has been at all more pronounced on the
personal and home care side of things versus oral care, or if it's about equal? And then a few months ago, you had
indicated that you thought traditional advertising ratios would be up again as a percentage of sales in 2016. And as
we've talked about, a good deal has changed since then in the macro environment. So I'm just curious if that's still your
expectation in terms of what's embedded in your outlook, the Super Bowl ad notwithstanding? Thanks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yippee. The answer to your first question on volume is no, not really. It has more to do with the
short-term slowdown in relation to the level of increase in pricing you take regardless of which category you're taking
pricing in.
On the advertising side, I won't repeat too much of an old story, but I would say back to this notion of marketing mix,
when we think about advertising, we think about everything from educating kids in schools, to get dental professionals
and veterinary professionals to make a recommendation before the consumer has even purchased a product, to
engaging with consumers through the various different media that we can avail ourselves of, increasingly digital but
also the so-called traditional media.
And then, of course, a strong belief in making that engagement carry through to the retail level where we think that
expenditure can build brand health and value as well. But as we said on the last call, we expected as we got into our
budgeting process that our innovation flow would be such that we would expect to see coming into 2016 an increase in
the traditional advertising while still using the in-store lever as well. And indeed, as you might imagine, given the
richness of innovation that Bina went through in her prepared remarks, that is exactly where we have ended up with our
plan. And so, I can say that our advertising, the traditional advertising for 2016 is up both on an absolute basis and, of
course, on a ratio basis as well given that strength of innovation.

And we'll take our next question from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - William G. Schmitz>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hey, Bill.
<Q - William G. Schmitz>: Hey. A couple of things. How do you define strong organic growth? Because I'm trying to
figure out how that sort of plays out relative to Venezuela. So can you tell us how much Venezuela contributed to
organic growth now that the cat's kind of out of the bag on the earnings side? And then sort of how you think organic
growth is going to play out next year?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yeah. Well, let me just say, Bill, in response to your question: when you say how do you define
strong organic growth, I think we would say in the environment we're in, the range we have, 4% to 7%, bookends
strong organic growth, and 5% for 2015 in that regard is therefore strong. And the way we're thinking about 2016
without Venezuela is exactly the same way, which is to say our target for organic growth is to grow in that 4% to 7%
range without Venezuela. And I can report that I have to say, from a top line point of view, the year is off to a bright
start.

And we'll take our next question from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jason English>: Hey. Good morning, folks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hey, Jason.
<Q - Jason English>: Thank you for the question, and happy new year to you as well. I want to come back on
Venezuela real quick just to make sure we understand the math. I think in the last Q you filed that you listed around 4%
of sales, 2% of EBIT. Clearly, more on EPS with interest income that you talked about. But on the EBIT side, the math,
I know on very rounded numbers suggest that removal of Venezuela is going to be about a 50 basis point contribution
to EBIT margins. Is that sort of directionally right? And if so, can you comment sort of bigger picture on how you're
thinking about margins overall next year both with and without that tailwind?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yeah. Well, we don't tend to talk about EBIT margin, Jason. So, let me turn to gross margin,
which as you know, we regard as the fulcrum of everything. So as I said, gross margin, up 20 bps to 59% in the fourth
quarter. And perhaps I should take the opportunity now before Lauren comes on and chides me of going through the
roll forward for that fourth quarter gross profit. So if you go to the gross profit in the prior year was 58.8%. Pricing, our
strongest showing for the year, up 1.6 percentage points, so positive 1.6 points. Restructuring and funding-the-growth,
290 basis points, positive 2.9%. Material prices, 420 basis points negative, of which 240 basis points was transaction,
modest negative with all other, and you get to the 59%.
Now, as we roll that forward to 2016 and the plans we have, we feel good about our ability to meaningfully increase
gross margin in 2016. And we would say that we expect our gross margin expansion in 2016 to be in that 75 basis
points to 125 basis points range. Part of the reason, as I said earlier, is the less aggressive foreign exchange headwinds.
But as I also said earlier, we have pricing less, but half of it rollover. We have funding-the-growth, which you know
very well. We have the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, and we expect to see that gross margin expansion
begin in the first quarter of 2016.

<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Hey, guys.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hey, Ali.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: I wanted to drill down two things. One is SG&A and then just a broader question SKU proliferation.
First on SG&A, I know we've talked a lot about ad spend. It is the seventh quarter in a row we are seeing ad spend as a
percentage of sales go down. But to your point earlier, your shares aren't moving. If you could confirm both volume
and value. It doesn't look like it's moving. So how much more of a shift do you think you can do from ad spend to
in-store? And kind of what are you watching just to make sure you don't go into the olden days fear of just hurting the
brand and it becomes a risk from that perspective? So kind of what are you watching, how much more you can you go?
And then on non-advertising – ex-advertising SG&A, I thought we would see more benefit because of the hubbing and
the restructuring and everything that we talked about there. Why are we not seeing more there? So that's the SG&A
question.
And then on the SKU proliferation or innovation question, how do you guys – so every quarter we hear really
interesting things, Bina is basically out of breath describing them at the start of every quarter. How do you guys deal
with SKU proliferation? Is there a very clear discipline of put one in, take one out? Or how do you deal with that? And
if you give us a sense of your number of SKUs you guys sell over the years? And how much that's gone up? It's just
something that struck me listening yet again. Thanks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yeah, yeah. Well, thanks for your one question, Ali, as usual. But let's turn to the advertising.
And I mentioned in the introductory comments the word balance. And you and I had this conversation on the last call.
We don't view this as either/or. We view this as what do we need to do to create the trial and repeat of our brands, build
health over time and ultimately build market share with more consumers using our products. And I wasn't quite sure
what you meant when you said your market share is not moving. It is moving, and it's moving up. And Bina went
through some of those examples.
And when we think about advertising, we think about, as I said earlier, marketing mix from the school room, to the
dental office, to the store and all of the other media through which you can reach people, including digital, including
television, including magazine advertising and the like, even billboards in Africa. And we think about that balance all
the time to make sure that our brand health doesn't weaken over time. And I said that the advertising would be up
absolutely and as a percent of sales in 2016. And we have quite a list of measures that we look at from trial to repeat, to
various brand health measures, which we track over time so that we don't get to a point where you start to, shall we say,
take more out of the brand than you are putting back into a brand. And that's back to that word balance.
We think we have kept the right balance in 2015. When we go into 2016 with the portfolio and the brand objectives
that we have for 2016, we're taking up the traditional. We will continue to use the in-store as part of our marketing mix,
and we will monitor very, very closely the trial and repeat measures we have in terms of the new innovation and the
brand health measures that we have in terms of the brands, Colgate, Sanex, et cetera, that we have around the world,
because we are a marketing company and that's what we do.
So I think you can be reassured that it's not one or the other. We're not trying to push from one to the other. We're just
trying to register the point that we have to think about the mix of all of the engagement points we have with consumers.
And as I said before, we have a 74% share in Brazil. That's how much of the shelf you have. You can have an
enormous impact with the consumer in the store.
Your SKU proliferation point of view is spot on. It is always a risk that you end up in the hunt for innovation of this
risk of over proliferating. I can't say that we have a strict one in, one out policy. That would not be correct. I can say
that as a company measure from the top of the house, we monitor our SKUs by division, by business and overall as a
company. And frankly, our SKU count has been coming down. And now, within that you have cycles when you're
replacing and you've got a double count, but it's something we watch really at the top of the house, and it's essential
part of our simplification initiatives because it touches everything, the factory, the inventory, you can imagine all of the
touch points. So it's a fair question. I don't think we are at risk of over proliferating with the innovation we have,
because we have a discipline to bring the overall numbers down year upon year.

And we'll take our next question from Joe Altobello with Raymond James.
<Q - Joseph Nicholas Altobello>: Thank you. Good morning. Hey, guys. I guess I just want to go back to gross
margin for a second and the 75 bps to 125 bps expansion outlook for this year. That seems to be your evergreen target.
I was looking at my model and if it's right, you guys haven't done that since 2009. So it's been a while and I understand
there's been a lot of external factors that have kind of cropped up here. But how much confidence do you have in that?
And I guess how do we think about raw materials ex- the transactional impact of currency in that? And how do we
think about the exclusion of Venezuela in terms of the dynamics of that gross margin expansion? Thanks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yes. Well, how you think about it, I mean first of all, there is no one more keenly aware of our
gross margin plateau than us, number one. Number two, when we think about it, again, as I mentioned a little bit
earlier, from that transaction point of view, although foreign exchange continues to be a negative, it is less of a negative
than what we endured in 2015. Now, of course, that improvement builds over the year, but still overall it is less
negative. As I also mentioned earlier, underlying commodity costs with oil even at $35, are basically flat to modestly
down. That's a favorable.
Third, we have the funding-the-growth program that we have had every year and we track through quarter by quarter
and you will see the history and you now know the history for 2015. And that's our goal and objective for 2016. And as
I said, we have pricing lesser than last year, but – and of which 50% is rollover. Now, Venezuela clearly adds a benefit
to gross margin, but I would say that we definitely feel that 2016 is the year we need to raise our gross margin and the
proof will be in the pudding when we talk next at the end of the first quarter. Everything that we know we feel
confident about that.

And we'll take our next question from Caroline Levy, I'm sorry, Levy, with CLSA.
<Q - Caroline S. Levy>: Thank you so much. Hi, Bina and Ian. Ian, just a more general commentary, if you wouldn't
mind walking around a couple of big markets, China, Brazil, Mexico, Russia, just the state of the consumer. I mean,
from where we sit sometimes things can sound really dire. But what you're hearing from your country leaders and
people on the ground about the consumer sentiment? And is it significantly worse in any one of those areas than in
another?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Well, it is difficult to find anybody with anything optimistic to say about much of anything these
days. Without being overly general, I would say that the underlying consumer sentiment and behavior in China and
India is okay. I would say that the underlying consumer sentiment in Mexico is okay. I would say that the underlying
consumer sentiment in Russia is not great, and that would be English understatement. And I would say in Brazil, the
underlying sentiment in Brazil is not great.
And we have said before, but again, our objective is to grow market share for our brands in those environments. I think
we have said before that we think Brazil is not an overnight fix and we will stay the course. But again, if you take this
generalized view, I think there are still more of the emerging countries where the underlying consumer sentiment is
okay. Russia and Brazil would not be in that group in 2015, and we don't believe in 2016 either. And although it's a
smaller part of our business, that would also apply to some of the African companies – countries, but they are smaller.

<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hey, Bill.
<Q - William B. Chappell>: Just a follow-up. Could you quantify what the organic growth was last year
ex-Venezuela? And then the other question, on share repurchase, I'm not sure if you commented on that, on what it was
in the quarter, but is there any thoughts with kind of the stock where it's been? In the past, you've certainly used
opportunities to step up and use a little more cash. Is that a thought right now?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Okay. The answer on Venezuela is a polite no. So I repeat, we delivered 5% organic growth in the
fourth quarter and in 2015, and we are guiding that we will deliver the same organic growth range between 4% and 7%
excluding Venezuela in 2016.
As we think about share repurchases, obviously one has to be thoughtful about capital structure in the environment
we're in given the foreign exchange impact on cash profit. And as we have gone through our capital structure right
now, and we have not made this decision yet, but I think it would be fair to say as a company that we have been for,
since 1895 I think, committed to paying a dividend and have increased it for the last 50 plus years. So that's a decision
yet to be made, but that is obviously a use of cash. So is capital expenditure, which is very focused on supporting our
Global Growth and Efficiency Program, and then we turn to share buyback. Right now, our capital structure would say
our gross share buyback for this year would be in the $1 billion to $1.3 billion range.

And we'll take our next question from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.
<Q - Lauren Rae Lieberman>: Great. Thanks. I would never chide you, Ian, first of all.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: I did it already.
<Q - Lauren Rae Lieberman>: I had a question on Europe. I think when I had spent some time with [indiscernible]
(52:56) middle of last year, we talked quite a bit about premium innovation, and it struck me as a sort of newer
direction, a different way of dealing with the longstanding deflationary environment in Europe. So if you could talk a
little bit about how that – those efforts are going on, premium innovation, is this a strategy you're thinking about taking
in a more significant way into other markets? That would be really helpful. Thank you.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yeah. Well, it is well underway. As we went through our 2016 budget program, I think you may
have had a sneak peek on stuff we hadn't yet seen here, but that is very much underpinning the European plan for 2016,
and some of those products are moving into the marketplace, as Bina mentioned, as we speak right now. And it would
be fair to say that depending on the market, depending on the condition of the consumer, that is a model that is under
serious study and indeed has already been adopted in certain parts of the world. But to the extent that it can be
deployed, you should expect that it will be.

with the restructuring savings ending in 2016, whether financially will be of interest as well as a means to generate
savings. Thank you.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Well, first of all, I'm tempted to comment on the British press, Javier.
<Q - Javier Escalante>: Okay. I understand. But what about Glaxo consumer? Is it something that – is it kind of – I
know that you're very choicy and very financially disciplined, but do you think that this is something that is – that it
would be of interest to Colgate to consider?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: The only proper answer to that question is that we don't comment on market speculation and
rumor. Or the British press.

And our final question comes from John Faucher with JPMorgan.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Thank you very much. Two questions here. The first is a lot more discussion about the local
brands and things like that, yet as you said, your market shares are generally increasing. Can you talk about what
you've seen from them from a transactional pricing standpoint?
And then the second question, Ian, is probably, it's a little bit of a devil's advocate question, and probably not one
you're expecting, which is when you talked about having the flexibility of sort of the touch points, right, advertising
versus trade and in-store, what have you, and given that dialogue you've had over the last 6 months to 12 months,
wouldn't that argue that longer term that the gross margin expansion which we've been looking for is less relevant,
right? It seems as though if you have that marketing mix flexibility, it should be about the operating margin, not the
gross margin. So I guess sort of putting it back into your court in that regard, doesn't the gross margin lose some of its
importance over time if you're moving these buckets around more? Thanks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: So, let me answer the question on the local brands' pricing. I guess, for those materials that are
dollar denominated, they face the same pressures that we do, and many of these local brands are not classic cheapies.
They are reasonably well-priced products. I must say I can't give you a chapter and verse review on have they
mimicked the pricing we have, but we certainly haven't seen them going the other way. So either they are premium in
many cases and they've stayed there or I think I could say that they will have moved their pricing. We haven't seen
them trying to go the other way.
On the marketing mix comment, I would be careful to argue about the flexibility. I think what it gives us is against the
objectives we have for a brand or an innovation or against a particular consumer, what is the best way to think about all
of the touch points we have in terms of reaching them? I made the comment on the last call that over half of moms
today in Latin America are millennials; that Facebook and YouTube are enormous connection points for that
community. So that's a great place to go to touch those kinds of consumers.
And I think personally, gross margin remains as important because what you're trying to do there, I think, is to create
value in a product that the consumer sees and is prepared to pay for, back to Lauren's point about premium innovation,
and it's off that fulcrum everything else comes. Because otherwise from an operating point of view, you're only leaving
yourself really leverage overhead and advertising to deal with. So I think a gross margin focus should be an unremitting
focus in a consumer products company in our types of businesses.
Ian M. Cook
Okay. Well, I am pleased and surprised, pleasantly, by the duration of the call. Thank you for all of the questions and
we look forward to keeping you updated as the year unfolds. Thank you very much.
