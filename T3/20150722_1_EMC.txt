Joseph M. Tucci
Thank you, Tony. I would like to begin by welcoming everyone to our Q2 earnings call.
From my perspective, our results in Q2 were mixed. I am pleased to report that we met our EPS target. However, we
did fall a bit short of our revenue expectations. For the record, revenue was $6.1 billion and EPS was $0.43. And once
again, we faced a very back-end loaded quarter.
I am very pleased that in the quarter the six growth initiatives which we reviewed with you at our recent strategic forum
continued to grow at accelerated rates. XtremIO, ViPR-ECS-ScaleIO, NSX, and AirWatch all experienced very strong
growth. Pivotal had an outstanding quarter, with product bookings up triple digits. And DSSD is receiving as much
customer interest as any product we have ever introduced. In fact, demand for beta systems was off the charts.
That said, we continue to see declines in our traditional storage products, as customers are becoming more conservative
around refreshing their traditional infrastructures as they plan their IT transformation and roll out their digital agenda.
The good news here is that we are holding our technology footprint in these accounts. We also experienced continued
pressure on our businesses in China and Russia, largely due to geopolitical issues. All these factors impacted our top
line results. I will leave it up to Zane and David to take you through the details of Q2. However, I would like to give
you my perspective on what's happening in our markets and its impact on EMC.
Our customers are now focused on and investing in digital transformation in their journey to the hybrid cloud. As a
result, we see them changing their traditional operating models and buying patterns. To fund these new initiatives,
customers are reducing costs on their platform two applications and infrastructures. This is creating a just-in-time,
just-enough buying process. This effect is continuing to manifest itself in very back-end loaded quarters.
We expect these buying patterns to continue in the near term. And despite our new businesses ramping very nicely, we
believe it is prudent to reduce our full-year forecast by $400 million. We now expect 2015 revenue to be $25.3 billion,
and we expect non-GAAP EPS to be $1.87 for the year. And while we are disappointed that we are reducing our
expectations for the year, we remain confident in our strategy, and we believe we can and will do better.
To help ensure we improve our performance, we are going to execute on our growth strategy, reduce our cost base, and
take additional steps to manage the trends in our traditional Storage business. We are implementing significant actions
in each company and across the Federation to drive greater operating leverage, additional synergies, and increased
customer relevance.
On the cost front, we have launched a program to reduce our existing cost base by $850 million annually, with run rate
savings achieved by the end of 2016. As these cost efficiencies materialize, we will reinvest some portion of these
savings to further strengthen our growth agenda.
On the strategic front, we and the EMC Federation of companies have a tremendous opportunity in front of us, namely
to become the most trusted partner to our current and prospective customers as they embark on their digital
transformation and hybrid cloud journeys. Our customers consistently tell us that they believe in our vision, that they
derive significant value from our collective Federation offerings. We are helping them to deliver outstanding results
through our broad and deep products, services, and solutions portfolios.

The IT market opportunity to assist customers with their digital transformation and their move to hybrid cloud
computing is massive. Market research firms estimate that the third-party managed and hosted cloud market will grow
at more than 30% per year and reach $124 billion by 2020. And these estimates do not include the rapid growth of
customers managing their own private clouds.
While estimates for digital transformation vary greatly, they all point to a multi-hundred billion dollar market by 2020,
which will have an even faster growth rate than the hybrid cloud market. These are the high-growth markets we are
squarely focused on and will continue to invest in heavily.
To capture these opportunities, we are aligning our businesses even more tightly, especially EMC II and VMware.
Together we have video developed a market/growth strategy that has four main pillars. Pillar one is anchored in our
best-in-class products and solutions that are and/or will be offered as a service.
For instance, EMC II provides the broadest range of storage, data protection, and converged infrastructure capabilities
for the hybrid cloud covering all classes of data and price points. VMware provides modern software-defined
infrastructure capabilities for the hybrid cloud and management of mobile devices. Pivotal has an increasing number of
deep digital transformation engagements with major companies to enable them to do modern agile digital product
development and do so on a modern open cloud apps and data program. RSA is increasingly focused on their rapidly
growing security analytics and next-generation identity solutions, as well as extending their market leadership in
governance, risk, and compliance.
Pillar two is our expanded focus on cloud services for both on and off-premise implementations. As part of this pillar,
we are pleased the Virtustream acquisition has now closed and are thrilled to have Rodney [Rogers], Kevin [Reid], and
the entire Virtustream team as an integral and important part of the family. They are key elements of our growth
agenda.
As we indicated when we announced this acquisition, Virtustream will be a Federation asset. It brings us unique
capabilities in the area of mission-critical workloads such as SAP. One of our most important partnerships is with SAP,
and I'm pleased to say that Virtustream has just signed an agreement with SAP to become a premier global provider of
SAP HANA enterprise cloud services. We will provide you a comprehensive update on our cloud services strategy later
this quarter.
Pillar three is a better coordinated go-to-market approach, including the formation of a Federation-level go-to-market
organization. We have consistently heard from many of our largest customers that they desire a more aligned offering
across our sales forces. They want fewer but highly trusted partners to take them on their journey to the digital cloud
future. Beyond our largest customers, we are accelerating account level planning and bringing a coordinated message
and offerings to the market.
Pillar four, our most important pillar, is all about our stellar leadership team and the extremely talented people we have
across the globe, which I have the distinct pleasure to work with every day. They are smart, dedicated, and are now
working even closer to together with a laser focus on the success of our customers. Importantly, we know that when
EMC and VMware work closely together and both have a significant presence in the account, the business volume for
VMware and EMC respectively almost doubles compared with accounts where only one company has a strong
presence.
Collectively, these four pillars of our market agenda will allow us to better serve our customers, improve
competitiveness, increase satisfaction, and drive our overall revenue and growth rate.
And finally and very importantly, the board is working closely with management to help ensure our market leadership
in the next generation of technology. The board is also deeply engaged in the smart navigation of the CEO succession
process, and we are very focused on opportunities that will enhance shareholder value.
Now I will turn the call over to Zane to take you through the numbers and then David to walk you through EMC II's
results for the quarter. Zane, it's all yours.

Zane C. Rowe
Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone.
First off, I want to thank the entire team for their efforts in helping deliver our results this quarter. There are a few areas
I will elaborate on within my prepared remarks. We're becoming a more strategic and relevant partner as our customers
are increasingly asking us to deliver solutions that span across all of our businesses. We're also seeing success in the
growth areas of our portfolio where we have been investing for some time. These businesses are performing well and
meeting our expectations. However, we are continuing to see pressure in parts of our traditional storage categories like
high-end and unified. We're initiating a significant cost reduction and business transformation effort that will reduce
our expenses, make us more efficient, and improve how we operate our business.
Our Q2 consolidated revenue totaled $6.1 billion, up 3% year over year and up 8% on a constant currency basis. EPS
was $0.43.
Looking across our three primary businesses, EMC Information Infrastructure revenue grew 1% year over year.
VMware increased 10%, and Pivotal increased 18%. Consolidated revenue growth in the Americas was up 9% year
over year. EMEA was down 3% and was impacted by FX. On a constant currency basis, EMEA was up 8%. APJ was
down 1%, up 5% constant currency. And Latin America was down 15% as reported and down 4% in constant currency.
The transformation of EMC's business has required significant resources over the last number of years. We have built
and bought some of the best assets and technology and have created a leading portfolio of products and solutions. The
performance of businesses such as XtremIO, AirWatch, and Pivotal is growing evidence of the progress of EMC's
transformation. We are confident that we will continue to see success across our new growth initiatives as businesses
develop their IT agendas.
As Joe mentioned, engagements with customers involving transformational change are growing. As customers begin
the steps towards their digital transformation and develop their digital agendas, the more transactional spend in
traditional storage like high-end and unified remain under pressure, as many customers are purchasing these product
categories primarily to cover short-term needs. This phenomenon is having an extended impact across our enterprise
customer base. As a result, we are reducing our revenue outlook for 2015 to $25.3 billion. We are, however, pleased
with the progress we're making in the growth businesses, which are forecast to meet their revenue goals for the year.
We have been disciplined in our approach to developing parts of the portfolio that will deliver long-term growth and
shareholder value. To do so, we've been actively rebalancing resources from traditional businesses to growth
businesses. While we've been reducing costs across our mature businesses, much of that benefit has been masked by
the investments we've also been making in our growth areas. I've mentioned previously that we've been examining all
parts of the business to control expenses on both the COGS and OpEx lines. However, the continued pressure in
traditional storage is changing the equilibrium of this model. As a result, we are initiating a cost reduction and business
transformation program to better align our expenses and improve our operations.
While we've been working to make our model more efficient, this program to reduce our current annual cost base by
$850 million will enable us to achieve positive change at a faster pace. Tough decisions will need to be made, but this
will help ensure all parts of our business have a return profile that helps us achieve our collective strategic and
operational goals.
The near-term financial impact is tied to tighter spending controls and some reduction in positions. Additional savings
from this program will be achieved through business transformation, including operational process redesign,
organizational realignment, and portfolio streamlining. We will begin to see the impact of the program in the fourth
quarter of this year with a reduction in our existing cost base of $50 million, which is reflected in our EPS outlook of
$1.87 for 2015.
In 2016, the structural improvements we plan to put in place throughout the year are targeted to result in us exiting
2016 with an operating model poised to deliver the $850 million in savings. For your modeling purposes, we are
targeting a Q4 2016 expense reduction of between $125 million and $175 million net of the associated ongoing funding

of the program itself. We will provide you with the information on the related charge and head count reductions when
finalized and additional details of the program as we roll it out over the upcoming year. We have not included any
associated charges or free cash flow impacts in our outlook for this year.
As Joe mentioned, we will invest a portion of these savings in our growth agenda to bring out new solutions and
products and drive additional Federation success. We believe that our ongoing portfolio management efforts combined
with these optimization actions will help us stay ahead of the market shifts while setting a solid foundation for the
future. Ultimately, this transformation will allow us to drive growth, better serve our customers, shareholders, and
employees.
As the industry and companies are working through the transformation in IT, we have developed a federated approach
that helps customers with their biggest challenges, positions all of our businesses more strategically, and represents a
strong competitive differentiator. We're also putting into place a go-to-market organization entirely focused on working
with our largest customers on a cross-Federation basis to better deliver value and drive growth for the business.
Changes here include the creation of Federation-level bid teams, account management, and ordering capability,
designed to help customers get more value from our offerings.
Customers are increasingly looking to transform their businesses to become more agile. They are looking to leverage
new capabilities and approaches to be delivered as comprehensive solutions versus putting individual technology
products together themselves. We more than ever before are selling a number of solutions comprised of tightly
integrated capabilities from across our Federation of businesses. Examples include custom business transformation
engagements and pre-engineered solutions such as enterprise hybrid cloud, Data Lakes, and security analytics. We now
have a more strategic level of engagement than we would if each of the various businesses were engaging with the
customers independently.
A Q2 example of cross-Federation strategic relevance is our relationship with a major U.S. insurance company. This
was initially a services-led engagement focused on helping the customer support a new application environment. It
began with an enterprise hybrid cloud deployed upon Vblocks. This EHC infrastructure supported Cloud Foundry paths
for a new critical application that was developed by Pivotal Labs. With the success of this engagement, we're now
adding data protection capabilities to the same foundation. This was a broad Federation opportunity, including
XtremIO, Vblocks, VMware technologies, ViPR, PCS, Pivotal Labs, VPLEX, VMAX, and Data Domain, brought
together in one solution. Our ability to help customers in this way differentiates us from the competition. It's likely that
we wouldn't have had this opportunity without the close integration across our businesses.
Another aspect of our capability is how we're helping customers move to the cloud. We've seen success with our public
cloud offering, vCloud Air, complementing our on-premise private cloud. With the recently completed acquisition of
Virtustream, we will now augment that with a leading position in cloud services for mission-critical workloads,
including SAP. Our hybrid cloud portfolio now spans the entire spectrum of customer cloud requirements, from
on-prem private to managed off-prem to public clouds.
Enterprises and service providers are looking for simpler infrastructure deployment models as they scale their cloud
capabilities. Given the well known benefit of converged infrastructure, it is a rapidly growing opportunity, as more
customers turn to this model. In fact, a recent survey of 150 CIOs conducted by a large investment bank showed that
71% of those surveyed expect to adopt converged infrastructure within the next three years. Even more telling, the
same group says that CI's share of data center spend will increase by a third by the end of 2016. EMC has been ahead
of this trend with our VCE business and is very well positioned as CI becomes a bigger piece of the spending pie. We
continue to show good success in CI, as demonstrated by the greater than 30% growth in Vblock and related revenue in
Q2.
We have also been broadening out our offering in the CI space to better address a variety of customer needs. David will
address the broader CI strategy and the integration of VCE in a few minutes.
With the strength of some of the best IT professionals in the business, we have developed an incredibly strong
technology and product portfolio. Over the course of the last few quarters, we have highlighted six of our growth

opportunities, including Pivotal, AirWatch, NSX, XtremIO and our software-defined storage offering, and DSSD.
While they have required a sizable investment, they also offer significant growth opportunity through our federated
approach. Importantly, we continue to see meaningful results collectively from these six, and we're on track to reach
our $2 billion revenue outlook for 2015.
Turning to Pivotal, revenue was up 18% year over year. With much of Pivotal's business being a subscription model,
revenue is not the clearest measure of progress. A common way to measure the growth of subscription businesses is via
annual recurring revenue, also known as ARR. And in Q2 Pivotal ARR was $60 million, up almost 60% quarter to
quarter. Pivotal's mission is to accelerate how companies lean into their digital future. In order to do that, enterprise
customers need to transform how they build software on an open cloud native platform.
Pivotal's cloud native platform, Pivotal Cloud Foundry, enables developers to deliver next-generation applications and
user experiences as well as transform existing applications to operate with greater speed at lower cost. Given the
performance so far, we are confident that PCS is on track to become the industry's leading open cloud native platform.
Pivotal Labs, the agile software development business, has been credited with helping shape the development culture of
Silicon Valley's most influential and valuable companies. When you couple our open cloud native and analytics
platforms with our unique approach to software development, it explains why Pivotal is sought out by the world's
largest enterprises. As a result, we are highly confident in Pivotal's evolution as a high-growth business marked by our
ability to help large enterprises in their digital transformation journey.
We're starting to see certain vertical markets with a greater urgency to become digital as the competitive dynamics in
those markets are driving the need for rapid change. An early example is in the automotive sector, where Pivotal works
with three of the top five global automotive manufacturers. The change in this vertical is driven by new digital
companies pressuring the incumbents on product, on business model, and on experience, all using software.
Another vertical is financial services, where Pivotal works with three of the top five North American financial services
institutions. The existing businesses are changing their models due to the emergence of a number of successful
financial services alternatives, all using software to compete in providing a better product, business model, and
experience.
We believe Pivotal is now in the strongest position in its two-year history. We have the right subscription-based model,
the right modern cloud native and analytics platforms, and the right software development services capabilities. Pivotal
is uniquely qualified to help the world's largest enterprises successfully transform into great software companies.
VMware had another solid quarter, with license bookings beyond standalone vSphere greater than 60% of total license
bookings, up from more than 50% year over year. This helped drive revenue growth of 10% year over year, 13% in
constant currency. VMware continues to diversify its businesses through expanding its portfolio of products for
enabling the software-defined enterprise.
Both AirWatch and NSX are continuing their positive momentum. AirWatch license bookings were up 60% year over
year on a constant currency basis, and it continues to be the clear leader in enterprise mobility management. NSX is
also doing well, with first half license bookings almost doubling versus the first half last year. NSX proofs of concept
accelerate every quarter, and in Q2 the number of customers increased over 700% year over year (sic) [increased to
over 700 from a year ago].
Another example of the value of our cross-Federation capabilities across VMware, Pivotal, and EMC II is a recent win
at a large German industrial company. This customer was looking for an automated cloud solution to run third-platform
apps and enable their Internet of Things initiative. We were able to bring them a cohesive, fully-integrated solution,
including VMware SDDC, Pivotal Cloud Foundry, enterprise hybrid cloud, and ViPR. We were able to help them with
a step in their digital transformation and won the strategic deal due to the Federation approach and best-in-class
technology stack.
While David will provide more color on the Storage business, I will point out a few highlights with regard to the three
storage-related growth opportunities. As I noted earlier, XtremIO had another great quarter, with year-over-year

revenue growth exceeding 300%. And as the clear market segment leader, it has certainly been a big success. Our
software-defined storage offering, including ViPR, ScaleIO, and ECS, is continuing to gain traction with customers,
including ViPR controller revenue growing triple digits over last year. And there's also great interest in ScaleIO, with
over 6,000 downloads in Q2. Very positive early reaction from customers regarding DSSD is encouraging as we head
toward general availability later this year. And within RSA, the combination of security analytics, next-generation
identity management, and GRC revenue was up double digit.
Q2 consolidated gross profit was flat year over year. And within this, EMC II gross profit was down 4%. In order to
give you a more comparable view of gross profit performance, adjusting for FX and VCE, EMC II gross profit grew
slightly year over year. Consolidated operating profit declined 11% year over year, and EMC II operating profit was
down 21%. Both results were impacted by the inclusion of VCE and FX fluctuation. Adjusting for VCE and FX, EMC
II operating profit was up year over year. On a reported basis, the decline in operating profit impacted EPS by $0.06.
Other income improved year over year. The largest portion of this benefit was the elimination of VCE expense from
this line versus last year. The net benefit to year over year EPS was $0.04. Lower share count helped EPS by $0.02
versus last year as a result of our ongoing buyback program.
A few comments on the balance sheet and cash flow; EMC consolidated cash and investments in Q2 was $14.8 billion,
$2.5 billion of which is EMC ex-VMware domestic cash. Short-term debt totaled $1.9 billion, and we've been
accessing the commercial paper markets during the quarter. We expect to complete our $3 billion share repurchase plan
for the year and have repurchased $2 billion through the first half of this year. Free cash flow in the quarter was $647
million. This was impacted by VMware's GSA payment in the quarter. For 2015, we expect free cash flow to be $4
billion, a $100 million reduction from prior expectations as a result of the change in our outlook.
In summary, the Federation approach is working well, as EMC is becoming an increasingly strategic partner with
customers as they contemplate their digital agendas. Our focus on solutions, converged infrastructure, and best-in-breed
products is strengthening our position and delivering portfolio growth. We have initiated a program to reduce our
existing expense base by $850 million. And while this will necessitate the need to make some tough decisions, it will
strengthen the company, allow us to continue to invest in and grow the business, enhance our position as a technology
leader, and generate shareholder value. We are focused on the right opportunities. We have the best people, the
strongest portfolio, and an improving operational structure to support the business.
With that, I'll turn the call over to David. David?
David I. Goulden
Thanks, Zane. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us today.
I'd like to start by thanking the entire EMC II team for continuing to execute well in an IT market that is changing
rapidly. We have a very strong and growing portfolio that we continue to leverage very effectively to create new and
differentiated outcomes and strong ROI for our customers. This morning, I will focus my comments on the storage and
converged infrastructure elements of the EMC II portfolio.
Overall storage revenue grew 1% this quarter and was up 6% in constant currency. Within this, emerging storage grew
49%, led by XtremIO, Isilon, and software-defined storage. XtremIO had its biggest bookings quarter ever and is on
track to achieve well over $1 billion in bookings this year, while Isilon continues its strong traction in big data analytics
running Hadoop workloads. VRS improved in Q2, helped by the launch of the new high-end Data Domain system. Our
high-end and unified businesses continue to see pressure, as Joe and Zane mentioned earlier.
So let me give you some more color on what we see as happening within the storage markets. As enterprises continue
their secular shift to the new digital age, defined by cloud, mobile, social, and big data, we now expect the overall
external storage market to grow at a 2% to 3% CAGR from 2014 to 2018. Within this, we expect new storage
technologies like flash, converged infrastructure, and software-defined storage to grow at a high teens CAGR from
2014 to 2018, while standalone traditional storage systems are expected to decline at low teens CAGR.

We also believe that most enterprises and organizations will adopt a hybrid cloud approach to drive their IT
transformation, incorporating both traditional and newer storage architectures. A hybrid cloud combines the benefits of
both private and public clouds to allow not only a smoother self-paced transformation for existing applications but also
a platform for building and running new applications. And as you would expect, enterprises are in various stages of
their IT transformation.
Customers who have not yet embarked on transformational initiatives are very cautious about their transactional
spending, while those who have made transformational decisions are spending aggressively on these new initiatives but
also remaining very disciplined about their transactional spending. Transformational initiatives are not just about
hybrid cloud and new digital applications. They can also include infrastructure transformation via converged
infrastructure and storage transformations via flash, storage tiering, software-defined and software-managed
architectures.
As transactional spending remains cautious, we now believe that the traditional storage market will not improve this
year. Therefore, while our expectations for growth and overall mix in the storage market for the long term have not
changed materially, the overall storage market will grow less than the 2014 to 2018 CAGR this year. Beyond 2015, we
expect overall storage growth to improve due to favorable mix shifts towards new applications and IT transformations.
Given our revised expectations for the storage market, we do not expect the pressure on our traditional Storage
business, primarily VMAX and VNX, to ease this year. As a result, we now expect our Storage business to grow at 1%
this year. Excluding both help in consolidating VCE and hurt from FX, storage growth is also expected to be 1%
As the storage market continues to transition, we have been working actively to evolve our storage portfolio towards
flash, software-defined storage, big data, and cloud to remain ahead of the markets. We align our internal operations
and go-to-market to adapt to the changing market by forming our Core Technology division and Emerging Technology
division last year and by consolidating VCE into EMC II, and to optimize our cost structure within EMC II by
continuing to rebalance our resources to self-fund our growth initiatives.
As Zane mentioned, we are initiating a new cost reduction program to accelerate our efforts to optimize our business.
As the largest part of the Federation, the majority of this program will be focused upon EMC II. This new cost
transformation program consists of traditional cost reduction initiatives that focus on areas like indirect procurement,
facilities, contingent labor, standard control, and managing product life cycle investments in traditional storage and
business transformation initiatives focused on areas including product design through operations enhancements, direct
in cost of goods sold spending reductions, simplification, [CSAT] optimization, and quote-to-order-to-cash digitization.
We already have teams working on each of these and expect approximately equal savings from both the traditional cost
savings initiatives and the business transformation initiatives.
As our customers become even more focused on outcomes and work with fewer, more strategic vendors, the traction
we're getting with our larger customers is very encouraging. Today I will share just a few of those customer wins with
you that focus upon multimillion dollar transformational deals using our Federation solutions like enterprise hybrid
cloud and the recently announced business Data Lake solution.
One of Europe's largest financial institutions wants to build out their private cloud platform and move their existing
mobile applications from two of the largest public clouds to their own platform. They chose to build out their cloud
platform using the Federation EHC solution and run it on Vblocks. EMC won this deal over one of our largest global
competitors not only because we had the best technical solution, but also because EMC was the only vendor who could
meet this customer's business-critical timeline.
When a large South Asian bank needed to migrate to a cloud-based data center and improve their IT agility and process
management, they turned to EMC over some of the world's largest IT providers due to the completeness of our
Federation offerings. The customer embraced EMC's Federation's vision of enterprise hybrid cloud for infrastructure,
Pivotal PaaS for application management, and EMC ViPR for automated storage management.

A large U.S.-based non-profit healthcare provider chose to deploy the Federation business Data Lake solution to build
out a foundation for population health analytics. After attending our Big Data Vision Workshop, the organization
decided to partner with EMC instead of using a do-it-yourself approach. EMC won their business by helping them plan
their execution model for the integration of the Data Lake and supporting technologies.
As you know, converged infrastructure continues to be not only the major building block of our Federation solutions,
but also increasingly a primary way that customers are deploying infrastructure to support their existing and new
workloads. Since we consolidated VCE within EMC II at the start of the year, we've been broadening out our offerings
in the CI space to better address a variety of customer needs. For the more traditional business-critical workloads, we
continue to expand our CI block portfolio with the introduction of Vblocks. For the newer workloads that are more
suited to hyper-converged and software-defined infrastructures, we're rapidly building out our rack and appliance CI
portfolio with the launch of VxRack and VSPEX BLUE respectively. The launch of VxRack at EMC World was very
well received, and we look forward to starting shipments of this new class of CI system later this quarter.
The ability to leverage our capabilities across the Federation, including VMware and Pivotal, is an important
competitive advantage that enables EMC not only to offer market-leading converged infrastructure, but also to provide
the solutions based upon CI that our customers increasingly value.
Now turning to storage and product highlights, we are very pleased with the emerging storage growth this quarter,
where Isilon, XtremIO, and our software-defined storage portfolio that includes ViPR, ECS, and ScaleIO continues to
do very well and expand our total addressable market by adding both net new customers and net new workloads. The
emerging storage is now at nearly $3 billion revenue run rate, and we expect this bucket to grow more than 30% for
this year. And our market share in most emerging storage categories continues to be much higher than our market share
in traditional external storage.
At the same time, both high-end and unified continue to be the leading products in their prospective markets where the
bulk of the storage spending occurs today, and we are very focused upon maintaining our lead here. The installed base
for both products remains a positive, with a stable VMAX base and VNX winning almost 1,500 new-to-EMC
customers this quarter. VMAX and VNX continue to expand and install flash capacity very nicely, and both improved
their Net Promoter Scores significantly this quarter.
As Joe mentioned, we are taking additional steps to manage trends in our traditional Storage business. These include
go-to-market activities such as enhanced refresh programs in our own install base as well as competitive displacement
programs and simplifying our traditional portfolio with fewer components and fewer SKUs.
As we look forward to the rest of the year, we are excited about the new products that we've already announced such as
VxRack, new high-end Data Domain, XtremIO 4.0, ECS 2.0, and FAST.X for VMAX, and expect them to start
contributing more meaningfully moving forward. And we have a great set of announcements lined up in the second
half, such as new Isilon systems and DSSD, to name only two.
In summary, we still expect our Storage business to grow in 2015 both reported and ex-FX and VCE. The new
businesses are performing exceptionally well, and we're getting more aggressive with programs, refreshes, and costs in
our traditional businesses. Going forward, the favorable mix towards new applications and transformational spend will
help us do better beyond 2015.
With that, I'll turn it over to Tony for Q&A. Tony?

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question or comment
comes from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
<Q - Amit Daryanani>: Thanks a lot. Good morning, guys. Joe, you talked about at the end of your comments about
the board being deeply engaged about the succession process and looking to enhance shareholder value. Can you just
talk about what's the timeline you think for the board to reach a conclusion for both these things? And what are the
range of options you guys are possibly looking at to enhance shareholder value beyond the restructuring initiative you
talked about? Thank you.
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: Hi, Amit. How are you? I really don't want to comment on time. I used the word smartly
actively navigating the process. And I have said point blank I am very committed, love this company, and we'll give the
board the time they need to properly make sure the navigation and succession process works terrifically. So I don't
want to put a deadline on the board, but they are actively engaged, let me put it that way.
On your second point, look, I'm not going to tell you exactly everything, but let me do it this way. The board and
management, we understand that the IT industry is in the midst of a sea change, a huge sea change. We understand that
business as usual is rarely a good strategy when an industry is going through this kind of turbulence. The companies
that will be successful are the ones that are able to truly transform themselves. The board and management, we're
focused on assuring that – and we are deeply engaged in making sure we have a very successful transformation.
We have a number of options, really good options, and we have important next-generation winning technologies, great
assets, and we have great people. So we are on it. And I think you're seeing that in addition to smartly navigating the IT
landscape now, we are also really seriously addressing our costs here to make sure that as we go through this
transformation – and you look at the rates that our new assets are growing, it is incredibly impressive. We have great
assets around digital transformation, hybrid cloud, security analytics, next-generation PaaS, mobile device
management, security, and I could go on. So basically, we're in a good position.
We're one of the few companies of our age, born when we were born mostly in the client/server era, that is producing
quarter after quarter of top line growth, albeit not as fast as it was. This quarter was 3% year on year. When you
compare us to our peers, I think we're going through this inflection point. And as David said, I do believe that 2015 is
the trough and that you'll see improvement as we go through. So those are all the things. That's a stream of
consciousness I just went through. I know I didn't specifically answer exactly what you want. You want the when, the
what. But I just wanted to give you some of the vast opportunities we have and the resolve that we have to not only
continue to drive our top line but basically our bottom line, and go through this transformation, and very importantly,
produce shareholder value.
<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: Thanks, Amit. Next question, please.

Thank you. Our next question is from Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
<Q - Ittai Kidron>: Thanks. I guess it was good to hear that finally you're taking a little bit more aggressive cost
cutting initiatives. But going back to the commentary, Joe, on what you've started to see as far as enterprises starting to
slow down spending and some of the geopolitical factors, the one element that is missing out of this whole discussion is
the competitive front. Can you give us a little bit more color on what you're seeing on that competitive side? Maybe,
David, you can comment on that as well. We are seeing a lot of new flash-based vendors out there growing quite
strongly. We're seeing new hyper-converged vendors being extremely successful in the marketplace and, in some cases,

displacing you from real big competitors for customers. I'm just trying to gauge how much of the competitive element
is a part of an issue here, and I was just a little bit surprised not to hear almost anything about that during the
discussion.
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: It's really interesting, Ittai. If you looked at what we're doing in each one of those categories,
we're clearly a leader. If you looked at – and David should do this, not me. But if you look at XtremIO versus all the
other flash players, significantly bigger, significantly faster growth. We didn't even release DSSD yet, but I can tell you
I have never seen a product for the demand for betas and the excitement around DSSD. So when you look at the
all-flash space, we're in phenomenal shape.
If you look at hyper-converged and what we're doing with VC, what we're doing with VSPEX BLUE, VSPEX BLUE is
early days. Most of these hyper-converged work on VMware infrastructures. And again, we have a great opportunity
there, and I could go on and on. So it's just they make a lot of noise, they make a lot of hype, but we have great, great
answers. And basically, this is a world event. When I work with customers, they've got a lot of traditional apps which
they love the services on products like VMAX. So it's how do you sell VMAX and – and/or. So we've got great options
for customers where most of those little competitors make a lot of noise but it's basically one size fits all. David, do you
want to add to that?
<A - David I. Goulden>: I think I'll just add couple of data points around it. As Joe said, we are the market leader in
all the growth areas of the industry as well as the traditional areas. The emerging storage bucket which we talk about is
at a $3 billion run rate, so probably bigger than all the stars put together plus some, last quarter growing close to 50%.
So we are winning in these areas.
And relative to footprint in our traditional business, in the markets that we are in, we believe that our footprint is
holding very, very nicely. Now obviously, we're in some markets that are more susceptible to spending pressure than
are other markets. And of course, there's always a trophy win, a trophy there that somebody can talk about. But when
we look at the overall footprint, including what goes in and what comes out, our footprint is very solid in our enterprise
customers and our global accounts. I mentioned a large number of net new-to-EMC customers last quarter alone with
the VNX family.
So obviously, as the industry has slowed, there is more competitive dynamic, but we feel very strong about how we're
doing in the new markets, and we've given you some good data points to feel comfortable that we are maintaining our
share, maintaining our footprint on an aggregate basis in our existing markets.
<Q - Ittai Kidron>: Very good, good luck.
<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: Thanks, Ittai. Next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question or comment is from Kulbinder Garcha from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Thanks. I just want to clarify one thing from maybe Zane. The comment on the cost
reduction, the $125 million to $175 million by the fourth quarter of 2016, are you saying that whatever the run rate is
today, we should just think that level of reduction by the end of next year? Is that what you're trying to communicate,
or is there further investment that would offset that drop into the bottom line?
And then just one question for Joe is, so far this year, my interpretation of events is that you seem to be much more
vocal about the need for the Federation to stay together. And if that is the case, because it sounds like you mentioned
those points about the extra revenue that comes to VMware and EMC from staying together, why not buy in VMware
and rationalize the entire cost base given that you're doing this cost reduction now anyhow? Is that something you've
considered?
What are the arguments against doing that? Any thoughts there would be helpful. Thanks.

<A - Zane C. Rowe>: Good morning, Kulbinder. I'll start and then I'll let Joe answer the question you directed towards
him. What we wanted to do is give you an articulation of what you can expect and the trend as we contemplate the cost
cutting over the next period of time through next year. So starting with an estimated $50 million in savings, which
would be net savings, those are savings net of the investments. So as you grow the $50 million to the $125 million to
$175 million over the course of the next year, we wanted to at least give you an approximation for that run rate on our
existing expense base. Beyond that, as Joe mentioned, as we recognize and realize some of those savings, we're always
looking for growth and for opportunities, and obviously we'd expect to invest some of that back into growth
opportunities. Joe, I'll let you take this.
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: Undoubtedly, everybody on this call believes deeply that one of the biggest transitions that
every company has to do is the move to the cloud. We talked about digital transformation, which I think is even a
bigger market. That's where the Internet of things and all of that falls in. But just take where we live in data centers, and
data centers are moving to cloud technologies, both private and managed. So obviously, if you were doing that, would
you rather do that as just VMware, as just EMC, as just Pivotal with their PaaS, or are you a lot stronger in front of a
customer doing it together?
So do I think we're much stronger? The answer is absolutely. So I think splitting this Federation or spinning off
VMware is not a good idea. I firmly believe that. I believe that we're better together, a lot better together. Just to give
you some statistics, I gave you one statistic. In an account, in a large global account where both EMC and VMware
have major presence, each one of us gets double – each one of those companies gets double the amount of revenue,
double. It's pretty impressive. We know there's over $1 billion in revenue synergies when you count through that, and
we think there's opportunity for well over another $1 billion if we do some of the things I talked to you about in getting
tighter aligned.
We know we've shared more than 4,000 people have moved across the companies. This helps attract and retain talent.
We know our win rates are higher when we go in together. So obviously, I'm committed. So basically you want, what
options are we going to do? I just referred to options. You'd like me to lay them all out now. I don't want to get in front
of the management team and working with the board, but we understand that when you're going through this kind of a
sea change, and the board recognizes it's a huge sea change in IT, business as usual is really rarely a good strategy. And
we're all about good strategies, transformation, and doing things right.
<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: Thanks, Kulbinder. Next question, please?
Operator
Our next question or comment is from Steve Milunovich from UBS. Your line is open.
<Q - Steven M. Milunovich>: Thank you. Just to follow up on that, Joe, on the cost side, you and I have both lived
through these transformations, and the traditional stuff tends to go down faster than you think. Have you guys been a
little late in recognizing the need to reduce costs, and are you convinced you're doing enough? And then on the other
side in terms of the Federation, will there be cultural issues? It sounds like you've started to work this, but VMware
historically has been a pretty separate company. Can you get the two companies really working together?
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: I'll start backwards. The answer is yes. VMware realizes what I just told you, that when we
both are big, when both sides of the company are in an account, both David's side, the EMC II side, the VMware side,
and now we're seeing more and more the Pivotal side, each get not only more revenue but double the amount of
revenue. And this is resonating well. Also, they see some of their former partners that are now standing up clouds, and
if you believe cloud is the future of the data center as I do and you look inside their clouds, they're basically using more
of their own technology.
So this does make sense to VMware. Pat [Gelsinger], Carl [Eschenbach], and Jonathan [Chadwick] and the VMware
leadership team are solidly behind this. That doesn't mean they're going to – we don't want to make, let them and
encourage them to still partner with others because I think having an open ecosystem is the future. But yes, they're

Are we late? Steve, in my whole life, anything I did, I never said wow, I should have, I'm glad I waited. I usually say if
I had a great idea, we should have done it earlier. But I don't want to say we're late. Would I wish we had done it a little
bit earlier? Probably, but we're here now and we're doing the right thing.
<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: Thank you, Steve. Next question, please?

Thank you. Our next question is from Alex Kurtz from Sterne, Agee. Your line is open.
<Q - Alex Kurtz>: Thanks, guys, for taking the question. David, you talked about double-digit declines for the legacy
products, at least in the market in general. As we look to reset our models here on VMAX and more importantly VNX,
which you really haven't spoken about in the last couple quarters at least, should we be thinking about double-digit
declines for both of those products for the next couple years as you guys transition to XtremIO and VxRack and some
of these new platforms?
<A - David I. Goulden>: Alex, without getting to specificity beyond this year, to give you a couple things to think
about, I think we started out the year thinking that the VMAX growth rates would be a little bit stronger than they were.
The rate of decline, to be more particular, would be a little bit less than last year. I think now we think they'll be in the
same zip code as last year. Bear in mind, though, there's a four to five point currency headwind in there, so really from
constant currency actually doing a little better.
And we do think that the VNX, again because of the move to cloud in some of the mid-tier and some of the competitive
pressures, will also be in a market declining growth rate. But they will get pickup as we move from a
transactional-oriented spend to a transformational-oriented spend. Because as people move towards the hybrid clouds,
it is a power of and, and moving existing applications and new applications into the hybrid cloud.
So we stand a chance beyond 2015 when the transformational spend picks up to actually see a bit of an uplift in those
platforms as the new applications and in particular the hybrid cloud spend becomes a bigger part of the overall budget.
So I think we do expect market type declines this year with a chance for some improvement beyond that as these
systems also get sucked into hybrid cloud deployments.
<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: Thank you, Alex. Next question, please?
Operator
Next question is from Maynard Um from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
<Q - Maynard J. Um>: Hi, thank you. Can you just talk a little bit about the structure of the Federation-level
go-to-market organization? Are you effectively building a sales organization on top of the EMC and VMware sales
teams? I guess how will the various teams work together through this organization? And are the people sitting in the
organization, are they sitting within EMC, within VMware? Maybe if you can just go through a little bit about how
they work together, where they sit, and how this is different from the structure before. Thanks.
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: I would not view it as a sales organization that we're building. That's the furthest thing I want
to do. We have great salespeople. What we're doing is build it – view it as we're building a set of client directors which
can help coordinate, which customers are demanding. They're not asking from us anymore. They're demanding. So
we're building a set of – a higher level – I hardly call them salespeople, but client directors to help customers
understand what they need to do to go when they as companies – and if you're not doing this, you're going to fail as any
company outside of IT. They have digital agendas. How are we going to help them with their digital agenda? They
have to take their traditional data center and move them to clouds, private, public, hybrid.

So basically these client directors are going to be like a level – it's a different job than a sales job. And it's basically
how you help understand and become part of a customer's fabric, and then underneath that how do we coordinate all the
great technology we have. And we think if we do that, we will get much bigger wallet share from our customers and
much higher customer satisfaction levels. View it as that. Go ahead, David.
<Q - Maynard J. Um>: But is VMware also having these client directors, or is this an EMC-driven thing?
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: The problem we have, one of the problems we have and one of the problems we talk about is
there are two EMCs. There's my EMC and there's David's EMC. So we try to say EMC-squared. That's myself and the
Federation. And then we have EMC II. I understand the branding is terrible and it's one of the things we've got to take a
look at. But if you take a look, these would be not with David, not with Pat. They would be in effect at the Federation
level with me. And of course, they would be owned by both. It should look like an asset for EMC II. It should look like
an asset for Pivotal. So it's an extra layer and it's not in either EMC, VMware, or Pivotal, or RSA. It's at an extra level.
Does that make sense to you?
<Q - Maynard J. Um>: It does, thanks. And then, Zane, can you just talk about the incremental costs associated with
that then? Is that all embedded in? Thanks.
<A - Zane C. Rowe>: Yes, it would be all embedded in. Ultimately, we feel confident that we're going to gain a lot
more revenue share using this model. If you think about the marginal costs, obviously in some cases, it's the teams
actually working closer to together. So while there's a small incremental cost as you combine it, I actually think it will
be far more efficient as we progress.
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: We're being smart in only talking about cost synergies. I happen to be for one to believe there
are more revenue synergies than there are cost synergies, but I know how everyone thinks. If you think we're pretty
good operators, you'll take the revenues, the cost synergies to the bank, thank you, and it's up to us to prove, and that's
fine with me, that we can produce the revenue synergies. But I believe there's a huge opportunity for revenue synergies.
So I want to add that little color.
<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: Thanks, Maynard. Next question, please.
Operator
Our next question is from Aaron Rakers from Stifel. Your line is open.
<Q - Aaron C. Rakers>: Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to go and look at the gross margin trend in the
Storage business. I think it was reported at 53.3% for the Information Infrastructure. I know that there's a VCE negative
effect on that, but that's down from 56.1% a year ago. What exactly is the drag from VCE? And more importantly, how
do we think about that trend going forward as your business model mixes particularly around the commodity based
hyper- converged solutions? Thank you.
<A - Zane C. Rowe>: I'll start and then let David touch on it as we think about the future of VCM. Obviously, I think
we've talked about it a fair amount as we consolidated that, there was a fair amount of third-party products that are
rolled in with the converged infrastructure that now impacts the gross margin obviously as well as the operating
margins. David has talked about that being flat if you were to exclude both FX and the impact of VCE on those gross
margins. And again, we're obviously encouraged by the run rate, the growth rate of VCE, and recognize the opportunity
there. So that's what's initially driving through the gross margin change as you look at that year over year.
<A - David I. Goulden>: So just to pick up...
<Q - Aaron C. Rakers>: And on...
<A - David I. Goulden>: Sorry, go on.
<Q - Aaron C. Rakers>: Go ahead. I was going to say on a forward basis, how do we think about the trend going?

<A - David I. Goulden>: I think just to reiterate what Zane just said, really VCE accounts for the entirety, or VCE plus
the minor impacts of FX on gross margin accounts for the entirety of the year on your margin changes. Going forward,
as I've said, the gross margin in the three primary storage buckets are in the same zip code, so there's not a massive
impact of movement towards the emerging market bucket, which does of course have more commodity but it's also got
some software-only products. Those net each other out. And you've seen that big mix shift over the last couple years
with the emerging sector becoming a much bigger piece of the business and that not having any real impact upon gross
margins. So we are balancing through that. The good news is that there's not a huge difference between those two. So
as the mix shifts, we have good opportunity.
<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: Thank you, Aaron. Next question, please.

Your next question is from Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal. Your line is open.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Hi, thank you. I wanted to follow up on Amit's question. The stock is down 16% for the
year with the S&P up 3%, so it's continuing another year of meaningful relative underperformance. And for context, I
would argue that EMC seems to be both trying to buy invest for growth. And I think shareholders would like more
capital back rather than EMC going out and buying more assets such as Virtustream. And as part of that, when I
specifically look at RSA, it's only 4% of revenues. But with revenues declining in a very buoyant security market, I
think it points to EMC perhaps is not operationally optimized right now. So the questions I have, is the board having
conversations without management? And could you confirm that all options are on the table here as the board considers
the strategic alternatives?
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: I can confirm for sure that the board is having many sessions without management, and they
are considering smart options. You mentioned Virtustream, but let me just give you a couple specifics. EMC has about
30% share in the storage array market, the external storage market. If you look at mission-critical, that share probably
goes to over 50%. So EMC is living in these mission-critical environments. So if you believe that many storage
services, storage-as-a-service is going to the cloud, for EMC not to play there with a mission-critical cloud was insane.
And that's exactly what Virtustream is addressing. You just saw it today, the partnership they announced and the
relationship they announced with SAP. These are the kind of mission-critical applications where EMC's storage lead is
really strong. So I can't agree with what you said at all, and neither does the board or they wouldn't have approved
Virtustream.
So it's not – you can't live – you've got to live in an 'and' world, not an 'or' world. This industry is going through an
unbelievable transformation, and as I called it, a sea change, and it's undeniable. And if you don't invest – you can't
only do it organically. If you don't invest into where the IT buck is going, you're going to be really sad as investors. I
feel incredibly bad as does the board, and I believe we can address it and will address it, of the undervalue that you just
pointed to, Keith. But again, you've got to think this whole thing through in a broad segment. And I'll close where I
started. The board is having sessions both with management and without management.
<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: Thank you, Keith. We have time for one more question, and then we'll have a few
concluding comments from Joe.

Thank you. Our final question or comment comes from Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
<Q - Kathryn L. Huberty>: Yes, thank you. Zane, you mentioned portfolio streamlining as part of the $850 million
restructuring. Is there any consideration of exiting some products or even entire segments such that you could refocus
on growth areas and also generate some cash that could be returned either in buybacks or M&A?

<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: We are looking at assets that aren't as strategic, and to really focus or get more clarity on our
mission for where we're going to grow. And again, not to repeat myself 100 times, but it is around digital
transformation. It is around security analytics. It is around hybrid cloud. Those are three very core, and of course with
AirWatch and mobile device management and security. So if you look at those broad areas, we're going to invest more
there. And again, if things that are not strategic in helping us with that, we will look at how we can monetize and get
better return and utilization.
<Q - Kathryn L. Huberty>: Thank you.
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: Zane, did you want to add something?
<A - Zane C. Rowe>: I agree with Joe. Clearly, Katy, we've been looking at all parts of the portfolio very carefully and
I was going to tie it into what Joe had said earlier which he already said, which is it's important that it works together.
We believe in growth in the future. And obviously, we think there's a lot of opportunity between streamlining as well as
investing in our growth initiatives.
<Q - Kathryn L. Huberty>: Thanks.
Joseph M. Tucci
In closing, first of all, I want to thank everyone for here. We are really focused on our transformation and our mission
that is critical. The industry is transforming. We must transform. We've seen this coming for a while. We've built a
unique set of technologies, assets, focus businesses and talent. And it's now time to how do we produce true value for
our shareholders out of that set of assets and be a winner in the next generation of IT technology.
We think we're really investing well where the IT puck is going. And again, the board and management are confident in
our future and in our ability to drive shareholder value. So thank you for being with us today and we'll get to see all of
you. Thank you, bye-bye.
