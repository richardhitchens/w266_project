Steven M. Mollenkopf
Thank you, Warren, and good afternoon everyone. We delivered strong results this quarter with revenues at the high
end of our guidance range and earnings per share well above the high end of our guidance range on strong operating
performance and progress in licensing. Our strong fiscal third quarter results reflect good execution across our
businesses as we position the company for a return to growth.
We are investing to expand our technology roadmap and lead in 5G, are pursuing new opportunities in fast-growing
areas that build on our core technologies, and are committed to operational excellence. In QTL, we are pleased to report
that we made good progress on the outstanding license negotiations this quarter and received reports for a significant
amount of prior-period sales. This is a good indication of the progress we are making and we expect that momentum to
continue into our fourth fiscal quarter. We now have more than 110 companies that have signed licenses consistent
with the terms of the NDRC resolution.
In QCT, the favorable demand trends for our new chipsets across the mid and high end smartphone tiers, especially
with the top ten vendors in China, are helping to deliver improved financial performance. We are also seeing
incremental demand for our lower tier chipsets in China versus our prior expectations, driven in part by our
differentiated all mode and modem leadership.
In the premium tier, our Snapdragon 820 now has more than 150 premium smartphone and tablet designs, and we have
just announced the Snapdragon 821, which offers further performance enhancements and will help set a new bar for
flagship smartphones, increasingly popular mobile VR head mounted displays and other new devices. Our updated
Snapdragon 600 and 400 product families are becoming the preferred choice for OEMs driving growth in the high and
mid tiers as users seek more performance and features in these segments.
We continue to expand our presence in adjacent opportunities including automotive, networking, mobile compute, and
IoT. These industries are rapidly adopting smartphone technologies. Our leadership across 3G, 4G, 5G, Wi-Fi,
multimedia, graphics, processor, and RF front-end technologies positions us well for these new growth areas.
Collectively, the addressable opportunity for these adjacent areas is expected to grow at a CAGR of 18% over the next
five years from $12 billion to $29 billion according to a combination of third party and internal estimates.
In automotive, the pace of innovation is accelerating, and we are seeing a strong alignment between the industry needs
and QUALCOMM's technologies. We continue to build momentum and strengthen our position through significant
design wins at global automakers. This includes telematics, where our modem leadership is well recognized,
infotainment with our Snapdragon automobile processors, and in connectivity with our Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and location
products.
Our momentum in IoT continues as customers turn to our broad offering of IoT development platforms to accelerate
their product innovation. At COMPUTEX, we introduced the QUALCOMM Snapdragon Wear 1100 processor for the
fast growing targeted purpose wearable segments such as watches, fitness trackers, smart headsets, and wearable
accessories. Our Snapdragon flight platform has helped OEMs quickly commercialize new smaller, lighter drones,
leveraging QUALCOMM's integrated SoC connectivity, GPS, and drone software solutions.
We're also extending our proven leadership in modem solutions into the Internet of Things with over 100 designs from
more than 60 manufacturers using our low power LTE IoT modems. In networking, we continue to drive the transition

to the new Wave 2 11ac standard for Wi-Fi networks and now have over 350 home and enterprise products either in
production or designed across mainstream and premium segments.
We are on track to close our TDK JV by early calendar 2017 and to deliver our next generation gallium arsenide and
CMOS PAs in 2017. This will enable us to provide a comprehensive set of technologies and module capability for the
RF front end, positioning us well for key industry trends, complexity increases within smartphones, the proliferation of
radio bands in 4G and 5G and the growth of cellular in IoT.
We are on track to deliver operating margins of 16% or better in QCT in the fourth fiscal quarter, and it is important to
note that our planning assumptions incorporate second sourcing at our large modem customer. Looking forward, our
global scale, technology leadership and differentiated chipset roadmap across multiple tiers and regions and dozens of
spectrum bands continues to position us well for the future. Our modem expertise continues to lead the industry and as
we did in both 3G and 4G, we are leading the world to 5G. 5G will make wireless broadband indistinguishable from
wireline, requiring devices with ultra-high speed, ultra-low latency and ultra-reliable connectivity. The technology
roadmap required for 5G will drive significant advancements in modem and front-end features, the technologies in
which QUALCOMM excels.
Let me take a moment to review a few of our core strengths that will underscore our continued wireless broadband
leadership. Our gigabit LTE leadership with the Snapdragon X16 modem will pave the way to 5G. Many of the
technologies enabling gigabit LTE will be common to 5G: use of more antennas, use of multiple types of spectrum
simultaneously, more sophisticated signal processing, et cetera. And the mastery of these features in 4G will be
essential to leadership in 5G.
Many of these features are already being trialed or commercially deployed in phones using our Snapdragon 820
processor with X12 LTE. QUALCOMM also pioneered 802.11ad operating at 60 gigahertz, which is shipping into
access points and computing devices today. The design and commercialization of this technology into smartphones is
enabling the company to build leadership and expertise in the high bands, known as millimeter wave, to be deployed
broadly in 5G.
We are also designing a new OFDM-based 5G air interface that will not only enhance mobile broadband services, but
also enable connectivity and management for the Internet of Things and new types of mission-critical services. Our 5G
design is intended to get the most out of the wide array of spectrum available across regulatory paradigms and bands
from low bands below 1 gigahertz to mid bands from 1 gigahertz to 6 gigahertz to millimeter wave. 5G devices will
bring the next level of convergence with the ability to work on licensed and shared spectrum concurrently.
We are very pleased that regulators around the world are beginning to allocate spectrum for 5G consistent with our 5G
design and development efforts. Recent spectrum regulatory decisions and movement in the US and Europe, combined
with progress on the spectrum regulatory front in China, Japan and Korea are good indications that the world is
preparing for 5G.
We recently announced our new 5G prototype system and trial platform, operating in spectrum bands below 6 gigahertz
and showcasing multi-gigabit throughput at low latency. We demonstrated the prototype system at Mobile World
Congress Shanghai in collaboration with China Mobile. The new prototype adds to our existing 5G millimeter wave
prototype system operating at the 28 gigahertz millimeter wave band and is capable of robust mobile broadband
communications in non line of sight environments. We are utilizing these prototype systems to test and demonstrate our
innovative 5G designs to drive 3GPP 5G new radio standardization and enable timely 5G NR trials in anticipation of
future commercial network launches.
To summarize, fiscal 2016 has been a transition year for QUALCOMM, which has played out largely as expected. Our
strong results this quarter reflect the good progress we have made positioning the company for improved financial
performance and continued technology leadership in mobile and the many exciting new industries and products enabled
by our smartphone technologies. We are continuing to make progress in our licensing business and expect that
momentum to continue positioning us well for the future.
I will now turn the call over to Derek Aberle.

Derek K. Aberle
Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon everyone. As Steve noted, we made significant progress in the licensing business
this quarter, both in terms of new agreements signed and catch-up amounts reported. As a result, QTL had a very strong
fiscal third quarter with total reported device sales of approximately $62.6 billion and revenues of $2 billion, driven
primarily by the catch-up reporting of certain prior period sales and revenue as well as stronger than expected 3G/4G
device ASPs.
As a reminder, as a result of the resolution of our dispute with LG in April, in the fiscal third quarter, we recognized
over $200 million in revenue for sales reported during the prior two fiscal quarters and resumed to recognizing
quarterly LG revenues for sales reported in the third quarter, consistent with our prior guidance.
We continue to make steady progress in China, executing new license agreements. In addition, we are still actively
negotiating with a small number of the key remaining Chinese OEMs and making progress in those discussions. Based
on the progress we are making, those licensees agreed to report and pay a portion of the sales and royalties they have
been withholding while we continue to negotiate their new agreements. These amounts plus additional catch-up
payments we received from other licensees during the quarter resulted in more than $200 million in revenues in QTL
for the third fiscal quarter related to prior-period activity. QTL revenue for the quarter therefore included a total of
more than $400 million in revenue related to prior-period activity as a result of the LG resolution and these catch-up
payments.
As we have said in the past, we are prepared to take action against OEMs that are not negotiating in good faith to
conclude license agreements or under-reporting the royalties they owe us. Consistent with that approach, in June we
filed complaints against Meizu in the intellectual property courts in both Beijing and Shanghai, China. Regrettably,
we've had to turn to litigation against Meizu in order to protect our rights and importantly to maintain fairness and a
level playing field for the companies that are respectful of intellectual property rights and have entered into license
agreements in accordance with the resolution reached by QUALCOMM and the NDRC. We are also continuing to
work hard on a number of fronts to improve compliance. We are actively implementing our compliance plans and
expect them to deliver meaningful improvements over time.
Looking ahead, we continue to estimate calendar 2016 global 3G/4G device shipments of 1.625 to 1.725 billion devices
with year-over-year unit growth of approximately 8% at the midpoint. We continue to see a strong 4G ramp in China as
each of the operators pursues aggressive subscriber growth targets with their 4G-plus service offerings and design
momentum continues to move rapidly towards all mode devices across China.
Other emerging regions continue to be negatively impacted by macroeconomic headwinds. Outside of handsets, growth
in automotive telematics is offsetting weaker tablet volumes. We continue to expect low single digit growth in global
3G/4G device sales in fiscal 2016, consistent with our prior guidance, reflecting strong unit growth partially offset by
ASP declines that are consistent with our prior expectations. We continue to expect that the rate at which handset ASPs
will decline during fiscal 2016 will be about 50% of the rate of decline experienced in fiscal 2015.
In terms of the outlook for QTL for the fiscal year, we now expect revenue to be between $7.4 billion and $7.8 billion.
We have narrowed the range to align with our current view of expected progress in China for the remainder of the
fiscal year, including increased confidence that we will conclude additional agreements with some of the remaining key
OEMs within the fiscal year. Although we expect to continue to see quarterly fluctuations in the externally implied
royalty rate, for the reasons we have previously explained, we expect the rate for fiscal 2016 to be in the range of 2.9%.
With respect to the Korean Fair Trade Commission investigation of our licensing practices, we have now submitted an
extensive response to the case team's report and have entered the hearing phase with the commissioners. During this
phase, the commission will conduct a series of hearings over the next few months during which we expect to have the
opportunity to further present our response. The first hearing was held earlier today in Korea and contrary to the recent
press reports, the commission has not yet reached a decision in our case.

In conclusion, we continue to make good progress in China. We are keenly focused on concluding agreements with the
remaining OEMs as well as improving compliance and are working towards continued progress in the fourth fiscal
quarter.
That concludes my comments, and I will now turn the call over to George.
George S. Davis
Thank you, Derek, and good afternoon everyone. We are pleased to report a very strong fiscal third quarter. Revenues
were $6 billion, up 4% year over year, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.16, up 17% year over year. We
ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $31 billion, reflecting strong operating cash flow of
approximately 30% of revenue in the quarter and the acceleration of our share repurchase activity into the first half of
the year.
Through our fiscal third quarter, we have returned approximately 120% of free cash flow, or more than $5.9 billion to
stockholders this fiscal year, including the completion of the remainder of our $10 billion stock repurchase
commitment. And we are on track to achieve our targeted 75% return of free cash flow in fiscal 2016.
Our third quarter results reflect both our commitment to operational efficiency and the strong performance of our
operating businesses. Performance above the high end of our guidance range primarily came from continued progress
in our licensing business in China. In QCT, MSM shipments were 201 million, approximately 9% above the midpoint
of our prior guidance range, reflecting greater than expected demand in the low tier, particularly in China. QCT
operating margin at 9.5% was in line with our prior expectations on higher volume and cost reductions with increased
low tier demand impacting our product mix and revenue per MSM versus expectations.
Non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses overall were lower than forecasts, decreasing 2% sequentially,
reflecting continued cost initiatives. Our non-GAAP tax rate during the quarter was 19%, up modestly against
expectations as a result of a higher mix of licensing revenues in the quarter. We continue to expect our non-GAAP tax
rate to be approximately 18% for fiscal 2016.
Turning to our fiscal fourth quarter, we estimate revenues to be in the range of approximately $5.4 billion to $6.2
billion, up approximately 6% year over year at the midpoint. We estimate non-GAAP earnings per share in our fiscal
fourth quarter to be approximately $1.05 to $1.15 per share, up approximately 21% year over year at the midpoint. We
expect fiscal fourth quarter non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses will be down approximately 2% to 4%
sequentially, reflecting further strategic realignment plan cost actions, particularly in QCT.
In QTL, as Derek mentioned, our fiscal year revenue outlook is $7.4 billion to $7.8 billion, and we believe our recent
licensing progress will continue throughout the remainder of the year.
Aligned with that view, our revenue guidance for the fourth fiscal quarter assumes some additional progress in China.
However, our fourth quarter guidance does not include the full potential benefit from the completion of all license
agreements under negotiation and is consistent with the low end of the QTL range for the full fiscal year.
For the fiscal fourth quarter, we estimate total reported device sales of between $57 billion and $65 billion. Our TRDS
forecast reflects our estimate that global device sales will be lower year over year, reflecting a decline in the premium
tier at a large OEM partially offset by the impact of closing new licensing agreements and the resulting catch-up we
expect to receive. Like our revenue guidance, this forecast includes the impact of closing some but not all of the
remaining agreements in China.
In QCT, we anticipate MSM shipments of approximately 195 million to 215 million units and operating margin to
improve sequentially to 16% or better, consistent with our prior operating margin target. Our QCT operating margin
forecast reflects the strength of our new product cycle, our cost actions throughout the year, as well as strong demand
for mid and high tier devices.

Now turning to fiscal 2016, we remain on track to meet the $1.4 billion reduction in spending under our strategic
realignment plan and we continue to expect more than $700 million of savings in fiscal 2016 relative to the SRP
baseline, ahead of our original $600 million target. A summary of the savings program is included in the investor
presentation for this call on our website.
We continue to expect fiscal 2016 non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses to be down approximately 2% to
4% year over year, which includes the full year impact of acquisition related increases of approximately 5%. Adjusting
for M&A, estimated spending in these areas would be down 7% to 9% year over year.
We are committed to maintaining a strong discipline of cost management while remaining extremely focused on the
important role QUALCOMM will play as a leading innovator in mobile technology solutions.
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Warren.
Warren Kneeshaw
Thank you, George. Operator, we are ready for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Simona K. Jankowski>: Hi. Thank you for breaking out the benefit to QTL from the China catch-up royalties.
Would you be able to also break out the contribution to units and the level of ASPs for that catch-up? And then is there
much left in terms of the already signed agreement that is yet to be recognized?
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Simona, hey. It's Derek. Yeah, I think we're not in a position today to break out the split of
TRDS kind of units and ASP that came in through the catch-up payments in Q3. I think if you look at it, you sort of
look at it for the year. You'll be able to see that we're sort of making progress in closing the gap. And if we continue to
make progress and close these key remaining agreements, we talked at the Analyst Day of being in a position to capture
about 75% of the global sales from the Chinese OEMs. I think we'll actually sort of on an exit rate basis if we can close
these remaining deals, we'll be better than that. So I think it's just a continued story of progress and you're starting to
see the results roll through this quarter.
<A - George S. Davis>: And Simona, in terms of the upside to guidance, as we indicated, our Q4 guidance is really set
at the low end of the full year range for QTL. So the upside would be the agreements in addition to the ones that we
expect to sign that we put into the guidance. There's still $400 million of revenue upside that is possible for the quarter
and not in our guidance.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.
<Q - T. Michael Walkley>: Great. Thank you. Yeah, Derek, just another question on QTL. With the progress in China
certainly encouraging and as you continue to make progress with a few of these other large Chinese OEMs, how should
we maybe think about the exit rate basis in terms of maybe units you believe are being under-reported entering fiscal
2017? Do you think it's still more than maybe 10% of the market under-reporting? Are you getting close to those
levels? And then just overall high level, how is this progress as you exit the year relative to your expectations toward
your longer term $10 billion in QTL revenue by 2020? Thank you.

Page 7 of 15
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Yeah, Mike, this is Derek. So I think the way to think about it is, sort of if I bridge back to the
answer I was just giving to Simona's question, we continue to believe that if we can close these remaining agreements
that the exit rate actually on the China portion of the global sales Chinese OEM portion will now be north of 75%. And
I think if you look at that also in terms of then the global sales, it would be less than 10% on a run rate basis going
forward. And what we've seen actually is some of these key Chinese OEMs have actually been gaining share in it, so
we'll get an even larger benefit on a run rate basis if we can close out the remaining couple of agreements we have here.
<A - Warren Kneeshaw>: Second question.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Oh, yes. And I would say basically I think the progress we're making in China and the view
on the market we see is consistent with what we talked about in terms of the $10 billion target.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Timothy Patrick Long>: Thank you. Just sticking on this same topic, sorry to beat it too much. It looks like,
Derek, the March units were only down about 4% sequential, so I'm assuming that's some prior period catch-up. So if
you were to normalize the full year 8% growth, would that be lower because of those aren't in there and maybe if you
could just give us a sense. I don't know if that's breaking out those numbers too much. And then just on the chip side, I
think I just wanted to hit on the gross margin. I guess was it mix that caused it to be down even though the ASPs were
up in the quarter? And what's kind of the outlook for the next few quarters on the gross margin line for QCT? Thank
you.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Hey, Tim. This is Derek. So on the first question, yeah, the units in Q3 would have included
some amount of catch-up which rolled into the catch-up number that we talked about. If we look back, you'll see we
have effectively held our unit call for calendar 2016 which is about, as you said, about an 8% year-over-year growth.
Obviously that has quarterly fluctuations given seasonality and other variability. I would say largely from a market
standpoint, things are tracking in line with what we would have expected last quarter.
We talked about China being stronger, some softness in the premium tier, and a little bit of weakness in some of the
emerging markets. But the net-net still giving us confidence that the 8% forecast was good. You may have seen China
reported numbers out recently probably stronger than most people had expected and largely in line with what we
thought would happen there.
<A - George S. Davis>: Hey, Tim, it's George. And I think we don't break out the gross margin, but I think your point
is on revenue per MSM. And yes, it was a little softer in the quarter than we had expected on mix. Obviously the unit
story was quite good, and in particular we saw a lot of strength in the low tier. Gross margin is going to be a good story
for us as you look into the end of the year. You're going to see the impact of not only a very strong set of new products
starting to get the lift in the marketplace in Q4, but the adjacent business continues to do well. Our adjacent businesses
are continuing to do well. And of course, and we reiterated the 16% op margin for QCT, and that means that it'll also
benefit from the OpEx actions that we're taking in the quarter as well. So a good story overall for QCT.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - James E. Faucette>: Thanks. I just wanted to ask a follow-up question as it relates to the collections that you
guys are doing or the payments, et cetera. Derek, maybe you can just talk a little bit about how we should think about
both timing, but also what maybe the long-term implications are. I guess just a little more color on anything that you
can say as to why the negotiation [indiscernible] (29:02) the outstanding licensees are still there. And at what point do
you feel like you end up having to do something along the lines of filing suit with Meizu? Thank you.

<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Yeah, James. It's Derek. So I think the way to look at it is, we had this small group of
licensees that were withholding their reports and payments while they continued to negotiate, and that was inconsistent
with what a lot of the other companies did. And I think the way to look at that is, given the progress that we've made
within the last quarter with those companies towards closing agreements, which aren't yet closed but we are making
progress towards that, sort of put them in a position to feel the right thing to do was to go ahead and report a portion of
the prior-period sales, which is what rolled through in the quarter.
Taking that up a level, as I said, for the year and at the Analyst Day, we talked about if we could close these key deals,
we would basically be sort of on a run rate basis collecting on about 75% of the total sales by the Chinese OEMs, and
then there would be additional compliance work we would need to do to kind of close the gap on the remainder. I
would say now as we look at that picture, if we accomplish the same goal this year, meaning the closing the
agreements, the exit rate will actually be north of that 75%, and then of course we're already actively moving on a
number of fronts to improve the compliance in the other areas.
So I think that's largely tracking in line with our plans. And as you can see, if there are companies that we believe we're
not making progress with and we won't conclude agreements with because they're not negotiating in good faith, we will
take action against them and that's what we did against Meizu. We don't feel like at the moment we're there with other
companies, but of course that could change in the future. Our current view though is we are making progress and we
have higher confidence now than maybe we did a quarter ago that we'll be able to close those deals within the year.

Your next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Thanks. Just a couple of quick ones. Derek, for you just a clarification on the licensing
side. So it sounds like there's $400 million worth of catch-up payments from Samsung and from the Chinese OEMs.
There's going to be some catch-up payments already included in your Q4 guidance, especially for QTL I assume, and
eventually those catch-up payments tail off to zero because you just get an ongoing run rate. I just want to clarify if
that's the way it works. And the second part of the QTL part is that, this move from 75% compliance to move towards
let's say 100%, is it as you exit this year, is that more about getting your existing licensees that are reporting to you to
100% comply and report all of their units, or is it signing up still further new major vendors? Thanks.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Kulbinder, this is Derek. Yeah, we basically said the combined catch-up amounts across is
actually LG, not Samsung. LG and the companies that then reported some prior period activity was in the quarter north
of $400 million. If you think about Q4 as George mentioned, the way we've looked at that, kind of throughout the year
we've had a little bit of a difference in the way we've treated guidance, meaning the QTL full year revenue guidance
has always included revenues associated with closing new deals, but that when we were just guiding one quarter out,
we have been cautious in not including the benefit of what would be required to close those deals within the quarter.
Now as we get towards the end of the year with just Q4 remaining and we look at the progress we're making, we've
effectively narrowed the range, brought up the low end of the range. And as George said, we've included some amount
of benefit from closing new deals, but not the full benefit. So what's rolling through our Q4 guidance is really
consistent with the low end of the full year QTL revenue guidance, and then there is incremental revenue that would
come from closing additional deals in the quarter, which we believe is possible, which is why we've continued to have
a higher range for the full year on QTL.
Going forward, I think the way to think about the run rate is, again if we get that done, we will be north of probably
75% of the Chinese OEM sales on a run rate basis, which would mean sort of the under-reporting percentage of total
global sales would be less than 10%. And then really to close the gap on that is going to be a combination of I would
say signing up some of the smaller players as well as obviously we have the dispute with Meizu and then driving higher
compliance from some of the companies that are already licensed and just not reporting their full sales. So it will be a
kind of a combination of a few different elements there.

Your next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Rod B. Hall>: Yeah, hi guys. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to come back to QTL and the
midpoint. Your midpoint guidance at QTL is down $0.5 billion, and so I get all the commentary around the puts and
takes, but I'm just trying to understand what caused that shift down in the midpoint. Is it demand? Is it ASPs? Is it that
the catch-up payments aren't quite as much as you thought? Can you help me understand what's going on there? And
then I have one follow-up on that as well.
<A - George S. Davis>: Yeah hi, Rod. It's George. So yeah, the midpoint, if you do the $7.3 billion to $8 billion versus
$7.4 billion to $8 billion, yes, it's down $500 million. I really wouldn't read anything into it. There's a number of
agreements that were put within that space. We've tried to every quarter give an update on where we think the range is
going, and even last quarter, we said it looks because of the market and some other issues, the range is probably had a
little more downside, but we held the low end of the range based on progress.
So we're constantly adjusting to make sure that we reflect what's possible. You've also seen us take some litigation
action, which actually puts things potentially outside the window for the year. But there's a number of factors that went
into the range, and so I wouldn't over-read a $50 million change. And again, we're guiding to the low end of the range,
which means we have significant upside to that if we're able to sign more agreements.
<Q - Rod B. Hall>: Okay. And then I just also wanted to ask you, the 16% exit rate, you had said that's now it sounds
like a minimum, and I just wonder how conservative is that margin exit rate now that you know more about market
share changes, et cetera, in the back end of this year? Can you just comment a little bit about do you feel that's a very
conservative number now, or is it as conservative as when you started out with that 16% exit rate? Just give us some
idea there.
<A - George S. Davis>: We're pleased with what we've seen in the marketplace. As you know, the year probably
overall has been a little softer in the premium tier than we would have thought. So, but we've also made good progress
on both market share and on our cost efforts relative to expectations going in. So I think overall we feel comfortable
reiterating, but I really don't want to characterize it beyond that.

Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
<Q - Timothy Arcuri>: Thank you. I had two questions. I guess the first one, Derek, I'm still trying to maybe get at
what some people are asking about the pro forma royalty rate. So maybe can you maybe pro forma out for us what the
royalty rate was net of all the catch-up payments in June, and then maybe what the pro forma royalty rate will be for
September as well?
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Yeah, Tim. This is Derek. I think the way to think about it is we, in my script, we included a
statement for the full fiscal year that we believe for the full year will be around the 2.9% level. I think if you try to kind
of normalize Q3 to adjust for the prior-period activity, things like the LG resolution which pushed the rate up, I think it
would be in that range as well for the quarter.
Q4 we believe will be down sequentially, but it's really hard to give you a forecast on that just because it will be fairly
dependent on how many of the deals we get resolved within the quarter and how much catch-up comes in. As you
might remember, some of the guys that we're still negotiating with were larger, historically larger three-mode players
and the rate on three-mode devices is lower than on other devices and so that could have within the quarter when that
catch-up comes in could have a dilutive effect. But we're still comfortable with the longer-term view on the rate that we
talked about in February and also for the year that I mentioned today.

<Q - Timothy Arcuri>: Got it. Thanks. And then I guess just my follow-up is really for Steve and the team. Can you
talk a little more about 5G? And you guys are talking more about this every call, so I guess the question is really about
timing and your position in the standards and sort of when they'll be finalized and what your IP position will be for 5G
relative to what it's been for 3G/4G. Thanks.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: Sure. So Tim, it's Steve. In general, we're obviously trying to drive 5G as quickly as we
can. It's an area which we think to be a strong player in 5G, you have to be a strong player in 4G/3G and Wi-Fi, and
consequently we think that we will maintain a very strong IP position moving forward. The standards bodies are
working on that right now, and so I think we have a lot of visibility into the strength of our submissions as well as to
how the industry is unfolding.
I think in general if you were to ask me that question a year ago, I would have said that it would have happened closer
to 2020. Certainly over the last year and accelerating here over the last quarter, there's been a real pull to push that in or
to pull that in closer to the 2018, 2019 timeframe depending on what the deployment is. And of course we're going to
support that with our products and with our standards submissions and all the R&D that we're doing. And as you would
expect, we're accelerating as well as protecting that R&D as we're repositioning the company for growth. And I think it
will be a good story for QUALCOMM here over the next decade.

Your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Blayne Curtis>: Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just a couple on QCT. You talk about upside from the
China market. There's been a lot of concerns about maybe from overbuilds. You have the best perspective knowing
what you shipped in versus what's selling through. Just some, your perspective on China maybe seasonality as you get
into December. And then you said you factored in some second sourcing at a marquee phone. Do you think that share
that you will have ultimately on this generation is sustainable?
<A - Cristiano R. Amon>: Okay. This is Cristiano. Thank you for your question. First maybe addressing China, I
think as we said, in addition to seeing stronger demand for high and mid and even low tier units, and it also give us a
higher unit in the quarter, I think we are seeing significant traction. We think our new product family, not only the
Snapdragon 800, but more important the 600 and 400 tiers, and we see the market in China is moving up. We spoke
earlier in other calls about things such as all mode and carrier aggregation. We see that is materializing. All mode is
becoming the preferred configuration, which is a multimode solution across all the carriers in China. And I think here
China exactly moving faster to higher speeds. So we see that exactly a positive trend for QUALCOMM in particular as
the market in China moving up.
With regards to how we view about second sourcing in one large customer, I think we said very, very clear that's our
planning assumption and we still, we stayed, we're going to – driving towards to meet our commitments in 2016, and I
think that has no impact on our 16% projection of operating margin for QCT.

Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I was wondering if you could give us an

operating margins as we go into next year. Do you think 16% in Q4 will be the trough for operating margins? As we go
through 2017, they should never drop below that?
<A - George S. Davis>: Hey, Stacy. It's George. Again, we would expect to see strong revenue per MSM again in the
fourth quarter, and so we're not giving a specific guide, but if you look at the product mix and you look at where we're
seeing an uptake and the positioning of our new products, it's all consistent with improved revenue per MSM. Also of

course the adjacent businesses contributed to that as well as they did in the third quarter. We're not going to guide 2017

Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura. Please go ahead.
<Q - Romit J. Shah>: Yes. Thank you. Just on the second sourcing with the key customer, I'm just wondering if you
guys can give us some feel for whether you were able to retain majority share. And looking into next year, I know you
talked a little bit about gigabit LTE that you're going to have with the X16 Snapdragon. Is that an important factor as
you all think about design wins in 2017? I think the feedback from some of the competition is that while it's ahead one
gigabit, download speeds will be fairly rare in practice and not really a variable when it comes to design wins.
<A - Cristiano R. Amon>: Hi, Romit. Thanks for your question. This is Cristiano. So I'll just try to address. It's very
difficult for us to comment specifically about our customer plans with regards to volume and share. I think what I can
say is we always had second sourcing in our business in QCT throughout the years, and I think we always rely on the
strength on our product roadmap and technology transitions to drive value and volume from our solutions.
I think that leads into your second question. I believe the gigabit LTE transition, it is going to get a lot of traction across
all the developed markets. But in – also you're going to see that as pre-deployment ahead of 5G. I think the ability to
drive gigabit LTE technology with 4G using advanced RF techniques is going to be key to drive a transition to 5G. And
I think in addition to that, we see both the Wi-Fi and the LTE evolving at the same time across licensed and unlicensed
spectrum, as unlicensed spectrum with 3GPP is standard. It's called LAA. Unlicensed spectrum becomes available,
that's going to give many operators worldwide the ability to get to gigabit speeds, and we're very confident about the
ability to do that with our roadmap.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: And this is Steve. The only thing I would add is, I think betting against feature
leadership at the modem level has never been a good way to build a sustainable business. We think it continues to be a
defensible franchise. And in fact if you look at the strength that we're seeing in the business today in China, I think it's
good proof that you do not want to be on the wrong side of modem feature leadership. And we think that continues to
be important and becomes even more important as the industry transitions to 5G. So we feel like we're in a good spot to
maintain a strong position on the modem franchise.

Your next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - Tal Liani>: Hi, guys. Is there any impact on pricing of the competition with Intel? And second about QCT, when
should we see the bulk of the 820 ramp hitting the numbers? I'm trying to model this properly since the ASP is so much
higher than the average, and I don't know if you expect it to hit at a certain time or more moderate growth kind of
across many quarters. Thanks.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Tal, obviously we can't specifically talk about any one customer's pricing, but I can tell you
and I'll reiterate what I said about going Q3 to Q4. Part of how we're going to be getting the operating margin to 16% is
a strength at both the gross margin level and across our product suite. So I think we feel very good about the
positioning of our products and the ASP implications of that.
<A - Cristiano R. Amon>: Hi. I think [ph] Paul to (47:22) comment on the 820 ramp, I think we will continue to see
820 launches throughout the year. I think you have the normal seasonality of the holiday season, but also you have now
different seasonalities in China as well. So I think we'll continue to see 820 launches throughout the year and when we
get into 2017, you're going to start to see launches with our next generation platform.

Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
<Q - C.J. Muse>: Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. I guess two quick ones. First one, can
you share what the dollar value of catch-up payments is embedded in your September Q revenue guide? And then
secondly, if I look at your EPS guide and your QCT operating margin guide, it seems to suggest a PBT margin for QTL
closer to 74% versus 86% last Q. Curious if you could walk through what is driving that downtick. Thank you.
<A - George S. Davis>: Yeah, so for QTL, we would expect obviously we're coming down quarter over quarter
relative to the, because of the amount of kind of out of period items that were in Q3. Spending staying flat will impact
operating margin not as much as certainly what you're forecasting. We haven't guided the amount of licensing that we
anticipate assigning, but it's not a material amount, but there is some included in our guidance forecasts.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Tavis McCourt with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
<Q - Tavis C. McCourt>: Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. Derek, I wonder if you gave us the catch-up
payments for the fiscal third quarter embedded in the $7.4 billion to $7.8 billion guidance for QTL. Can you give us the
full year estimate or if it's a range of catch-up payments? And then secondly, Steve, on the gigabit LTE, I missed it
before. Is that in the roadmap for next year's modem? Have you said that specifically? And if so, what level of carrier
aggregation would be needed for that? Thanks.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Tavis, this is Derek. So yeah, we're not going to break out specifically how much catch-up is
sort of in the range. The way to think about it though is, sort of the two of the larger companies that we've been
negotiating with and have been withholding payments this quarter reported and we recognized more than $200 million
of catch-up payments related to them. That's not the entirety of the catch-up amount, but it's obviously a significant
portion.
And then as think about what catch-up means, there's obviously some 2015 activity, but now we're halfway, essentially
halfway through 2016, so there will be additional catch-up. So you'll have in-quarter activity plus catch-up payments
related to those agreements when they get signed and if that happens in the fourth quarter they would roll through there.
But it's pretty hard for us to give more color than that just given the timing uncertainty of when they'll get done and
how much will roll through in the quarter.
<A - Cristiano R. Amon>: Tavis, this is Cristiano. To your question on gigabit LTE, gigabit LTE, I think we already
assembled some of the first products with gigabit LTE. You're going to see this in products throughout next calendar
year. Maybe some of the early products could come as early as this calendar year. And you need three or four carrier
aggregation to be able to do this. One important thing is you have a lot of carriers today doing three carrier aggregation
today. I think that plus four carrier aggregation, you can get to gigabit speeds.

Your next question comes from the line of Brett Simpson with Arete. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brett Simpson>: Yeah, thanks very much. First question for Derek on QTL. So just looking at the China license
agreements you're signing of late, my understanding is they don't include implementation patents anymore and you
have an outlook for $10 billion of QTL revenue by 2020. Can you talk about how you might monetize your
nonstandard essential patents, your implementation patents in the future? Should we expect QUALCOMM to consider
separating implementation patents as a separate license agreement with your customers as you move towards say 5G?

<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Hey, Brett. This is Derek. Yeah, you're correct as it relates to China. So as part of the NDRC
resolution, we committed to offer licenses to, it's actually not even the entirety of our essential patent portfolio, but the
3G/4G standard essential patents in China. And so in a sense, that has resulted in us doing something different in China
than we have done historically, which is a disaggregation of the portfolio. And as I have said in the past, we do believe
there's an opportunity to monetize the remainder of the portfolio.
Our focus has been really sort of a sequenced approach, meaning try to get through all of the key deals covering the
3G/4G portfolio, and I think we're getting towards the finish line on that. And then once we do that, I think there's a
number of different opportunities and ways that we're thinking through monetizing the remainder of the portfolio. And
as you may recall, we mentioned that wasn't built in even to the $10 billion number that we had had talked about in
February. So we do think there's an opportunity there over time.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Ed Snyder with Charter Equity Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Edward F. Snyder>: Thanks a lot. Steve, you mentioned that to be strong in 5G, you really have to be strong in
4G given the legacy standard. Isn't that also the case to some extent with the 4G that you had to be fairly strong in 3G?
And how has that impacted the second sourcing in some of your larger customers? Is this one of the things that's
keeping you in the majority share? And do you think it's going to play out that way for the rest of the 4G and into 5G
too?
It's been the case a lot of folks have entered the modem business with great plans and almost all of them have fallen
away, and it seems to be most of it is done because they don't have the legacy software to do all of the handoffs [ph] in
the corner cases (54:00) that QUALCOMM does. So I'm just trying to figure out how that applies to some of the
marquee phones that are playing out now. And then into 5G, do you see that being a big factor or are we going to go so
far off the reservation in like IoT and all that that the legacy stuff isn't going to be as big of a deal? Thanks.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: Ed, I actually agree with the way that you characterized it. It's been very difficult to
build I would say a high quality modem business without having the ability to handle all the modes that come up. This
becomes increasingly important when you're looking to get into SKUs that are sold let's say worldwide because
essentially you get the entire world's feature set come into your product. And so what you tend to see is that people
might split their products and go with one region with a particular solution, but it's difficult to get the lion's share and
certainly difficult I think over time to protect that, those design wins. And we've seen that over a number of generations
and I would say one of the reasons that we were successful in 4G, besides just being ahead on 4G, was the ability to
make it very easy for multimode to occur at the chipset.
Really all the multimode work tends to be abstracted to the user by the chipset. That continues to be important and I
would add in Wi-Fi and many different bands when you go to 5G. So we think that's going to continue to be an
important component of our business moving forward and one of the reasons why we think it's important to invest not
only in the modem but in the RF and all of the technologies that make that very easy to occur. With IoT it even
becomes more important in my opinion because the SKU that goes into these industrial applications, you're really
trying to make it easy for someone to go and access cellular without having to learn about all of the complications that
cellular provides. So we think that's not only a defensible strategy for cellular products but also for the Internet of
Things and the franchise moving forward.

in every case you can't come to agreement seek legal remedy or will there be many cases in which it's not worth the
cost?
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: The business in China obviously is pretty diverse, and I think we have approached it in the
right way, which is we have kind of a stage plan. The first is to get the key agreements done. I think we're making good
progress as you've seen on that front. There's a number of in-country in-China compliance initiatives we have ongoing
with existing licensees including active audit and other efforts to make sure we really have a clear understanding of the
market landscape and who's doing what. There will be I think a piece of the market that is sort of the long tail piece that
tends to be lower ASP, low cost, lower featured devices that might be a little bit harder to get after than some of the
other pieces.
But we're seeing consolidation across the OEMs both in terms of share and also even some early M&A activity. So the
number of players we believe will reduce over time. Beyond that, so obviously legal proceedings will be an element of
our compliance efforts, and you've seen that with Meizu, but there are many, many other things we're doing as well
both in China. And I talked about some of these at some length at our Analyst Day in February, but there's a lot of
activity we're also doing outside of China in a lot of the other regions in the world that we think have the ability to
impact and change behavior for some of the players that have been less compliant in the past.
So litigation will be one tool, but it's not going to be the only tool. There's other things that are less costly that we think
we can do to drive higher compliance over time, and a big area of focus obviously for the business right now.
<Q - David M. Wong>: Okay, great. And for leading-edge chip manufacturing technology in the future, do you plan to
use a single foundry for any given advanced mode, or might you split your business between foundries? When do you
expect to tape out 10 nanometers and have these sampling?
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: Well I think in general, we tend to have a multi-sourcing strategy, and that includes the
leading node. We have already taped out 10 nanometer and sampled it to customers, so our focus tends to be on the
leading node even beyond 10 nanometers. And because our business is so diverse, we tend to use everything from the
leading node all the way down to analog processes. So it's multi-sourcing tends to be one of the tenets of how we
operate the business, so.

Thank you. I just wanted to thank everyone for attending the call today. We had a stronger than expected quarter and
are executing well on our plans to position the company for the next phase of profitable growth. We continue to make
good progress in the licensing business in China, and have favorable new product momentum in QCT. Lastly, I want to
thank all the QUALCOMM employees for their hard work, for the strong quarter, and we look forward to the many
exciting opportunities ahead. Thank you.
