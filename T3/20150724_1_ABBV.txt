Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions.
So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rick.
Richard A. Gonzalez
Thank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2015's earnings
conference call. We delivered another strong performance, with second quarter results ahead of our expectations,
including adjusted earnings per share of $1.08, representing growth of more than 31% versus the second quarter of
2014.
Our results included strong operational sales growth of nearly 20%, driven by a number of products across our
portfolio, including strong performance from our newly acquired oncology therapy, IMBRUVICA, continued global
uptake of VIEKIRA, and continued strong growth from HUMIRA, as well as other products in our portfolio, including
Creon, Synthroid and Duodopa.
We're particularly pleased with the high quality of our results in the quarter. We saw significant margin expansion,
continued R&D investment, and SG&A leverage. And we delivered these results despite a significant foreign exchange
headwind. We're also pleased with our outperformance and progress year-to-date. We've driven strong commercial,
operational, and R&D execution resulting in industry-leading top and bottom line performance.
During the quarter, we advanced several important strategic priorities, continued to enhance operational efficiency, and
achieved a number of regulatory and clinical objectives. Importantly, we completed the acquisition of Pharmacyclics,
augmenting AbbVie's already strong position and growth prospects. I'll discuss our progress with Pharmacyclics in
more detail in just a moment.
We're also driving strong performance from our current portfolio including HUMIRA, which is off to a very good start
in the first half of the year, with robust underlying global demand and exceptional performance in the U.S. We made
significant progress with our mid- and our late-stage R&D programs. During today's call, our Chief Scientific Officer,
Mike Severino, will provide an update on our pipeline.
And we've also continued to improve efficiency across our operations, delivering roughly 800 basis points in operating
margin expansion this quarter versus the prior year, achieving an operating margin profile of 44.2%, and we remain
committed to improving this metric across our long-range plan. This quarter and our first half results demonstrate the
significant progress that we've made towards our objective of delivering industry-leading growth.
As I mentioned, during the quarter, we successfully completed the acquisition of Pharmacyclics, a strategic addition to
our business that adds another compelling growth platform to AbbVie's strong prospects in immunology and virology,
and accelerates AbbVie's clinical and commercial presence in oncology. While strategically important, the acquisition
of Pharmacyclics will also drive strong financial benefits, further diversifying our revenue base, significantly enhancing
our revenue growth across our long-range plan and delivering EPS accretion beginning in 2017.
And as we have outlined, we expect accretion related to the acquisition in excess of $0.60 per share in 2019, ramping to
more than $1 per share in 2021. Pharmacyclics will operate from its Sunnyvale, California headquarters under the
leadership of Erik von Borcke. Erik has held a number of leadership positions within AbbVie since joining the
company in 2001, including his most recent role as Vice President of Global Marketing.
The transition has been seamless, and we've been impressed by the caliber of talent we've welcomed from
Pharmacyclics into AbbVie. We saw a strong momentum with IMBRUVICA in the quarter, full second quarter U.S.
IMBRUVICA sales were $234 million. We continue to expect IMBRUVICA to drive U.S. sales of approximately $1
billion for the full calendar year 2015.
Since we completed the Pharmacyclics transaction, we have seen additional positive data and progress on our
regulatory objectives, including positive readouts from two Phase III studies, HELIOS and RESONATE-2.

With respect to the positive RESONATE-2 data, a significant portion of our valuation for Pharmacyclics was attributed
to advancing in the first line treatment. And while we assume a very high probability of success, these data provide
strong evidence of IMBRUVICA's dramatic efficacy in a front-line setting and further derisks this component of our
model.
Our virology franchise will be a significant growth driver for us in 2015 and in the years to come. With the launch of
VIEKIRA, we have established a meaningful position in the HCV market. We continue to see progress particularly
internationally, which is tracking ahead of our planning assumptions. We received approval in 47 markets, and we
expect a number of additional countries to come online as the year progresses and into 2016. This includes Japan,
where we continue to expect a regulatory decision during the second half of this year. As a reminder, in Japan, we will
commercialize a 12-week, two-pill once a day ribavirin-free combination.
Overall, we continue to see excellent progress across our total pipeline. We've advanced several assets into the
regulatory approval cycle. We've moved assets into pivotal trials, reported positive data from several assets, and we
expect additional regulatory approvals as the year progresses.
We're also encouraged with the advancement and derisking of our mid- and our late-stage pipeline. Over the past six
months, we've reported positive data from several programs. For example, earlier this year, we reported positive top
line results from the first of two Elagolix pivotal trials in endometriosis. Our partner, Galapagos, recently reported
positive interim top line findings from two Phase IIb studies of our partner in selective JAK1 inhibitor in RA. We have
also recently seen data from the six-month extension trial of the first Elagolix endometriosis pivotal study. And the
results were consistent with the previously reported efficacy and safety findings.
Several other assets such as venetoclax in relapsed/refractory CLL patients with 17p deletion are demonstrating strong
results. We're very encouraged with each of these data readouts.
In summary, we delivered another quarter of strong results, exceeding our guidance range for the quarter. When we
launched AbbVie back in January of 2013, we set an objective for ourselves, to build an innovation-driven,
patient-focused biopharmaceutical company capable of delivering and sustaining top-tier financial performance.
We have made significant progress in building the key strategic elements necessary to deliver on that objective. We're
driving exceptional performance out of our existing portfolio including HUMIRA. We have a robust pipeline with
several assets with multibillion-dollar potential. We're achieving significant operational efficiencies which are apparent
in our first half 2015 results.
And we've added another major growth platform with Pharmacyclics and IMBRUVICA. We've also delivered on our
commitments to shareholders, with a total shareholder return since launching the company in January of 2013 of more
than 125%. We're well positioned to deliver industry leading EPS growth in 2015 and we continue to make significant
progress advancing our pipeline and other strategic actions that will position AbbVie for top-tier growth through the
rest of the decade and beyond.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike. Mike?
Michael E. Severino
Thank you, Rick. It's an exciting time to be leading research and development at AbbVie. We have a broad and robust
pipeline that includes more than 40 active clinical development programs, including 10 programs in late-stage
development or under regulatory review. Our core areas of focus include immunology, where we're leveraging our
deep expertise to develop next-generation biologics and small molecules that elevate the standard of care.
Oncology, including assets to address both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. Neuroscience, with a particular
focus on developing disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer's and other neuro-degenerative conditions, and
virology, with an emphasis on continuing to evolve the HCV treatment landscape. We are also placing focused
investment in our late-stage programs in women's health with Elagolix, and renal disease with Atrasentan.

Today, I'll cover each of these areas and highlight some of our most promising programs. In immunology, we've
established clear leadership positions across therapeutic categories including rheumatology, dermatology and
gastroenterology, and we're leveraging our expertise to build upon these strong positions.
Our strategy is centered upon identifying treatments that offer differentiated profiles relative to currently available
therapies, with a goal of continuing to raise the standard of care. We have several promising assets in development,
including two oral selective JAK1 inhibitors, several biologics and a bispecific biologic currently in mid-stage trials.
Most advanced are our two selective JAK1 inhibitors on the cusp of completing mid-stage development in RA. As Rick
mentioned, earlier this year, our partner, Galapagos, announced positive top line interim data from two Phase IIb
studies in RA. Over the next few months, we'll evaluate data from our internal program, ABT-494, and make decisions
about next steps.
We also believe our DVD-Ig antibody platform holds tremendous promise in the treatment of immune-mediated
conditions. ABT-122 is our combination anti-TNF, anti-IL17, two validated mechanisms in Phase II trials for RA and
psoriatic arthritis. Our early development work with the DVD platform has established that our DVDs have favorable
drug-like properties similar to monoclonal antibodies and can be manufactured reliably. We'll see data from our
mid-stage trial in RA in early 2016. And we have other promising mechanisms in development, including in IL-6
nanobody, as well as several early-stage programs.
Finally, in immunology, we continue to innovate with HUMIRA. We have new indications and formulations in
late-stage development. We recently received a positive opinion from the EMA for hidradenitis suppurativa, and we
expect a U.S. regulatory decision in the second half of this year. We also received EMA approval for a new HUMIRA
formulation, specifically designed to reduce injection pain and reduce injection volume compared to the current
formulation. This new formulation is currently under review by the FDA. And we're on track to submit our U.S. and
European regulatory applications for uveitis in the second half, following the recent completion and positive results
from our second pivotal trial.
The acquisition of Pharmacyclics significantly accelerated AbbVie's clinical and commercial presence in oncology.
With IMBRUVICA, we've established a leadership position in the treatment of blood cancers, and we're
well-positioned to build upon that strength with other promising assets in development. Within the hematologic
oncology space, we have three novel mechanisms that are either on market or in registration-enabling trials: BTK, PI3
kinase, and BCL-2 inhibition. We're well-positioned to continue to evolve the treatment landscape with innovative
combinations of these and other mechanisms. Our goal is to markedly improve efficacy by achieving deep, durable
disease control and/or remission.
As I mentioned, IMBRUVICA represents our first foray into this therapeutic category. And we're pleased to continue –
and we're pleased with the continued progress we've seen with IMBRUVICA since the close of the acquisition. At the
recent ASCO meeting, we and our co-development partner, Janssen, presented data from the Phase III HELIOS trial,
which studies the combination of bendamustine and rituximab, or BR, with or without IMBRUVICA in
relapsed/refractory CLL. The study demonstrated that IMBRUVICA improves outcomes when combined with BR,
illustrating that IMBRUVICA is not only effective as a single agent, but is also potent and safe when used in
combination.
We also announced top line results from the Phase III RESONATE-2 trial comparing IMBRUVICA monotherapy to
chlorambucil in patients aged 65 or older with previously untreated CLL. The results illustrate that treatment with
IMBRUVICA improved progression-free survival and multiple secondary endpoints, including overall survival in the
first line setting. We plan to present and publish the full results and we'll submit the data to regulatory authorities in the
second half, building upon our existing set of indications and expanding into the front-line CLL setting.
We've also continued to make progress with our first-in-class BCL-2 inhibitor, venetoclax. At the recent EHA meeting,
we presented updated study results showing patients with relapsed/refractory CLL taking venetoclax in combination
with rituximab had an overall response rate of 84%, with 41% of patients achieving a complete response. While early,
these encouraging results speak to the valuable role venetoclax may play in novel combinations with the potential to

restate standard of care in a variety of B-cell malignancies.
We recently received the FDA's breakthrough therapy designation for venetoclax in relapsed/refractory patients with a
17p deletion genetic mutation. We plan to present the data that supported this designation at the upcoming ASH
meeting, and we remain on track to submit our regulatory applications for the 17p deletion indication by the end of
2015.
Our hematologic oncology pipeline also includes duvelisib, a dual PI3 kinase gamma/delta inhibitor being investigated
for the treatment of a wide range of blood cancers. And we are partnered with Bristol-Myers Squibb on elotuzumab, a
monoclonal antibody targeting CS1, a protein primarily expressed on the surface of myeloma cells in late-stage
development for front-line and relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.
Data from the Phase 3 study in relapsed/refractory patients recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine
showed that adding elotuzumab to standard treatment significantly reduced the risk of disease progression. We expect
our partner to submit regulatory applications for the syndication this year.
We are also leveraging this mechanism within the context of our antibody-drug conjugate platform with ABBV-838, an
anti-CS1 ADC currently in early-stage clinical development.
Our pipeline also includes late-stage assets in development for the treatment of solid tumors. Veliparib is our PARP
inhibitor, being investigated as a treatment for several solid tumor types. In contrast to other PARP inhibitors in
development which are being evaluated as monotherapy, specifically in cancers with inherited genetic deficiencies in
DNA-repair and in later lines of therapy, we've taken a different approach with veliparib.
We have numerous ongoing Phase 3 trials evaluating veliparib in combination with common DNA-damaging
hemotherapies in a wide range of clinical settings. Veliparib has demonstrated promising signals of efficacy and is
currently in late-stage development for breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. Additionally, we plan to evaluate
veliparib in combination with checkpoint inhibitors with clinical trials planned for 2016.
We're leveraging our strong capabilities in protein engineering with ABT-414, our antibody-drug conjugate for
glioblastoma multiforme or GBM. GBM is the most common and most aggressive type of malignant primary brain
tumor. The early data for ABT-414 are promising and we recently initiated additional single-arm studies and a
randomized, controlled trial in second-line GBM, which could provide a pathway to registration if the data are
consistent with earlier phase studies.
Certainly, the area of the immuno-oncology has recently garnered significant attention. We have an active discovery
program with an objective to drive the next wave of immuno-oncology development beyond checkpoint inhibitors. We
are particularly focused on the use of our bispecific platform to support conditional activation of the immune system in
the vicinity of tumor cells, and we are leveraging the emerging science of soluble T-cell receptor technology as well.
We anticipate multiple immuno-oncology assets moving into the clinic in the 2016 timeframe.
Our virology franchise will be a significant growth driver for us in 2015 and in the years to come. With the launch of
VIEKIRA, we have established a meaningful position in the HCV market, and our current position will serve as a base
from which we will launch further innovation. We are on track with our next-generation HCV program to bring to
market a ribavirin-free, once-daily, pan-genotypic combination with high rates of efficacy and a competitive duration
of therapy.
Earlier this year, we disclosed preliminary results from a Phase 2b study of our next-generation protease inhibitor,
ABT-493; and our next-generation NS5A inhibitor, ABT-530. The interim data showed that treatment with our
next-generation combination in non-cirrhotic genotype 1a and 1b treatment-naïve and -experienced patients receiving
the ribavirin-free therapy for 12 weeks resulted in an SVR4 rate of 99%.
Today, I'm pleased to report that the SVR12 results are equally impressive. In fact, the dose we intend to pursue in
Phase 3 drove an SVR12 rate of 100%.

Evaluation in other genotypes continues to progress with encouraging results, and we are also evaluating shorter
duration of therapy with this combination. We expect to present data from the Phase 2 studies at the AASLD Meeting
later this year. And we remain on track to advance in the Phase 3 development this year, with commercialization
expected in 2017.
In neuroscience, we're focused on pursuing transformational therapies for the treatment of conditions like Alzheimer's
disease, Parkinson's, MS and other neurodegenerative conditions.
In ZINBRYTA, our investigational biologic for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis is currently under regulatory
review in the U.S. and Europe, with regulatory decisions expected in the first half of 2016. The filings are based upon
strong pivotal trial results which demonstrated patients treated with ZINBRYTA had a statistically significant 45%
reduction in annualized relapse rate versus AVONEX, an established standard of care.
Given the product profile, novel mechanism of action and it's once-monthly subcutaneous administration, we believe
ZINBRYTA has the potential to be an important therapeutic option.
We're also in the early stages of our U.S. launch of DUOPA for advanced Parkinson's disease, which was approved
earlier this year. We are continuing to innovate with DUOPA, working on drug delivery improvements and moving
toward less invasive approaches and continued improvements in the DUOPA pump.
We also have numerous early-stage neuroscience programs under way that have the potential to come to fruition in the
later years of our long-term plan. For example, earlier this year we entered into a collaboration with C2N Diagnostics
to develop and commercialize a portfolio of anti-tau antibodies for the treatment of serious brain disorders. Tau is a key
protein associated with the pathologic progression of Alzheimer's disease. And, like amyloid, tau also has the ability to
be imaged and tracked in the central nervous system.
We recently received an orphan drug designation and initiated a Phase 1 program in patients with progressive
supranuclear palsy, a rare and debilitating neurologic disease. We're on track to start clinical development with C2N in
Alzheimer's disease in 2016.
Finally, as I mentioned, we continue to make focused investment in our late-stage programs in renal disease and
women's health. Atrasentan is our internally-discovered selective endothelin antagonist in late-stage development for
the prevention of progression of diabetic kidney disease. A large global Phase 3 program is currently underway
evaluating the impact of Atrasentan on renal outcomes such as the onset of end-stage renal disease, transplantation or
death due to renal failure.
Elagolix is our compound in Phase 3 development for endometriosis and Phase 2b for uterine fibroids. Given the high
prevalence of these conditions and the current lack of treatment options, we view Elagolix as a significant opportunity.
Our goal with Elagolix in endometriosis is to bring to market an oral therapy that provides a high level of efficacy with
minimum menopausal side effects such as hot flash while preserving bone health.
Earlier this year, we announced positive top line results from the first of two ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials. Initial
results from the study showed that after six months of treatment, both doses of Elagolix met the study's co-primary
endpoints with a safety profile consistent with prior studies.
We have also now seen data from the six-month extension of the first Elagolix endometriosis pivotal study and the
results were consistent with previously reported efficacy and safety findings. We'll see top line results from the second
pivotal study in endometriosis in the first quarter of 2016, and we plan to disclose top line data from our Phase 2b trial
in uterine fibroid in the fall.
So in summary, since the start of the year we've made significant progress and are on track to advance several programs
in the coming months. We built a promising late-stage pipeline comprised of potentially transformational medicine
which will fuel our future growth.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for additional comments on the quarter and 2015. Bill?

William J. Chase
Thank you, Mike. This morning, I'll review our second quarter performance and provide an update on our outlook for
2015.
As Rick said, we are very pleased with the strong quarter we delivered. Operational growth on the top line was a very
strong 19.4%, excluding an 8.3% negative impact from foreign exchange. Reported sales were up more than 11%.
HUMIRA delivered global sales of more than $3.5 billion, up 16.4% on an operational basis. We continue to see strong
momentum for HUMIRA as the market leader around the world. On a reported basis, currency had a negative 8.8%
impact on global HUMIRA sales and reduced international HUMIRA sales by nearly 18%.
U.S. HUMIRA sales increased nearly 29%, driven by prescription volume and favorable pricing impacts. We've seen
acceleration in market growth this year in the U.S., with HUMIRA driving double-digit growth in the gastro, rheum
and derm segments. Wholesale inventory remain constant at less than half a month.
Internationally, HUMIRA sales have grown nearly 9% on an operational basis in the first half of the year, consistent
with our planning expectations. As we noted last quarter, the first quarter international growth rate of nearly 15% was
favorably impacted by the timing of shipments in select markets. Consequently, international sales growth in the
second quarter was negatively impacted by the shipment timing.
Market growth internationally remains strong, with most major markets experiencing double-digit growth. And
HUMIRA's international market share has remained stable despite new competitors and the launch of a biosimilar,
infliximab. HUMIRA's momentum has not been adversely impacted by the biosimilar.
For the full year 2015, we continue to expect global HUMIRA sales growth in the mid-teens on an operational basis.
This reflects a forecast for the U.S. growth approaching 30% and 9% to 10% operational growth internationally.
Global VIEKIRA sales in the quarter were $385 million. In the U.S., we are ramping share in our exclusive accounts
and have now achieved our target level of penetration in our largest contract. As we've said previously, the contribution
of the international launch has exceeded our planning expectations, which will lead to a higher mix of international
sales this year. International sales of VIEKIRA in the second half will also benefit from an expected approval in Japan,
where we'll commercial a two-drug once-daily ribavirin-free combination.
As Rick noted, total U.S. sales of IMBRUVICA in the quarter were strong at $234 million. Given the May 26 closing
date for the Pharmacyclics transaction, we recorded a partial quarter of IMBRUVICA sales, including $97 million of
U.S. sales and $10 million of international profit sharing.
For 2015, we anticipate Pharmacyclics adding more than $750 million to our top line for revenue occurring after the
May 26 closing date.
Global Lupron sales were $198 million in the quarter, up nearly 10% on an operational basis. For the full year 2015, we
expect Lupron sales to be roughly in line with 2014. U.S. sales of Synthroid were $187 million, up nearly 12% versus
the prior year quarter. For the full year 2015, we expect modest growth for Synthroid.
AndroGel sales were $170 million, down significantly due to continued market declines and the entry of generic
competition for the 1% formulation. We expect AndroGel sales somewhat above $500 million for the full year 2015.
U.S. Creon sales were $159 million in the quarter, up significantly from the prior year. We continue to capture the vast
majority of new prescription starts in the pancreatic enzyme market. We expect double-digit sales growth for Creon in
2015.
Sales of Duodopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease, grew more than 20% on an operational basis in the
quarter. We expect continued double-digit growth for Duodopa with a modest level of U.S. sales in 2015. Our U.S.
launch will be getting underway this quarter, and as we've said previously, we anticipate a gradual ramp for product
sales in the U.S. this year as physicians grow familiar with the product.

Turning to the P&L profile for the second quarter. Since becoming an independent company, we placed a high priority
on becoming more efficient and driving operating margin improvement. We're pleased with our progress in the quarter
as we delivered an adjusted operating margin of 44.2% of sales.
Excluding a modest negative impact from Pharmacyclics, our operating margin improved 820 basis points versus the
prior-year quarter. More than 500 basis points of this improvement was driven by efficiencies and P&L leverage.
We showed continued improvement in gross margin as a percentage of sales in the quarter. The adjusted gross margin
ratio was 85.3%, up 570 basis points from the prior-year quarter, driven by exchange, operational efficiencies and
product mix.
Adjusted R&D was 15.9% of sales, reflecting funding actions in support of our pipeline assets. Adjusted SG&A was
25.1% of sales in the quarter, down from the prior year, contributing to overall continued improvement and operating
margin leverage.
Adjusted net interest expense was $137 million, reflecting the impact of debt issued in conjunction with the
Pharmacyclics acquisition. The adjusted tax rate was 21.9% in the quarter. Second quarter adjusted earnings per share
excluding non-cash intangible amortization expense and specified items were $1.08, up 31.7% year-over-year and
exceeding our previous guidance range. On a GAAP basis, earnings per share were $0.83.
Moving on to our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are confirming our 2015 adjusted EPS guidance range of
$4.10 to $4.30. This range reflects EPS growth of 23% to nearly 30%. Our 2015 adjusted guidance range includes the
previously communicated $0.20 dilutive impact of the Pharmacyclics acquisition. It excludes $0.84 of intangible
amortization and specified costs, including Pharmacyclics transaction costs.
Regarding the P&L profile for 2015, the following estimates have been updated to include the impact of significant
foreign exchange and the Pharmacyclics acquisition.
On the top line, we expect revenue growth on an operational basis of roughly 20%. We are forecasting approximately
7% negative top line impact from currency this year, resulting in a reported sales growth of around 13%.
We are forecasting a significant increase in our operating margin profile, which we expect to reach approximately 42%
of sales in 2015. Excluding the negative impacts from the Pharmacyclics acquisition, we expect to deliver roughly 650
basis points of improvement over the prior year. About 500 basis points of this improvement results from efficiency
initiatives and leverage across the income statement.
We are forecasting an adjusted gross margin ratio approaching 83%. This is an increase from our original guidance
reflecting significant year-over-year improvement driven by the impact of exchange, product mix and actions we've
taken to further improve our margin profile.
We will continue to invest in our pipeline, supporting our exciting opportunities on oncology, HCV, immunology and
other areas. We are forecasting R&D expense of approximately 16% of sales, and we expect to continue investing in
our growth brands with SG&A levels at approximately 25% of sales.
We are now forecasting net interest expense of about $625 million for the full year, including the incremental debt from
the Pharmacyclics acquisition. And we continue to expect an adjusted tax rate in the 22% range in 2015.
Regarding the third quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $1.05 to $1.07. This excludes roughly $0.14 of
specified items and non-cash amortization and includes the impact of Pharmacyclics dilution. We expect third quarter
revenue growth on an operational basis in the low 20 percentage range, excluding approximately 7% negative impact
from exchange.
So in conclusion, we're very pleased with the level of quality in the quarter and our performance in the first half of
2015. We have driven strong top and bottom line growth and delivered operating margin expansion while also
advancing our strategic priorities. This puts us in a strong position to deliver top tier industry growth this year and in
the years to come.

And with that, I'll turn it back over to Larry.
Larry Peepo
Thanks, Bill. We'll now open the call up for questions. Operator, we'll take our first question, please.
Q&A
Operator
Okay, sir. Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question
comes from Ms. Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs. Ma'am, [indiscernible] (37:04).
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you very much. Hope you guys can hear me okay. With respect to HUMIRA international
sales, you pointed to shipment timing, tough comparisons and FX as reasons for the underperformance. But wouldn't
Remicade biosimilars be the real culprit here? What evidence specifically can you share with us that suggests that this
quarter performance was more of a one-timer versus a new trend? I mean maybe you can share what you've seen in
terms of market share changes, et cetera.
And then a question for you, Rick, on potential for U.S. biosimilars. As you know, Amgen filed an IPR on two
long-dated patents. Maybe you can talk to those patents that are being challenged and put that into the context of your
broader patent defense strategy. Thanks very much.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Thanks. All right, Jami. Jami, this is Rick. Good morning. I'll take the first question and
let Laura Schumacher answer the second question for you. So, it's a good question, and I'm going to answer your
question, I'd say, very directly and very clearly because I want to make sure that there's no misunderstanding or
confusion around this issue. But the bottom line when we're all done is I will tell you that we have seen no impact from
Remicade biosimilar on HUMIRA in the international market, but I'll give you some color to be able to support that.
So, I'm going to go back to the first quarter. When we announced first quarter results, if you look at Bill's formal
remarks, in his remarks we identified the fact that they benefited from shipment timing. And that is exactly what we're
seeing here and I'll tell you that the impact we're seeing here is consistent with what we expected in that.
The second thing I'd tell you is that when we put out the original guidance on HUMIRA, both at the beginning of the
year and then when we raised guidance, within that guidance range we had assumed international performance growth
of HUMIRA at 9% to 10%. If you look at the performance in the first quarter, we delivered 14.9% growth in the first
quarter. Second quarter was 3.6%. The average for the two quarters or the first half of the year is 8.8%. We are
confirming now explicitly that the second half is forecasted internationally to be 9% to 10%, which is exactly what it
was in the original guidance. We're also confirming the original guidance.
So obviously, if you thought we were sitting here with our toes hanging over the edge of the cliff, that would be an
awfully foolish thing to do. So, I can tell you we absolutely have no concerns around that.
So, let's talk specifically around what we're seeing with biosimilars, and I'll give you a little bit of facts maybe to
support it. So, the biosimilar Remicade has been approved now in 46 countries. It's actually launched in about 36 of
those countries. They participated in five national tenders and they participated in about 11 regional hospital tenders.
If we look at the markets that they've been in for more than a year to be able to measure what their market share is,
their total market share is 2.8%. So, they haven't had any meaningful impact. We measure every one of those markets
that they're in. We've been doing it from the very beginning.
Any one of those markets, HUMIRA continues to grow, as we would have expected it. We don't see any impact from –
nor did we expect any impact in Remicade biosimilars within those markets. We obviously continue to watch that.

If we look at the pricing within those markets, the median discount versus the innovator is about 25% off. For the ones
that were tendered, it's a little over 50% off, which again is in the range of what we would have expected. The reaction
that we're seeing in the market is consistent with what we expected.
And so, I would just tell you that it's playing out as we anticipated. Now, we need to continue to monitor, but I can tell
you that we don't have any concerns in that area as we would have expected.
So, the reality is this is nothing more than movement of shipments between a handful of countries. I'll give you a
couple of examples maybe to make you feel a little bit better. So if you take France, which I know there's been a lot of
public concern about France. If you look at our growth rate in the first quarter and our growth rate in the second
quarter, they're almost identical. If you look at Canada, our growth rate accelerated between first and second quarter. If
you look at the Netherlands, our growth rate accelerated between first and second quarter.
Now, there are countries where clearly we saw tenders move around. They weren't in the countries that we're impacted
by biosimilars, they were due to other events. So, the reality is this is nothing more than shipment timing. Did I answer
your question?
<A - Larry Peepo>: I think we might have muted her line. Laura...
<A - Laura J. Schumacher>: The IPR.
<A - Larry Peepo>: ...go ahead on the IPR.
<A - Laura J. Schumacher>: With respect to your question about Amgen's IPR, as we've said before, we have a broad
portfolio of IP covering manufacturing, process, formulation and methods of use. Amgen's IPR does not impact our
patent defense strategy. We don't know why Amgen selected the two formulation patents that it did to potentially
challenge an IPR, but it does give some perspective on the breadth of our IP, including over 40 additional patents that
are not a subject of the IPR.
<A - Larry Peepo>: Thanks, Jami. Operator, we'll take our next question, please.
Operator
Okay, sir. Our next question comes from Mr. Jeff Holford of Jefferies. Sir, your line is open.
<Q - Jeffrey Holford>: Hi. There just still seem to be a lot of noise on the line, it's not coming from me. But first
question is on new HUMIRA, the one you just had approved in Europe. Can you just give us a bit more color around
some numerical data, whatever you have around the clinical differentiators you seem to have there on pain and
injection volume. Just give us a bit more review whether the label that you're getting is going to help you potentially do
hard switches in some of the markets you were thinking about and how this product could help you in the future
potentially as a biosimilar defense mechanism because that's not entirely clear from this.
And then just on VIEKIRA contracts in the U.S., could you just give us any updates on how these actually are playing
versus how you thought they were going to, just on the metrics that you're looking at? And then just the last question
around VIEKIRA, does your run rate for the last quarter of the year, the $3 billion run rate that you're looking at, does
that assume a full quarter of Japan? How important is that in your mind at achieving that run rate? Thanks very much.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Okay, very good. So, Jeff, this is Rick. I'll answer most of the first question. Let me see if
Mike maybe able to add a little bit of specificity.
So, were two benefits that the new formulation was designed to do. We know that there are patients who ultimately
stop therapy with the current product because of the pain that they feel upon injection. So, we know that's an important
driver of adherence of the product. And so, we designed this product as a differentiation.
The clinical data, Mike, I don't recall the specific numbers. Do you recall the actual percent?

<A - Michael E. Severino>: This is Mike. So, there are data in the studies that were submitted to regulatory agencies.
We're still waiting on a final labeling in the U.S. and in Europe. So, I think it's probably a bit [indiscernible] (45:08)...
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: [indiscernible] (45:08)
<A - Michael E. Severino>: ...numbers that might be in labeling. But we have test this in the course of the clinical
development program.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: What I would say is it's a significant reduction in pain, a very significant reduction in
pain. The second part is that this will also allow us to ultimately reduce the volume of injection – volume, and therefore
potentially over time reduce the number of injections, particularly on the loading dose.
So as you said before, this is an incremental improvement to the product. We think it's a meaningful improvement.
We've obviously studied the different kinds of things that we could do to HUMIRA. We have other things that we're
continuing to work on, but we think these are a meaningful opportunity to be able to launch the product.
We haven't formally decided exactly how the product will launch or at least formally announce how the product will
launch. So, I'm not going to talk to any details around whether or not it'll be a full conversion or ultimately a phased-in
kind of an approach based on certain countries. And so, that's essentially how we see the product and we do think it'll
be differentiated in a significant enough way that it'll have both a material impact on HUMIRA itself, HUMIRA's
performance itself, as well as a differentiator versus competitors.
So on VIEKIRA pack as far as contracting is concerned, I'd say the contracting hasn't changed a lot in the U.S. from the
last time we talked on the call. As we indicated, we had a number of exclusive contracts that were coming online in that
April, May, June kind of timeframe. They're now up and running. We are ramping within those particular contracts. I'd
say we're ramping within the expectations that we expected. If you look at our single largest customer in the U.S. that's
an exclusive, we've now reached peak share there. And so, ultimately, we've reached the level of share that we had
anticipated and it's a very high level of share.
And so now, the rest of the growth will be around driving these incremental contracts and then also driving additional
share gains within the parity accounts and the non-exclusive accounts. And that's the work that goes on day by day by
day.
As far as the $3 billion running rate that we've talked about before, I'd say we're still tracking against that, U.S.
specifically. Is Japan important? It does assume that we have a full quarter of Japan, and I would say Japan is an
important market for us. Now based on everything that we know today in the competitiveness of that product and
where we are in the regulatory cycle, I think we should get a full quarter's worth of Japan, potentially even maybe a
little bit better than that.
As we look at VIEKIRA, the only thing I'd say is when we originally launched VIEKIRA, our expectation was that we
would build this into a meaningful product for us. And then, position ourselves so that as we launch a next-generation
asset, which as you know we've described as a pan-genotypic ribavirin-free QD product, and the profile of
next-generation is maintaining consistent with what we would've expected, that then with the launch of that we will
continue to gain further share with that product as we introduced that product in the marketplace.
If we look at our performance so far, I think we're up – I don't know – 67% quarter-over-quarter. If you look at just the
second quarter running rate, it says the product is tracking at about $1.5 billion product and continuing to grow nicely.
The international side of the business obviously has performed better than the U.S. I think the U.S. has not met our
expectations. I think we understand why, and we're continuing to work on that. But certainly, the international market
is performing incrementally better than what we expected.
And so, I think everything that we're looking at right now would suggest that that should be a solid number. I'd say
there are three factors that are important for that to happen, and we're continuing to monitor those three things. One is
we have seen patient volumes in the U.S., overall volumes in the market, decline. The latest data would suggest
genotype-1 patients are down around 175,000, 180,000 now on an annualized basis. We're assuming that's the level that
it will stabilize at. And I think the data would suggest that that is a reasonable assumption.

Second assumption is that the VA has run into funding difficulties, so the level of patients that they're treating is down.
And we are assuming starting October 1 that they will get additional funds and they will come back up to the level that
we saw in the earlier part of the year.
And then, the third assumption obviously is Japan that we just talked about. So, those are the three things that I think
will drive the ultimate performance.
I guess the last thing I'd say is if you look at our overall performance in the first half and both in second quarter, I think
it demonstrates the strength of the business that we have here. If you look at consensus, we were slightly off the
consensus number for VIEKIRA this quarter, but yet we over-performed. And we over-performed because we
delivered better operational efficiency, we delivered over-performance in other areas. And the balance of our business
and our ability to be able to still deliver strong performance even when there are changes, I think, should be, one,
reassuring to investors and, two, it demonstrates the strength of the overall business.
<Q - Jeffrey Holford>: Thanks. That's very helpful color, and congratulations on a great IMBRUVICA number.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Thanks.
<A - Larry Peepo>: Thanks, Jeff. Next question, operator?
Operator
Our next question comes from Mr. Marc Goodman of UBS. Sir, your line is open.
<Q - Marc Goodman>: Yes, morning. First of all, you have a guidance range that's pretty wide. I was just wondering
why you didn't tighten it this quarter. Second, you talked about immuno-oncology, you would have multiple assets in
the clinic by next year. Can you talk about are these going to be similar types of assets to PD-1, PD-L, things like that,
or are they kind of the next wave of products?
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Okay. This is Rick, I'll cover the first one. I mean, we haven't narrowed the guidance
range yet. We probably will here as we get closer to third quarter, the guidance range. And I'd say the primary reason
for that is foreign exchange has certainly been more challenging than we anticipated. And we want to see how that
plays out. We told investors that we were going to cover foreign exchange that we weren't going to do – we weren't
going to pass that on.
And so, we just want to see another quarter's worth of performance here and what foreign exchange does over that
period of time to feel more comfortable that when we narrow the range, we're within a range that we're comfortable
with. It's just that simple. And then, Mike, why don't you talk about immuno-oncology.
<A - Michael E. Severino>: Certainly. With respect to immuno-oncology, we're really referring to the next wave of
programs. These would be things beyond PD-1, PL-1 or perhaps things that might combine well with those
mechanisms. But we're looking at driving for treatment results that can't be achieved today. So, we would be referring
to novel mechanisms.
<A - Larry Peepo>: Thanks, Marc. Operator, we'll take our next question, please.

<Q - Alex Arfaei>: Regarding HUMIRA, you mentioned you're seeing accelerated market growth in the U.S. Very
impressive U.S. performance, by the way. Are you seeing increased penetration of biologics in these markets or is it
overall volume growth or both? And can you provide more color on some of the efficiencies we're seeing – some of the
operating efficiencies we're seeing? Where are you cutting and why? Thank you.
<A - William J. Chase>: So Alex, on HUMIRA, if you look at the U.S., it's really been a remarkable story. If you look
at market growth last year, it was in the 6% range, that has now moved to about a 13%. We've held that pretty steady
across the quarter. So, what that's a sign of is that the SG&A that we've put behind the brand continues to work and it
continues to give a positive return.
And the way that that growth is delivered is in fact by penetration as well as improved patient compliance and a
number of other things. But there's definitely a penetration element, that is the big growth driver in this market. And as
you know, all of the immuno – autoimmune segments are relatively underpenetrated versus what you would expect,
given the power of a biologic. So, that is a big part of the story.
In terms of efficiencies, look, we've been focused on efficiencies from the very beginning. Now they shake out in a
number of different places. In manufacturing, they are the traditional efficiencies you would expect whether it be
purchasing, better utilization of plants or in some cases, even taking offline nonproductive capacity. We've done all of
those sorts of things.
Across the P&L though, leverage itself presents a different type of efficiency, right. We're obviously no longer in a
situation where we need to grow expense at the same rate as the top line. In fact, if you look at our expense growth
particularly on SG&A, it is far, far, far below what the top line is growing and that's pretty much the new model for this
business now that we've made the investments we needed to make back in 2013 and 2014, and we're on track to start
delivering growth through the introduction of new products in 2015 and beyond. So there's really two different types of
efficiencies in the numbers.
<Q - Alex Arfaei>: Thank you.
<A - Larry Peepo>: Thanks, Alex. Next question, please, operator.

Our next question comes from Mr. Mark Schoenebaum from Evercore ISI. Sir, your line is open.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Okay. Hey, guys. Thanks a lot for the transparency. Always the most detailed prepared
remarks of any company – any big company, so thanks for that. I just want to go back to the central point that others
have asked about, because the stock is off right now, and the consistent feedback I'm getting is that people are just very
concerned about the rest of world HUMIRA numbers. So my question is really simple. One, what was the sequential
volume growth for rest of world HUMIRA? Two, what was the average change in price quarter-on-quarter in the 2Q,
please?
And then my second question, if I may, is you guys, I think, have mentioned, that you might contemplate an Analyst
Meeting where you might provide some long-term financial targets or vision and go over the pipeline. And then you
had contemplated this once the PCYC deal is closed. So I'd just like to know what your current thinking is on that.
Thank you and congratulations on a great stock move this quarter.
<A - William J. Chase>: Thanks, Mark. So, Mark, on HUMIRA, the volume growth quarter-over-quarter was slightly
above 10% overall. Price was 6% on a global basis.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Do you have just rest of world?
<A - William J. Chase>: Rest of world had negative price of 4.1% and volume was up over 7%.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: The volume was up over 7% rest of world. Okay.

<A - William J. Chase>: Yeah.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Got it. People are very confused out there. Thank you.
<A - William J. Chase>: Thank you.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: And then Mark, this is Rick. On the Analyst Meeting, yeah, it is something we are still
considering. I think as you indicated maybe in one of your remarks, I think timing-wise, if we decide to do it, it
probably will be at the beginning of the year, maybe timed with a major meeting where it would be convenient for
investors to be able to participate. We haven't made a final decision yet, but we will communicate something around
that at some point here, probably third quarter.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: And just to confirm the HUMIRA numbers, those are sequential, correct?
<A - William J. Chase>: Quarter-over-quarter, 2015 versus 2014.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Do you have the sequential numbers, 1Q this year versus 2Q? And then I'll stop.
<A - William J. Chase>: I don't have them handy because we don't typically look at it that way. I would say price
would be relatively flat quarter-to-quarter. Price would be probably down about maybe 2% quarter-over-quarter, but I
don't have a firm volume number for you. Can we follow up with you on that?
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Was it up though? Was it positive?
<A - William J. Chase>: Yes.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: It was positive. Okay. Thank you.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: It was price positive? He's asking...
<A - William J. Chase>: No, price was negative.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Okay.
<A - William J. Chase>: But volume was positive.

Our next question comes from Mr. Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Sir, your line is open.
<Q - Christopher T. Schott>: Great. Thanks very much for the questions. Just a couple quick ones here. First, can you
just quantify the impact to gross margins from FX in the quarter and in the annual guidance? I just want to get a better
sense of what type of underlying growth we're seeing on that gross margin line as we're going through the year here.
The second question was on the IL-17. Just would be interested in your perspective on what those products are going to
kind of mean for the psoriasis market and as you think about HUMIRA over time. And the final one, and sorry just to
come back just to clarify some of the earlier comments on the new HUMIRA formulation and launch dynamics. Just
want to make sure I understood the comments. Should we think about when this product launches, it's going to
basically fully replace the prior version of HUMIRA and whatever countries it goes out in, or is this going to be a
conversion-type process where you have to go physicians, get them to select the new version somewhat of a gradual
process. Just want to try to make sure I understood your earlier comments. Thanks very much.
<A - William J. Chase>: So, Chris, on gross margin – I'm just going to give you some numbers – so, our gross margin
was up about 570 basis points. Pharmacyclics diluted that by about 50 basis points. So, if you exclude Pharmacyclics,

we were up 620 basis points, just over half of that was exchange. And then for the year, very similar story, different
numbers, but similar story. Gross margin, we're forecasting up around 300 basis points. Pharmacyclics will have about
90 basis points to a point – 90 basis points to a full point impact. So, net-net, excluding Pharmacyclics, you'd expect to
see about a 400-basis-point improvement of which, again, just slightly over half is exchange.
<A - Michael E. Severino>: Okay. So, this is Mike. I'll take the second component of your question. With respect to
the IL-17s, I think clearly the IL-17s in plaque psoriasis demonstrates very strong efficacy. There are areas where their
profile is not quite as compelling, in psoriatic arthritis, for example. The initial uptake of the 17s [IL-17s] has been
relatively slow. We would expect the dermatologists would take some time to become comfortable with the new
mechanism before they would adopt it. So, we feel comfortable about the trajectory of HUMIRA in the psoriasis space
for quite some time.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Okay. And on the new formulation, I mean we really can't talk specifically about what
the strategy will be because it's somewhat conditioned on the regulatory approval, and we don't have regulatory
approvals yet all around the world. But there probably will be situations where it will be a replacement product,
meaning it will replace not over a very short period of time, but over a relatively short period of time. As inventory runs
out of the old product, the new product will replace the old product and we'll only maintain the new product in the
marketplace. I would say that will probably be the predominant model that's out there but it might not be the exclusive
model that's out there, depending upon the regulatory approvals.
<Q - Christopher T. Schott>: Thanks very much.
<A - Larry Peepo>: Thanks, Chris. Next question, please.

Our next question comes from Mr. Robyn Karnauskas of Deutsche Bank. Sir, your line is open.
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Hello. It's Mr. Robyn Karnauskas. Thanks for taking my question.
<A - Larry Peepo>: Nice to meet you.
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: All right. So, two quick questions. One you didn't mention anything about celiac disease.
I'm wondering if you could comment on did the program fail or are you still interested in that program? Second
question, on HUMIRA 2, the new HUMIRA, do you think we'll be able to track that in any way, will it be given a
different name? Just wondering like how the Street will be able to monitor that as it has an uptake.
And then the last question, big picture, for your RA franchise, given that it looks like you don't have to go through the
patent dance and Amgen's filing an IPR which can speed up sort of the clarity around when they're actually going to
launch. How do you view the timelines for some of your emerging RA drugs and whether it's important to get them on
the market sooner, or whether or not you'll still be okay if Amgen's biosimilar hits ahead of their launch? Thanks
<A - Michael E. Severino>: So, this is Mike. With respect to celiac disease, we're still evaluating the opportunity and
we've not reached a decision point yet.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Okay. Robyn, this is Rick. I'll cover the HUMIRA formulation. Again, it's consistent
with what I've described to you before. It will depend upon the regulatory approval, so we don't know the answer to
that yet. It could be that it has the exact same name as the current product, and therefore, you wouldn't necessarily have
any direct visibility to it. It could be HUMIRA plus some designation after HUMIRA, and therefore, we would be able
to track or you would be able to track it in some separate fashion. So we're going to have to see how that plays out
before I can give you an accurate answer.
And then, I'd just say on the big picture piece, I'd say the IPR doesn't necessarily change anything that we thought
about before from a timing standpoint. As we've said, and as Laura mentioned a moment ago, we have a broad group of
or portfolio of IP. We have some very important patents in this area, and we intend to enforce those patents, and this

IPR process won't affect those timelines as we've assumed it.
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Okay. Great. Thank you.
<A - Larry Peepo>: Thanks, Robyn. Operator, we have time for one more question, please.
Operator
Okay, sir. Our last question comes from Mr. Steve Scala from Cowen. Sir, your line is open.
<Q - Steve M. Scala>: Thank you. And thanks for the R&D overview. AbbVie really does have an impressive
pipeline. On the new HUMIRA formulation, what portion of the current patients on HUMIRA have issues with pain
and/or volume? What additional IP protection does it offer? And then third, it sounds like there's a bit of hedging on the
prior VIEKIRA guidance of annualizing at $3 billion, exiting 2015. Am I wrong? Thank you.
<A - Larry Peepo>: Thanks, Steve.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: All right, Steve. This is Rick. I guess I'll do the last one first. I was trying to describe to
you the elements that will drive our overall performance in VIEKIRA. If I sounded like I was hedging, I apologize for
that.
It is our goal to still hit the number that we described to you. So I was trying to describe to you the elements associated
with it. As far as the details around percentage of patients, I mean, I don't recall it offhand. I'd say, there's a fairly
substantial percentage of patients that when they first go on the drug do experience or express concern about pain upon
injection. The vast majority of those patients obviously worked through it and stay on the drug. But it's not an
insignificant percentage of patients that see – that we see that experience at the beginning of their use of the product.
And as far as volume, it's more of a practical thing. At the end of the day, if you inject less volume, obviously that
helps with the pain as well, assuming it's not more viscous or has some other reason why it would have pain. But if you
– as you get less volume in the indications where you have loading doses, there would be a substantial benefit there
where you could go from multiple loading doses to one loading dose as an example in certain conditions. And I think
that will be a significant benefit for patients.
<Q - Steve M. Scala>: And the IP?
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: I mean, essentially, it has IP associated with it. I'd say this is really a strategy to
differentiate the product. Obviously, you have IP around this particular formulation. I think that IP will protect this
particular formulation. As we've described, I think, a couple of times before, we don't view this as an absolute block.
When you think about our biosimilar strategy, it's a number of things that have all been put together, a very large
portfolio of IP, some of that IP is very broad and very challenging, I think, for someone to work around.
New formulations that help differentiate the product, a commercial strategy, when and if biosimilars launch, and then
our pipeline of new assets to be able to move into this market. And I'd say although we tend not to probably ever get
there in any meaningful way, maybe one of the exciting things that we see internally is if you look at the data that
we've seen around the JAK1 hypothesis that we have is playing out, and it's playing in a very positive way. And I think
it's a profile of a drug that we believe could have a meaningful impact in the marketplace and I think that will be an
important product for us to advance and get into the marketplace.
And then also ABT-122, I think as we talk about an IL-17 combined with the TNF, as we see that data, I think that
product could have a very meaningful place in the market as well. And so, I think we're gaining a lot of encouragement
about derisking that mid-stage pipeline to ensure that we have some products that will follow on with HUMIRA.
<Q - Steve M. Scala>: Thank you.
