Thomas A. Kennedy
Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone. This morning, Raytheon reported solid second quarter operating results.
Sales exceeded our guidance, increasing by 3% over second quarter 2014. This was driven by IDS and missiles and
was primarily organic.
With this solid revenue performance, we now see an opportunity for top-line growth in 2015. EPS and cash flow also
exceeded our expectations in the quarter. This performance demonstrates that our focus on global growth is succeeding.
As a result, we've updated our financial outlook to reflect our solid year-to-date performance and the acquisition of
Websense in late May. Toby will walk you through those details in a few minutes.
Global demand for advanced technologies drove an 11.9% increase in bookings in the quarter compared to the second
quarter of 2014. International bookings were particularly strong, representing 46% of total bookings, led by the $2
billion Saudi Patriot award, as well as a number of missile awards.
Domestic bookings were also solid with awards from across our portfolio, including Standard Missile-3, Evolved
Seasparrow Missile, next-generation radars for P-8 Maritime Aircraft, as well as $626 million in classified awards at
both SAS and IIS. Given the strength of our overall bookings year-to-date, we now expect full-year 2015 bookings to
be approximately $24.5 billion plus or minus $500 million.
The Raytheon team and I had the opportunity to meet with many of our global customers last month at the Paris Air
Show. The feedback reinforced what we've been seeing over the last year. That is, many of them are investing in strong
defense to deter evolving threats.
I would note that compared to the Farnborough Air Show last year, the demand to strengthen the deterrence has
increased, particularly from our customers in Eastern Europe, the Middle East/North Africa, and the Asia Pacific
region.
We see this increased demand reflected in our results. For example, at the end of the second quarter of 2015,
approximately 44% of our total backlog was international, a new high for the company. This compares to 38% at the
end of the second quarter 2014. Total backlog increased $1.5 billion year-over-year to $34.5 billion. This is important
because it sets the stage for growth and provides future margin expansion opportunity.
I'd like to take a moment to further highlight our missile business. As many of you know, Raytheon is a premier
provider of missile and ship defense systems. Whether it's for newbuild or upgrading existing ships, most of them will
have one or more Raytheon missile systems solutions on them. Our core product within this domain is our Standard
Missile family of interceptors.
Standard Missile 6, also known as SM-6, is designed to provide over-the-horizon defense against aircraft and anti-ship
cruise missiles. In the second quarter, an SM-6 successfully intercepted a supersonic target in an over-the-horizon test,
a key demonstration of the missile's capability.
Further, SM-6 moved from low-rate initial production to full-rate production in the second quarter. We also received a
$143 million booking in the quarter, which drove year-to-date bookings for SM-6 to approximately $215 million.
Another version of our Standard Missile is SM-3, which is used by the U.S. Navy to intercept short- to
intermediate-range ballistic missile threats. This is one of the company's largest programs. In the second quarter, we
received a $512 million award for the IB version of this missile, supporting the ongoing ramp-up in production.
The SM-3 IB will be deployed on the U.S. and allied Navy ships. It will also be deployed at the end of the year on land
in Europe as an integral part of the Phased Adaptive Approach missile defense system. The next generation of SM-3
has also taken flight. In the second quarter, SM-3 IIA, which we are developing in partnership with Japan, had its first
flight test, which was successful and is expected to enter production later in the decade.

Taken altogether, standard missile programs have driven over $800 million of bookings year-to-date. Beyond Standard
Missile, the Missile business segment is also benefiting from significant demand for a wide range of other solutions,
including global demand for Paveway, and the Evolved Seasparrow Missile, which saw strong bookings in the quarter.
Our Missile portfolio was well-aligned with the evolving priorities of our global customers and that provides a strong
foundation for our future growth.
Looking at our domestic market, from a broader perspective, the defense budget environment remains fluid. While
there have been positive signs coming from Washington, there are still differences between Congress and the
administration in their approaches to fund fiscal year 2016 defense spending. Additional time may be needed to resolve
these differences, which increases the probability of another continuing resolution this fall. We've had CRs for the past
several years. We would not expect a significant impact on our results should we have another one this year.
Now turning to our capital deployment strategy. As part of our balanced approach, we are increasing our expectation
for the share repurchase program. We now expect the share repurchase for full-year 2015 to be around $1 billion,
which represents a $250 million increase both over 2014 and our original expectation for 2015. This follows a 10.7%
increase in the dividend in the first quarter and the Websense transaction in May.
As I mentioned, we closed on the Websense acquisition in the second quarter and the integration is on track. The
combination of Raytheon and Websense is a great fit, allowing us to bring our advanced cybersecurity capabilities to
government and commercial customers around the world. We welcome Websense employees to the Raytheon team.
Overall, I'm pleased with our performance in the quarter. The members of our team are proud and passionate about
what they do for our global customers, our investors, and our company, and their focus and enthusiasm contributed to
our success and helped drive our results. I would like to thank the Raytheon team for its hard work and dedication.
With that, let me turn it over to Toby.
Anthony F. O'Brien
Okay. Thanks, Tom. I have a few opening remarks, starting with the second quarter highlights, and then we'll move on
to questions. During my remarks, I'll be referring to the Web slides that we issued earlier this morning. Okay. If
everyone would please turn to page 3.
We are pleased with the solid performance the team delivered in the second quarter, with sales, EPS, and operating
cash flow all better than our expectations. We had strong bookings in the second quarter at $7.6 billion, resulting in a
book-to-bill ratio of 1.3. Sales were $5.8 billion in the quarter, up 3%, led by our IDS business.
You should note that with the acquisition of Websense, we have moved away from presenting adjusted numbers but
have provided additional information that should help you with your understanding of the financial performance of the
company.
Our EPS from continuing operations was $1.65, which I'll give a little more color on in a few minutes; and operating
cash flow of $376 million was better than our prior guidance driven by the timing of collections. Second quarter 2015
operating cash flow was higher than last year's second quarter, primarily due to the timing of required pension
contributions and the expected collection of the eBorders settlement with the U.K. Home Office which was resolved in
the first quarter 2015, partially offset by higher cash taxes. During the quarter, the company repurchased 1.9 million
shares of common stock for $200 million, bringing the year-to-date share repurchase to 4.6 million shares for $500
million.
As Tom mentioned, we closed on the Websense transaction on May 29 and formed Raytheon Websense, a new joint
venture company that was created through the combination of Websense Inc. and Raytheon Cyber Products. The
Raytheon|Websense segment results have been presented to reflect Raytheon Cyber Product results for all periods and
Websense results after the acquisition date.

Our full-year 2015 guidance, which I'll discuss in a few minutes, has been updated to include Websense as well as
improved operating performance for the first half of the year, which I'll address further in a few minutes.
Turning now to page four. Let me start by providing some detail on our second quarter results. Company bookings for
the quarter were $7.6 billion, an increase of over $800 million compared to the second quarter 2014, and on a
year-to-date basis were $12.1 billion, an increase of approximately $1 billion over the same period last year. It's worth
noting that on a trailing four-quarter basis, our book-to-bill ratio was 1.1 times.
For the quarter, international was 46% of total company bookings, and on a year-to-date basis was 41%. For the year,
we expect international to be in the range of 32% to 35% of total bookings. As Tom just mentioned, we booked several
significant awards in the second quarter, including a $2 billion contract for Patriot for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,
$538 million on the Warfighter FOCUS program, $529 million for Standard Missile 3, $511 million on Evolved
Seasparrow Missile, and $363 million for Paveway.
Backlog at the end of the second quarter was $34.5 billion, an increase of approximately $1.5 billion compared to the
second quarter of last year. And on a funded basis, backlog was $25.3 billion, an increase of almost $1.8 billion
compared to the last year's comparable quarter.
If you now move to page five, as I mentioned earlier, for the second quarter 2015, sales exceeded the high end of the
guidance range we set in April, primarily due to better-than-expected performance at IDS and Missiles. For the second
quarter, our international sales were approximately 30% of total sales, and all of our businesses were at or above our
expectations.
Looking now at sales by business. IDS had second quarter 2015 net sales of $1.7 billion, an increase of approximately
10% compared to the second quarter of 2014. The increase was primarily due to two recent international Patriot
awards. It is important to note that the second quarter 2015 included the recognition of additional sales for pre-contract
work that had previously been deferred. We now expect full-year growth to be closer to 4%.
In the second quarter 2015, IIS and Missiles had net sales of $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, in line to
slightly up when compared with the same quarter last year. SAS had net sales of $1.4 billion. The change versus last
year was driven by volume on international tactical radar systems programs. And for Raytheon Websense, keep in
mind that the results for the second quarter of 2015 include Raytheon Cyber Products for the full quarter and Websense
results for the month of June.
Moving ahead to page six. Overall, the company continues to perform well. Our operating margin was 11.1% both on a
total company and a business segment basis. On a year-to-date basis, our operating margin was 13.4% and on a
business segment basis was 13.2%.
As we discussed on the last few earnings calls, compared to 2014, our margins for 2015 have been impacted by a
change in program mix, as well as higher IR&D and program investments. We continue to invest in ourselves with the
objective of positioning the company for future growth.
So, looking now at the business margins. The change in margins at IDS was primarily driven by a change in program
mix on international Patriot programs nearing completion. Included in IDS operating income in the second quarter of
2015 was an adjustment of $33 million to eliminate all remaining estimated incentive fees related to the Air Warfare
Destroyer program due to the shipbuilder extending the planned schedule and related increase in cost to complete its
portion of the program.
Although Raytheon's performance continues on plan for both a cost and schedule standpoint, the shipbuilder is now
estimating an increase in its cost to complete the program, which drove the decrease in estimated incentive fees. The
change in margin at IIS was primarily driven by a change in program mix. Missiles and SAS margins were down in the
quarter compared with the same period last year, primarily driven by higher net program efficiencies in the second
quarter of 2014.
And at Raytheon Websense, the second quarter 2015 operating margin reflects higher Raytheon cyber expenses to
develop and launch new commercial products compared to the second quarter 2014, as well as approximately $5

million of restructuring cost associated with the combination of Websense and Raytheon Cyber Products. When you
normalize for these two items, Raytheon Websense margin would be in the high teens range.
Before turning to the next page, I wanted to spend a minute discussing the purchase accounting adjustments and
corporate items related to the Websense acquisition. In the second quarter of 2015, we had a deferred revenue
adjustment of approximately $10 million and about $8 million for the amortization of acquired intangible assets.
In addition, I want to point out that on the Corporate line, there is approximately $23 million of Websense
acquisition-related cost.
Turning now to page seven. Second quarter 2015 EPS was $1.65, better than expected driven by higher sales. Of note,
second quarter 2015 included a favorable $0.29 non-cash tax settlement as reflected in our prior guidance, and an
unfavorable $0.09 associated with the Websense acquisition.
On page nine, we are updating the company's financial outlook for 2015 to include Websense as well as our improved
operating performance to-date compared to our prior guidance. We're increasing full-year 2015 net sales by $400
million, of which approximately $300 million is driven by IDS and Missiles and approximately $100 million is driven
by the Websense acquisition. We now expect our full-year 2015 net sales to be between $22.7 billion and $23.2 billion,
which is flat to up to 2% over 2014.
We now expect the EPS impact from the Websense acquisition to be $0.25 dilutive for 2015 compared with the original
estimate of $0.48 we provided you back on April 20. This change is driven by the completion of our fair value analysis;
and as a result, we have updated our acquisition accounting adjustments.
We've now incorporated this EPS impact into our updated 2015 guidance. Our full-year 2015 EPS is now expected to
be in the range of $6.47 to $6.62, which when normalized for the acquisition is an improvement of about $0.05 over
our previous guidance. And as a reminder, we have not included in our 2015 guidance the potential extension of the
R&D tax credit.
As I mentioned earlier, we repurchased 1.9 million shares of common stock for $200 million in the quarter. We are
increasing our expected share repurchases for the year and now expect to repurchase approximately $1 billion.
As I mentioned earlier, we repurchased 1.9 million shares of common stock for $200 million in the quarter. We are
increasing our expected share repurchases for the year and now expect to repurchase approximately $1 billion, an
increase of about $250 million from our initial outlook. We have tightened the range on share count and now see our
diluted share count to be between 305 million and 306 million shares for 2015.
Also, we have raised the low end of the range for our 2015 operating cash flow guidance, and now see it between $2.5
billion and $2.7 billion. And as you can see on page 9, we've updated the sales guidance range for three of our
businesses and for the addition of Raytheon|Websense. We've increased sales at both IDS and missiles to reflect
stronger bookings and higher-than-expected volume to date. At IIS, we adjusted sales to reflect the realignment of
Raytheon Cyber Products to the new Raytheon|Websense segment.
Turning to margin, we've updated the margin guidance range for the company to reflect the Websense acquisition and
now see operating margin to be between 13.1% and 13.3% for the full year. At the business segment level, we see
business segment operating margin in a range of 13.2% to 13.4% for the full year. It's worth noting that we expect
operating margins at Raytheon|Websense to be between 9% and 10% for the full year. And excluding
acquisition-related costs, their margins would be about 17% to 18%.
On page 10, we've provided some directional guidance on how we currently see the quarterly cadence for sales,
earnings per share, and operating cash flow from continuing operations for the balance of 2015. And on page 12, we
have provided a four-year outlook of the Raytheon|Websense acquisition accounting adjustments to help you with your
long-term modeling.
Please note that you will see a significant decline in the deferred revenue adjustment over the period and the
amortization of acquired intangible assets will begin to decline more significantly after 2018. We now expect the joint

venture to be accretive to GAAP earnings in two to three years compared to our original expectations of three to four
years.
Before concluding, with regard to our capital deployment strategy, we expect to continue to generate strong free cash
flow and maintain a strong balance sheet going forward. We remain focused on deploying capital to create value for
our shareholders and customers. This includes internal investments to support our growth plans, as well as returning
capital to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends, and as we sit here today, possibly smaller targeted
acquisitions that fit our technology and global growth needs.
In summary, if you stand back and look at the quarter, we had solid performance. Bookings were strong with a
book-to-bill ratio of 1.3. Our sales, EPS, and operating cash flow from operations were all higher than expected. Based
on this performance and our near-term expectations, we increased our guidance for 2015 sales. And if you exclude the
impact of the Websense transaction, we raised EPS guidance by $0.05. We had strong cash flow generation and have
increased our planned share repurchases from approximately $750 million to approximately $1 billion for the year.
With that, Tom and I will open up the call for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instruction] Your first question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn from Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Good morning.
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Good morning, Rob.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Tom, just a question on Websense and the overall commercial cyber strategy. Could you,
maybe, put into context what you are seeing there with your expansion into that market just as some of your
competitors apparently are exiting.
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Yeah, well, I'm not going to comment on the strategies of other companies but I can tell
you that we are very excited about our Websense acquisition and our expansion into the commercial cyber market. The
reasons we decided to do this are still solid and sound. We've been doing a very heavy integration effort for the last two
months. And several of the reasons and number one is that, as you can see from reading the paper every day, the cyber
threat continues relative to commercial companies.
There's a new company that comes online every day of having some type of a breach. And so, we're continuing to get
input and demand signals from commercial companies across the board. And their demand is they're looking for
higher-end, I would call it, defense-grade cyber solutions that will continue – and we see that increasing into the
foreseeable future. So we see a strong demand, strong growth opportunities. But the combination of Raytheon and
Websense is what's helping us deliver that high-end, defense-grade cyber capability.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Okay. And then just as a follow-up to that and just really on what you just spoke of, is the
thrust of this then really to sell Raytheon's product to Websense or through Websense's organization into the
commercial market or also to sell the Websense product? And then what scale do you need to achieve with this
segment for the strategy to work for investors?
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Okay. So, first of all, this is a two-way – I would say a winning side in terms of sales, one
is we are working to our sales channels, which were initially in the government-related world and the international
government-related world, and we're opening up those channels to the Triton product, which is the Websense main
platform. It's also allowing us, the commercial channels, to go into the commercial world with our SureView product.
And we believe we now have scale, you'll see, and as Toby showed you, it's approximately $500 million a year in
revenue. And now we have access to the commercial channels that we were going after and a plus for the Triton

product is now they have access into the defense and also government channels that we had.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Which side of the two-way would be the larger opportunity?
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: I think it goes both ways. There is – we're seeing a pent-up demand on the government
side for the Triton platform, and we're also seeing a pent-up demand on the commercial side for the elements of the
SureView product, four main products that drop into the Triton platform for upsell. And we're seeing a benefit both
ways. We anticipated those synergies, and we're seeing those synergies come to fruition.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from Carter Copeland from Barclays. Please proceed.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Hey. Good morning, gentlemen.
<A>: Good morning, Carter.
<A>: Good morning,
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Just a couple of them. Toby, on the AWD program, I wondered if you could just clarify if
there's any risk of further financial impact there. Basically, you got that scrubbed to zero, and then the pre-contract
revenue recognition, I wonder if you might size that for us?
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Yeah. So, first with AWD. The answer is yes, that's scrubbed to zero, as you say, the
adjustment that we took in the quarter of the $33 million eliminated all of the remaining incentive fees where we were
tied to the shipbuilder performance. So we do not anticipate any additional write-offs there relative to AWD. And then,
relative to the pre-contract cost, it was in the $100 million to $150 million range.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Okay. And then, just as a follow-up, obviously, I know you've been talking about IDS
margin progression, but obviously, the guidance implies a pretty big step up in the back half of the year. How should
we think about – how much of that is trend line to look at in going forward and how much might be temporary related
to either performance adjustments you expect to see as you hit milestones? Any color you can give us on that would be
helpful.
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Sure. Sure. So, I think, just when you step back from it and we go back to the end of
January, then again in April, we talked about how at the company level we saw a couple of things driving margins
down this year, the unfavorable mix and the higher level of investment. IDS, of all the businesses followed by SAS,
was most impacted by the unfavorable mix. So what we're seeing is consistent with what we had expected to see for the
year.
That said, the margin in Q2 was in line with our expectations. So even though we had the unfavorable adjustment on
AWD, we did see some other performance improvements in the quarter that essentially offset that. That, again, is
consistent with lower margins in the first half of the year. We still expect a ramp-up on IDS margins, particularly in Q4
as the overall business mix improves due to the ramp-up of the international awards that we saw at the end of last year
and then into the early part of this year.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Great. Thanks for the color. And good quarter, guys.
<A>: Thank you.

<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: First of all, we continue to work with the German customer. We already have the Patriot
system in there, and it is going through some upgrades relative to our Configuration-3 plus. They are upgrading some
of the – well, all their systems. And they have decided to keep the Patriot system operational to 2025.
We have obviously heard their decision on MEADS. They are – but at the same time, we continue to work with that
customer as we proceed forward. We have not seen any changes relative to any of the competitions we are in or
perceive to be in in the near future that would impact any Patriot opportunities.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Okay. Thank you for that. And just tell me quickly on the domestic growth versus
international, I think previously, you kind of guided to low single-digit down for domestic and up for international. Is
that still intact for as we look for 2015?
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Yeah. So, for a total year now for domestic, the way to think of it, Peter, is to be flat to
down in the low single digits and for international for the year to be up in the mid-single-digits.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Okay. Great. Nice quarter. Thank you.
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Thanks.

<Q - Robert Stallard>: Thanks so much. Good morning.
<A>: Good morning, Rob.
<A>: Good morning.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Tom, you mentioned the Triton product at Websense earlier on. I was wondering if you could
give us an idea of how the organic growth on that product has been tracking year-to-date.
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Well, the organic growth has been tracking about in the double digits on that product.
And as we mentioned before on the prior calls, they have two major products. One product is, I would call Web
filtering that is declining and being replaced by the Triton platform. So if you look at the Triton platform itself, it's in
double-digit growth year-over-year.
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Yeah, Rob, and I'll just kind of on a – as we talked about, we only have the month of June
in the quarter post-acquisition but if we look at the full quarter for Websense Triton, their bookings would have grown
by about 10% on a quarter-over-quarter basis.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Okay. And then, Tom, maybe a bigger picture question. I was wondering if you could
comment on what you think the impact of this Iran nuclear deal could be on your customers in the Middle East?
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: I'm not going to get tied up in the politics of it but I can take you back to my statements
earlier that we are seeing an increased demand signal across the board and it's not just in the Middle East, which is –
but we're seeing it in Eastern Europe and also in the Asia Pacific region, and it's really for different reasons. But it is –

any uncertainty in the geopolitical aspects of those regions, we're seeing an almost immediate reaction from these
countries to want to beef up their defense. And I think if you look at this quarter, you see the results of that in our
bookings.
And if you also – I did mention it, I know it was one quick line in my opening remarks, but we hit an all-time high in
the company this year. And that all-time high was in the amount of international backlog and that was 44%. And we
didn't break open any champagne bottles or throw any glasses into the fireplace or anything like that, but it is a
monumental for us to be able to have achieved that. And I think the correlation goes right to this fact that the threat is
not going away. It's increasing. And we're seeing it across three major regions of the world.

Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi. Please proceed.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Just wanted to follow up on the line of questioning over the
last couple of callers there and have you discuss a little bit more about the longer-term outlook as, I mean, we move out
into 2020, to the back half of the decade here.
And I know you've talked about this before but it would be, I think, helpful to get some updated dots from you on how
you view both the domestic and international market kind of playing out over the next couple of years. When do you
see a return to growth in your domestic business? And then as you look out into that, out as far as 2020, the pipeline
that you have on the international side and how you're going to be able to – or if you're going to be able to sustain the
types of growth that you're seeing today as we move out into the latter years of this decade.
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Yeah, so let me – and then I'll turn it over to Toby and he can put some numbers behind
what I say. Right off the bat, we – and I'll just go back to the discussions we've had at the last call. And we won some
major domestic programs that were in development on right now; one is the air and missile defense radar and the other
one is the Next Generation Jammer, FAB-T. We've also won a couple that are still on protest.
But the ones we're finishing up – we'll be finishing up on development on will be in about the 2018, 2019 timeframe,
which then will start going into LRIP and then by 2020 going into full-rate production. So on the domestic side, we are
going to start to see an uptick relative to more production programs coming online. So I think that's good on the
domestic front.
You're also seeing, based on the budget drills this year, that both the administration and also Congress are aligned with
the fact that they believe that the budget needs to increase over the Budget Control Act of 2011 caps. The issue that
they're having is how to go off and achieve that increase. But the bottom line is is they're both aligned, the
administration and Congress, on the need for the increase. So, we're very – we feel very positive about some
breakthrough here in the next, hopefully, next year relative to 2016's budget and increasing over the Budget Control
Act caps. However, we do – have planned to the Budget Control Act caps, which are about a 1% increase over the
fiscal year 2015.
So we do see the domestic budget increasing over time. On the international, we talked about some major awards. We
were down selected by Poland. That contract will be definitized over the next year and a half on the details, starting
ramping up in late 2016, or in 2017. So we see that program picking up and hitting the production numbers in about
2020, so, again, an uplift in the 2020 timeframe and taking us into 2025.
So we, overall, both on the domestic and on the international, we see a significant pipeline that will take us well beyond
2020.
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: And Jason, I'll just kind of jump in there a little bit and add a little to what Tom said. So in
addition to the programs transitioning domestically, a little bit nearer term SM-3 with the IB and the IIA will be
moving to production.

And to answer your question about when we would see a return to growth domestically, right now, as best we can tell,
maybe late next year, and if not, into 2017 for our revenue to start growing domestically. I think what Tom just
commented on from the international, combined with the 44% backlog that's international today, that pipeline Tom
referred to, the 30% of our sales that were in international, that sets us up nicely for international to grow including into
next year.
And obviously, as we said, we now see top-line growth this year with our outlook of being flat to up 2%. Previously,
we had looked at 2016 as a return to growth, so we're kind of moving that outlook in a year. And we still see
year-over-year growth in 2016 as well.
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: It's a very – I think it's a very good picture moving forward
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Yeah. It sounds great. And just a quick follow-up question. On margins, Toby, can you talk a
little bit about what's going to happen specifically in IDS on the back half that allows you to achieve a full-year
guidance.
And then, Tom, on the longer-term outlook you just talked about, these ramping programs. What does that do to
margins for the overall company if you're going to ramping development and early-stage production on those things
that you just talked about? Does that put...
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: What I'm going to do is, we'll – Toby, you just went over, actually on his discussion
before, he'll hit the IDS details, and then I'll kind of give you the bigger picture relative to where we see margins going
in the future.
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Yeah. So, Jason, for IDS, as we said before, the results so far have been consistent with
our expectation given the impact of mix that we've seen there. In the second half, primarily in the fourth quarter is
where we expect the uptick. And there's really two things that are driving that. The business mix is going to start to
improve with the large international programs, again, that we booked late last year and through the first half of this year
as they continue to move and ramp up through the production cycle. Additionally, we would also expect in the fourth
quarter to see more program efficiencies flowing through to the bottom line. And overall, we still see the margin
outlook for the total year at IDS in the range of 15.1% to 15.3%.
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Then relative to margins, on the domestic side, we talked about some major development
programs. We had one, and they're now obviously in development. When they start switching into production, we
normally see a margin increase due to the fact that we're taking on more risks on the production side on firm-type
proposals. I mean, firm fixed-price contracts. So that will see an uptick there in the margins. But on the international
side, as Toby mentioned, we've had some significant bookings here in the last year and a half.
The area that we're working right now, and I think it's a great sign here, is we're bringing in more suppliers. We're
increasing the number of shifts we have in the factory, adding on days. And so, we're seeing essentially getting quite a
bit of synergy across these different wins that we had internationally and as we do see a margin expansion across those
programs as we go into 2016 and beyond.
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: And I think, Jason, just – if you're looking for a little more color or detail from an IDS
perspective, the reason we see better program efficiencies towards the end of the year is the effects of things like
strategic sourcing, automation in our factories that are driving efficiencies, again, tied to the ramp up of those major
production programs that we referred to before.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Great. That's helpful. Thank you very much.

<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Thanks. Good morning. Just a quick follow up on that one, maybe Toby. The run
rate in the second half of 2015, obviously pretty great if you can get through on IDS. Is that sort of the appropriate way
to think about the mix is it's going to look into 2016? Or is there just a healthy performance in the second half that we
should not think about that as a run rate?
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Well, so, let me talk a little bit about IDS, right? So, mentioned in the second quarter that
they had strong sales growth and part of that was driven by the recognition of the pre-contract work that we talked
about earlier.
As far as the second half goes for a Q3 perspective, you know, we do expect sales at IDS to be up high single digits in
Q3. However, when we get to Q4, we'll look to see sales on a quarter-over-quarter basis to be essentially flat compared
to last year because in the fourth quarter of last year, we did have a build-up of inventory that did convert into sales that
makes the comparison a little bit different. I wouldn't take that as a run rate going into 2016, however, but I would
expect directionally 2016 to be better than 2015.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Okay. That's really helpful. And then, Tom, at a high level, a lot of companies have
been looking at their services blend with hardware and do the two cost structures support themselves from a
competitive perspective. And I'm sure you've gone through this exercise, and I'm not looking to layer other people's
strategies on you, but how do you look at that equation where the services market becomes more and more competitive
relative to the cost structure that's somewhat required for your hardware-sensitive businesses?
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Actually, that's a great, great question. So first I need to kind of set the stage. Raytheon
never went down the path of getting into the fed IT business. I don't know if you realize that. So we recognized a long
time ago that that was not a business that we wanted to be in, really because we saw that it would eventually get
commoditized. So we don't have any of that effort going on within the company.
The services that we do are – most of it is associated with our products, so that helps us in maintaining our products,
and logistics associated with our products. For example, we do a lot of performance-based logistics relative to our
products and that's – and essentially comes under the umbrella of the services.
And then in IIS, where most of the traditional services are located, and they are leaders in advanced solutions and
capabilities in providing cyber services, intelligence, mission support, and I would call it high-consequence training in
key markets. And it's not just for the U.S. government, it's also for governments worldwide. So it's a pretty strong
business for us. Again, we are not in the fed IT, never were, so that's an area that I think is it's hard to compare us
against some of these other companies that are shedding their services because a lot of that shedding is associated with
the fed IT.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Okay. Thanks.

Your next question comes from Howard Rubel from Jefferies. Please proceed.
<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: Thank you very much. Toby, I want to know if in some of your other forecasts going
forward, you're always going to basically understate acquisitions by about 50% of the cost because originally, as you
had indicated, it was going to be $0.48 and here we're looking at about half that. Can you elaborate on what's changed
and as we go forward and look at Websense, the deferred revenue number seems relatively modest versus the balance.
What happened?
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Yeah, so just as a reminder, Howard, back in April when we gave the initial estimates,
they were preliminary and subject to our final purchase accounting valuation. Part of our process, we had looked at
other transactions and there were a range of potentials relative to percentage of assets, et cetera, percentage of purchase
price that would be potentially characterized as intangible or the deferred revenue, so we had a range. We didn't want to
come back to you and increase the dilution, for lack of a better way to say it. And in the quarter, as we do after we close

on all our acquisitions, we embarked upon the formal fair value analysis. We finalized that here at the end of June and
what you see now is the update to reflect that, so it was really nothing more than that.
<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: All right. I'm going to talk about Patriot for one second. Tom, you've sort of created a
Patriot users group with all of your different customers around the world. Could you talk a little bit more about the
ideas that you're getting from them that are, I'll call it, leading to an ongoing upgrade in the system and how do you sort
of see that playing out?
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Well, let me just – on a baseline element, we are proceeding on upgrades, of what's called
Configuration-3 plus, that was the upgrade to the Patriot system that was funded by the UAE several years back. We
still have 72 fire units out there as opportunities to upgrade to Configuration-3 plus. So we're off pursuing that element
of it.
In addition to that, there's – the user group is looking for us to provide a 360 AESA radar and we've been off working
that for several years now. We've done some significant testing and believe we're in the position to take on contracts to
– for that development of the 360 AESA radar. There is – right now, there is an opportunity to replace 220 Patriot
radars with these 360 AESA radars, so significant upgrades there.
The other area that we're doing and it's on the international side is – and it's in Qatar. It's a contract to provide an air
defense operating center which integrates all air defense systems. I think that will be the next thing that we're seeing
with some of these other customers who have other air defense assets; they want them integrated with one common
operating picture so that they can get the synergy of having everything together in one place and operated by one
operator. So they're the type of upgrades. We're pursuing them, and in many of the cases, we already have contracts to
start those systems. So we already have the initial customers, and in some cases, we're getting ready to get our first
initial customer to move forward with them.

<A>: Good morning, Hunter. How are you doing?
<A>: Good morning.
<Q - Hunter K. Keay>: Real good. Thank you, Tom. Two questions on content. Can you remind us of your exposure
to Sikorsky, however you want to quantify that? I think it's small, but just to verify. And how should we think about
Raytheon's potential role on long-range strike? Haven't really heard a lot about that. Any color on that? Maybe it's too
early, maybe not. Anything you want to provide would be great.
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Relative to Sikorsky, we – you're right. We don't have much content on the Sikorsky
products. We have worked a lot with them. I have personally worked with Sikorsky on programs in the past. But right
now, it's not a significant part of our revenue stream.
<Q - Hunter K. Keay>: Good.
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Relative to long-range strike, we really can't comment at this time.
<Q - Hunter K. Keay>: Okay. I got you. All right. Thanks. And then I think you guys made the comment last quarter.
You've made I think dozens of cyber acquisitions over the last couple of years. I'm kind of curious to hear what some of
the lessons learned would be in terms of the pitfalls, not necessarily what went right but what went wrong, and what
can you take from that as you look at Websense in terms of sort of things to avoid in the past that can be applied here,
at least [indiscernible] (51:01).

<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: I'll tell you what, well, the lessons learned led to the acquisition of Websense. And so the
lessons were we did very well in buying these companies on the government side, but we were not achieving any
upside relative to the commercial side.
And so we – when we went back and reevaluated the reason why, it turned out that we didn't have the commercial
channels. And it takes quite a bit of effort to establish channels to be able to reach out to 30,000 customers versus 20
government customers. That's the different game. It wasn't the technology or the underlying technology. It wasn't the
products. It wasn't the personnel. It was essentially not having access to the market channels that's required in the
commercial business. And so that was a lesson learned.
And so we took that lesson learned and we went out and we started in 2013 looking at what was the best company out
there that we could essentially acquire that would enable us to unlock the capabilities we had from the other
acquisitions but into the commercial marketplace. And someone that already had a strong position, already had a new
product, a new platform, allowing us to move forward. And so there was about – essentially, it was the structure of how
we implemented those companies and we right now, of everything we're seeing, we think we have taken that lesson
learned to heart and are making the right inroads into that commercial marketplace.

Your next question comes from David Strauss from UBS. Please proceed.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Good morning.
<A>: Good morning.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Toby, did I hear you right where you said Websense would be at high teens margins ex the
cost to develop the commercial cyber product and then restructuring? And if so, how long does it take until you're kind
of through that spend to actually report high-teens margins out of Websense?
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Yeah. So to answer the first part, you heard correct. Without those two items, we'd be –
we said 17% to 18%, part 1, part 2 relative to the timing of that. So we're always going to be looking to make
investments in technology and make sure we're keeping up with the threat there. But if we were to look out over time
without that, probably in the 2017 timeframe.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: And how long – how much or how long are you running on the restructuring side? I mean,
how much restructuring is there to do here?
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: The majority of it will be completed this year. There could be a little bit of a tail into early
part of next year.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Okay. And then, a follow-up. So you've talked about $7 billion, roughly, in Patriot orders. A
little bit surprised. I would have thought a fair amount of that – those orders would come with advanced payments, yet
we haven't really seen – we've actually seen the advanced payment balance go down. Can you just comment on that?
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Yeah. So a few – a couple of those orders were FMS, right, which do not have the
advanced payments. What you've really seen here is a timing issue, right. And if I take it back up to a higher level, not
specific to those orders. We have seen the advance account on the balance sheet, to your point, David, fluctuate over
time, driven by the timing of those advances and then when they are subsequently liquidated. On average historically,
we have run at a rate of about 9% to 10% of sales. Okay. At the end of the first quarter, the balance was about $2
billion. To your point as well, slightly below our five-year average, which has been around $2.2 billion.
And really the main driver on that was timing. Back last year, in the first quarter we had received a significant advance
from a customer and we had fully liquidated that here through the first quarter of 2015. On some of the new awards, we

have milestone payments as well that are more weighted towards the back half of the year. That all said, from an

Your next question comes from the line of Richard Safran from Buckingham Research. Please proceed.
<Q - Richard T. Safran>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A>: Good morning, Rich.
<Q - Richard T. Safran>: A lot has been asked. I just wanted to ask you about some upcoming programs. There's this
JSTARS recapitalization program out there; you announced some recent teaming with Bombardier and Lockheed;
Northrop recently announced with Boeing. I just want to know from your perspective, is this indicative that the
program is more near-term? If you could give us any sense of the timing of the opportunity, and some sense of the size,
any color here on this would be helpful, because I tend to think this is a rather substantial opportunity for you.
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: We agree with you. You're right. We have – we are teamed with Lockheed and
Bombardier on one of the teams for work including sensors and some additional work. We are also providing a radar as
a kind of a merchant supplier for the other teams if they so desire. So we're kind of been spending quite a bit of time on
this program in ensuring that we wind up with a piece of it moving forward.
<Q - Richard T. Safran>: Okay. And then just as a follow-up here also, so on your 3D printing technology, just
wanted to get a sense here. Is this applicable to current and future missile programs? Is this technology applicable
across the board? Because I know there's been things like trying to get an upgrade here in the Tomahawk, et cetera. Or
is this more something that you're gearing towards, like, next-generation missile programs, like next-generation land
attack weapon?
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Let me first tell you why it's important and what it's bringing to the industry. The 3D
printing allows you to essentially build up these very complex assemblies, multi-part assemblies as one part, one
continuous part, and therefore improving cost. But it also does something else. In areas where heat is a major issue, it
allows the heat transfer capabilities to be significantly enhanced. When you have an assembly with multiple parts that
are tied together, you have heat issues where the intersection of those pieces. So by being able to build one continuous,
very complex part, you can solve a lot of the heat transfer problems, which is very important as we move into the
hypersonics area of our missiles.
<Q - Richard T. Safran>: Thanks very much for the color there. Appreciate it.
