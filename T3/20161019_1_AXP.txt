Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the American Express Third Quarter 2016 Earnings
Call. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, we'll have a question-and-answer session and instructions
will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.
I'd now like to turn the conference over to Toby Willard, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Toby Willard
Thanks, Ryan. Welcome. We appreciate all of you joining us for today's call.
The discussion contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and
business prospects, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within
today's presentation slides and in the company's reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information relating to comparable GAAP
financial measures may be found in the third quarter 2016 earnings release and presentation slides, as well as the
earnings materials for prior periods that may be discussed, all of which are posted on our website at
ir.americanexpress.com. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.

Today's discussion will begin with Jeff Campbell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who'll review
some key points related to the quarter's results through the series of presentation slides. Once Jeff completes his
remarks, we will move to a Q&A session.
With that, let me turn the discussion over to Jeff.
Jeffrey C. Campbell
Well, thanks, Toby, and good afternoon everyone. As you can see in this afternoon's earnings release, our earnings per
share for the third quarter came in at $1.20, which is 3% below the prior year. These results reflect our continued focus
on our priorities of accelerating revenue growth, optimizing investments and substantially reducing our costs.
There's clearly still a lot of work to do, but we are pleased with our performance through the third quarter and our
results have come in above the expectations that we shared with you earlier this year.
The favorability was driven by faster-than-anticipated progress on our expense initiatives and steady credit
performance. Also, as we've discussed previously, we did take a very balanced approach to our second half
assumptions given some of the dynamics within the U.S. Consumer marketplace, including the portfolio sale last
quarter and the overall competitive environment. While the environment continues to evolve, we now have greater
clarity after seeing the consistent growth in adjusted billings, loans and revenue that we experienced in the third
quarter.
Also, as expected, Q3 included a higher level of investment spending than the prior year and certain impacts from our
ongoing cost reduction initiatives, including a modest restructuring charge. And finally, we continue to use our capital
strength to return a substantial amount of capital to shareholders.
Separate from our operating results, this quarter also saw the recent Court of Appeals decision in our favor in the
Department of Justice antitrust lawsuit, while I'd point out the DOJ has the right to further appeal the decision.
The progress we've made this year gives us confidence to move ahead more aggressively in Q4 with a number of
initiatives that we've been working on for some time. These include a renewed emphasis on our Platinum Card
portfolios in the U.S. which provide a combination of service, access and benefits that have been the benchmark of
value for more than 30 years.
They also include our biggest campaign yet to build on the success of Small Business Saturday and drive additional
spending at neighborhood businesses in a way that leverages the ongoing expansion of our merchant network in the
U.S. through our OptBlue program.
In addition, we're going to continue to build upon the digital marketing capabilities that helped to bring on a record
number of new Card Members this year with expanded acquisition campaigns, both in the U.S. and key international
markets. Finally, we will be supporting all of these initiatives with an extensive advertising campaign.
With these and other initiatives coming together at the start of the peak shopping season, it will be a very active fourth
quarter. In support of this, we're planning a substantial increase in our investment spending to bring together and
leverage the combined impact of all these initiatives on our Card Members and merchants during the remainder of the
year and to position us for growth in the years ahead.
I highlight that the decision to increase investment levels is consistent with how we have run the company for many
years, as we seek to leverage earnings capacity to invest for the moderate to long-term.
Turning now to the summary of our financial results on slide two. Revenues decreased by 5%, reflecting the decline in
volumes in Card Member loans following the portfolio sale in Q2. I'd note that FX had a relatively small impact on our
reported results this quarter; the first such quarter in quite some time.

Net income was down 10% versus the prior year due primarily to the lower revenues combined with a higher level of
investment spending. These impacts were offset in part by lower rewards and operating expenses.
We again leveraged our strong capital position to provide significant returns to shareholders. Over the past 12 months,
we've repurchased 72 million shares which has driven a 7% reduction in our average share count. This decline in shares
outstanding, along with our net income, drove EPS of $1.20 for the quarter, which was just 3% below the prior year.
These results include a restructuring charge of $44 million this quarter related to our cost reduction efforts. Since we
have provided a 2016 EPS outlook excluding restructuring charges, I would point out that our adjusted EPS, after
excluding the $0.04 restructuring charge, was $1.24 in the third quarter and $5.01 on a year-to-date basis. These results
brought our reported ROE for the 12 months ended September 30 to 26%.
Moving now to our billed business performance trends, which you see several views of, on slides three through six.
Worldwide FX adjusted billings were down 3% during the quarter, as you can see on slide three. As we've done in the
last two quarters, we have also provided a trend of adjusted worldwide billed business growth rate; excluding both
Costco cobrand volumes at all merchants and non-cobrand volumes at Costco on slide four. By this measure, FX
adjusted billings growth was 7%, which was down from 8% last quarter.
We saw a number of positive trends within our underlying billings performance during the third quarter. Within the
GCS segment, performance amongst both U.S. and international middle market and small businesses remained healthy.
Our International Consumer billings growth rates remain strong, which I'll come back to in a minute.
In the U.S. Consumer segment, while the ultimate outcome will play out over time, we are on track with our
expectation to capture at least 20% of the out-of-store spending of the former Costco cobrand Card Members as a result
of our acquisition efforts prior to the sale, which does provide some lift to our adjusted billings growth rates. But we
are starting to lap it this quarter.
We are also on track with the overall performance trends we had expected across the evolving and competitive U.S.
Consumer space, in particular seeing strong growth across our U.S. cashback profits.
Our adjusted billings performance this quarter also reflected several challenges, which impacted our year-over-year
growth rates. The largest driver of the sequential decline in the growth rate versus the second quarter was the end of our
network relationship with Fidelity, which moved to a new network this quarter. As a reminder, the revenue contribution
from Fidelity was minimal as we were not the card issuer.
U.S. billings growth was also impacted by lower gas and airline ticket prices, which remained headwinds across our
U.S. businesses and had a similar impact to the prior quarter. And finally, consistent with prior quarters, spending by
large corporations remains weak with billings declining year-over-year reflecting the slow growth revenue environment
and cost reduction efforts being undertaken by many large companies.
Coming back to the drivers of total international billings performance on slide six, the increase in FX adjusted billings
growth to 11% during the current quarter was driven by improved performance in JAPA, primarily due to an up-tick in
growth rates in China. As you know, while China does impact our billings growth rates, it has a very small impact on
our revenue and earnings due to the low margin that all networks are [indiscernible] (10:26).
Within the EMEA region, our UK business continues to perform very well with FX-adjusted growth of 16% during the
third quarter. The weakening of the British pound that has occurred since the Brexit vote at the end of June has been a
drag on our reported billings and revenues. But from an earnings perspective, as you'll recall, we are relatively hedged
naturally against the pound as the UK serves as the headquarters for many of our international operations.
Turning now to loan performance on slide seven. Our loans on a GAAP basis were down 12%, compared to Q3 2015,
reflecting the sales of the two cobrand portfolios in the first half of this year. To help understand the underlying trends,
on the right side of the slide, we've excluded the sold cobrand portfolios from the prior year and adjusted for FX. On
this basis, adjusted worldwide loan growth of 12% is down from 13% in the second quarter, but continues to outpace
the industry.

We continue to see opportunities to increase our share of lending from both existing customers and high-quality
prospects. Over the last two years, as our cobrand loans have declined, we have successfully shifted our mix towards
non-cobrand Card Members. These Card Members are more likely to revolve their balances producing good returns for
us, though they do have a slightly higher write-off rate. We do not believe that this mix change is driving any
significant change to our overall credit profile, and it is producing good returns.
Our net interest yield during the quarter was 9.8%, which was up from recent quarters. Several factors influence this
change. The sold cobrand loan had a slightly lower average yield than the rest of our tenured portfolio. In contrast, the
non-cobrand Card Member loans, to which our mix has shifted, have a higher yield. In addition, some of the new Card
Members from last year have begun to lap their introductory APR periods. These positives were then partially offset by
a small increase in the percentage of loans in introductory promotional periods due to our strong acquisitions over the
past year.
Turning to provision on slide eight. Total provision decreased by 5%, as you can see on the left side of the slide, but
this result includes provision in Q3 2015 related to the two cobrand portfolios that were sold earlier this year. When
you exclude those credit costs from the prior year, as we do on the right side of the slide, adjusted provision increased
6% versus the prior year. This 6%, however, is a combination of two different trends.
Charge card provision declined year-over-year due to improved credit performance, as both worldwide write-off and
delinquency rates were below prior year, with the write-off rate in our U.S. Consumer business reaching a new
historical low. Consistent with prior quarter performance, adjusted lending provision increased by more than the
growth rate in loans. As expected, we are beginning to see some seasoning of our newer loan vintages.
Turning to our reported lending credit metrics, I would point out that they're impacted by the Costco loans that were not
sold as part of the portfolio sale. As a reminder, these loans primarily relate to cancelled accounts. They are having an
impact on our reported write-off rates this quarter, but no provision impact as they were already reserved for at a higher
level. Excluding these loans, adjusted write-off rates are relatively consistent with last quarter and remain best-in-class
among large peer issuers.
Stepping back from the quarterly credit results, I'd emphasize there has been no change in our credit outlook and the
credit continues to perform better than our Investor Day expectations. Consistent with our previous comments, we
expect the continued growth in adjusted loans and some modest upward pressure on our write-off rates, due primarily
to the seasoning of loans related to new Card Members, will both contribute to an increase in adjusted provisions going
forward.
Turning now to revenue performance on slide nine. Reported revenues were down 5%, while adjusted revenue growth
accelerated modestly from 4% in Q2, to 5% this quarter. This level of growth is consistent with our year-to-date
adjusted revenue growth performance and the expectations we shared at our Investor Day in March.
As we look at the detailed components of revenue on slide 10, we see a decline in discount revenue from lower
volumes, while on an adjusted basis discount revenue increased by 5%. This was driven by the 7% increase in adjusted
volumes that I already discussed for the quarter, offset partially by a decline in the ratio of discount revenue to billed
business, which I will come back to in a few minutes.
Net card fee growth continues to be strong, up 10% this quarter. We are seeing healthy growth in our domestic
Platinum, Gold and Delta portfolios, as well as in key international markets like Japan and Mexico. Steady growth in
card fees is a reminder of the strength of our value propositions and our ability to attract and retain fee-paying
customers even in the face of an intense competitive environment.
Moving on, net interest income was down 11% on lower reported loans, while up 10% on an adjusted basis. As I
mentioned earlier, adjusted loans were up 12% and net interest yield on Card Member loans increased year-over-year.
These impacts were partially offset in net interest income by higher funding costs related to our charge card portfolio
due to the increase in interest rates versus last year. Last, I would point out that net interest income represents 17% of
our total revenues this quarter, somewhat lower than we've seen in recent quarters given the sales of the cobrand
portfolios.

Coming back now to discount rate performance on slide 11. We saw the reported discount rate increase 1 basis point
year-over-year as lower discount rate volume coming off the network more than offset the rate pressure from merchant
negotiations, including those tied to new regulations in Europe and the continued growth of OptBlue.
We did see the ratio of discount revenue to billed business move down by 5 basis points year-over-year. The
year-over-year decline stems in part from the continued growth in cashback rewards. The greater sequential change in
Q3 versus the reported discount rate is due to our billings mix shifting towards GNS, or network business in Q3, as
cobrand volumes declined.
Turning now to expense performance on slide 12, you can see that total expenses were down 3% compared to the prior
year. I will speak specifically about marketing shortly, so let me start by focusing on rewards.
The reported rewards expense declined 11% versus the prior year, much more than the 3% decline in reported billings I
mentioned earlier. We first noted this variance in Q2, as the billings from cobrand products that formally drove rewards
expense come off the network and are partially replaced with new volumes that are more likely to earn cashback
rewards, which are recorded as contra-discount revenue.
Excluding volumes and rewards from the Costco cobrand in the prior year and including the cost of rewards on
cashback products, the growth in adjusted rewards was relatively in line with the growth in adjusted proprietary billings
this quarter.
Looking forward, however, and consistent with our Investor Day expectations, we would expect this trend to change;
and for rewards, including cashback, to grow faster than billings as we continue to enhance our product value
propositions overtime beginning in the fourth quarter due to the recent enhancements to our U.S. Platinum products.
Turning then to operating expenses, we continue to feel good about the progress we have made to reduce our cost base
by $1 billion on a run rate basis by the end of 2017. We have made faster progress than we had anticipated on
identifying and executing the key initiatives behind this effort. In the third quarter, this translated into operating
expenses being down 3% year-over-year despite the $44 million restructuring charge that we took in the quarter.
Moving now to marketing and promotion expenses on slide 13. I'd remind you that as we entered 2016, we anticipated
that our full year marketing spending would be similar to prior year levels of $3.1 billion. On last quarter's earnings
call, we highlighted that we anticipated full year marketing expenses would be at least $200 million higher than 2015 as
we take advantage of attractive investment opportunities. Consistent with these comments from last quarter, marketing
and promotion was up 10% versus the prior year in Q3.
As we've discussed, new card acquisitions has been one of our investment-focus areas and we did acquire 1.7 million
new cards across our U.S. issuing businesses this quarter and 2.5 million on a worldwide basis. This performance
remains above our historical average level of acquisitions, though as expected it is below the levels in recent quarters.
Looking ahead to Q4, the financial performance we had year-to-date gives us confidence to move ahead more
aggressively with a series of initiatives that we've been working on for some time. In particular, we plan to accelerate
and leverage the combined progress we have made in several areas.
First, providing increased marketing support for the tremendous Platinum Card franchise that we have in the U.S. We
are excited about the changes announced earlier this month, which will provide expanded travel benefits for our U.S.
Consumer and small business Platinum products. These new benefits are just one step in a series of further
enhancements that we plan to make with the Platinum product over the course of the next year.
Second, leveraging our many years of sponsoring Small Business Saturday to build upon the success that we had
increasing awareness among small business merchants and Card Members. Small Business Saturday is a great example
of how our closed loop enables us to partner and provide value to both our small business merchants and our existing
Card Member base.

We've made significant progress growing our small merchant footprint in the U.S. through OptBlue and believe that a
fourth quarter promotional campaign represents an excellent opportunity to make our Card Members aware of the
millions of new locations where American Express is now welcomed.
Third, further building on the success of our U.S. card acquisitions across all of our products, including the distinct
opportunities present in the consumer card segment. Fourth, increasing our acquisition efforts in key international
markets to build upon the positive momentum seen in our international business. And last, supporting all of these
efforts through an increased brand advertising presence around the globe to drive greater penetration and share of mind
with both consumers and merchants.
We believe that the fourth quarter provides an opportunity to bring together and leverage the combined impact from all
of these initiatives to best position the company for growth in 2017 and many years beyond. As a result, we now
anticipate that marketing and promotion expenses during Q4 will be significantly higher sequentially; and that for the
full year, M&P will be more than 10% above 2015 levels.
Moving now to capital, we continue to be pleased with our ability to return excess capital to shareholders through share
buybacks and dividends. On a year-to-date basis, we have returned 92% of the capital we've generated to shareholders,
which has driven a 7% reduction in our average shares outstanding.
While we will, of course, be subject to the annual CCAR process going forward, we remain confident that the strength
of our business model provides us with the ability to return significant amounts of capital to shareholders, while
maintaining our strong capital ratios.
So let me now conclude by going back to the key themes in our results and providing an update on our outlook for the
balance of the year. During the third quarter, we made progress on our key initiatives to accelerate revenue growth,
including driving new card acquisitions across our global consumer and commercial portfolios, expanding merchant
coverage, and driving momentum on our lending growth initiatives. We also remained focused on our cost reduction
efforts and continue to leverage our strong capital position to create value for our shareholders.
To put the third quarter into the context of our full year plan, as a reminder, at the beginning of the year, our outlook
was for full year 2016 earnings per share to be between $5.40 and $5.70, excluding restructuring charges and other
contingencies.
We also pointed out that consistent with our history, we expected to use a portion of the portfolio sale gains to fund the
increased spending on a range of growth initiatives across the company. We also said that we expected to use the gains
to fund spending throughout the year, which would result in some unevenness in our quarterly results.
On last quarter's earnings call, we updated our outlook and said that we expected full year 2016 EPS to be at the high
end of the $5.40 to $5.70 range. We also said that the competitive dynamics within the U.S. Consumer space created a
bit more uncertainty around our second half assumptions.
Today, while competition remains very intense and the environment will continue to evolve, we have greater clarity
about the trends we're seeing due to our actual results this quarter. This clarity, combined with continued favorable
trends in credit and operating expense performance, offset partially by the increases in marketing and promotion and
rewards that I discussed, but would have allowed us to raise our full year 2016 EPS guidance to be between $5.90 and
$6. As a reminder, this outlook excludes the impact of restructuring charges or other contingencies.
Turning to 2017, our outlook for full year EPS to be at least $5.60 remains unchanged at this time. Given the
faster-than-expected progress on our cost reduction initiatives, we do now anticipate that operating expenses in 2017
will be lower next year than the $10.9 billion shown in our Investor Day scenario.
Depending upon our operating performance and the opportunities that we see at the marketplace, we believe that the
accelerated operating expense savings we're achieving could provide us with the flexibility to have higher levels of
marketing and promotion next year than in our Investor Day scenario, while still tracking towards our $1 billion cost
reduction target, as well as our earnings target for 2017 of at least $5.60.

We continue to believe we had the right strategy in place to meet our objectives in 2017 and to build a solid base for
driving longer term growth. We are pleased that our results so far this year have provided us with the flexibility to bring
together marketing efforts in the fourth quarter around the host of initiatives I outlined earlier, while also raising our
outlook for full year earnings. We are clearly operating in a challenging environment, but are intensely focused on
executing the plans we have in place.
Toby Willard
Great. Thanks, Jeff. Before we open up the lines for Q&A, I'll ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one
question. Thank you for your cooperation.
And with that, the operator will now open the line for questions. Ryan?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go to the line of Craig Maurer with Autonomous. Please go ahead.
<Q - Craig Jared Maurer>: Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question. Limiting it to one question. If we do see a rise
in interest rates, do you expect there to be any change in the competitive environment as it would seem low
advantageous credit combined with low rates has allowed, what you could call, some second-rate players to simply
throw cash at the problem in the form of cashback rewards?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Well, Craig, I guess a few comments. We run the company and try to make our decisions
based on a very long-term view of how we build long-term sustainable value for our shareholders by creating long-term
relationships with our Card Members and merchants. Frankly, when we do that, we take a through-the-cycle view of
the economics as we make decisions about what we can get good investment returns on and what we can't. And so, that
leaves us believing that we should be aggressively investing where we see opportunities, regardless of where we may
be in the cycle.
It is a competitive environment right now. But what I would say is that in response to that competitive environment, we
try to stay very focused on our longer term goals and on creating the kinds of products, value propositions and offerings
to our Card Members and merchants that bring to us people interested in the same kind of long-term sustainable value
and relationships that we're after.
Now, what does the rising interest rate environment mean for that? Well, certainly, for us, I think everyone would
recall that given the significance of our charge card franchise, for us, all else being equal, rising interest rates cost us a
little bit of money; 100 basis points, all else being equal, is a couple hundred of million dollars. On the other hand,
rising interest rates in theory should be accompanied by reasonably good economic conditions, and that generally
provides some kind of offset.
So we feel very comfortable that we have in place a range of strategies and tactics that will thrive and be economically
sustainable through whatever economic environment we face in rising interest rates. What that might mean for the
competitive environment, we'll have to see. But we try not to make decisions counting on any particular change in the
competitive environment.

<Q - David Ho>: Good afternoon. Just talking about the incremental investment spend, particularly in your Platinum
product, how much of it was reactive versus proactive in response to a new entrant late in October? And to what extent
will this continue and kind of what's the pace of investment? We just kind of saw a taste of that due to a recent value
prop increase. But what else is next?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: I think it's a good question, David. What I would say is we are continually working to
maintain and keep vibrant what we believe is by far the gold standard in high-end cards, and that's the Platinum
product, both in the consumer market and in the small business market; and you see, as part of that, us steadily and
consistently evolving the product.
If you think back, over the last few years, you every year have seen steady enhancements to the products from the
introduction of the Centurion Lounges, to expansion of various travel-oriented credits around TSA PreCheck and
Global Entry through status that we're able to offer people through things like our partnership with Hilton HHonors.
And so, you see a very steady stream of these things, and there's a lot of thought and a lot of planning that goes into
them. And what we have announced earlier this month is the latest in that steady stream. And, as I said in my prepared
remarks, you should expect more.
So none of those things happen in response to any particular move by our competitors. They're all very long in the
planning. But they all do stem from a general view of how we view the competitive environment evolving in general
and how we think we can best evolve the product to take advantage of the broad range of brand, and service, and global
reach that we can bring to our customers that are the kinds of things that we think let us stand out and are very difficult
for competitors to match.

<Q - Robert Paul Napoli>: Thank you. I guess I don't want to beat the rewards thing to death, because there are so
many other things to focus on. But with the Sapphire card and I would imagine that when you put your planning
together that you were aware – you would expect that Costco/Citi would have very aggressive marketing programs. But
have you seen an effect on the cancellation rate or lost cards from these new competitive products? And the rewards
that you've put in place and the changes that you've put in place, do you think that that's good enough to slow down any
competitive loss and then possibly lead to American Express starting to gain market share instead of losing market
share?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Well, there's a couple of good questions there, Bob, and let me start by talking about a
couple of different product value propositions. When you look at the Platinum franchise, I would point out to you, as I
said in my prepared remarks, that we have seen a very nice growth both in numbers of Platinum members in the U.S.,
as well as the fee income from Platinum members over the course of the past year; and that was a contributing factor in
our card fees being up 10%. So I'd start there and say, we feel pretty good about that franchise. And it's part of why we
are continually thinking about how we enhance the proposition in response to the evolving environment.
When you look at the cashback environment, we have been very successful. And, again, in my prepared remarks I
talked about the particularly good growth we've seen in the U.S. Consumer space with our cashback products. So we
feel pretty good about those value propositions. So it's far too early to see any impact from things that have only been
launched in very recent weeks and months.
And, as I said a few minutes ago, we're in the game for the very long-term, to build long-term relationships with our
customers. We believe we have product value propositions that are about creating the kind of relationship with our
Card Members that goes on for many, many years. I would point out that when you look at our Platinum franchise, it,
in many ways, is built upon a group of people who've stayed with us for decades, not for short periods of time. So we
feel pretty good about all those value propositions.

In terms of market share, we have many, many different products across the consumer, small business and commercial
segments. When you look at the U.S. market in total across all of those segments, to remind everyone, we found
ourselves gaining quite a bit of share in a couple of years right after the financial crisis. And ignoring the portfolio sales
for just a second, we've had some modest share declines in the last couple of years.
First and foremost, we run the company to create value – financial value for our shareholders. We create product value
propositions that we think are attractive to our Card Members and will create long-term value for our shareholders.
Certainly, as we make decisions, one factor we consider is what's happening with overall market share. But I would say
our number one goal is how we create long-term sustainable financial value, and market share is just one factor that
goes into that.
So we're not ever happy or content to see ourselves losing the little bit of market share we've lost in the U.S. over the
last couple of years. I would point out that outside the U.S. we've been gaining share in almost every market in which
we operate. But I would close by saying our number one objective though is making the right decisions to build
sustainable financial value.

Thank you. We'll now go to the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.
<Q - Sanjay Sakhrani>: Thank you. Jeff, I was wondering if you could help us with the run rate of expenses as we
move into 2017. I know 2016 has a lot of numbers – not a lot of stuff in there. But maybe you could just help us with
how to think about the beginning point for 2017, off of which you'll have those expense saves?
And then secondly, just as far as the rewards costs are concerned, can you just help us think about how to think of the
impacts to the rewards rate on the expense line and the discount rate as far as the cash rewards are concerned? Thanks.
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Well, that's quite a bit there, Sanjay. Let me take a cut at a few of those. On 2017
expenses broadly, I guess I'd maybe break them into three categories: operating expenses and M&P and rewards. So to
remind everyone, in March at our Investor Day, we showed one scenario for how you might get to our EPS target for
2017 of earning at least $5.60.
In that scenario – and we did point out there were other ways to get there as well – but in that scenario, we had
operating expense in 2017 of $10.9 billion. And what I'm telling you this evening is when we look at the progress we
made in identifying and executing on a range of initiatives, we will do better than that. Just how much better, we'll have
to see. But we will clearly do better and we feel good about that. And we're continuing to work every day to find more
money and get the number as low as we can.
The next thing I said in that Investor Day scenario is that versus a 2015 base of M&P of about $3.1 billion, we thought
we could trim as much as $200 million to $400 million. We'll have to see on that one. I would tell you that certainly to
the extent we can do better on OpEx, to the extent we have revenue trends that allow us to achieve our financial bottom
line targets, I suspect we will probably not pull down M&P as much as we suggested in that Investor Day scenario,
both because we may have the financial flexibility enough to do it.
And, look, I'm certainly not going to sit on this call, Sanjay, and try to argue with people that the environment doesn't
continue everyday to be a very, very competitive environment. So our M&P probably comes somewhat off that 2015
level, but perhaps not as much.
Rewards is certainly a moving target, because it's a function both of the new value propositions we put in the
marketplace with Platinum, as well as the evolving mix across our cashback cobrand and proprietary portfolios. So on
that one, I'll tell you, other than the directional comment that beginning with the fourth quarter you will see a reversal
of the trend we've seen in the last few quarters where, in total, rewards have been growing a little bit more slowly than
billings, that will clearly reverse in Q4.

It should be clear to you, we've been planning that for some time. That's why going back as far as Investor Day I said,
built into the 2017 numbers and the scenarios we showed for what might happen beyond, we had assumed that rewards
costs will grow faster than billings. But I think, Sanjay, I'm probably going to wait one more quarter until we provide a
little bit more insight into 2017 to be much more specific than that. And the Q4 results I think will help everyone begin
to calibrate as well.

Our next question comes from the line of Chris Brendler with Stifel. Please go ahead.
<Q - Christopher Brendler>: Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon.
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Hi, Chris.
<Q - Christopher Brendler>: First question on the UK. You've seen acceleration there. I think this goes back to the
same question I asked last quarter. It was 10% I think last quarter FX-adjusted, now it's 16%. And a lot of competitors
are sort of reacting to the interchange reductions there. What's your strategy there? Are you gaining share because of
your sort of holding the line on rewards in the face of the interchange reduction? And is there any sort of color you can
provide on you outlook for the UK business given that's sort of competitive advantage at this point? Thanks.
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Well, we are pleased by the growth we've seen in the UK, which has been in the
double-digits, above 10% for quite some time now. And I would also point out, as I said earlier, that that is typical of
the majority of countries outside the U.S. where we – in most countries, not all – but in most do find ourselves gaining
share, albeit starting from much smaller bases in share than what we have in the U.S.
We have a very flexible business model. You hear us talk a lot about the many different advantages that having a
closed-loop model gives us. And we talk a lot about the value that we get from the fact every day we have to go out and
negotiate with merchants to demonstrate our value, and everyday we've got to demonstrate our value to Card Members.
That is giving us some flexibility in the UK and across Europe to try to craft propositions for both the merchants and
Card Members that people find very attractive as that environment evolves.
So we are pleased with the growth in the UK. I would say that growth has been strong for some time, but it does seem
to have picked up even a little bit more steam as you look at this year. So we're pleased with that, and we're working
hard all across the EU to further build on that momentum.
I will remind everyone, however, that there – in the nearer term, an offset, which we talk about when we talk about the
discount rate, is that we are in a multi-year process, probably of slowly renegotiating many of our merchant agreements
in Europe. And as we renegotiate them, because of the caps on interchange, there is more pressure on us in many ways
to keep the differential similar but bring the absolute rate down. And that's part of what we've been talking about for
some time now. That's part of what's putting some unusual downward pressure on our discount rate. So that is an offset
that we should remember to some of the nice volume performance we're seeing in Europe.
<Q - Christopher Brendler>: Great. Thanks so much, Jeff.
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Thanks, Chris.

Our next question comes from the line of Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.

you've talked about in digital marketing with the 1.7 million accounts you added in the U.S. this quarter and 5.9 million

year-to-date. Are you seeing improvements in your cost of acquisition relative to what you've seen in the past? And is
that a function of being digital or are you just getting better at acquiring customers than maybe you were a couple of
years ago?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: There's probably a couple different phenomenon, Chris, worth commenting on. So, yes,
every quarter we get better, more sophisticated, more thoughtful about how we leverage our closed-loop data in terms
of making our digital marketing more effective. And that's why across the globe, in our consumer businesses, the
majority of our new Card Member acquisitions for some time now have come through digital channels.
So one of the reasons why we believe we can moderate marketing and promotional spend overtime without losing
traction on accelerating revenue growth is every quarter we get a little bit better at digital marketing. It is far more
economically efficient than some of the other direct mail, or depending on what country you're in, in the world; we use
direct sales channels sometimes in a few countries. The one thing I would acknowledge that goes the other way a little
bit is certainly our relationship with Costco provided a really good source of acquiring new customers; and that was a
very low-cost acquisition channel, and they were good customers attracted to two good brands.
So we have lost that. One of the things internally that we do look at and are pleased by is, as we have lost that channel,
we've effectively had to completely replace that acquisition effort with efforts in other channels. Digital has played a
big part of that. And we feel we have crossed the threshold, if you will, where our acquisitions, now even though we've
lost that one big former channel, were above what they were in the prior year; and we feel good about that mix.
I would say, though, that certainly not all of our Card Member acquisitions are digital yet. And one of the positives to
me about that is it means I see many years still ahead of us of getting better every year, and that's going to give us a
little bit better economics every year. So thanks for the question.
<Q - Christopher Roy Donat>: Thanks.

And our next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Moshe Ari Orenbuch>: Great. Thanks, Jeff. Most of my questions were actually asked. But I was just hoping
you could kind of discuss the performance of the Global Merchant Services. The growth rate and revenue, you talked
about – you mentioned Fidelity in your comments. But talk a little bit about the revenue growth and margin trends
there, if you could?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Yeah. I'd remind, Moshe, you and for that matter everyone, as we've re-segmented the
company after Ken reorganized the company late last year, we created the four new segments. And the new segments,
what we call GMS, which is led by Anre Williams, represents our Merchant and Loyalty businesses. That business
does not have in it, what we call, the GNS or network business, which is the business that goes out and negotiates with
third-party issues – such as the third party issuer of the Fidelity cobrands. That business is reported in our International
Consumer segment for the most part, because most of those relationships are outside of the U.S. Fidelity was one of a
small number that were in the U.S.
So with that as background, when you look at the GMS segment, quite frankly, it's really going track the overall
company, because what you're really seeing in that segment are the acquirer and network economics that go with the
issuing done by the consumer and commercial segments. What you see when you look at what we're calling ICNS, or
the International Consumer and Network Services segment, is the combination of our proprietary issuing businesses
outside the U.S. along with the network business. And we do provide in the tables some information about the growth
in the network side of the business, which continues, as it has for many years now, to be the highest growth in terms of
billing segment of the company.
So with all that as background, what I'd say is, the GMS segment really just reflects the overall company economics;
and I'm not sure I would add a lot there. When you look at the performance of the GNS or network business, we

continue to be very pleased by growth in that business outside the U.S. I'd say the business in the U.S. is not a growth
business. It was down this quarter driven by Fidelity. And that would be one thing that I would say is not a particular
growth opportunity for the company, at least in the near term. But outside the U.S., we see very nice growth in Europe,
Asia, as well as Latin America. So thank you for the question.

Our next question comes from the line of Ken Bruce with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kenneth Matthew Bruce>: Thank you. Good evening, and surprising quarter in a very good way. So
congratulations. My question relates to credit. You talked about competition being intense, and most of that's around
rewards. One of the other areas that we've noticed is there's been a lot more focus on growing loans across the board
and we're seeing some expansion of the credit box. So, all things being equal, you guys have been growing fast yourself
and you talk about higher loss rates. I guess I'd like you to try to dimensionalize kind of where you're expanding the
credit box versus what you think is just seasoning within the portfolio without really changing the composition – the
overall composition of that loan book. If you could help us with that, that would be great? Thank you.
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: That was a good question, Ken. I guess, I'd say a couple of things. As I said in my
prepared remarks, what you have seen is that as our cobrand loan portfolio has shrunk due to the portfolio sales, we
have worked very hard to replace the growth that was formerly coming from those cobrand Card Members with
non-cobrand Card Members.
And as a general statement, we find that the non-cobrand Card Members are more likely to revolve on their balances.
They do have higher write-off rates, and so the average credit quality is marginally below where it was for the cobrand
Card Members. We price for that. That's part of why as I went through the net interest yield, our net interest yield
sequentially has gone up a little bit because you're losing the lower yielding cobrand Card Members and you're gaining
more non-cobrand Card Members where the yield tends to be a little bit better.
So that's the one area where I would say there is some evolution in the nature of the Card Members. You add to that
seasoning because you go through a process over the first year or two that you require a revolving card member, where
they evolve through the credit process. And those are the two things going on that have led us for some time now to say
we feel good about our loan growth, we think we can grow loans at the kind of rates we've been growing them for a
very long time, and we think we can do without materially changing the overall credit profile of the company.
I'd also just remind you, the other reason that we've been able to do that for some years now, because, remember, we
didn't just accelerate our loan growth. It's been well above the industry for several years now; and you haven't seen a
change in the relative credit profiles. We are able to grow loans partly because we're just focused on it now and we're
creating the products that are attractive to consumers in that area. We're creating marketing that actually drives people
to the products and we just have more focus on it here as a management team. And as you've heard us say over and
over again over the last year, we really were leaving a target-rich opportunity for ourselves with our very low
penetration into our own Card Members' borrowing behaviors.
And so, that's a key difference I think, Ken, between us and where others may be. Because as we sought a few years
ago to begin to accelerate our growth in loans, we really didn't have to figure out, well, boy, we're already capturing our
share of our own Card Members' behaviors, well, how are we going to attract new Card Members. We had a very
different proposition ahead of us. We could just say, well, what do we do to start tuning our marketing and products so
that we capture more of our appropriate share of wallet, what we already capture on spend. So I think that gives us a
very different opportunity set than others may have. And I think it's an important component of why we've had several
years of growth above the industry, while maintaining our relative credit positioning. So hope that helps.
<Q - Kenneth Matthew Bruce>: Thank you. Yeah, that does. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Don Fandetti with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
<Q - Donald Fandetti>: Jeff, I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about where your thinking is on the
international strategy. It sounds like it's going be one of the areas of investment that you highlighted. It's been a pretty
strong area where some of the U.S. Consumer businesses are feeling intense competition. Can you talk a little bit about
what you're thinking? Are you getting more aggressive there or is this just sort of continuing the pace?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: No. It's a good question, Don. And I do think we are trying to drive even more growth out
of our international businesses. I would point out, for some time now, with the one challenge we had in Canada aside,
we have been seeing really nice growth across our International Consumer businesses. Our international small business
segment, which is reported in GCS has consistently for some time now been our highest growth segment in the
company. So we feel really good about the growth we've been getting, and we'll be doing a number of things to try to
accelerate it further.
When you say, though, talk about your international strategy, that's always a challenging question, because we don't
have an international strategy. We have a strategy in the UK. We have a different strategy in Germany where we're
greatly able to leverage the of our [indiscernible] (59:33) business, which has really nice synergies with the card
business.
We have totally different opportunity in Mexico where we have one of the largest market shares we have outside the
U.S. and a tremendous market position that's growing rapidly. We have a very different strategy in Japan where, due to
a relationship we struck with JCB many, many years ago, it is one of the few international markets where we have
tremendous coverage. And that has been fueling growth rates in the double-digits for a number of years right now.
So I could go on, but I guess my point is we feel good about the trends that we've seen for a couple of years now. We
are trying to provide even more resource and focus to invest in the markets where, frankly, we see the greatest traction.
And I just named a couple of them. I could go on, but I won't...
<Q - Donald Fandetti>: Yeah.
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: ...take too much of everyone's time. And it's really more about just putting more time,
effort, resource and focus behind the things we're already doing.
<Q - Donald Fandetti>: And, Jeff, just to quickly clarify. I know it's not material. But the China activity pickup, is that
outbound, coming out of China? Is that sort of just organic growth or are there new signings of deals?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: No. It's really organic growth. And so, you do see the growth across all types, including
outbound. But the biggest chunk is still intra-China where, like all networks, our share, that we are allotted under the
Chinese government's rules, is quite modest to put it mildly. So we like to think we continue to very successfully build
the brand and build presence in China. We've been able to do that without putting any capital into China. And as the
Chinese government inevitably moves towards a more open and competitive market, we hope that that brand, the
presence that we've been able to create is an asset that we will be able to leverage more overtime in the future.

particularly excited about that you think that you might monetize overtime? Thank you.
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: That's a good question, James. Certainly, we were pleased. In the last couple of years, I
would say, you saw two in particular really significant investments that turned out quite well for us. The ICBC
investment, as well as the Concur investment. We do run, as you would find it, many, if not most, companies of our
size and scale, a venture capital group. And we do have very modest investments in a range of companies across the
payments and technology spectrum.
I would say, our goal there is really about making sure we stay very close to where innovation is happening across all
of the spaces that are interesting to us. Our goal is to invest with companies where we can also create working
relationships and operating relationships, where we can help them succeed and we can also stay with the pulse. And our
goal is not to necessarily, as the first priority, find ourselves making lots of money by buying and selling these stakes.
That's not really the goal. And our goal is not to lose money doing it.
So from time to time, we have one of those companies that takes some kind of exit and there are modest gains, and I
don't usually even bother to talk about, or modest losses. For now, it's certainly in that too quite a nice modest positive.
But as I said, that's not the goal. There's nothing else in the portfolio that I would say is material at this point that an
investor should be aware of. All these investments are quite small. So, thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: Hi. Good evening, guys. I'll try to make this one quick. Jeff, you gave us a lot of detail in terms
of the puts and takes on the expense space, whether it's the below $10.9 billion or the marketing and promotion dollars.
Can you just – given all the customer acquisition that you've done this year, can you just help us understand the outlook
for revenues?
Clearly, you talked about a lot of different areas, small business clawing back market share, increased lending, what
you've talked about on this call. But can you just give us a sense of how you're progressing relative to expectation on
revenues? And given this increased marketing spend that you're doing, is this a potential we can actually see
higher-than-expected revenue growth?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Well, I think, Ryan, as you would probably expect me to say, we'll have to see. We're
pleased that when you look at Q3, you saw a little bit of sequential acceleration from the 4% you saw in Q2. We're
pleased that year-to-date we're at 5%. And I'd remind everyone that our scenario that we showed back in March at
Investor Day through 2017 had a 5% revenue CAGR. So we're already there.
Whereas a management team, we are laser-focused on thinking through the best strategies for accelerating revenue
growth further into the kind of higher range scenario that we talked about beyond 2017 at Investor Day. We'll have to
see. We feel very comfortable and confident in the choices we've made. But there is a lot of factors, whether it's the
economy or interest rates that someone brought up earlier or the evolving competitive environment.
What I'd say is, we feel good about the earnings guidance we've given people for 2016 and 2017, we feel good about
the revenue trends we've seen year-to-date, we feel good about the decisions we've made; and we'll see how that all
plays out in 2017.

<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Thanks very much. Jeff, I was hoping that you just might clarify how we should think about
net income for next year? I mean, obviously, you've given the guidance on the EPS and we know that there's going be
significant share repurchases, and you've talked to a number of the expense line items. But how do we think about the
net income and core profitability relative to, let's say, an annualized run rate for the quarter that you just produced?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Well, I'd make a few comments. I think you should presume that we will execute upon the
CCAR approvals that we have, from a share repurchase perspective. And so, that math will get you to some continued
significant uplift in EPS versus net income.
When you think about the quarter we were just in, I would say a couple of things. You would expect to see, based on
all the comments we've made, a little growth in rewards cost relative to the quarter we just saw. On the other hand, we
have a lot of operating expense that we're now confident we will get out as we get into 2017. We also believe we can
moderate the marketing and promotional line somewhat. I talked a little bit earlier about the to-ing and fro-ing that
we'll debate internally over the next couple months about just how much.
And then, clearly, we are very focused on continuing to get good revenue growth; and our goal is to accelerate it. So
you can sort of back into what that will mean depending on what you want to believe about where we end up on an EPS
perspective. In some ways, I suppose, the probably least variable of all the variables I just talked you through would be
share repurchase because you can publicly see what we're going to do; thanks to the Fed's CCAR process. So that's
probably the way I would think about it, Eric.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Okay. Thanks very much.
<A - Toby Willard>: Hey, Ryan. I think we have time for one more question.
Operator
Okay. That comes from the line of Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Richard B. Shane>: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I'll try to be quick here. Jeff, you had talked a
little bit about the distortion that's occurring as you increase the mix towards cashback between member rewards and
the impact on net discount revenue. I'm curious as we think about the fourth quarter and your emphasis on marketing –
or, excuse me, on growing the Platinum book, how we should think about that relationship? Because I'm assuming
that's not a cashback offer.
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Correct. Yeah. So it's good question, Rick. So to remind everyone, what I've been trying
to do over the last few quarters just due to the way the accounting rules work, we've put our cashback rewards up as a
contra revenue and our Membership Rewards and cobrand rewards generally go down is what you see in the rewards
line. So we try to add all those up, and they've been growing so much similarly in recent quarters. Rewards have
actually been growing a little slower than billings. That will clearly change next quarter because of the Platinum
changes.
There were also, in last year's fourth quarter, a couple of true-ups, the kind of one-time things you have from time to
time that helped lower last year's Q4 rewards line. So the year-over-year change will look a little bit more exaggerated
in this Q4 than in others. In some ways, it might be better to look at the sequential run rate of rewards, Rick, to try to
figure out what happens to the rewards line.
But the cashback contra rewards sequentially aren't going to do anything unusual other than just grow as the products
grow. And the two things that will change on the rewards line are the implementation of these Platinum changes, which
will clearly drive significant cost. How much? We'll have to see what the take-up is, et cetera, along with this
accounting item that I talked about from last year. So hopefully that's a little helpful in how you think about it. So...
<Q - Richard B. Shane>: And the good news is that the clock is now ticking on anniversary-ing all of these
adjustments. So 12 months from now, we won't be thinking about this quite as much.
