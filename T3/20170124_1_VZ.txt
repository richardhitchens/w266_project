MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning, and welcome to the Verizon Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all
participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for questions following the presentation.
[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this
time.
It is now my pleasure to hand the call over to your host, Mr. Michael Stefanski, Senior Vice President-Investor
Relations.
Michael T. Stefanski
Thanks, Tori. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. This is Mike Stefanski, and
I'm here with our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Matt Ellis.
As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information and the presentation slides, including a
supplemental information slide, are available on the Investor Relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call
will also be made available on our website.
Before we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on slide 2. Information in this
presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject
to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the
SEC, which are available on our website.

The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year
basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential.
Before Matt goes through our results, I'd like to highlight a few items. For the fourth quarter of 2016, we reported
earnings of $1.10 per share and full year earnings of $3.21 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include a
few non-operational items that I would like to highlight.
Our reported fourth quarter earnings include a non-cash pre-tax gain of about $1.6 billion. The largest item was the
mark-to-market adjustment of our pension and OPEB liabilities, which was a pre-tax gain of roughly $1.8 billion. This
adjustment, which was primarily non-cash, was caused by an increase in the discount rate, as well as other plan factors.
We also incurred pre-tax expenses of nearly $200 million, primarily related to severance cost under our existing
separation plans. The net impact of these items, after-tax, approximated $1 billion or $0.24 per share.
Excluding the effect of these non-operational items, adjusted earnings per share were $0.86 in the fourth quarter,
compared to $0.89 a year ago; a decline of 3.4%. For the full year, adjusted earnings per share were $3.87, compared
with $3.99 in 2015; a decrease of 3%. Recall that our 2015 adjusted EPS included $0.13 of depreciation benefit related
to the three Wireline properties that we sold to Frontier.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt.
Matthew D. Ellis
Thanks, Mike. Good morning to everyone on the call, and thank you for joining us today. I look forward to working
with our investors and all of you who follow our stock and share in progress on our strategy to deliver the promise of
the digital world.
We're in a vibrant and exciting industry. Our leadership position in Wireless and fiber networks, as well as our loyal
and high-quality customer base, is a reflection of our commitment to continuous improvement by our outstanding
employees which places us in a great position for long-term profitable growth.
The continuous changes from technology advances and the competitive environment will provide us new opportunities
to evolve and develop innovative solutions to continue to be a key player in this dynamic market.
I'm energized by those challenges and the great team we have, and I'm excited about the coming years. My primary
objective is to build on the strong foundation of this business and ensure we're always being responsible stewards of the
company by running the businesses we have today as efficiently and effectively as possible, while investing
responsibly to deliver long-term growth and shareholder value.
Let's now move into an overview of 2016. As expected, 2016 was a transformative year for Verizon. We demonstrated
strong financial performance and returned value to our shareholders, while repositioning the business. Our core
businesses are executing well in highly competitive markets and we're on track with our strategic priorities.
During 2016, we completed Wireline divestitures of three markets, negotiated new contracts with our labor unions,
executed successful 5G technical trials, and gained traction in new growth businesses.
Operationally, in Wireless, with our network leadership strategy, we added 1.3 million smartphone net adds and
maintained industry-leading retail phone churn performance of less than 0.9% for the year and for seven consecutive
quarters. In Wireline, we restructured the segment and its cost structure. Overall, we delivered solid operational and
financial results, which I'll go into in more detail in a few minutes.
Our capital allocation was consistent with our strategy. We invested in adding capacity through densification of the 4G
network, acquired Telematics and Smart City businesses, and extended ecosystems to monetize data traffic. We
reduced our unsecured debt and delivered strong value to our shareholders through the 10th consecutive increase in
annualized dividends last September.

Entering 2017, we are confident with our strategy and priorities to serve customers and increase value. The foundation
of our strategy is a network that's ubiquitous and reliable. We will continue to invest in our networks, expand network
capabilities, and advance ecosystems to offer value to our customers. The execution of these priorities will allow us to
lead the network layer and develop innovative solutions to meet customer demands in the rapidly expanding
mobile-first digital world.
Now, let's get right into the operating performance, starting with our consolidated results on slide six. Total operating
revenue in the fourth quarter was $32.3 billion, a decline of 5.6%. Consolidated 2016 revenue was $126.0 billion,
representing a decline of 4.3%. If we exclude revenues from the divested Wireline properties and AOL, which became
part of our operations during the second half of 2015, adjusted operating revenue would've declined approximately
2.4%.
Wireless revenue tracked with our expectations in the quarter, as the shift from service revenue to equipment revenue
across our basic customers is ongoing. Equipment revenue was seasonally strong, primarily led by new smartphone
launches and equipment installment take rates. Wireline segment revenues continued recent trends declining 3.1%, with
consumer growth of 0.2% for the quarter.
In our new businesses, we are pleased with AOL's performance for the quarter and full year. In the fourth quarter, our
digital media business, led by AOL, generated revenue of $532 million net of traffic acquisition costs. This revenue
was down about 5% year-over-year, as expected, due to the revenue lift related to the Microsoft deal in the fourth
quarter of 2015, but increased around 10% sequentially, in line with expectations.
Organically, Internet of Things revenue was $243 million, up 21% in the fourth quarter. We expect to sustain these
strong trends. Including acquisitions, Internet of Things revenue increased more than 60% in the fourth quarter.
Strong cost management across the business enabled us to drive profitability, including offsetting the lost earnings
contribution from the divested Wireline markets. On a consolidated full-year basis, excluding non-operational items,
EBITDA totaled $44.8 billion and EBITDA margin was 35.5%.
Now, let's turn to cash flows and the balance sheet on slide seven. In 2016, cash flows from operations totaled $22.7
billion, which is impacted by payments of cash income taxes of $3.2 billion associated with the gain on the divested
Wireline properties.
Full-year capital spending of $17.1 billion was just below our guidance of $17.2 billion to $17.7 billion. Free cash flow
for the year totaled $5.7 billion, which does not include the proceeds from on-balance sheets securitization transactions.
In the second half of 2016, we shifted to on-balance sheet securitization of our equipment receivables, as it provides us
a lower overall cost of funding. As we have previously noted, the proceeds from our on-balance sheet securitization
program are reflected in the cash flows from financing.
During the fourth quarter, we generated cash proceeds of about $2.4 billion from on-balance sheet securitization for a
total of $5.0 billion during the second half of the year. Our balance sheet is strong and provides us with financial
flexibility to grow the business.
We ended the year with $108.1 billion of gross debt, which comprised of $103.1 billion of unsecured debt and $5
billion of on-balance sheet securitizations. Our year-end unsecured debt balance was lower by $6.6 billion from the
prior year. We remain on track to return to our pre-Vodafone credit rating profile by the 2018 to 2019 timeframe.
Now, let's move into a review of the segments, starting with Wireless on slide eight. In the Wireless business, we are
delivering a balanced operational performance in a highly competitive environment.
Total Wireless operating revenue declined 1.5% in the quarter to $23.4 billion. For the full year, operating revenue
totaled $89.2 billion, a decline of 2.7%. Service revenue of $16.3 billion declined 4.9% for the quarter, as compared to
the 5.2% decline in the third quarter. For the full year, service revenue declined 5.4%.
Overall, service revenue trends are consistent with the postpaid base migrations to unsubsidized service pricing.
Approximately 67% of our postpaid customers are now on unsubsidized pricing, which is ahead of our expectations

due to higher volumes in the fourth quarter.
Service revenue plus device payment plan billings increased 1.7% in the fourth quarter and 2.0% for the full year. This
deceleration in trend is due to the strong migration of customers in the second half of the year to unsubsidized pricing,
as customers fulfilled their prior service contracts.
We're also seeing strong migrations to our new pricing structure that we launched midyear with Safety Mode and
Carryover Data. While these plans have resulted in greater-than-expected optimization, they improve customer
satisfaction and retention. Recently, we launched a single-line pricing plan to improve our competitive position in that
segment.
Equipment revenue increased to $5.7 billion, up 6.2% for the fourth quarter and 3.5% for the full year. The percentage
of phone activations on device payment plans increased to approximately 77% in the fourth quarter, compared with
about 70% in the third quarter and about 67% in the fourth quarter of 2015.
We expect the first quarter take rate for device payment plans to be similar to 4Q, as two-year service contracts are no
longer available for upgrades by the embedded base. At the end of the quarter, approximately 46% of our postpaying
phone customers had a device payment plan.
Improving the cost structure of our Wireless segment is a priority. We see additional opportunities to increase
efficiencies in our operating model through the continued application of our Verizon Lean Six Sigma processes.
On total revenues, our EBITDA Wireless margin was 36.9% for the fourth quarter and 43.8% for year. In terms of
profitability, we generated $8.6 billion of EBITDA in the quarter, a decrease of 5.2%. For the full year, total EBITDA
was $39.0 billion, an increase of 0.2%. As expected, the equipment promotional activity in the quarter was elevated
given the holiday season. We will remain competitive in the marketplace.
In the fourth quarter, overall traffic on LTE increased by approximately 49%, while we extended our lead in the
industry's third-party performance studies across the country. Wireless capital spending totaled $3.5 billion in the
quarter and $11.2 billion for the full year.
Now, let's turn to slide nine and take a closer look at Wireless connections growth. In the fourth quarter, we added
high-quality retail postpaid net additions of 591,000, with a sequential improvement in the number of 4G smartphone
and total phone net adds. We added 552,000 new 4G smartphones in the quarter, which are partially offset by a net
decline in 3G smartphones, resulting in 456,000 net new smartphones. Total postpaid phone net adds totaled 167,000,
which included a net decline of basic phones.
Tablet net additions totaled 196,000, which was 764,000 less than last year due to lower gross adds and higher churn
resulting from previous year's promotions. Full-year postpaid net additions of 2.3 million included 1.8 million 4G
smartphones and 1.4 million 4G tablets. The primary offset to these net additions was net declines in basic phones and
3G smartphones.
Postpaid gross additions improved sequentially to 4.2 million for the fourth quarter and to 15.4 million for the full year.
Our disciplined focus on customer retention resulted in retail postpaid phone churn of less than 0.9%. Overall, our retail
postpaid churn increased year-over-year due to higher tablet churn to 1.1%.
Total postpaid device activations totaled 13.1 million in the quarter, down 1.9%; and 43.2 million for the full year,
down 7.3%. About 85% of these activations were phones, with tablets accounting for the majority of the other device
activations. About 8.3% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the fourth quarter, up sequentially and
consistent with prior year. During the quarter, 8.6 million phones were activated on device payment plans.
Net prepaid devices declined by 9,000 in the quarter, compared to a decline of 157,000 in the prior year. We are seeing
sustained year-over-year improvement in retail prepaid. We ended the year with 114.2 million total retail connections,
excluding wholesale and Internet of Things connections. Our industry-leading postpaid connections base grew 2.1% to
108.8 million, and our prepaid connections totaled 5.4 million.

Let's move next to our Wireline segment, starting with a review of our consumer and mass markets revenue
performance on slide 10. In the Wireline segment, consumer revenue increased 0.2%. And mass markets, which
include small business, declined 0.2% in the fourth quarter.
For the full year, consumer revenues expanded by 0.4%, and mass markets declined by 0.3%. Fios total revenue again
increased 4.4% in the fourth quarter and increased 4.6% in 2016. Fios revenue growth was primarily driven by an
increase in the total customer base and strong demand for higher internet speeds. In Fios Internet, we added 68,000 net
customers for the quarter and 235,000 for the year. We now have a total of about 5.7 million Fios Internet subscribers,
representing 40.4% penetration.
In Fios Video, we added 21,000 net customers in the quarter and 59,000 for the year and now have a total of 4.7 million
Fios video subscribers, which represents a 34.3% penetration. Similar to prior quarters, we continue to see strong
demand for Custom TV offerings. Our One Fiber initiative in Boston is progressing as expected, and we launched
consumer and business services to customers late in the fourth quarter.
We continue to innovate with our Fios platform utilizing our fiber assets. And earlier this month we introduced Instant
Internet, which is a new service that offers both upload and download speeds of 750 megabits per second. This service
was introduced in New York, New Jersey, Philadelphia and Richmond, and other markets will see the service soon.
Let's turn to slide 11 and cover Enterprise and Wholesale, as well as the Wireline segment in total. Global Enterprise
revenue declined 4.5%; and on a constant currency basis, was down about 4% in the fourth quarter. For the full year,
Global Enterprise revenue declined 3.6%; and on a constant currency basis, was down about 3%. In our Wholesale
business, as expected, revenues declined 7.5% in the fourth quarter due to the impact of non-recurring items in the prior
year. For the year, Wholesale revenue declined 4.9%.
Total operating revenues for the Wireline segment declined 3.1% in the quarter and 2.3% for the full year. The impacts
of the labor contract workforce reduction and tight cost control supported improved profitability, while maintaining
strong customer satisfaction.
The segment EBITDA margin was 24.1% for the quarter and 19.6% for the year. We expect to see continuing
improvement on an annual basis with seasonal fluctuations.
Capital spending in Wireline was $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter and totaled $4.5 billion for the year. Regarding our
pending Wireline transactions, we expect the acquisition of XO Communications to close in the first quarter, and the
data center transaction to close in the second quarter.
Let's move next to slide 12 to discuss our strategic position. Entering 2017, we are confident in our strategy and
priorities for future growth and profitability. The foundation of the three-tier strategy begins with our commitment to
invest in our best-in-class networks. Above the network layer resides our platform layer, which we are developing and
creating new business models to monetize the ever-increasing digital traffic growth.
Our goal is to be the trusted provider of connecting people and things and providing scalable solutions and analytics.
Network quality and leadership is the cornerstone of this strategy and at the forefront of our brand value proposition to
our customers. Today, we are one of the largest and most reliable 4G network in the country with market-leading fiber
assets.
To expand our network leadership, we are executing on our strategic efforts to densify the 4G network, increase fiber
resources and enhance spectral efficiency. As I noted earlier, we've initiated our next generation fiber network
deployments in Boston. Fiber is an important element of our Wireless networks, as it allows us to strengthen our 4G
LTE capacity, while also preparing for 5G.
Our pending XO Communications acquisition will add to our fiber footprint and provide us with additional metro rings
in 45 out of the top 50 U.S. markets.
5G wireless technology is a focus for us. We are now launching about 10 pre-commercial pilots across the country with
multiple use cases, including dense urban and suburban neighborhoods. Our goal is to test the 5G fixed wireless

technology in different environments in order to successfully operationalize 5G products for a commercial launch. As
noted earlier, we are expanding platforms and building new business models to monetize digital mobile video traffic on
our network.
In our media assets, AOL's content and ad tech capabilities have enhanced our video offerings. With a focus on
delivering timely, short form versions of video clips, we have seen digital video consumption gain traction in the last
year.
At the content and solutions layer of our three-tier strategy, the combination of AOL, go90 and other content has
enabled class cross-platform sharing. This strategy expands our distribution and revenue opportunities globally across
carriers and networks.
We have seen increased usage in the go90 application through this exchange, and we're expanding our unique content
offerings. The average daily usage in go90 was consistent sequentially at about 30 minutes per viewer, with less than
20% of traffic served on the Verizon Wireless network in the second half of the year.
We are actively leveraging our content portfolio and have strategically focused on an ad-supported model. In 2016,
through our joint venture with Hearst, we launched unique content through Complex Media and AwesomenessTV, and
we are looking forward to expanding these offerings this year.
In addition, our extensive digital rights portfolio, including sports such as NFL and NBA, provided enhanced viewing
experiences, such as launching Stream Pass to Verizon Wireless customers across multiple demographics.
Our pending Yahoo! acquisition will further increase our opportunity to scale in the digital media space with its 1
billion plus monthly average unique viewers. We are still working with Yahoo! to assess the impact of the breaches,
and we have not reached any final conclusions yet.
The Internet of Things, including Telematics, is an area of opportunity that is rapidly growing as the connected world
expands. Ubiquitous and reliable coverage to support the vast number of devices expected on these various platforms is
a competitive advantage. And we are developing this ecosystem to leverage our best-in-class networks, while providing
solutions to verticals, such as transportation, energy, agriculture and smart cities.
A great example of this is in the Telematics space. With acquisitions of both Telogis and Fleetmatics, we became the
market share leader. Our Smart City solutions continue to progress and the business is augmented with the acquisitions
of Sensity and LQD WiFi. As a result, we now have a deep inventory of solutions on our IoT platform to provide to our
customers.
Overall, we are confident in our ability to execute, deliver results, and return value to our shareholders, while
continuously transforming the business. As we look at our current and pending assets in the media and IoT businesses,
we will be focused on integrating these assets by increasing global scale organically and further enhancing
cross-platform content sharing opportunities.
Collectively, these assets allow us to participate in the global ecosystem of the connected world. We see a clear path to
revenue contributions from these integrated assets, which will drive returns to the overall business in a less
capital-intensive manner.
Now, let's turn to slide 13 to review 2017 priorities. In 2017, our focus will be leveraging our network leadership
position. We will focus on retaining and growing our high-quality customer base in both Wireless and Wireline, while
balancing profitability in this dynamic environment. Enhancing ecosystems in media and the Internet of Things, led by
Telematics, will further drive the monetization of our network and solutions, both domestically and globally.
We expect full year consolidated revenue, on an organic basis, to be fairly consistent with that of 2016 with
improvement in Wireless service revenue and equipment revenue trends. We also expect full-year consolidated
adjusted EPS trends to be similar to consolidated revenue trends.

Additionally, we're targeting the following for 2017: consolidated capital spending between $16.8 billion and $17.5
billion; minimum pension funding requirement of approximately $600 million; and in terms of income taxes, we expect
our effective tax rate for financial reporting purposes to be in the range of 34% to 36%, based on current legislation.
We will execute on the long-term strategy to position the business for the future.
With that, I will turn the call back to Mike so we can get to your questions.
Michael T. Stefanski
Thank you, Matt. Tori, we're now ready to take questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] One moment please for the
first question. Your first question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. You may ask
your question.
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Great. Thanks very much. Good morning. Matt, maybe we could start with the last point on
the guidance. Can you just give us a reconciliation of the new guidance versus the previous GDP type growth and
normal type EPS? What are the changes there causing that? And on EPS specifically, can you just help us reconcile
what the base number that you'll be using for sort of a flat kind of organic number would be for all the adjustments with
Frontier and the labor dispute, et cetera? Thank you.
<A - Matthew D. Ellis>: Thank you, Simon, for the question. Good morning. So, I guess, let's start with the outlook
we gave this morning, and I'll start with the revenue. So as you saw from that, we said we expect to see it consistent
with 2016 on an organic basis, and we continue to see the revenue trajectory of the business improve. So as you saw in
the release, we expect that to be fairly consistent on an organic basis. So this is an improvement over 2016 when
revenues declined 2.4% on a comparable basis.
So let's unpack that for a second and see how we get to that improvement from the negative 2.4%, up to something
that's more comparable; and obviously the major driver is Wireless, where total revenue was down 2.7% last year and
service revenue was down 5.4%. So if we look into the service revenue component there, that trajectory improved
throughout the year. We started in the first quarter of 2016, down 6.2%; we ended the year in the fourth quarter, down
4.9%; and the year as a whole average, down 5.4% as I said.
So as we expect that trend to continue to get better, we should see a better number year-over-year in Wireless service
revenue. Equipment revenue should also be higher, given the higher device payment take rate, which we expect to be
similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter, which was at 77%. And so, obviously improvement in Wireless, it will be
the biggest factor year-over-year.
And as you look at the other parts of the business, we expect Wireline revenue trends to be similar to 2016. And then,
Media Co., we expect that will continue to build off the progress made last year. And then, within the IoT businesses,
obviously including Telematics, that grew 21% in the fourth quarter and we expect that business to continue to grow at
a very healthy pace. So on a combined basis, we're confident in seeing a better revenue trajectory in 2017 than last
year.
When you talk about how we gave the outlook on revenue versus what we've been saying previously, I think the
biggest item you've got to look at in there is Wireless service revenue. So we continue to make good progress
transitioning the base to unsubsidized service pricing. And as customers come out of their two-year subsidy plans, we
see them quickly migrate to the unsubsidized service pricing. And we ended the year with 67% of postpaid customers
now on those unsubsidized pricing plans. And so, while we were happy to have seen the acceleration, it does provide a

headwind to service revenue.
And then, additionally within service revenue, we saw a higher level of migrations than past pricing changes to the
plans that we introduced in the middle of last year. That functionality of those new plans appeal to our base, and we
saw customers take advantage of that and optimize their plan. So those two developments especially have essentially
pushed out our expectation of the timing of service revenue to return to year-over-year growth from the end of 2017
into 2018.
As so, then as you look at the earnings side of it, obviously the largest driver of EPS changes is what happens in the
Wireless service revenue. So obviously with service revenue being $66 billion, more than half percent of our total
revenue, it's the largest driver. And so, we continue to work through that service revenue migration.
It is offset by the strong cost management we've had across the business. And that's been a hallmark of our performance
over the past few years using the Verizon Lean Six Sigma program that you heard us talk about previously; and that
will continue to produce significant benefits in 2017. And we'll also see a full-year benefit in 2017 from the new labor
contracts.
So when you factor in all of the above, we expect to produce strong earnings again in 2017. And we talked about the
trend we expect on EPS. You've obviously got the impact in 2016 of one year of the Frontier properties in the first
quarter and obviously the work stoppage. But in total, we'll be around – the revenue lines – we'll be around where we
were in 2016 is the baseline of our view for 2017.
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Okay. So just to be clear, on the EPS, we should take the EPS that you reported for 2016 as
the base for 2017?
<A - Matthew D. Ellis>: That's a reasonable starting point, yes.
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Okay; great. And then, just one last thing on the optimization. Has that sort of faded at this
point, or is that still continuing at quite a pace? Was that kind of a three or four-month effect, or are you still seeing a
lot of that going on?
<A - Matthew D. Ellis>: We're seeing that still continue, but we saw it at certainly an aggressive pace initially after we
launched those plans. So that just means the base moved quicker to those plans than we'd seen in other changes. So
we're excited that we launched product features that were of high level of interest to our customers.
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Great. Thanks, Matt.
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: Simon, thank you. Tori, next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Philip A. Cusick>: Thanks. Just to follow-up, first, on Simon's question. Can you give us explicitly what the
revenue number you're looking at in 2016, sort of the normal number, as well as the earnings number?
<A - Matthew D. Ellis>: Yeah. The normal number for 2016 would be the comparable against the down 2.4% when
you adjust out for the acquisitions over the course of the couple of years.
<Q - Philip A. Cusick>: Sorry. So exactly the dollar number that we should be starting with as the baseline to build
from?
<A - Matthew D. Ellis>: Yeah. I'll come back to you on that one. As I say, we refer off the down 2.4% year-over-year.
It adjusts out for the transactions in both 2016 and also the AOL introduction in 2015. So when you adjust for both of
those, the number. --
<Q - Philip A. Cusick>: Right, and I am just – I'm sorry. Go ahead, Mike.

<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: No. I was just going to say, we'll get you that exact number, because it is both taking out
Frontier for the first quarter, as well as we do make an adjustment because we didn't have a full year of AOL. So that's
how we get to the negative 2.4%. But effectively, what we're saying is, is that organically that plus not including any of
the growth from new businesses that would be the consistent number. But we'll get you that exact number.
<Q - Philip A. Cusick>: Okay. And then, just to make sure, when you talk about better trends and it sounds like you're
looking for stability, that revenue number you're looking for dollars of stability year-over-year, not stable downtick in
percentages, correct? Not down on 2% revenue [indiscernible] (35:39)
<A - Matthew D. Ellis>: Correct. It's been on a dollar basis year-over-year, and we get there through seeing
improvements in the trend on the service revenue trajectory, the equipment revenue trajectory, so in total across
Wireless. And then, also the newer businesses. Whether it be Media Co. or across the Internet of Things businesses, we
continue to expect to see the revenue from those businesses improve in 2017.
<Q - Philip A. Cusick>: Okay. That makes sense. And then, on earnings, is it $3.86 that we're using as the baseline
from 2016 to jump off into 2017, or is that a different number?
<A - Matthew D. Ellis>: I'd go off of the $3.87 that we had on an adjusted basis, adjusting out for the mark-to-market
and other items.
<Q - Philip A. Cusick>: $3.87. Got it. Okay. And then, just to add one more new one. You talked about the GAAP tax,
34% to 36%. How should we think about cash taxes in 2017 under the current legislation?
<A - Matthew D. Ellis>: Yeah. We would expect cash taxes to converge towards the effective tax rate during 2017.
<Q - Philip A. Cusick>: So a higher cash tax rate in 2017 than 2016?
<A - Matthew D. Ellis>: Yeah. The cash tax is just purely on income. Obviously, our cash taxes for 2016 did include
$3.2 billion of taxes related to the Frontier transaction. We would expect to have cash taxes in 2017 related to the
disposal of the data centers, when that occurs, at a lower level. But on the organic tax on earnings, we would expect
that the cash taxes to be closer to the ETR during the course of 2017.
<Q - Philip A. Cusick>: Okay. And do you have any initial thought on what the different plans of tax changes could
be? Anything you can help us as we model out the different impacts from border adjustments and things like that?
<A - Matthew D. Ellis>: Yeah. So as we look at taxes, we certainly – look, it's a little too soon to tell, right? We
certainly are supportive of changes in the tax legislation. We believe that we need to get to a more competitive tax
environment. And we look forward to working with Congress and the new administration as they try and put new tax
rates forward.
Certainly, a reduction in the rate would be beneficial. 100% expensing of CapEx would be beneficial initially. But the
plans being discussed also include items such as the removal of the interest expense deduction. And then, as you
mentioned, we're all trying to understand exactly how border adjustability may or may not work.
So certainly believe that tax reform would be a benefit to us. Whichever year is the first year it applies to, whether it
applies to 2017 or whether it initially apply to 2018, we're definitely seeing it being a benefit to the cash taxes we pay.
But given the uncertainty of the specifics of the plan, it's a little too soon to say exactly how much that could be.
<Q - Philip A. Cusick>: Can you give us an idea of, within your CapEx and OpEx, what, either a dollar number or a
percent, comes from overseas? And then I'll stop. Sorry.
<A - Matthew D. Ellis>: Yeah. I don't think we've disclosed that number previously. So we'd have to go back and look
that. But no, we're not going to disclose that at this time.
<Q - Philip A. Cusick>: Thanks very much.

<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: Phil, there is a reconciliation of the number for revenue that we're using in our financials
that we released this morning on our website. But the number is $121.8 billion. So $121.8 billion would be the base for
the revenue, as we discussed.

<Q - Philip A. Cusick>: Okay. Great. Tori, if you could, next question.
Operator
Thank you. Next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - John Christopher Hodulik>: Great. Thanks. Maybe another follow-up on the guidance. Matt, obviously there's a
lot of moving parts, but with the revenue trends and EPS trends sort of mirroring each other, it seems to suggest
roughly sort of flattish margins, but you're leaving the year with real strength in Wireline profitability. So, first of all, if
you could talk about what's driving that and expectations for that to continue. Does that imply that the margins on the
Wireless side, looking out into 2017, should be sort of flat to maybe even down? And maybe talk a little bit about that
trend, especially given the help that you should see from the removal of subsidies in the year? Thanks.
<A - Matthew D. Ellis>: Thanks, John, for the question. So starting off with Wireline, certainly Wireline had a good
result in the fourth quarter. I would tell you, as we said in our prepared remarks, that we would expect Wireline
margins for 2017 and the year as a whole to be higher than they were in 2016; and you'll see some seasonal fluctuations
in there, as we typically do. So I would tell you it'd be reasonable to expect Wireline margins for the year as a whole to
be in the low-20s, compared to the 19% that we saw for 2016.
So we see a lot of improvements going through the business there. Obviously, we're going to have the full year benefit
of the new labor contract through there, and we continue to manage costs in that business very closely, in line with the
revenue trajectory. So we continue to see kind of similar revenue trajectories for the Enterprise and Wholesale
businesses and are excited about the Fios business, which was up last year 4.6% on a full-year basis for Fios revenues.
And we continue to have more open-for-sale properties there that creates opportunities as we head into 2017.
On overall margins, and you talked about the Wireless margins, this always comes back to where the service revenue
trajectory is going to be. And so, we certainly see improvements in service revenue year-over-year, but we do go into
the year off that 4.9% jump-off point from the fourth quarter and we expect to see that continue to improve as we head
into 2017. But as I've said, we now see the point at which we get back to year-over-year positive number pushing out
into 2018.
And so, I would expect us to continue to have very strong margins in the Wireless business, but it's going to be off of
that service revenue trajectory continuing to be slightly negative though in an improving direction.
<Q - John Christopher Hodulik>: Do you think that on a net basis you can keep those Wireless margins flattish?
<A - Matthew D. Ellis>: We will continue to aim to produce the strong margins in that business, and certainly believe
that we have the ability to maintain a premium pricing in the market; and that will certainly be our aim as we go
through the year.
<Q - John Christopher Hodulik>: Great. Thanks, Matt.
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: All right. Thanks, John. Tori, next question, please.

<Q - David William Barden>: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess, two, if I could. First, Matt,
obviously a lot of focus on the guidance. Taking maybe $2 billion to $3 billion of revenue out of that number, it feels
like something's changed on the ground competitively that's making you have to really get more aggressive on the EIP
side and then the promotional side. Do you feel like Verizon needs to go to market more aggressively with an unlimited
product like each of your competitors has and is kind of leading with these days?
And if you could kind of talk about kind of your view – we all knew Fran's views on the economics of that, but I'd love
to kind of hear what your perspective is on the necessity that you do that and your ability to do that if you chose to?
And then, the second thing, just now with Ajit Pai's elevation to the Chair, I think that we have greater clarity on the
likelihood that we're going to be getting rid of the privacy rules, specifically aimed at telecom, also the opportunity to
maybe more aggressively monetize broadband. Could you talk a little bit about some of the opportunities and actions
that you might be taking right now to prepare for kind of the next regulatory wave? Thanks.
<A - Matthew D. Ellis>: Yeah. Thank you, David. So I'll start with your first question. So as we look at our market
position, it's based off the product offering. And we have the best network performance out there, which is a major
criteria in the user experience. Despite the claims of others, third-party studies continue to demonstrate the superiority
of our network. And this network leadership position obviously allows us to maintain a premium price for our service
in the marketplace.
So as I look at our service revenues plus installment billing, so the total amount we're actually billing a customer each
month, that increased 2% in 2016. So that demonstrates our offerings continue to be competitive and resonate in the
marketplace. We constantly monitor the competitive market, look for opportunities to compete more effectively. And
as an example of that, we recently launched new single-line pricing which we believe was an underpenetrated market
for us.
So our pricing is disciplined to provide a return for our premium service. There's a number of different offers out there.
We saw some folks go to unlimited, we saw some bundling of content and so on in the marketplace. We continue to
assess where we are in there. And as I say, I think our results – we had 167,000 net phone adds in the quarter. So I
believe our positioning continues to be competitive.
We constantly look at what's out there. Unlimited is one of the things that some of our competition has at this point in
time. That's not something we feel the need to do. But, as I say, we continually monitor the market and we'll see where
we head in the future.
And in terms of your second question, so, look, there's a lot of changes going on in D.C. right now obviously.
Yesterday, we saw the announcement that – as you mentioned, of Ajit Pai. And so, that may have a number of impacts
across the regulatory space. But I think it's just too soon to tell exactly where we're going to be. We look forward to
working with the regulators, whether it's the FCC or others.
The other thing that I'd mention though as you think about that, we make investments for many years given the nature
of the business that we're in and our investments aren't focused on just who happens to be in office today. We're
making investments that are for 10-plus years. And I think our record stands for itself that irrespective whoever the
administration is run by and the regulatory regime that were effective. And that will continue to be how we focus our
investments. And so, we're looking forward to working with the new administration and the new leadership in the FCC,
and we expect to continue to be competitive in whatever environment we're operating in.
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: David, thank you. Tori, if we can move to the next question.

Next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead with your question.

the pre-Vodafone deal levels, how much room does that leave you before 2018/2019 for strategic transactions? There's
been a lot of speculation about the types of things that you might do in this new environment, whether it's content, or
wireline, or spectrum, or none of the above. I am wondering if you could just sort of give us some thoughts on how
much flexibility you have and how do you think about the various vectors of opportunity for you?
<A - Matthew D. Ellis>: Yeah. Thanks, Craig. So as you mentioned that we have been on this path to getting back to
the pre-Vodafone credit metrics by 2018/2019, and that's part of our overall capital allocation. We've been able to be
consistent with investing in our networks on a continuous basis, making that improvement in the balance sheet, and
also returning value to shareholders.
And since the Vodafone transaction, we've had a number of activities that we've done, whether that be AOL, some of
the other acquisitions in IoT such as Fleetmatics, we've also divested of businesses, whether it be the tower transaction,
as an example. And so, we've been able to continually make strategic transactions while staying consistent to each part
of that capital allocation policy.
So that will be our intent to continue to do so. And as we head into 2017, we believe that we'll be able to continue to
maintain that capital allocation policy that allows us to deliver on all three of those key areas.
<Q - Craig Eder Moffett>: And, Matt, can you comment on how you think about the various options out there,
whether it's content, or wireline, or spectrum, or something else?
<A - Matthew D. Ellis>: Yeah. So obviously, look, I'm not going to comment on any specific combinations that have
been rumored over the years, and certainly we're not able to talk specifically about spectrum right now given that we're
in the incentive auction. So we will continue to look for opportunities to expand and grow the business. Lowell and I
are completely aligned that we will be disciplined in any investment activity.
We evaluate all options, whether that's build by our partner for our strategic positioning and the key criteria is creating
a long-term value for the business and shareholders. So we'll continue to look for the right things to do to position the
business to be successful in the future. And we do that on an everyday basis and we'll continue to do so. And I think
we've successfully done that over the past few years.
<Q - Craig Eder Moffett>: Thanks, Matt.

Thank you. Next question comes from Mike Rollins of Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Michael I. Rollins>: Hi. Thanks, and good morning. Two, if I could. First, if you could talk about how the 5G
business case is progressing from a financial perspective. And, Matt, what are the key metrics that you're looking for
from the team that's working on the business case to facilitate a green light of commercial deployment? Is there certain
cost metrics like per home passed or certain other metrics that you're focused on?
And then, just if I could follow up on a clarification. So I think you mentioned that in terms of thinking about flat
organic revenue for 2017, you took the revenue for 2016, you subtracted the divestiture of markets to Frontier and you
subtracted AOL. Can you help us think through what the add-backs then are for 2017 with the number of pending and
completed acquisitions that you announced and are still in progress? Thanks.
<A - Matthew D. Ellis>: Thanks, Mike. So let me start off with 5G. So, look, we had good progress in 2016, as we
discussed, throughout the year. We had a number of technical trials and [ph] lab-scale (51:28) trials, which we
completed. And so, we've now moved on for the next phase of that, which is some of these commercial scale pilots that
are getting underway right now in about 10 different locations around the country. So we're very excited about the
opportunities that 5G brings. And we'll see how those trials go and we look forward to sharing progress with you on
those as we move forward throughout the year.

You asked around key metrics, and I think it's going to be the same as any major investment we could be looking at, is
the combination of what's the cost to rollout 5G. We get into questions about how the distance from the node, how
many homes can you cover on any particular node, what speeds can we get, what's the cost of putting that there, et
cetera, et cetera. XO obviously brings something to that by adding additional fiber to the base as we think about rolling
out the infrastructure needed for 5G.
But it's the same as any investment, Mike. We're going to look at the revenue opportunity we think we can get based
off of the results of the tests that are underway right now and compare that with the cost. And if it provides a great
return for shareholders, we will certainly move ahead with launching commercially. And if it'll be the same as any
other investment, we'll look at it the same way.
In terms of your second question on 2016, you're right, the baseline is reducing the Frontier divestiture and also AOL
because we only had it for partially – part of the year in 2015. So then if you think about total revenue for 2017, it
would include obviously the full year of AOL this year. We expect XO to kick in later this quarter. We expect the IoT
businesses. You're going to have the full year of Fleetmatics and Telogis and the other IoT acquisitions. And then,
assuming the Yahoo! transaction closes, you'll have the revenue from there too.
So when you think about building on the number that Mike mentioned, the $121 billion, you got all of those things to
layer on top of that to get to the expectation for the full year. Obviously, as it relates to pending transactions, it'll be
contingent on the timing of those as well. So hopefully that answers your question on that.
<Q - Michael I. Rollins>: Thanks very much.
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: Okay. Tori, next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Brett Feldman>: Thanks for taking the question. If I look at your CapEx guidance for the full year, essentially
seems you're guiding to flat, plus or minus a reasonable range. I was hoping you can maybe unpack that a little bit. And
just thinking about your network strategy and your product strategy, what areas are you accelerating capital investment
inside the business? And maybe where do you feel like you've done a good job building out your network where it
needs to be? Thanks.
<A - Matthew D. Ellis>: Yeah. Thanks, Brett. So as you think about the CapEx, as you say, the number is reasonably
consistent year after year, and that's something you've seen from us for a number of years. But as you say, within that it
changes over time. And so, within LTE our spending has -- continues to transition from coverage to densifying the
network. And that continues to evolve as we leverage new technologies around radio, and hardware and software, and
then [ph] refarming (55:01) our spectrum within 4G and densifying with small cell.
So you'll continue to see that densification of the 4G network. And that includes how we put fiber out there which
obviously is needed for the 4G network, but also is something that we think about for prepositioning for 5G. So you'll
continue to see that.
You'll continue to see us launch additional parts of LTE Advanced as we go through that. We had the initial launch of
that last year. We expect additional features to come through in the course of this year, and we'll continue to expand our
CRAN architecture. So within Wireless, you should expect to see the spending continue to move to make the network
more efficient on a cost per gig basis going forward.
And then, as we've mentioned, fiber is a consistent part of our business. So that's something you should expect to see us
continue in. We've talked about what we're doing in Boston. You should continue to see us do that. Some of the other
businesses aren't, as we said previously, they're not as capital-intensive as our network business. So you should expect
to see the CapEx will continue to be focused on the network side of the business as we go into 2017.

<Q - Brett Feldman>: And just a quick question as a follow-up around where you're investing. You talked about the
pre-commercial – the 5G commercial trials you're running. Are those predominately within your Wireline footprint, or
do you actually think that when you're ready to go commercial you have a business case to go in whatever markets look
like they have the best demographics regardless of whether you're an incumbent Wireline provider or not?
<A - Matthew D. Ellis>: Yeah. It's not just in the ILEC footprint; it's across the country. And we certainly see the
opportunity to deploy 5G solutions across the country as well, once we get comfortable that they're ready to be
launched out on a commercial basis.
<Q - Brett Feldman>: So you could do One Fibers in markets across the country, not just in Boston?
<A - Matthew D. Ellis>: Yeah. That's certainly – it's certainly we're looking at how we would support the 5G network
across the country, both in and outside the ILEC footprint.
<Q - Brett Feldman>: Thank you.
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: Tori, next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from Mike McCormack of Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Mike L. McCormack>: Hey, guys. Thanks. Matt, maybe just a clarification on your comments regarding service
revenue turning positive. Just give us a sense: obviously optimization continues, but is that predicated on a stable
pricing environment in your view?
Secondly, on the retention side, looks like you got about a 21% delta between those that are on unsubsidized plans
versus those making device payments. Is that fair? And then, as we think about that, how much of that is bring your
own device, versus off contract, versus your own retention efforts?
And then, if you don't mind, a final one. Based on our math, it looks like you still have about 13.1-ish million feature
phones out there, so non-smartphones. What's the strategy to try to move those over to smartphones, or try to retain
them to prevent headwinds on handsets as we look into 2017?
<A - Matthew D. Ellis>: Yeah. Thanks, Mike. I'll start with the last one. Look, we certainly like it when customers
migrate from feature phones to an LTE smartphone, but we're also very happy for those customers that just want a
feature phone. They're not looking for the additional functionality, but they want to be connected to a great network.
We're very happy to continue to have those as customers, and we look forward to continuing to have offerings that
meet their needs as well.
In terms of service revenue, and I think you talked about the gap between the 46% of our customers who have a device
payment plan and the 67% of our base who now are on [ph] unsubsidized (58:54) pricing. That's a factor of as
customers come out of their two-year service contracts and they move over to that pricing without necessarily
upgrading a handset -- and we expect that will continue – that that delta between those two numbers will be those
customers who've either, they've come out of two-year subsidy and moved over to the unsubsidized pricing, they could
be – we now have customers who took out a device payment plan over two years ago, who have completed those
payments and are now no longer making a device payment every month. And as you say, BYOD continues to be part of
that base too.
So you should expect there continue to be a delta between those two numbers, because not everyone on unsubsidized
pricing is going to have a current device plan. So we see that continuing as we go into the year. And part of the whole
thing is migrating over to device payment.
<Q - Mike L. McCormack>: Okay. Just a clarification then, Matt. I guess I am trying to get to how much of that – I
am sorry to interrupt – but the actual percentage that is you going into actively retain customers that are still on contract

to reduce their price point without losing a customer, is there some component of that as well?
<A - Matthew D. Ellis>: Yeah. The vast majority of our two-year customers who've gone on to the unsubsidized
pricing is when they've come to the end of that. I mean, we typically – customer has to get through their two-year price
plan if they're on that two-year service contract before they would then be able to come to the unsubsidized pricing.
When you look at our churn, I think what you're trying to get to is that phone churn that was below 0.9%. And that is
not because we're bringing customers on to that pricing before they've moved. I think that continued strong churn
represents the value our base sees, and the service they get, and the high quality of the network that they have when
they're a Verizon customer. So it's only when they come out of their two-year contract do they move over to – have the
opportunity to move over to unsubsidized pricing.
<Q - Mike L. McCormack>: Okay. Thanks for the clarification. And just on the service revenue expectation, is that –
the stable pricing is the expectation there, or expecting additional promotions if you look at 2017?
<A - Matthew D. Ellis>: We expect to continue to compete in the marketplace. And throughout 2016 we had various
promotions throughout the year. I'd expect us to continue to, at different times of the year, have different promotions
out there. But I expect, based off that, we will compete effectively in the marketplace.
<Q - Mike L. McCormack>: Great. Thank you, Matt.
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: Thanks, Mike. Tori, we have time for one more question. So last question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Your last question comes from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Amir Rozwadowski>: Thanks very much, and good morning. Just a quick follow-up on Brett's questions on
fiber. Specifically, how should we think about your future fiber needs. It seems like in some context you're willing to
shed certain assets, but have also acquired others and are also working with third-party providers in some cases
overbuilding in areas such as Boston. What I am trying to understand is that based on your actions it seems as though
not all fiber assets are created equal. And so, how do you get to the point where you have the right fixed assets and the
right locations to support your network vision? And I've just got a brief follow-up.
<A - Matthew D. Ellis>: Yeah. So good morning, Amir. Thank you for that. Fiber is going to be a critical asset for us.
It's a critical asset today and it will certainly continue to be so as we go into the future. So one thing it allows us to do,
and this certainly is within our footprint, is it replaces the core copper networks that have served us well over the years,
but from a capability standpoint and also just a maintenance standpoint it certainly makes a lot of sense for us to
continue to replace copper with fiber. And then, as you say, fiber is going to be critical for us as we densify 4G and
think about 5G. That explains why the XO transaction was interesting to us, getting those metro rings in 45 of the top
50 markets.
The other thing you've seen us doing for Boston was really look at this One Fiber approach, which was building the
network in a way that it provides a common fiber infrastructure to serve a number of different needs, whether that be
consumers in-home, or in out-of-home, and then obviously our small, medium and enterprise customers too. So you
should continue to see us deploy fiber. How we deploy that fiber can differ from location to location. We certainly look
where it makes sense for us to own the fiber. But if there is way for us to partner with other people where they can
build the fiber on our behalf, we certainly do that as well.
So it's a location by location, case by case basis. We look at the economics and we decide the best way to get to the
fiber assets that we need. And we think about that it's not just the fiber assets that we need for what we're doing today,
but as we think about the network going out into the future. So you should continue to see us make investments in fiber
as we go forward and position the network to service the business well into the future.

<Q - Amir Rozwadowski>: Great. And just a quick follow-up on your 2017 outlook. What type of factors do you take
into account on any potential changes to the competitive landscape. In particular, Comcast has highlighted that they
expect to launch their Wi-Fi/MVNO strategy in the back half of the year. Given you folks are partnered there, I was
wondering what you're factoring in with respect to that partnership in terms of size and impact of both your financials
and potentially the competitive landscape?
<A - Matthew D. Ellis>: Yes. So as I think about it, look, we know they said they expect to launch that later in the
year. We'll have to wait and see what is. As we've said previously, look, we've been in the Wholesale business for
many years. We're happy to be in that business and we'd sign that agreement again if the opportunity came up. But,
look, we don't expect that to necessarily have a major impact during the course of 2017. They've got a lot of work to do
there, and I'll let them talk about their strategy on that.
But as I think about the competitive environment as a whole, I would expect it to continue to evolve in ways that some
of which we may guess, others which we'll have to wait and see how they play out. But what I remind you is that we've
seen many different competitive environments over the past 15, 20 years in Wireless and I think the one constant has
been is the way that we've always competed effectively, whatever the environment. And I'd highly expect us to do the
same thing in 2017.
Michael T. Stefanski
Great. Thank you for your questions. Tori, before we end the call, I'd like to turn the call back to Matt.
Matthew D. Ellis
Thanks, Mike. I'd like to close this session with a few key points. In 2016, we delivered solid results in a competitive
environment. We added quality customers, while leading the industry in network performance and customer retention.
We had solid financial results generating cash flow and shareholders return. We're confident in our strategy and
priorities, led by investing in our networks, creating platforms to further monetize daily usage, maintaining a
disciplined capital allocation model, and returning value to our shareholders.
We're positioning the company for long-term growth. A key foundational element for our vision of the future is to be
the trusted network provider. Our strong network assets will enable us to be a centerpiece of this new connected world
of people and things, and give us the opportunity to participate globally in advancing digital ecosystems. We look
forward to the opportunities ahead of us to create value for our customers and shareholders. Thank you for your time
today.
