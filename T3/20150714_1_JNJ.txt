Operator: Good morning and welcome to Johnson & Johnson's Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call.
All participants will be able to listen-only until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This call is being
recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. [Operator Instructions]
I would now like to turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin.
Louise Mehrotra
Good morning and welcome. I'm Louise Mehrotra, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson and it
is my pleasure this morning to review our business results for the second quarter of 2015.
Joining me on the call today are Alex Gorsky, Chairman of the board of directors and Chief Executive Officer; Sandi
Peterson, Group Worldwide Chairman; and Dominic Caruso, Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer.
A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast, accessible through the
Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com.
I'll begin by briefly reviewing second quarter for the corporation and for our three business segments. Alex will provide
additional commentary on the business and our progress with regards to our near-term priorities. Next, Sandi, will
provide an update on our Consumer and Consumer Medical Device businesses. Lastly, Dominic will review the income
statement and discuss guidance for 2015.

We will then open the call to your questions. We expect the call to last approximately 90 minutes. Included with the
press release that was issued earlier this morning is the schedule of sales for key products and/or businesses to facilitate
updating your models. These schedules are available on the Johnson & Johnson website, as is the press release. Please
note we will be using a presentation to complement today's commentary. The presentation is also available on our
website.
Before we begin, let me remind you that some of the statements made during this review are or may be considered
forward-looking statements. The 10-K for the fiscal year 2014 and the company's subsequent filings identify certain
factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking
statements made today.
The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future
events or developments. Our SEC filings including the 10-K are available through the company and on our website.
During the review, non-GAAP financial measures are used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business
performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered replacements for and should be read
together with GAAP results.
Tables reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the schedules
accompanying the press release and on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website.
Now, I would like to review results for the second quarter of 2015. Worldwide sales to customers were $17.8 billion for
the second quarter of 2015, down 8.8% versus second quarter 2014. On an operational basis, sales were down 0.9%,
and currency had a negative impact of 7.9%. In the U.S., sales were down 2.4%. In regions outside the U.S., our
operational growth was 0.5%, while the effective currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported results by
14.8%.
On an operational basis, the Asia-Pacific, Africa region grew by 2.2%, while Europe grew 1% and the Western
Hemisphere, excluding the U.S. declined 4%. Growth in the U.S. and Japan was negatively impacted by hepatitis C
competition. Growth in all regions was impacted by divestitures, the most significant one being Ortho Clinical
Diagnostics.
Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying operational growth was 1.7% worldwide, 0.6% in
the U.S. and 2.7% outside the U.S. Additionally, excluding hepatitis C sales, underlying operational growth was 5%.
Turning now to earnings, net earnings were $4.5 billion and earnings per share were $1.61, versus $1.51 a year-ago. As
referenced in the table reconciling non-GAAP measures, 2015 second quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude
after-tax amortization expense of $230 million, and a charge of $66 million for after-tax special items. 2014 second
quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude a charge of $807 million. Dominic will discuss special items in his
remarks.
Excluding amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the current quarter were
$4.8 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.71, representing decreases of 6.3% and 3.9% respectively
as compared to the same period in 2014. Currency translation significantly impacted net earnings. On an operational
basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 6.7%.
Turning now to business segment highlights, please note percentages quoted represent operational sales change in
comparison to the second quarter of 2014, unless otherwise stated and therefore, excludes the impact of currency
translation. I'll begin with the Consumer segment.
Worldwide Consumer segment sales of $3.5 billion increased 2.3%, with U.S. sales up 2.7%, while outside the U.S.
sales grew 2.1%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying operational growth was 3.1%
worldwide, 2.9% in the U.S., and 3.2% outside the U.S. Growth was driven by OTC worldwide. Women's Health
outside the U.S. and Oral Care. OTC sales growth was driven by worldwide analgesics, Zyrtec in the U.S. and other
upper respiratory products outside the U.S. Upper respiratory, including Zyrtec sales, included a seasonal inventory
build.

In the U.S., adult analgesic market share was approximately 12%, up from approximately 11% a year-ago, while U.S.
pediatric share was nearly 44%, up from 39% a year-ago. New product launches and successful marketing campaigns
drove the results for LISTERINE in Oral Care and Women's Health products outside the U.S.
Moving now to our Pharmaceutical segment, worldwide sales of $7.9 billion increased 1%, with U.S. sales down 1.5%,
and sales outside the U.S. up 3.8%. New competitors in hepatitis C significantly impacted sales results. Excluding sales
of our hepatitis C products, OLYSIO and INCIVO, as well as the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying
growth worldwide U.S. and outside the U.S. was approximately 9.7%, 16.5%, and 2.5% respectively.
U.S. results included a positive adjustment to sales reserves for managed Medicaid rebates reflecting final data
received. U.S. comparisons to second quarter 2014 were positively impacted by approximately 2%, and worldwide by
approximately 1%. The most significant impact from the managed Medicaid adjustment was to humoral contraceptives.
Significant contributors to growth were INVOKANA/INVOKAMET, IMBRUVICA, XARELTO, ZYTIGA, INVEGA
SUSTENNA or XEPLION, CONCERTA, and immunology products, STELARA and SIMPONI. Strong momentum in
market share increases drove results for INVOKANA/INVOKAMET.
In the U.S., INVOKANA/INVOKAMET achieved 5.9% TRx within the defined market of type 2 diabetes, excluding
insulin and metformin, up from 5.1% in the first quarter of 2015. TRx with endocrinologists grew to 13.2% for the
quarter and 5.2% in primary care, up 1.2% and 0.8% respectively on a sequential basis. INVOKANA/INVOKAMET
remains a category leader in new to brand share with endocrinologists and has greater than 80% preferred access across
commercial and Part D plans.
Strong patient uptake with new indications, approvals and demonstrated efficacy drove results for IMBRUVICA in the
U.S. IMBRUVICA is the leader in both new and total patient regimen share in the second line CLL and MCL. Outside
the U.S., results were driven primarily by Europe, with strong patient uptake particularly in Germany, France and the
U.K.
XARELTO sales were up nearly 31% and total prescription share, or TRx, for the quarter in the U.S. and coagulant
market grew to 15.4%, up over two points from a year-ago. TRx in primary care reached 12.4% and in cardiology,
23.7%. XARELTO is broadly reimbursed with over 90% of commercial and Medicare Part D patients covered at the
lowest branded product copay. Strong growth of the combined metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer market at
nearly 12.5% drove the results for ZYTIGA in the U.S. ZYTIGA share was approximately 28.6% of that market, down
approximately 1.7 points on a sequential basis due to increased competition.
As an update, during the quarter we received several Paragraph IV notifications from generic manufacturers advising
that they filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications with the FDA seeking approval to market a generic version of
ZYTIGA in the U.S. before the expiration of the relevant patents listened in the Orange Book.
The composition of matter patent is owned by our partner BTG and expires in December 2016, and the method of
treatment patent is owned by Janssen Oncology Inc. and expires in August 2027. We are currently evaluating the
notices.
Outside the U.S., ZYTIGA achieved very strong growth in Asia and Latin America, which was partially offset by lower
sales in Europe due to increased competition. INVEGA SUSTENNA or XEPLION achieved strong results due
primarily to increased market share while CONCERTA growth was primarily due to therapeutic equivalence
reclassification of generic competitors.
The results for immunology were driven by strong double-digit market growth complemented by increased market
share for STELARA and combined SIMPONI, SIMPONI ARIA. Growth was partially offset by lower REMICADE
sales to our distributors reflecting the weakening of the euro and the loss of exclusivity in Europe, as well as a
reduction in inventory levels.
I'll now review the Medical Devices segment results. Worldwide Medical Devices segment sales of $6.4 billion
decreased 4.7%. U.S. sales declined 5.8%, while sales outside the U.S. declined 3.9%. Ortho Clinical Diagnostics was
divested mid-year 2014. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying operational growth was

1.4% worldwide, with the U.S. up 1.6%, and growth of 1.4% outside the U.S.
Growth was driven by Specialty Surgery, Cardiovascular Care and Orthopedics. Specialty Surgery growth was driven
by Biosurgery growth of over 8% and Energy growth of approximately 6% due to market growth, share gains in certain
segments and new product introductions.
Cardiovascular growth was driven by 10% worldwide increase in electrophysiology due to strong sales of the
THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH Catheter.
Orthopedics sales growth was driven by knees and hips as well as Orthovisc and Monovisc in sports medicines. The
growth was partially offset by lower sales in trauma and spine due to pricing pressure coupled with the timing of tender
business and competitive challenges in spine.
Knees worldwide increased 4% with the U.S. up 5%, and sales outside the U.S. up 2%, driven by strong sales of
ATTUNE, partially offset by pricing pressure.
Hips growth of 2% worldwide was driven by 4% growth in the U.S., with strong volume growth partially offset by
continued pricing pressure. Primary stem platform sales were a major contributor to the results.
Outside the U.S., sales were flat with strong growth in China and India, offset by lower sales in the Middle East due to
the timing of tender business.
For your reference, there were some notable developments in the second quarter which we have summarized on this
slide to assist you as you develop your models. That concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson second
quarter of 2015.
It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Alex Gorsky. Alex?
Alex Gorsky
Thank you Louise and good morning everyone. I really appreciate you taking the time to join our call today. And since
we're at the midpoint of the year, I'm excited to share the progress we've made against our near-term priorities. I'll also
use the time today to give some perspective on the environment that we're operating in and some of the macro level
issues we're seeing and also discuss why we believe with our innovation model and breadth and scale of our business
that Johnson & Johnson is strongly positioned to drive continued growth in shareholder value.
So I'll start the discussion, though, where I always do with our Credo. Our Credo serves as the moral compass for our
company and expresses a set of values that bond our associates worldwide with a shared commitment to meet and
really exceed the expectations of the more than 1 billion people a day that rely on our products, as well as to support
our fellow colleagues, the communities in which we live and work, and generate solid return to our shareholders.
Now, back in January, I laid out our near-term priorities for the business, and I'm pleased with our progress towards
them. Across the enterprise, we are very focused on delivering our financial and quality commitments. First, our
commitment to ensuring our products meet the highest quality standards is, of course, non-negotiable; and as to our
financial commitments, thus far in the year, we generated sales of $35.2 billion, reflecting the strong underlying
operational growth across the enterprise of about 6%, when we adjust for the impact of hepatitis C sales and
acquisitions and divestitures. And for the first six months, we delivered adjusted net earnings of $9.2 billion and
adjusted EPS of $3.27. On an operational basis, we delivered adjusted EPS of $3.59, growing at 5.3%.
As we've highlighted previously, we knew that our year-over-year comparisons to our current results would be
challenging, because of tremendous contributions of OLYSIO last year, as well as the impact of divestitures we made
and also the significant devaluation of major foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar.
Now, despite these headwinds, our broad base of innovative offerings, scale and global footprint are driving our strong
core performance. In Pharmaceuticals, we reported sales of $15.7 billion, reflecting strong underlying operational

growth when excluding the impact of hepatitis C and divestitures of over 11% for the first half of 2015, led by our new
and core products, including INVOKANA, IMBRUVICA, XARELTO and STELARA and ZYTIGA.
Our focused R&D strategy and commitment to driving launch excellence to ensure broad access and reimbursement
has really come together to make a difference for patients and has us well positioned to continue to drive above
industry compound annual growth over the next several years. Fueled by seven of our recently launched products, that
we expect will each exceed $1 billion in sales this year and the more than 10 new products we plan to file by 2019, that
each have $1 billion-plus potential of their own, based on their transformational potential to treat significant unmet
medical needs worldwide.
And just last week, our partner, Genmab, announced that we have completed the FDA submission for daratumumab, a
promising new breakthrough treatment option for people with multiple myeloma. This organization has collectively
done great work to generate strong clinical evidence in the development process, which is enabling our reimbursement
teams to gain the right coverage levels in order to create broad access and drive the strong performance of our products,
despite the pricing pressures that exists in the marketplace.
Now, I also want to make a comment here on our position regarding biosimilar competition for REMICADE, which I
know many of you are thinking about. Remember, biosimilars are not generics, and we expect the biosimilar market to
behave quite differently than the market typically has toward the introduction of the generic. Also more than 2.2
million people have been treated with REMICADE and about 70% of the current patients are receiving sustained and
effective treatment, so we believe their doctors are very unlikely to switch them off with that level of success. And we
also have a patent for the REMICADE antibody that doesn't expire until September 2018, that you can be sure we'll
continue to vigorously defend.
Look, we know competitive in the immunology space is fierce. And to ensure we maintain the leadership position,
we've built an established portfolio of $1 billion-plus medicines that include STELARA and SIMPONI and have
potential $1 billion-plus products in our late-stage development like sirukumab for rheumatoid arthritis and guselkumab
for psoriasis that we expect to introduce in the near-term. And we're also making very significant investments in
disruptive research areas like the microbiome, which holds the potential to intercept the disease and prevent it entirely
that will have applications in immunology and really across all our disease areas.
Now, turning to Medical Devices. You know we're number one or number two in the majority of the categories in
which we compete and have 10 $1 billion-plus platforms. Year-to-date, we reported global 0 sales of $12.6 billion,
which is an operational decline of 4.6%, due to the impact of the sale of Ortho Clinical Diagnostics which we
completed a year-ago. When we adjust for that our underlying operational growth in Medical Devices is up 1.4%.
I've been particularly pleased with the performance in several areas of this business, where new innovations are driving
growth, including our Biosense Webster business, which has grown nearly 11% operationally through the first six
months of the year. Our Endocutter business has grown 15.5% and our Biosurgery business with continued strong
growth of 7.5%.
In Diabetes, our products and strong in-market execution are helping to revitalize that business, while our Vision Care
business is on track to return to growth later in the year, when it will anniversary the impact of the 2014 price reset. In
Orthopedics, the business grew 1.5% operationally this year with good growth in the reconstruction and the sports
medicine segment, particularly in the second quarter here in the U.S., where, despite the pricing dynamics in the
market, we saw over 5% growth in knees and approximately 4% in hips.
Our spine and trauma businesses, however, have lagged market growth to-date. And we are absolutely committed to
turning them around. And we have new products launching this year that will help us do just that.
As we look at this market, the ongoing consolidation among health systems and within the insurance industry is
continuing to create pressure on pricing. We've been encouraged, though, by data showing that health care utilization
trends in the U.S. have continued to improve for the fourth consecutive quarter, with growth in both hospital
admissions and hospital surgical procedures and we remain optimistic about increased global health care utilization, as
well. So we are absolutely committed to accelerating our growth in Medical Devices through innovation and through

our research and development, which has been productive as the teams have already submitted more than half of the 30
major filings we previously announced, we plan to file by the end of 2016.
And the work we're doing with Google illustrates how we're aiming to pioneer the operating room of the future with
robotic surgery tools that will increase the surgeon's precision and minimize trauma for their patients, while also
reducing costs for the systems.
We're also transforming our go-to-market models to fully leverage the breadth and scale of our capabilities. We've
taken significant measures to strengthen our core businesses and effectively position ourselves to lead over the
long-term. We just recently integrated our global orthopedics and global surgery businesses under the leadership of
Gary Pruden, which will enable us to have a much more holistic approach to the way we do business. And the goal here
is very straightforward. Let's enhance our partnerships with the hospital systems and identify ways to improve
outcomes by leveraging our comprehensive portfolio.
Now, we already have numerous examples of co-promotions, broad contracting agreements, and service and solution
offerings in place that we can look to expand. And by better working in this new alignment model, we will be better
positioned to create more of them to drive future growth. Gary will be on the third quarter call in October, to tell you
more about this approach.
And now, on the Consumer business, Sandi Peterson and her team, which includes our new Worldwide Chairman for
the Consumer Companies, Jorge Mesquita, a seasoned leader who has been with us since the end of last year, are doing
tremendous work in building and executing a strategy that's effectively addressed the past challenges in our supply
chain and re-prioritized our approach in the category. And we're positioned to expand our market leadership in key
segments moving forward.
Year-to-date, we generated $6.9 billion in sales, a reported operational growth of nearly 4%, excluding acquisitions and
divestitures, driven by our market leading OTC and Oral Care businesses, and our strategy to focus the portfolio around
the key consumer need states, and brands that are backed with strong clinical science and professional endorsements, is
having a strong impact.
The United States OTC medicines are sharply up 13% for the year, led by the strong campaigns we're leading in
support in the relaunch of key brands like Tylenol, Motrin, and Zyrtec. And our momentum here could not have been
achieved without the efforts of our colleagues to complete the complex work required around consent decree. Globally,
we see strong operational growth in emerging markets, particularly in Argentina, Brazil, India, Russia, and Venezuela.
We are, however, experiencing market pressures in China where our volumes have slowed due to lower demand that is
being compounded by shifts in consumer behaviors and the emergence of new retail channels in the country.
In a few minutes, Sandi will take you through the strategy and approach for how our consumer-facing businesses are
leveraging our unique consumer insights and integrating science and different forms of technology to better meet the
needs of consumers and drive growth.
But before we do that, I want to reiterate how we're navigating the environmental changes before us and how we
strongly position Johnson & Johnson to deliver continued growth. As you well know, everything starts with innovation,
and at Johnson & Johnson, we're doing that on multiple fronts and we're committed to working with researchers around
the world to ensure we continue to operate at the leading edge of science, medicine and technology. And that approach
drives our enterprise R&D and the significant investments we are making to benefit patients and stakeholders.
We have a good balance of internal and externally sourced innovations, and acquisitions have accounted for just under
half of our sales growth over the last decade. And we're always actively looking for new value-creating acquisitions
and deals to continue that success.
We also invested about 11.5% of our net trade sales, or $8.5 billion in R&D last year across the enterprise to discover
in-license and develop innovative new products. And you can see the impact reflected in our portfolio and robust
development pipeline, which includes 25 active late-stage development programs, 160-plus early-stage programs, and
over 70 venture investments.

And in just two years, there's already 90 start-ups working in our JLABS, which creates tremendous access to new
ideas and potential downstream partnerships for the future. Now, when it comes to making significant R&D
investments, we must also focus on managing through the inherent complexities in the global, regulatory environment
in order to ensure our products are ultimately able to reach consumers.
We're encouraged by the steps governments are taking to increase access to quality health care for their people and to
also create and support a more innovation-friendly environment through designations that speed the review and
approval of transformational products. We've benefited from that with IMBRUVICA. And today, we have two other
candidates in our Pharma pipeline already designated as breakthrough therapies by the FDA.
At the same time, we can all agree, the governments around the world must do more to protect intellectual property and
ensure fair, transparent, and consistent enforcement of regulations governing the trade of innovative products, and we'll
continue to watch and engage in these issues in the more than 65 countries in which we do business.
Globally, about half of our total year-to-date sales come from countries outside the United States. With strong national
and regional models like those we've installed in China and Southeast Asia, we're better able to maximize the breadth
of our portfolio, interact more effectively with governments, and develop contracting strategies and gain consumer
insights that are shaping our international portfolios and informing R&D and ultimately driving growth.
And by executing with excellence in all that we do, we've introduced a strong cadence of new product launches over
the past five years that today account for about 25% of our overall sales. And we're taking steps to ensure we're even
more effective and efficient across the enterprise by investing in greater uses of technology and streamlining our back
office processes which we expect will help to free up about $1 billion that we can invest back into the business by
2018.
We're also continuing to make strategic decisions about the areas we're going to participate in or move on from. And as
we stated before, our focus is on areas where we are or we can be number one or number two in a particular area, as
well as on those products or businesses that will be directly complementary. And if we have an asset or a business that
doesn't meet those criteria, we've demonstrated that we will divest it and redirect our resources to accelerate existing
programs or to acquire new ones that we think are ultimately going to help more patients and also add more value to
our enterprise.
We also see that our broad base across the healthcare spectrum is a competitive advantage when the strategies we
create consider, and, where appropriate, incorporate insights and innovations from every aspect of our operations to
attack disease and improve health outcomes. The work we are doing with IBM and Apple does this by cutting across
the enterprise and leveraging our science, technology, and consumer insights to empower patients and caregivers to
help speed the post-surgical recovery process.
Executing our strategy ultimately comes down to people. And by focusing on them, and emphasizing our cradle-based
purpose, we developed a deep bench of extraordinary talent who are accountable for driving their businesses and who
also ensure we are taking leading roles within the industry and world medical community to combat global public
health issues like Ebola and HIV.
Now, just to summarize, Johnson & Johnson is a company that's built a remarkable legacy and has a very exciting
future. Healthcare, though, remains one of every society's greatest challenges and nothing affects people more
personally or affects communities and nations more directly. Our business is strong. And you can see that we're
continuing to make considerable investments in innovation and have a robust pipeline of truly transformative products
to ultimately benefit patients, and that we're taking actions to strengthen our leadership positions in areas in which we
compete.
With our transparent and consistent capital allocation strategy, we extended our track record of dividend increases to 53
consecutive years in April when we declared a 7.1% increase, taking our quarterly payout up to $0.75 per share and
have returned about 70% of our free cash flow over the past decade to investors, outpacing the S&P 500 in 2014, as
well as over the last three, 10 and 20 years.

With that, it's now my distinct pleasure to turn the call over to Sandi Peterson.
Sandi joined Johnson & Johnson just over two-and-a-half years ago and is leading a significant transformation across
major components of our enterprise, including our consumer-facing businesses, enterprise supply chain, quality, and
IT, and she has been a tremendous leader here since day one. I want to thank her and her team for what they've already
accomplished for our business, and more importantly, for what they will continue to do to help patients and consumers
worldwide.
With that, I'm pleased to turn the meeting now over to Sandi and will rejoin you a bit later to take your questions.
Sandra E. Peterson
Good morning. I'm happy to have the opportunity to talk about our progress in our consumer-facing businesses –
Consumer, Diabetes Solutions and Vision Care. I'll also discuss the evolution in our approach to technology across the
enterprise. Increasingly as we lead through the disruptions and opportunities in global health care, we are fusing the
power of technology with the power of science to deliver improved outcomes for patients, consumers and customers.
First, our three consumer facing businesses. As Alex said earlier, the future of these businesses looks promising. While
they are at different stages of transformation, we believe that they are all well positioned in attractive, growing global
markets and we are driving scale and growth in each.
Let me start with Consumer. Our iconic Consumer brands are J&J's face to the world. They are how we are known by
millions around the globe. They are our first point of entry into emerging markets, so they really are very important to
the overall enterprise. They are and will increasingly be important contributors to J&J's financial performance.
Demographic trends and changes in the way consumers make healthcare decisions are creating new opportunities for
our Consumer business.
Our consumer expertise and insight are highly valuable to payers and providers, which differentiates us from our
competitors. We view a healthy consumer business as a growth annuity for J&J with less volatility than other markets.
As many of you know, we launched our new Consumer strategy in 2013. We focused on stabilizing and revitalizing the
business, remediating quality issues in U.S. OTC, and being clear about where and how to compete and went around
the world. We are executing successfully against that strategy. We're pleased to say that we have remediated and
re-launched our U.S. OTC business. Over 80% of our brands have returned to the market. Tylenol Arthritis will launch
soon.
We've made significant progress in meeting consent decree requirements. The FDA has certified our manufacturing
facilities in Las Piedras, Puerto Rico and Lancaster, Pennsylvania. We recently had a successful FDA inspection in Fort
Washington and are awaiting final notification.
Our OTC brands continue to be loved by consumers and we have regained the trust of our customers. Most of our OTC
products are endorsed as number one in their categories by healthcare professionals. Tylenol remains the number one
doctor recommended brand for pain relief and the brand most used by hospitals. Zyrtec, children's Tylenol and
children's Motrin are also number one recommended brands. Last year, our OTC portfolio grew four times the category
in the U.S. That strength has continued this year with 13% growth in the first half and 16% in the latest quarter.
More broadly across the Consumer business, we've made significant progress in creating a world-class brand building
and marketing organization. We've globalized the management of 12 mega brands and are focused on 11 consumer
need-states. We've expanded these brands into new markets and are seeing strong share gains in Oral Care, Beauty and
OTCs. We are growing 11% year-to-date and gaining share in feminine protection. For example, in places like India,
Germany, South Africa and Poland. And we've revitalized our iconic Band-Aid brand. In the U.S. Band-Aid
consumption grew 6.3% and we gained two share points. Thanks to decorated Band-Aids and commercial innovation.
As we invest in our global brands and our top regional brands, and in our priority markets, we're building new
marketing capabilities, such as digital. We doubled our digital media investments in digital channels with emphasis on

social and mobile. Today, 40% of our digital ad spending is via mobile, and more than 90% of our Facebook ads are
served up on either smartphones or tablets. This global centrally-led marketing approach is bringing our beloved brands
to their full potential.
You may have seen the results of the new model come to life in the Johnson's Baby So Much More campaign. The first
global campaign for our iconic baby equity. The campaign launched in seven lead markets in February, and is rolled
out to more than 20 markets. By the third quarter of this year, all major markets will launch. Early results show
sequential consumption growth and share improvement.
In the U.S. alone, through May, Johnson's has grown 2.4 share points since the launch. Our product pipeline in
Consumer is also quite robust. We are focused on developing science-based, clinically-validated products, grounded in
deep consumer insights and most importantly endorsed by professionals.
We have 20 key product launches this year. For example, Neutrogena Hydro Boost, Motrin Liquid-Gels, and the launch
of the new LISTERINE Whitening formula in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America.
Improving our supply chain has also been another critical focus in the Consumer business. With a strong emphasis on
the U.S. OTC consent decree. Across the enterprise, we have made remarkable progress in transforming our supply
chain to ensure we deliver quality, customer reliability, and benchmark profitability. We continue to see the benefits of
integrating our supply chain organization to drive performance improvements in every J&J's segment.
As we look ahead in Consumer, we will continue to rebuild our competitive edge. The underlying environmental
drivers, demographics, the developing middle-class and emerging markets, and lifestyle shifts suggest growing
consumer need for our products and increased opportunity to help more people live healthier, more vibrant lives.
Across the business, we are focused on delivering above-market growth and benchmark profitability. Consumer IBT
margin before special items and intangible amortization expense has increased from 14.1% in 2013 to 15.4% in 2014.
And we'll continue to improve profitability until we achieve benchmark levels.
Our organic sales adjusted for currency and excluding acquisitions and divestitures grew approximately 4% in the first
half.
Since mid-2013, we have grown organic sales steadily. Last year, we grew share for the first time in a number of years
and we're committed to continuing that trend. We manage our Consumer brand portfolio actively with an eye towards
targeted expansion in key geographies and need-states through focused acquisitions and licensing agreements. A recent
example includes the acquisition in India of ORSO. The intersection of changes in the healthcare landscape, disruptions
in the retail environment and changes in consumer expectations and behaviors creates an opportunity J&J's Consumer
business is well suited to capitalize on.
Now, let me turn to our Diabetes Solutions business. Diabetes is the fourth largest healthcare category in the world.
Globally, the therapies and devices market is growing at 5%. 50% of patients with diabetes are unfortunately
undiagnosed or not in control, which creates an opportunity for us to grow, and an important opportunity to impact
patients' lives. Given the power of our OneTouch brand, a highly innovative pipeline, strong commercial execution,
and operational efficiency, we are well positioned to deliver profitable growth in diabetes, despite negative industry
pricing dynamics.
In blood glucose monitoring, we hold the number one value in volume positions in our nine top markets. This year's
OneTouch Verio platform launch is our most successful launch in the last two decades. In the U.S. alone, volume share
grew three points.
We have strong penetration in emerging markets where type 2 diabetes is growing and we have simplified our portfolio
dramatically, reducing the number of strip platforms from five to two, and module meter offerings from 14 to three. We
have reduced our facility footprint, slashed the number of SKUs by more than 55% and taken significant costs out of
the business.

In insulin delivery, we are growing at market-leading rates, up operationally, 32% year-to-date worldwide driven by
ANIMAS VIBE. In 2015, we took over the number two share position. In addition, we are making excellent progress in
preparing for the launch of Calibra, a new product which will create an entirely new category. Calibra is a wearable,
disposable insulin delivery patch that meets type two patients' need for discretion, convenience and control. We are
beginning the clinical outcome study and anticipate entering the market next year.
Looking forward, we are developing insight-driven, market appropriate innovations across the BGM and insulin
delivery platforms in areas such as digital solutions, continuous glucose monitoring, and automated insulin delivery.
We will continue to leverage enterprise capabilities and expand targeted strategic partnerships. Great examples of this
include our collaboration with Nova Biomedical and Hospital Systems and Dexcom with continuous monitoring
glucose pumps. We are particularly enthusiastic about the potential to improve engagement and health outcomes with
digital solutions that motivate patients to better self-manage while creating value for healthcare providers and
healthcare system.
Now, let me turn to Vision Care. Eye health remains one of the largest, fastest-growing and most underserved segments
in the healthcare. Vision correction represents more than half of that market with contact lenses representing a $7
billion segment. The presbyopia and astigmatism markets are especially underserved. Johnson & Johnson's Vision Care
has a long history as the global market leader in contact lenses. Our success was built on category-leading innovation,
strong relationships with the eye care professional, and the most recognized brand equity in the category.
It's no secret, however, that we faced capacity and portfolio issues in Vision Care in 2012 and 2013. At the same time,
competition intensified and consumer preferences shifted. The market structure has evolved in response, driving
increased emphasis on e-commerce and increased price competition between channels. These developments have
reduced engagement for eye care professionals who are an important ingredient in strong category health. Despite this,
we continue to lead the category globally by 11 points. We continue to grow at double-digits in our lead emerging
markets. BRIC market operational sales are up double-digits, driven by continued strong performance of Russia, Brazil,
and China.
Last year, we instituted a one-time price reset to bring more value to consumers in close partnership with eye care
professionals and the trade in the U.S. and Japan. We will anniversary this event in Q3 as Alex said earlier, and should
see revenue momentum in the second half. Share is stabilized in the U.S. for five consecutive months. We are
outperforming the market in volume in our top two strategic brands: ACUVUE OASYS and 1-DAY ACUVUE MOIST
and our equity measures with eye care professionals have improved.
In Q2, alone, we grew 15% operationally in Japan, driven by strong performance of our leading 1-DAY ACUVUE
TruEye and the recent launch of 1-DAY ACUVUE DEFINE, as well as favorable comps.
Our R&D strategy leverages consumer expertise and science-based clinically-supported manufacturing-enabled
innovation, and we have built a robust multi-generational pipeline. We are launching our first major innovations in five
years with 1-DAY ACUVUE DEFINE, 1-DAY ACUVUE MULTIFOCAL and ACUVUE OASYS Overnight.
You will see us accelerate innovation in high-growth specialty segments, such as beauty, presbyopia and astigmatism.
We will sustain innovation in our largest core platforms, spherical reusable and sphere daily disposable. We anticipate
at least one major product launch in each of the next three years, including innovations with the potential to disrupt the
category.
Vision Care used the new marketing process developed in consumer to relaunch the iconic ACUVUE brand. New
global ACUVUE campaign, which went live last week is designed to drive consumer engagement and category growth
and ensures a differentiated position with eye care professionals. Our world-class supply chain is a competitive
advantage in Vision Care. Our manufacturing team produced approximately 4 billion lenses in 2014. We are continuing
to invest in capacity expansion, while operating with 99.6% customer service levels.
Though we are still in the throes of rejuvenating our eye care business, we have made considerable progress which will
continue this year and into the next. As we bring our core contact lens business back to market leading growth, we will

also pursue our aspirations in the broader eye health market.
Alex started this morning by talking about the power of Johnson & Johnson's broad base in health care. Our
consumer-facing businesses are a critical contributor to that broad base. While Consumer, Diabetes Solutions, and
Vision Care are at different stages in their transformations and represent unique opportunities, we are driving scale and
growth in all of them.
Before I turn it over to Dominic, I'd like to share some perspective on how Johnson & Johnson is capitalizing on the
way technology is reshaping the entire healthcare landscape. The consumerization of healthcare, wearables, and mobile
apps are giving patients unprecedented access to health information. Physicians, regulators, and payers are leveraging
Big Data, Analytics, and real world evidence to personalize care, understand product safety and efficacy, and drive
improved outcomes. Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and advanced sensors are creating new opportunities to
take advantage of the best clinical and wellness expertise.
We are at a tipping point where technology is becoming the medium through which healthcare can become a more
effective and efficient system. The opportunities this creates for Johnson & Johnson to become a healthcare technology
innovator are immense. We have identified key technology areas that will accelerate growth and are actively pursuing
programs and partnerships in those areas. The relationships with Google and with IBM and Apple that Alex mentioned
are great examples. There are others in the works and more to come.
We are working with and talking to nearly every major technology company, and many early-stage companies. We are
collaborating with retailers like Walgreens and CVS, where care is increasingly delivered. Health plans like Aetna and
Kaiser Permanente, and health systems, such as Jefferson Health and Premier to leverage technology, digital tools, and
our health and wellness expertise.
We find that Johnson & Johnson is most often the partner of choice for technology providers. We have the patient and
consumer insights, the clinical and behavior modification expertise, and the regulatory experience that can combine
with technology to transform the continuum of care.
This is particularly exciting when you think about the work that we are doing with payers and providers, as in our work
with IBM and Apple. We are creating an ecosystem embedded in hospital networks which gives us the ability to
integrate the right patient data with the right record and the right clinical outcome in the healthcare IT infrastructure.
I've been in healthcare long enough to have heard over and over again that technology was going to disrupt the industry
beyond recognition. But today, maturing technology, scientific advances and global healthcare reform are combining to
make disruption a reality.
Today, technology is intrinsic to the business. As the world's most broadly-based healthcare company, we are uniquely
positioned to be the company that connects the fragmented world of healthcare.
Now, let me summarize. Our consumer-facing businesses are executing well against focus strategies. They are
demonstrating results, improving profitability, and growing. They have strong presence in the world's fastest-growing
markets and are building insight-led innovation pipelines. Each business is strengthening its brand building capabilities,
actively managing its portfolio and leveraging technologies in ways that increase efficiency and create competitive
advantage.
Across J&J, we are using technology to unlock the power of the enterprise, to improve patient and financial outcomes
in ways that will create value for our customers, and ultimately for our shareholders. And we are building what I firmly
believe is the best team of leaders in the industry.
With that, I'll turn it over to Dominic and I look forward to answering your questions.

Thanks Sandi and good morning everyone. As you've heard on the call, we're certainly pleased with the progress we
continue to make in the execution against our priorities which is reflected in the solid, underlying financial results we
have achieved thus far in 2015. And as Alex and Sandi discussed, we are well-positioned for continued growth in this
dynamic healthcare environment.
I'll take the next few minutes to review our financial performance in the second quarter and will also then provide
guidance for you to consider in refining your models for the balance of the year.
Turning to the next slide, you can see our condensed consolidated statement of earnings for the second quarter of 2015.
As we expected and as many of you on the sell-side also reflected in your updated models, direct comparisons to our
second quarter of 2014 are challenging due to the exceptional uptake of OLYSIO that we recorded last year, as well as
currency headwinds and the impact of not having Ortho Clinical Diagnostics in our results for 2015. Our sales results
for the second quarter of 2015 were essentially in line with analyst estimates as reflected in the First Call. On an
operational basis, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, and excluding the impact of Hep C products,
sales were up 5% for the quarter.
Please now direct your attention to the box section of the schedule, we have provided earnings adjusted to exclude
special items and intangible amortization expense.
Adjusted net earnings of $4.8 billion in the quarter are down 6% compared to Q2 2014, and adjusted earnings per share
of $1.71 versus $1.78 a year-ago are down approximately 4%. However, the adjusted EPS results exceeded the mean of
the analyst estimates as published by First Call. And excluding the net impact of currency translation, our operational
earnings per share was $1.90, or up 6.7%. There were no significant non-GAAP adjustments in the 2015 second quarter
other than the exclusion of the expense for amortization of intangible assets.
Now, let's take a few moments to talk about the other items on the statement of earnings. As we have said before, we
would use any gain from divestitures in 2015 to offset the lower earnings impact of not having the OLYSIO sales
uptakes we had in 2014, and to provide some offset to currency headwinds, while also allowing continued investment
for future growth. This quarter's results reflect just that. Cost of goods sold was 90 basis points lower than the same
period last year, mainly due to favorable product mix, somewhat offset by currency impacts.
Selling, marketing and administrative expenses were 30.3% of sales or 220 basis points higher as compared to the
second quarter of 2014. We are investing in a responsible manner, and the absolute spending level is comparable to the
prior year, mainly due to the impact of currency, as we continue investment spending behind our key brands on a global
basis.
The prior-year percent to sales level was artificially lower since there was very little spending in relation to OLYSIO
sales. Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was 12% and 170 basis points higher than the
prior year, as we continue to make important investments in our pipeline for future growth.
Interest expense net of interest income was similar to last year. Other income and expense was a net gain of $900
million in the quarter, compared to a net charge of $200 million in the same period last year. Excluding special items
that are reflected in this line item, other income and expense was a net gain of approximately $1.1 billion, compared to
a net gain of $300 million in the prior-year period. This quarter, we recorded the gain on the previously announced
divestiture of the NUCYNTA product. Excluding special items and intangible amortization expense, the effective tax
rate for the six-month period was 22.3%, compared to 21.1% in the same period last year.
As I noted during our call in April, the effective tax rate this quarter is, again, higher than our guidance for the year, as
it does not yet reflect the benefit of the R&D tax credit, as that legislation has not yet been passed, although we expect
that it will be. The effective tax rate is higher in 2015 as compared to 2014, as a result of the mix of earnings being
higher in the United States this year.
Now, I'll provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2015. Before I discuss sales and
earnings, I will first give some guidance on items we know are difficult for you to forecast, beginning with cash and
interest income and expense.

At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $15 billion of net cash, which consist of approximately $34 billion of
cash and marketable securities and approximately $19 billion of debt. I am pleased to report that we completed our
share repurchase program to help offset the ongoing impact of the OCD divestiture. For purposes of your models and
assuming no major acquisitions or other major uses of cash, I suggest you consider modeling net interest expense of
between $450 million and $550 million. This is unchanged from our prior guidance.
Regarding other income and expense, as a reminder, this is the account where we record royalty income as well as
gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments by our development corporation, as well as
divestitures, asset sales and write-offs. We would be comfortable with your models for 2015 reflecting net other
income and expense, excluding special items, as a gain ranging from approximately $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion. This is
slightly higher than our previous guidance.
As a reminder, this includes the gain from the divestiture of the U.S. rights to NUCYNTA pain medicine, as well as the
anticipated gain on the pending divestiture of the Cordis business to Cardinal Health, which we expect will close
towards the end of 2015, subject to regulatory clearances and other customary closing conditions. We have also refined
our estimates for the items in this account now that we are halfway through the year.
As I also noted in April, the guidance for other income and expense will flow through to increased operational earnings
as we expect to use this other income to compensate for the decreased income from OLYSIO in 2015, as compared to
2014, as well as to help mitigate some of the impact of strong foreign currency headwinds this year, while we also
continue to invest in our core business and opportunities for future growth.
And now a word on taxes. Our guidance for 2015 anticipates that the R&D tax credit will be renewed by Congress,
although that has not yet occurred. We would therefore be comfortable with your models reflecting an effective tax rate
for 2015, excluding special items of approximately 21% to 22%, consistent with our previous guidance. If the R&D tax
credit is not approved, that would negatively impact the tax rate by approximately 0.5% for 2015.
Now, turning to guidance on sales and earnings. Consistent with our previous guidance for sales, our assumption for
PROCRIT is that there will not be biosimilar competition in 2015. We also do not anticipate generic competition this
year for RISPERDAL CONSTA or INVEGA SUSTENNA, but we are expecting a generic entrant for INVEGA in
2015. As expected, we have seen additional biosimilar competition for REMICADE in Europe, following the patent
expiration in many countries in February of this year.
As we've done for several years, our guidance will be based first on a constant currency basis, reflecting our results
from operations. This is the way we manage our business, and we believe this provides a good understanding of the
underlying performance of our business. We will also provide an estimate of our sales and adjusted EPS results for
2015, with the impact that current exchange rates could have on the translation of those results.
Consistent with our previous guidance, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting an operational sales
increase on a constant currency basis of between 1% and 2% for the year. This would result in sales for 2015 on a
constant currency basis of approximately $75 billion to $76 billion.
Additionally, by way of comparison to how we've described our sales results in 2014, our operational sales growth for
2015, excluding the impact of all acquisitions and divestitures, as well as the impact of hepatitis C products, would be
approximately 6%, a higher level of growth than the comparable 5% for 2014.
And just to note, we are monitoring the situation in Greece as the country considers its path forward economically. We
do not anticipate any significant negative impact to our sales results for 2015, nor to our earnings for 2015, unless there
is a significant change in the current expected resolution. As of last week, the euro was lower by approximately 17%,
as compared to 2014 average levels, and the dollar has strengthened recently versus virtually all major currencies. And
though we are not predicting the impact of currency movements, to give you an idea of the potential impact on sales, if
currency exchange rates were to remain where they were as of last week for the balance of the year, our sales growth
rate would decrease by nearly 7%, reflecting the weakening of the euro and other major currencies against the U.S.
dollar.

Thus under this scenario, we would expect reported sales to reflect a change in the range between negative 5% and
negative 6%, for a total expected level of reported sales of between approximately $70 billion to $71 billion. This is
consistent with our previous guidance.
And now turning to earnings. A significant factor impacting our earnings guidance for 2015 is the impact of currency
movements on transactions. And although they are hedged, it is still somewhat negatively incremental versus the prior
year. We expect transaction currency impacts to be negative to our gross profit by approximately 60 basis points in
2015 as compared to 2014.
We would be comfortable with adjusted EPS guidance in the range between $6.70 to $6.80 per share on a constant
currency basis, reflecting an operational or constant currency growth rate of 5% to 6%. This is higher than our previous
guidance, as we have increased the lower end of the range, reflecting some operational improvements in the business,
and our confidence at this point in the year.
Again, we're not predicting the impact of currency movements, but to give you an idea of the potential impact on
earnings per share, if currency exchange rates for all of 2015 were to remain where they were as of last week, then our
reported adjusted EPS would be negatively impacted by approximately $0.60 per share, which is consistent with our
previous guidance. Therefore, our reported adjusted EPS would range between $6.10 to $6.20 per share. At this stage in
the year, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting the mid-point of this range, which is higher than our
previous guidance.
So in summary, as you update your models for the guidance that I just provided, I would like to make a few key points.
Although operational sales growth is expected to range between 1% and 2%, we are pleased to note that, when
excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and hepatitis C products, our operational sales growth at the
midpoint of our guidance is a solid 6% for the full-year 2015 as compared to 5% for 2014. And with regard to earnings
on a constant currency basis, our guidance on operational EPS growth is strong and in the range of between 5% and
6%.
And finally, as we execute on our growth plans, we are continuing to make portfolio choices and investments in our
business, particularly in research and development, as we continue to build our pipelines across the enterprise, which
will position us for sustained future growth.
And now, I would like to turn things back to Louise for the Q&A portion of the meeting. Louise?
Louise Mehrotra
Thank you, Dominic. And Holly, can you please give the instructions for the Q&A session?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator instructions] Your first question comes from Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Good morning, Glenn.
<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: Good morning. A question for Alex. In your first couple of years, Alex, you've spent a lot of

enterprise now, do you think we are finished with the divestitures? Question one. And question two, do we now enter a
period where the company is more focused on acquisitions? Thank you.
<A - Alex Gorsky>: Hey, good morning Glenn, Alex here, and thank you very much for your question. You know
Glenn, three years ago, when we started looking at our strategies going forward, we tried to outline a very clear path
ahead that would really consist of multiple components. One is, obviously, continuing to invest in our organic

businesses, both in sales and marketing and research and development, and I think we demonstrated that, in spite of a
lot of different puts and takes, that we've continued to do that in a responsible way, as Dominic outlined earlier when he
was taking you through the P&L.
An area where we did have a lot of focus was on making sure that our businesses were competitive and, of course, we
tried to be very clear in our criteria there that, look, we want to be number one and number two in the marketplace. We
want to have a clear innovation or technology path to really helping patients or consumers. Or, very importantly, we
wanted a business to be complementary to something else that we're doing in another area the enterprise, and of course,
just fundamentally be a strong business. And if they didn't meet those criteria, then, of course, we would consider other
options, where they may be better served in someone else's hands. And as you noted, we've demonstrated that we're
willing to do that, as well.
We think that's an ongoing process in the business. We would expect there, in a business our size, in excess of $70
billion involved in the numerous platforms that, that's something that you'll see as part of our natural cadence and flow
going forward. But clearly, we're always also interested in growth opportunities. And when we see strong innovations
that really make a difference for patients, then also where we feel it offers a great complement to one of our existing
franchises, or frankly, a platform for significant growth into the future, you know we've got the balance sheet. We've
got the wherewithal to make those investments and that's always a priority for us, it will remain so into the future.
<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: And just as a follow-up to that, if you look at the pipeline of M&A potential. Number one,
would you call the pipeline meaningful? In other words, there's a lot of rich targets out there. And then, as you look at
these targets, what do you see in terms of the valuation of these targets? Are these targets getting stretched? And is that
maybe one of the reasons why you haven't done as much M&A here in the last few years? Thank you.
<A - Alex Gorsky>: No, Glenn, thank you. Look, we do feel that there are several significant opportunities, really
across each one of our segments that offer potential for growth and that are consistent with the strategic outline that I
mentioned earlier. At the same time, I think we demonstrated that we want to be thoughtful and disciplined about our
approach. And we intend to continue that path going forward.

Your next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Good morning, Kristen.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Hi, Kristen.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Hey. Good morning everybody. I was just wondering, Dominic, if you can maybe just
walk us through, just again with the disposition of Cordis? Just kind of what you are assuming in terms of timing of the
sale of the business and then the dilution, and how we should think about that? Should we think about that similar with
the OCD business in terms of the use of the proceeds, perhaps, with another round of repurchase to offset dilution
again? Or just kind of how we're thinking still about cardiovascular?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Sure, Kristen. Well, we expect that the Cordis divestiture will close in the latter part of the
year. We still have some regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. So we would expect that towards the
end of the year. That's been consistent with our previous discussion. Nothing has changed there. The dilution of not
having Cordis as part of the business is not that significant, quite frankly. Not as much as it was for OCD. As you
know, that business, after we exited the drug-eluting stent business is a relatively small portion of our business.
And then, with respect to use of proceeds, as we do typically when we do divestitures, we wait after the transactions are
complete, look at other opportunities we have for the use of cash, and then make our decisions then, as we prepare our
plans for the coming year. So as of now, I really can't comment on what we might do with any of the proceeds.

<A - Alex Gorsky>: Hey, Kristen. This is Alex. I just might also add that cardiovascular remains an area of strategic
importance for us. We have a very strong, Biosense Webster business. In fact, if you look at the quarterly performance
for the second quarter, it's once again double digit. I think this reflects almost three or four years now of consecutive
improvements in that performance on a very similar level, a great flow of new technologies that's really making a
difference for patients. We also think cardiovascular – look, it still remains a global healthcare issue with a lot of
innovation. So it's an area where we remain interested and we still feel we have very solid footing with our Biosense
Webster EP business.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Got it. And then, just, maybe, if you could give us a little more color just on REMICADE.
I know that's obviously been a key concern of investors. Just what you are seeing in the quarter and kind of
expectations ahead, just with respect to the business over in Europe, with biosimilars?
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Okay. So in the quarter, Kristen, we had, in the export sales, we actually had an inventory
change that negatively impacted the reported results there for the Pharmaceutical group by about 2%. What we're
seeing in Europe is as expected. So for the countries that went off-patent in February 2015, we're seeing about a market
share for the biosimilars in the mid-single digits. So as expected.

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Good morning, Mike.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Good morning. Hi, good morning. Let me turn to the Pharma side for a minute. I think
two products that people are focused on in the first half of year for impact of competition were STELARA and
INVOKANA. INVOKANA looks like its momentum has continued and continues to look fantastic. STELARA looks
like it's slowed this quarter. So could you just comment on both?
<A - Alex Gorsky>: Yeah, Mike, Alex. Look, we have still see STELARA growth at over 15%, strong growth in the
U.S. and particularly strong growth outside the United States at almost 27%. There was a slight sequential decrease in
share we are projecting. But overall, if we look at the competitive profile of the product, how we're doing, combined,
frankly, with our overall franchise presence that we see in this area, we remain really confident in it.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: And any comments on INVOKANA?
<A - Alex Gorsky>: INVOKANA is the same. I think – look, we've continued to highlight the profile. We've got great
reimbursement, well in excess of 50% to 60% in both commercial as well as the Medicare side of the business. We've
continued to see strong TRx trends, both in primary care, as well as endocrinology. So overall, we're seeing strong
uptake and we think it's a big opportunity, Mike.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Okay. Alex, while I've got you here, it's been three years since you guys closed the
Synthes acquisition and I'm sure, as you commented, you're not thrilled by the first half performance in trauma and in
spine. So can you just talk a little bit about how you are feeling about that deal and what it will take to get it back on
track? Thanks.
<A - Alex Gorsky>: Sure, Mike. Thanks for the question. Look, overall, we absolutely believe it was the right move to
bring Synthes in and create the largest and most diversified orthopedics company and when we reflect back, there have
been changes that have taken place in the market. One is just the market growth across all these segments.
If you remember, back in 2008, 2009, 2010, we saw high-single digit growth really for hips, knees, trauma, as well as
spine. That has changed significantly, we are now seeing that in the 3% to 4% range. I am pleased with the

performance overall that we've seen through the integration. Whenever you bring two large organizations together,
there is always a lot of moving pieces, but I think over the last three years, if you take a look at the overall disruption
and the way that we've been able to manage it, I think the team has done a very good job and now we're really focused
on what do we do to ensure that we're best-positioned for the future. And frankly, we're doing it at a time when a lot of
our competitors are just getting ready to go through a significant amount of integration and transition. And this is where
we're excited.
And I think it starts with innovation. We've had a nice cadence of innovation. In fact, we're in the midst – we just
launched the TFNA, the transfemoral nail in trauma that we're excited about. We think it'll be an important addition to
the bag – to the portfolio of that part of the business. In the U.S., we were encouraged by the performance that we saw
in knees and hips at 5% and 4% growth respectively for the quarter. And also, going forward, I think we're also quite
excited about the opportunity to work with customers in new, unique and different ways across that portfolio.
And I also think it's fair to say that in all those areas, we're going to continue to look for ways to drive that business
through innovation, but also through increasing our effectiveness and efficiencies across all areas as well. So I think
we're pleased. We are not satisfied. There's more work that we need to do. And that's where we're focused right now.

Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Good morning, Larry
<Q - Larry Biegelsen>: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Two clarifications. On the utilization
comments about the fourth consecutive quarter of improving utilization, is that through Q1 or Q2?
And then, second, on REMICADE outside the U.S., by our math, we had a total international and export sales growth
in Q2 down about 18% constant currency. Louise, you talked about that 2% impact from the inventory reduction. Was
that to that 18% or so? Was that just a REMICADE outside the U.S.? If you could help clarify those two points, that
would be great.
And then I just have one follow-up for Alex after that.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: So Larry, that 2% is on total Pharmaceutical sales, so it was a large reduction in the
inventories.
<Q - Larry Biegelsen>: Total worldwide Pharma?
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Yes. Yes.
<Q - Larry Biegelsen>: Okay. And then the – and then on the utilization, was that through Q1 or Q2?
<A - Alex Gorsky>: Yeah, Larry, Alex here. That was through Q2. And again, you know this data as well as we do,
and we're trying to triangulate from multiple different sources. But what we see is, for example, around 4% growth in
hospital admissions. If you take a look at hospital surgical procedures, we're thinking probably between 2.5% and 3%.
And if we look at overall outpatient procedure growth, probably around 3%. So it's still positive. In some cases, it's flat,
perhaps a slight decrease versus what we saw in Q1, but we think overall, the trends are relatively constant, what we've
seen thus far.
<Q - Larry Biegelsen>: That's helpful. And I appreciate your comments earlier on M&A and the M&A environment,
but do you have $15 billion in net cash, which is obviously not earning much, I know your first priority for cash is the
dividend and then M&A. But at what point do you consider using your cash to repurchase shares, Alex? Thanks for

taking the questions.
<A - Alex Gorsky>: Sure, Larry. I think, look, overall ultimately we want to create more value for shareholders, and as
we look at our capital allocation strategy, you just iterated we have a strong commitment to dividends. We've done that
for a long time. You know our statistics and our track record there. Regarding M&A, it's also another area obviously
that we keep our eye on. I mentioned earlier in the discussion that we are always looking for the right opportunity and
we try to do that in a balanced approach. Of course we want innovation, of course we want complementary things to
add to our portfolio and growth opportunities, but we also want to ensure that we maintain the discipline and the
perspective of our approach I think has served us well over a lot of years.
And even if you look at the internal versus external investment in the company, I think if you look over a 20, a 10, or
even a near-term period, about 45% of our growth comes from what I'd call organic investment in our research and
development versus slightly over half through M&A, and so that will continue to be our approach.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Also, Larry, I would say that if you look at it over long periods of time, I think we're very
proud of the fact that over a decade we've returned about 70% of our free cash flow to shareholders. So I think it's
important to keep that in mind, although we may be evaluating opportunities all the time, we're always mindful of the
fact of appropriate return to shareholders consistently over long periods of time.
<A - Alex Gorsky>: And I think even recently through some of the announcements that we've made about share
repurchases, we've demonstrated that that's part of our mix and will continue to be so going forward.
<Q - Larry Biegelsen>: Thanks for taking the questions.

Your next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Good morning, Jami.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Good morning. Good morning, everyone. Just a couple of follow-up questions on sort of the major
themes of the earnings call. Alex, and I appreciate your taking the time to be on the call. Just if you look at the MD&A
business, the MD&A business has underperformed its peers for at least the last four to five years and maybe longer, I'm
not sure. But I can't imagine you are pleased with that performance. And I'm just wondering what is your interest level
in moving up the technology curve out of what you're in, which are mostly commodity businesses. When I look across
where the major growth opportunities are in medtech, you guys aren't there; robotics, transcatheter heart valves,
etcetera. So I appreciate valuations are high and you want to be disciplined, but at the same time J&J's MD&D business
continues to underperform. So if you could comment on that, please.
And then secondly, to you Dominic, you are booking about $2 billion in non-operating income in 2015, largely related
to divestitures. How do you repeat that performance in 2016 without creating, again, a very difficult comparison?
Thanks very much.
<A - Alex Gorsky>: Hey Jami. Thank you for the question. Look, first of all, as I said regarding our Medical Device
businesses, we think this is an important business and remains a very solid growth opportunity going forward, and look,
as you look across that entire business, we have a number of very exciting areas, frankly, that are doing quite well. We
highlighted some of them earlier, but whether it's Biosense Webster, whether it's what we're seeing in areas like
Biosurgicals, Energy, our Endocutter business. We're starting to see the turnaround in areas such as Vision Care, and
we don't think those are commodity businesses. We think those are driven by innovation, technology, and they've been
a steady stream.
Now, are there other areas where we're interested? Well, you know that we've made an investment in the robotics
space. We've announced an exciting opportunity with Google. It's still early days. We recognize that. But we think that

there is a lot of opportunity there given our expertise in general surgery overall and combining it with some of the
expertise that those new technology partners can add. And we're also interested in other areas beyond that, and we've
demonstrated the ability in the past that when we see them we will participate and acquire them.
And I think we've also demonstrated over the past few years that in areas where we don't see that path forward, that
we'll be active on the divestiture front as well. So we think that there is room for improvement. We know that we've got
businesses like Diabetes Care, for example, that had a significant impact from pricing a few years ago. Vision Care,
that's still in the midst of a turnaround, but we think that we've got the strategies, the innovation in place to turn those
around, and these can be very solid and strong performers going forward.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: And Jami, with respect to the other income and expense of $2 billion, roughly that you
quoted. I think we were very clear earlier in the year that we were going to use those divestiture gains to offset some
pretty significant headwinds and in particular, the major headwind of currency this year.
Going forward, I don't believe we'll have the same level of divestiture income, but we'll still have some. As Alex had
mentioned earlier, we're continuously reviewing our portfolio and making decisions of where we want to participate,
and where we think the assets would be better off in someone else's hands and where we could get value for our
shareholders by selling the assets.
So I think for 2016, we would still see some level of divestiture income, but, again in 2016 versus 2015, we won't have
– we don't believe we'll have the significant headwinds of currency that we just experienced in 2015, nor will we have
the tough comparisons of not having OLYSIO. So I think you'll continue to see it as part of our strategy to re-evaluate
our portfolio and deploy those gains against higher growth opportunities.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: And I just want to clarify something on the inventory for the Pharmaceuticals. The 2%
negative impact includes also some inventory reductions of OLYSIO. So if you just looked at the REMICADE export,
the total U.S. impact would be about 1%, about half of that, okay?
Thank you. Next question, please.

Your next question will come from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen & Company.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Good morning Josh.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Hi Josh.
<Q - Joshua T. Jennings>: Good morning. Thanks so much for taking the question. So I had the first one for Dominic.
As we look into 2016 and beyond and the analyzation of OLYSIO and other headwinds experienced in 2015, how
should we be thinking about leveraging the P&L driving at a higher level of EPS growth relative to revenue growth.
Should we anticipate a consistent constant currency EPS growth in the 100 basis points, 200 basis points range, or
could that spread improve as you experience operating improvements in consumer and device franchises and continued
strength in the Pharma unit?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Yes, thanks Josh. Well, as we've said many times, we always plan our business to grow our
top-line at a rate faster than the competitive set and then to grow the bottom-line at a rate of growth that's slightly faster
than the top-line growth. That depends each year on what investments we want to make to continue the growth
trajectory of the business. So I can't give you a formula to think about, but I think you have seen us be very consistent
in our ability to continue to grow earnings at a rate that's appropriately at a level faster than sales, again, depending on
what the market is doing and then depending on what particular investments we have.

We do see increased profitability in the Consumer business because you mentioned it in your comments and Sandi had
referred to it earlier now that we're through many of the issues in the consent decree. We saw the increase in the
profitability last year, and we expect that business will continue to contribute more profitability in the future.
<Q - Joshua T. Jennings>: Thanks. And just a follow-up on a Pharma products specific question. There was some
recent ANDA filers for ZYTIGA. Can you just talk about any inherent risk of a generic coming to the U.S. market prior
to 2016 and just an update on your patent positioning for that asset. Thanks a lot.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Okay, so just to repeat what I said in the prepared remarks, the composition of matter patent
expires in December 2016 and the method of treatment patent expires in August of 2027. We would not speculate on
any ANDA approval timing or outcome of any litigation; however, if we decide to file a lawsuit, the 30-month stay
would begin April 2016 at the earliest, and the length of which would be a core subject in the outcome of any litigation.

Your next question will come from the line of Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Good morning, Vamil.
<Q - Vamil K. Divan>: Hi, good morning everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question. So just two here, if I
could. One, you talked a little bit about INVOKANA earlier, I know Mike asked about this as well. But just – about
halfway through the quarter we did have the FDA comments around ketoacidosis. And just curious, I mean, obviously
performance seems fine this quarter, but any – on a qualitative basis, if you're sensing any sort of questions or changes
in prescribing habits as a result of what the FDA has stated at this point?
And then second, appreciate your comments on Greece. I was just curious also regarding Puerto Rico, just some of the
kind of macro issues that are going on there. I know you guys have some manufacturing down there. Do you sense any
sort of risk or concerns there depending how that sort of plays out over the next few weeks or months here?
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: So I'll take first the question on the DKA, it's early on. But our Phase 3 trials actually
included about 10,000 patients and we saw very few cases of it.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Right and with respect to Puerto Rico, you're right, we have a significant manufacturing
presence there and a significant employment on the island, of course, as a result, but I don't see that as a major factor in
our ability to continue progressing with our plan. So it's not on our radar screen as a major issue to contend with.

introduced a couple of years ago?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: This is Dominic, Jayson, it's the program that we introduced a couple of years ago. We're a
couple years into it now. And so we're already seeing some of those cost benefits. And Alex is describing the same

<Q - Jayson T. Bedford>: And how far along are you? Are you at 50%, 60%?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: We kicked it off in 2013. We did a lot of planning, of course in 2014. So we're just starting
to ramp it up this year into the next couple of years.
<Q - Jayson T. Bedford>: Okay. And then, maybe a question for Sandi on the Consumer side. You've added
investment over the last few years to support the relaunch of the OTC products, but margins seem to improve nicely
over the last few quarters. Does the added investment wind down to generate better margins or does the growth pick up
to improve margins?
<A - Sandra E. Peterson>: So thanks for the question. The way in which we're looking at this is the – as we're sun
setting the consent decree, it enables us to improve the productivity of our manufacturing footprint. So a large part of
where you will see continued improvement in the profitability of the business is by improving our COGS and our gross
margins for the business. So that's one aspect of it.
The other aspect of it is we are – we have undertaken over the last couple of years an approach to globalize our brands
and to globalize how we manage them, which drives increased efficiency in every single marketing dollar. So our
perspective on this is we need to continue to invest behind these brands, both the U.S. OTC portfolio, as well as the
global portfolio. So you'll not see us reduce our investments behind our brand building of all of our core brands. But
what you will see is improved leverage in our manufacturing footprint and actually how we're spending those dollars to
drive improved profitability across the sector.
<A - Alex Gorsky>: And Jayson, this is Alex. If I could just add, I really want to commend Sandi and Jorge and their
teams for the job they're doing on these re-launches. I think when we were having these calls several years ago there
was probably a fair amount of skepticism on our ability to relaunch against private label, making sure that we can work
our way to the consent decree requirements. And if you look at the progress that's been made over the past few years,
obviously, it starts with great products. I think now we have over 80% of our brands return to the shelf. A lot of new
recent launches, particularly along the Tylenol line.
If you combine that with the way that we've achieved all the consent decree requirements, I think we worked closely
with the agency. We've done that. In fact, I think we'll be the, if not the – one of the only large over-the-counter
companies to ever be able to do that successfully. And the really good news is that when you look at – as we relaunch
these brands, the share uptake is strong. I think we're back up to now about 60% of the share that we achieved in areas
like pain. So we're building our way back up, and when you combine that with some of the new innovations that we
have, we definitely see a nice growth opportunity in that part of the business.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: So with respect to everyone's time, we'll take two more questions. Next question, please.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Good morning, David.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Good morning. Thanks, Louise, for squeezing me in. Maybe just a question for Alex and Sandi
and a quick follow-up for Dominic. But the Consumer business is clearly recovering. That's the big message I think of
this call and I think the commentary, I think you've made publicly these last few months seems to be that for M&A
Consumer it's going to center more on brands and not companies. So you seem more willing in Consumer, at least from
our estimation, to rule out large M&A. Am I reading that right and why is that the case?
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: So the way in which we're thinking about acquisitions in Consumer is a combination of
things. We're going to clearly stay focused on our priority consumer need-states and geographies. So the way we look
at it is a combination, are there brands that are appropriate to tuck into our infrastructure to drive growth in certain
markets or in certain areas as the consumer need-state. But we also will look at technologies that we can license in, like

we've done in other parts of J&J.
And lastly, we do look at companies to acquire, whether they're midsized companies or whether they're larger
companies. And we are highly disciplined about looking at those and understanding the benefit of doing those kinds of
larger acquisitions versus midsize or smaller acquisitions. So we haven't ruled out any particular part of the
marketplace. We're looking at a variety of different opportunities given that the business is now stabilized and growing
again, we believe we're sort in a position where we can look at these things a little bit more on an ongoing basis.
<A - Alex Gorsky>: Yeah, and David, I would just add on to that, that the Consumer area remains one of a strong
strategic importance for Johnson & Johnson. When you think about the role of consumers and healthcare utilization
going forward, when you think about the way that you're able to drive innovation. And frankly, when you think about
the reach that it gives you, particularly in the emerging markets and the fast-growing markets. And by the way, for
Johnson & Johnson, it not only operates that way to drive growth in consumer, but it acts also as a way to increase our
uptake in our other businesses, particularly in those growth markets. We think there is a lot of opportunities. And I
think mission one over the past few years has been getting it on the right track. As you mentioned yourself, we think we
made a lot of progress there. We're feeling much, much better. And now we're obviously looking for ways how do we
expand that? How do we take it to the next level?
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Okay, very helpful. Thank you for that color. And then, Dominic, just a quick question on just
thinking about that international growth. This quarter was a little slower. I just wonder if you can just give us an update
on what you're seeing macro in emerging markets, maybe specifically China, just given the events of the last month.
Have you seen an any acute slowdown or is it relatively stable? Thank you.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: So we have seen in China some slowdown. I wouldn't call it acute. There is some
dynamics, of course, of a generic competition in China and an overall slower growth in economic growth. So we are
seeing that, but I think we're well positioned. We've been in China for many, many years. We have a good footprint
there. We obviously manufacture there as well and our brands continue to get good uptick there.
And of course, we're not in the generic part of the pharmaceutical business in China because we're focused more on
innovation in that market. So I wouldn't call it acute, but I would say we've seen some slowdown in the overall market
growth in China.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Okay. Thank you.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Thank you very much.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Our last question, please.
Operator
And your next question will come from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Yeah, hi, Rick.
<Q - Rick A. Wise>: Thanks so much for taking the question. Good morning, everybody. Alex, maybe just a question
for you and then one for Sandi. You talked again, you highlighted your focus on the OR of the future, and talking about
the Google JV and robotics. Can you maybe give us a little more concrete color? I mean, is there a grand plan? Does it
require acquisitions? Are we going to see some tangible products or launches that are going to impact sales and
earnings over the next six months, 12 months? How do you want us to think about it?
<A - Alex Gorsky>: Yeah, Rick, we want you to think about this as a real strategic investment in the future for robotic
surgery. And as we see the surgical suite continue to develop, in today's environment, I would say there is a pretty clear
line of demarcation between what you would say is standard surgery and robotic surgery. And we think as technology
develops in the future, whether it's real-time data collection, whether it's visualization, whether it's incorporating some
of the new technologies in areas such as energy and hemostats, combining these and very new and unique approaches

we think offers a real significant opportunity to improve patient outcomes and ultimately to grow a business.
We also think there is some inherent limitations to today's robotic surgery environment. When you frankly look at the
size and the scale of some of the existing innovation and if you look at what's happened with other technology
platforms, as they have become smaller, more flexible, more mobile, and frankly, have a better ability to integrate
various activities around the OR, that's where we think we can really make a difference. We realize, of course, that we
bring certain capabilities to the table, but we're also thinking working with partners like Google and others, it expands
our capability significantly.
And so look, we see this as really not something to have an impact, where I would say over the next six months to 12
months. This is likely more over a two- to three-year-plus timeframe, but we – this is something that we are quite
committed to, that our partners are committed to, and that we see is a real opportunity to fundamentally change the way
we think about surgery and robotics in the future.
<Q - Rick A. Wise>: I really appreciate that. And just last quickly, Sandi, it seems clear that VIBE is off to a strong
start. I think you launched it in the U.S. late last year. Maybe just talk, if you could give us a little color on the roll out?
Where are? Are you fully rolled out? Are you converting your own patients to VIBE or are you gaining new accounts?
And maybe what's next beyond VIBE. Thanks so much.
<A - Sandra E. Peterson>: So thanks. So if you – in insulin delivery in total, what we have done is, as you know, we
had launched the product in Europe and also in Canada over the last couple of years. And both in Europe and in
Canada, it also has a pediatric indication, which clearly gives it some unique differentiation in the marketplace. We
effectively launched it in the United States really at the beginning of this year. So we've seen significant positive
growth in uptake of the product in the U.S., which is a combination of existing patients upgrading to the new product,
as well as gaining – basically new to therapy insulin pumpers. As well as there we've seen a lot of conversion from
other pump platforms to our platforms.
We in the second quarter also filed for the pediatric indication for the U.S. product and so obviously the FDA will go
through its review process. But we're hopeful that before end of this year, we should have a pediatric indication which
will be a further uptick in the business in the U.S. and be very helpful to us in the U.S.
As I also mentioned earlier, there is two other things in insulin delivery that we're very focused on, actually three. But
two of them are working in partnership with Dexcom on a next-generation pump that really brings the best of what
we've learned of how to make this more user-friendly and effective with a patient, as well as ensuring that we've got the
right algorithm in the pump for insulin delivery.
Combining that with the next generation of sensor, our current pump has that with Dexcom, and then we're also and
have done a lot of work, not just in the insulin side, but also in the BGM side, of really creating a much better
ecosystem for the patient to have information and data that helps them manage their condition much more effectively.
And so we're using information technology in a smarter way going forward and we're seeing very positive impact of
that, not just in the insulin delivery side, but in our core BGM business. So that's another place that we'll see a number
of different things that we're going to be doing in this business.
And then last but not least, I mentioned that the Calibra patch pump is another great growth platform we believe for us,
because it's really a unique to the marketplace way to help type 2 diabetics who are insulin dependent, have a new way
of getting their insulin delivered to them in a much more discrete way. So there are a lot of things in the works, there's a
lot of things in our pipeline in insulin delivery.
<Q - Rick A. Wise>: Appreciate it. Thanks.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Thank you. We'll have some closing remarks by Alex.
