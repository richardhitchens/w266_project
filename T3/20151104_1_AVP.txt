Sheri McCoy
Thanks, Adam. Good morning and thank you for joining Avon's third quarter earnings call. I would like to discuss
three things today. First, I will provide my perspective on our overall performance in the quarter, including our
performance in Brazil and the U.S. Secondly, I will outline some recent organizational changes. And third, I will
update you on our thinking regarding Avon's Investor Day. I'll then turn it over to Jim, who will cover our third [ph]
quarter, including free (2:25) cash flow. And then, we'll open the line for Q&A.
Turning to the third quarter, let me start by saying that this was clearly a difficult quarter. Avon continues to face
unprecedented headwinds. Nevertheless, I believe that there are tangible signs of progress regarding the underlying
health of our core business.
As you are aware, given our geographic footprint, we continue to experience both record currency headwinds and
economic uncertainty in several of our top markets. And these impacts are magnified compared to some of our
competitors by not having the offset of a strong U.S. business.
Additionally, this quarter included a number of large items impacting the year-on-year comparison, making it difficult
to get a clear read on our underlying business trends. Starting with the top line, revenue was down 2% in constant
dollars. However, excluding the impact of the Liz Earle divestiture, the VAT tax benefit in 2014, and the Brazilian IPI
tax, which would have been up 3%, our adjusted operating margin was 3.2%, down 610 basis points. This was driven
by a number of non-comparable large items that in aggregate negatively impacted the year-over-year operating margin
comparison by 460 basis points. This is in addition to 410 basis points of headwinds from foreign currency. Jim will
take you through this in more detail.
We are disproportionately exposed to both foreign currency headwinds and the weaker-than-usual macroeconomic
backdrop for emerging [ph] markets' profitable growth at the local level. (4:00) And we continue to work to mitigate
the FX impact. Importantly, it's a balancing act.
Turning now to our regional performance, EMEA delivered solid constant dollar revenue growth, in line with our
expectations. I'm pleased that, once again, Russia performed well, delivering strong revenue growth. On the other hand,
the U.K. underperformed, due to a softer average order and also we have not yet gained consistent traction on field
improvements.
Latin America, the team delivered solid underlying constant dollar revenue growth under some very challenging
circumstances. Mexico continues to be steady. And Brazil, while facing significant macro challenges, delivered good
underlying constant dollar revenue growth, driven by increases in both Active Representatives and average order.
North America continues to make progress, although slower than we would like. The trend in Active Representatives is
still down versus prior year, but showed a slight improvement quarter-on-quarter. In Asia Pacific, the Philippines, our
largest market in the region, continued to perform well, but this was not enough to offset declines in other markets,
specifically China.
Next, turning to our category performance, Beauty declined1% in constant dollars, which was negatively impacted by
approximately four points, due to the IPI tax in Brazil and the divestiture of Liz Earle. Fashion & Home grew by 3% in
constant dollars in the quarter.
In Color, our constant dollar performance was flat versus prior year, but we showed sequential improvement versus the
second quarter. EMEA delivered strong growth year-over-year. Latin America's performance in Color was flat, but
when excluding the impact of the IPI tax in Brazil, we see double-digit growth in this [ph] region, which is a sign of
(5:45) both representative and consumer engagement within the category.
In Fragrance, we saw 4% growth on a constant dollar basis, driven by Latin America and EMEA. Avon fragrances
performed well across the Latin American region, as did Coty fragrances in Brazil. In EMEA, Avon Cherish and Avon
Attraction performed well. And we are pleased that our growth is coming from the upper mass masstige category,
consistent with our overall strategy to improve this subsegment by enhancing both packaging and use.

And in Skincare, global sales were down 6% in constant dollars. This was driven by the Liz Earle divestiture, the IPI
tax in Brazil, and underperformance in APAC and North America. In Brazil, facial skincare is a highly discretionary
category and with the contraction of consumer spending, the category remains challenging. Across our other markets,
we have a good lineup of launches and restages in quarter four.
We continue to face extraordinary currency pressure, impacting our third quarter reported revenue by 20 percentage
points and adjusted earnings per share by $0.16. We estimate currency has negatively impacted our pre-tax income by
$365 million year-to-date in 2015, with a total negative impact of more than $700 million over the past seven quarters.
And while we've continued with aggressive cost-cutting, it has not been sufficient to fully slowly offset currency
pressure of this magnitude and velocity.
In light of the challenges we face, I often get questions from you on what I see in the business that's encouraging. Top
of my list are our local market teams, which are performing well under very challenging circumstances. They are
navigating through the impacts of inflation, devaluation, geopolitical issues, consumer spending slowdown, and other
economic pressures, all while keeping our representatives and consumers engaged.
For perspective, across our top 12 markets, I can say that the majority of them are performing well. On the other hand,
a couple markets, like the U.S., continue to be challenged. But we know what the issues are, have the appropriate plans
in place, and are working to improve performance.
I thought it would be helpful to give you additional perspective on one of the underlying elements of the business that
gives me confidence that we're headed in the right direction. As we've frequently discussed, the long-term success of
Avon starts with the health of our representative base. Active Representatives continued to improve in the third quarter
in most of our top markets. On a global basis, Active Representatives declined 1% for the quarter. It was driven by
North America, Venezuela, and Argentina. Year-to-date performance has improved significantly versus the comparable
time period last year. Additionally, our top 12 markets, we saw modest growth in Active Representatives.
Active Representatives is a key indicator of our past performance. In addition to Active Representatives, internally, we
also closely watch our ending representative count. Ending representative count reflects the total number of
representatives who have the ability to place an order at a moment in time. It's a useful indicator of our potential
revenue growth. Our trends on ending representative count have been steadily improving over the past 18 months. And
this provides us with the confidence that, overall, we are increasing our base by continuing to attract and retain
representatives.
I will spend a few minutes now talking about Brazil, given its importance, and I'm sure it's top-of-mind for you. I'll start
by saying our team in Brazil continues to effectively navigate and drive business in a very challenging environment.
And I'm proud of the work they are doing. The strategy in Brazil remains unchanged, as we work to maintain a stable
business which positions as well when the macroeconomic environment improves.
As a reminder, there are three issues negatively impacting our performance in Brazil; first, local currency devaluation.
The real continues to decline versus the U.S. dollar. Year-over-year, we've seen an approximate 40% devaluation. And
for additional context, the real declined 23% in the third quarter alone. Second, there's a higher tax burden, led by the
IPI tax which went into effect May 1, and this negatively impacts our Color and Skincare growth. And third, the overall
economic deterioration is resulting in tightening of consumer spend. In this quarter, we also faced a tough comparison
to year-ago that included the VAT tax benefit that did not repeat this year.
With that said, we are pleased with the work of the local team to engage representatives. The Brazilian team grew
Active Representatives this quarter, resulting in underlying constant dollar revenue growth of 6%, excluding IPI and
the VAT tax credit. The team had an outstanding Christmas conference with record recruitment levels. They have a
strong on-boarding program and have tailored the representative experience to address the various representative
segments.
The number one priority of the Brazilian team is to keep the field stable and engaged. The team is taking price, while
balancing the need to offset inflation and the IPI tax, with an increasingly price-sensitive consumer in a highly
competitive market. And finally, they continue to take actions to reduce costs, while ensuring appropriate levels of

investment in key representative and consumer-facing initiatives.
Now, turning to the U.S., in the U.S., our primary focus has been on improving representative engagement and
rightsizing our cost structure. We are making progress and moving in the right direction, although it is slower than we
would like to see.
We continue to invest to improve the earnings opportunity and the representative experience. While our Active
Representative growth is still negative, we see pockets of positive improvement. Our representative retention is steadily
improving quarter-on-quarter. New representatives are now delivering a higher average order, and they are earning
more. And our top leadership groups are growing their businesses. These are all good indications that we are slowly
making inroads on improving representative engagement. But, put simply, we still need to bring in and retain more new
representatives.
In the U.S., we attract approximately 500,000 women a year who express interest in Avon. Our goal is to convert these
at a rate closer to both the U.S. historical rates and benchmarks we see in our other market.
Generally, the North American operating trends have been in line with our budget. Our expectation for North America
has been for modest profitability in 2015. We continue to expect the fourth quarter to be profitable. However, during
2015, our Canadian business has been hurt by the significant drop in the value of the Canadian dollar, approximately
15% relative to the U.S. dollar. This creates an additional headwind of $5 million to $10 million, moving what would
have been modest profitability for the full year to what we now expect to be plus-or-minus break-even. Overall, the
North American business is making progress. However, I remain concerned with the pace of our progress and continue
to evaluate strategies to accelerate the U.S. recovery.
To sum things up, we are certainly in choppy waters. At the local market level, I feel we are seeing good progress in the
majority of our top markets, but not at the level to offset the FX and the North American challenge.
Looking forward, we don't expect the currency trends to reverse in the foreseeable future. So, what are we doing about
it? We are taking actions to address the near-term pressure on the business and create longer-term profitable growth.
These actions fall into three areas. First, we continue to drive our core Avon business in our local markets to ensure we
are engaging representatives, aggressively managing pricing and driving profitable growth at the local level.
Second, we will drive additional resources to our top markets, selectively investing in the brand and improving the
Avon representative experience. And this will allow us to improve the delivery of profitable local growth.
And third, we will reshape our business, including the organization and cost structures, to both improve short-term
fundamentals and drive long-term sustainable profitability.
As a first step, we've announced internally this morning some changes to the management structure that I wanted to
note for you. These changes are essential to supporting our plans to drive profitable local market growth, create an
experience that will engage the next generation of women and drive significant additional efficiency.
First, in order to better manage our geographic portfolio, we will be combining EMEA and Latin America under the
leadership of John Higson, who is presently the Head of the EMEA region and Global Field Operations. This will
accelerate the progress of many of our largest and most profitable growing markets. Having a single point of executive
oversight for the majority of our top markets will provide increased efficiency and effectiveness, while also
accelerating our service and sales model evolution.
To avoid disruption, North America will continue to operate as it is today. Likewise, Asia Pacific will continue to
operate as it is today, driving profitable growth in the Philippines and resolving our business challenges in China.
Next, in order to expedite the evolution of the Avon brand experience, Fernando Acosta, who is currently Head of
Northern Latin America and Global Marketing, will be fully dedicated to the brand marketing and innovation aspects of
our business. He will also be leading our work to accelerate the adoption of social selling, something you'll be hearing
more about at a later date. Fernando will no longer be responsible for his Latin American role.

Finally, in order to create better operating efficiencies and effectiveness, Jim Scully's role will expand to Chief
Operating Officer. This provides a single point of executive oversight for enterprise strategy, infrastructure, and
support. Global supply chain will move into this organization to allow aligned planning, resource allocation, and
execution across IT, supply chain, and finance. It will also accelerate our cost optimization work. And Jim will also
continue in his role as CFO. These changes will take effect January 1.
Lastly, regarding Avon's [ph] investors (16:15), as you saw in our announcement this morning, we will be holding our
Investor Day on January 21 at our R&D facility in Suffern, New York. While we had planned to host an Investor Day
in the fall, given the challenging and dynamic situation we've been in, I felt it was best to keep our teams fully engaged
and focused on delivering fourth quarter, as it's an important quarter for us. When we see you in January, we look
forward to sharing our growth and investment strategies, our cost and capital structure, and our future outlook.
I will now hand it over to Jim for a detailed review of our third quarter results. Jim.
James S. Scully
Thank you, Sheri. And thanks again to all of you for joining the call today. In terms of my remarks for today, I will
begin with a review of the third quarter. I will then give you my top-line observations about the quarter, as well as some
brief commentary about each region.
With that, constant dollar revenue was down 2%, but reported revenue declined 22%, due to the negative impact of
foreign exchange. Before commenting on the key drivers of revenue performance, I would like to draw your attention
to the schedule we added to the press release to provide a better understanding of the underlying performance of the
business. This schedule [ph] carves up (17:30) the impact of certain Brazil tax items and the divestiture of Liz Earle.
As you know, we started to incur a new IPI tax on cosmetics in Brazil as of May 1 of this year. This tax has negatively
impacted the third quarter constant dollar revenue growth by an estimated two points. In addition, last year's third
quarter included the recognition of VAT credits associated with previous periods that did not recur this third quarter,
which also negatively impacted the year-over-year comparison of constant dollar revenue by approximately two points.
Lastly, the year-over-year constant dollar revenue comparison was negatively impacted by approximately one point due
to the divestiture of the Liz Earle business. The combination of these items negatively impacts our constant dollar
growth rate by approximately five points. Excluding the impacts of these items, revenue would have grown in constant
dollars by approximately 3%.
Active Representatives were down 1%, driven by the continued negative impact of North America and the Latin
American markets experiencing high inflation, specifically in Argentina. Partially offsetting those declines was strong
growth in Russia and solid growth in Brazil.
Average order declined by 1%, as this metric was negatively impacted by approximately four points, due to the Brazil
VAT recognized in the prior year and the IPI tax in the current year. In addition, the divestiture of Liz Earle negatively
impacted average order by approximately one point. These negative impacts were partially offset by pricing actions in
all regions. Price/mix grew 4%, while units declined 6%.
Adjusted gross margin declined 80 basis points to 61.2%. The Brazil VAT credits in 2014 and IPI tax in 2015
negatively impacted the year-over-year comparison of adjusted gross margin by approximately 100 basis points.
Excluding these impacts, adjusted gross margin would have increased 20 basis points. The favorable net impact of
pricing and mix, as well as lower supply chain costs, more than offset impact of foreign currency translation and
transaction costs.
Adjusted operating margin declined 610 basis points to 3.2%. The Brazil VAT credits in 2014 and IPI tax in 2015
negatively impacted the year-over-year comparison of adjusted operating margin by approximately 300 basis points.
Excluding the impact of these items, adjusted operating margin would have decreased approximately 310 basis points.
The decrease in adjusted operating margin was primarily driven by foreign currency translation and [ph] transaction

cost, (20:58) which negatively impacted our results by approximately 410 basis points.
In addition, adjusted operating margin was negatively impacted by 160 basis points due to employee incentive
compensation plans, primarily due to the prior-year period which included a benefit for the reversal of accruals. These
negative impacts were partially offset by continued benefits from cost-saving initiatives and the favorable net impact of
pricing and mix.
Moving to tax, the effective tax rate was negatively impacted by additional valuation allowances for deferred tax assets
of approximately $665 million, which caused income taxes expense to be significantly in excess of pre-tax income. The
valuation allowances were primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and its associated impact on foreign
earnings and our tax planning strategies.
The adjusted effective tax rate is abnormal and is driven by the fact that we had $47 million of tax expense associated
with the current quarters' adjusted loss before taxes. This reflects our inability to recognize certain tax benefits. The
year-over-year difference in the adjusted effective tax rate caused an estimated $0.11 per share negative impact on
adjusted earnings per share.
While I certainly appreciate the volatility of our effective tax rate, I did want to add some additional color. There are
really four key factors which drive the majority of the volatility in our tax rate: first, the country mix of our earnings;
second, the inability to recognize tax benefits in some countries where we have current period losses, as a result of
being in a position where we are recording valuation allowances on these countries' deferred tax assets; third, we are
recording the cost of withholding taxes on cash repatriations required to service corporate need; and finally, the
absolute level of pre-tax earnings.
Importantly, cash taxes have declined on a year-over-year basis. Adjusted EPS was a loss of $0.11 per diluted share
compared with $0.23 of adjusted earnings per share a year ago. Currency had a significant negative impact on the
year-over-year comparison of EPS of approximately $0.16 per share.
And, as I just mentioned, the year-over-year change in our effective tax rate caused an estimated $0.11 per share
negative impact. In addition, adjusted EPS was negatively impacted by the lower adjusted operating profit caused by
the Brazil VAT credits in 2014, the IPI tax in 2015, and the impacts from incentive accrual adjustments in 2014
mentioned previously.
I will now provide more details on our results by region, starting with Latin America. Third quarter revenue increased
1% in constant dollars. The Brazil VAT credits in 2014 and IPI tax in 2015 impacted constant dollar revenue growth by
approximately eight points. Excluding the impact of these items, constant dollar revenue grew approximately 9%.
Active Representatives were down 2%, negatively impacted by continued declines in our Latin American markets
experiencing high inflation. In addition, price increases in Brazil in their higher inflation markets were the primary
driver of a 3% [ph] increase in average order, (25:03) a 7% increase in price/mix, and a 6% decrease in units.
Latin America adjusted operating margin was 5%, down 850 basis points from a year ago. Brazil VAT and IPI
negatively impacted adjusted operating margin by approximately 570 basis points. Excluding the impact of these items,
adjusted operating margin would have decreased approximately 280 basis points and was primarily due to a negative
impact from foreign currency of approximately 410 basis points, of which translation drove an estimated 210 basis
point impact in transaction costs, for a headwind of approximately 200 basis points. In addition, field expenses were
higher, driven by incentives that drove top-line performance, primarily in Brazil. These negative impacts were partially
offset by [ph] a favorable (26:04) impact from pricing and mix.
Turning to Brazil, constant dollar revenue declined 10%. The VAT credits in 2014 and IPI tax in 2015 negatively
impacted constant dollar revenue growth by approximately 16 points. Excluding the impact of these items, constant
dollar revenue grew approximately 6%, driven by solid growth in Active Representatives.
As we move to the fourth quarter, we expect to face similar headwinds witnessed during Q3. Specifically, IPI will
continue to be a challenge, and VAT credits recognized in fourth quarter 2014 will dampen the headline results. In
addition, we will be negatively impacted by some recently-enacted additional VAT taxes.

While we begin the quarter with a stronger representative base, keeping our representatives engaged will be important
to our success, given continued expectation of tight consumer spending and our planned pricing actions. While we
expect the underlying business to remain healthy, it is hard to predict if it will grow at the similar levels delivered in
Q3.
In Mexico, revenue was relatively unchanged in constant dollars. Average order increased modestly and was offset by a
decrease in Active Representatives.
Moving to EMEA, third quarter revenue increased 3% in constant dollars. The divestiture of Liz Earle negatively
impacted constant dollar revenue growth by approximately three points. Excluding the impact of this item, constant
dollar revenue grew approximately 6%.
Growth in Active Representatives continued to drive the top-line results, as the underlying fundamentals remain strong.
In addition, the increase in constant dollar revenue was driven by increased price/mix, while units were relatively
unchanged. As we communicated previously, we are taking a deliberate approach to pricing, aimed at keeping
representatives and consumers engaged.
EMEA adjusted operating margin was 9.3%, up 40 basis points. The results benefited from revenue leverage, cost
savings and increased pricing. These benefits were partially offset by the negative impact of currency transaction costs
of approximately 300 basis points.
In Russia, constant dollar revenue rose 22%, driven by growth in Active Representatives and average order, as
revenues are realizing benefits from pricing. While a significant portion of the growth in the third quarter was driven by
price/mix, units continue to grow at a healthy rate. The market remains volatile and can be difficult to predict, but we
are pleased that our approach is keeping representatives engaged.
As a reminder, we expected Russia's constant dollar growth rates to be high single digits in the second half, mainly due
to the year-over-year comparisons becoming more difficult. Our third quarter performance was significantly higher
than that expectation, and we expect the fourth quarter to be relatively consistent with the third quarter's growth.
Constant dollar revenue in the U.K. declined 9%. The results were driven by a decline in Active Representatives.
Average order also decreased, as the third quarter's incentive programs did not perform as well as last year's programs.
As Sheri mentioned in her remarks, the team in the U.K. is addressing issues related to the health of the field.
Turning to North America, revenue declined 15% in constant dollars, driven by a 13% decline in Active
Representatives. North America adjusted operating margin was negative 3.3%, reflecting a 120 basis point
improvement over the prior year. The adjusted operating margin results benefited from cost-saving initiatives, as well
as the benefit of price/mix. These benefits were partially offset by the negative impact of revenue deleverage and a
modest increase in advertising, primarily related to recruiting.
While we continue to expect fourth quarter to be profitable and expect our adjusted operating profit to be in the range
of break-even, it may not be enough to move us into profitable territory for the full year. That said, we are seeing an
improved trend in Active Representatives, which, as we've discussed before, is the key to changing the trajectory of the
business.
In Asia Pacific, revenue declined 8% on a constant dollar basis. Average order declined 6%, and Active
Representatives declined 2%. The Philippines continued to grow, increasing 4% in constant dollars driven by an
increase in Active Representatives. However, it was not enough to offset declines in other markets, led by China, which
declined 42% in constant dollars. It is clear that we do not have the right go-forward plan for China at this point. The
Asia Pacific team has been focused on rightsizing the region, which is reflected in the adjusted operating margin
improving 140 basis points to 6.6%.
Please see our press release and 10-Q for a further discussion of the six adjustments we made to our GAAP results in
the quarter, which were: cost implement restructuring; Venezuela special items; gain associated [ph] with settlement
charges; (32:10) loss on the extinguishment of debt related to the prepayment of the 2016 notes; and an adjustment to

the devaluation allowance for the company's U.S. and non-U.S. deferred tax assets.
Moving on to cash flow, operating activities during the first nine months used $223 million, more than the prior year,
primarily due to lower cash-related earnings, which were negatively impacted by foreign currency translation as well as
the $67 million payment to the SEC in connection with the FCPA settlement. These items were partially offset by
lower net payments associated with operating taxes and lower pension contributions.
In the third quarter, working capital improved seven days operationally compared with a year ago. Accounts payable
improved 16 days operationally, as we continue to benefit from our focus on renegotiating payment terms with our
vendors. However, inventory was eight days worse operationally, primarily related to Venezuela. The impact in
favorable transaction FX on the cost of inventory in EMEA, as well as additional inventory in North America to
improve service levels, also had a negative impact.
Moving to our full year outlook, the current outlook now includes our year-to-date actual results, an updated estimate
for additional negative impacts from foreign currency translation and transaction costs due to the continued
strengthening of the U.S. dollar during the third quarter, and an expected negative impact from recently-enacted
additional VAT taxes in Brazil.
Our full year outlook, as compared to the prior year results, includes: relatively unchanged constant dollar revenue, this
includes approximate 0.5 point drag from the divestiture of Liz Earle; an approximately 19 point negative impact on
revenues due to foreign currency translation, this is an additional negative impact of two points compared to our prior
outlook; a 100 basis point decline in constant dollar adjusted operating margin, this is an additional 50 basis point
decline from our prior outlook and is based on our current year-to-date results and the expectation of additional
negative impacts from foreign currency transaction costs as well as additional taxes in Brazil; and a 300 basis point
decline in adjusted operating margin in reported dollars, this is an additional 100 basis point decline from our prior
outlook and is based on our current year-to-date results and the expectation of additional negative impacts from foreign
currency translation and transaction costs as well as recently-enacted additional VAT taxes in Brazil.
Lastly, free cash flow is expected to be negatively impacted by lower cash-related earnings from the negative impacts
to reported operating margin that I've just discussed. Free cash flow is expected to be positive in 2015, but lower than
our previous outlook of approximately $100 million. While we have lowered our outlook for free cash flow for the
year, it is important to note that we expect it to be positive for the year. In addition, the proactive steps we took to
restructure our working capital facility and to address the 2016 maturities provides us with the capital structure
flexibility to execute our strategies.
As Sheri mentioned, the teams remain focused on delivering local market profitability, cost containment, and cash
conversion.
With that, we will turn it back to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of the call.

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Lauren Lieberman. Please state your affiliation, then pose your
question.
<Q - Lauren Rae Lieberman>: Thanks. Good morning. It's Barclays. You mentioned a few things on the
reorganization that you've announced this quarter. When I saw you in August, there was some discussion around also
reorganizing reporting lines or business units to help alleviate some of the FX burdens or tax burdens. Is there any
update on that in terms of sort of corporate structure that could help on those fronts? Thanks.
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Thanks, Lauren. As we looked at the organization, one of the things that was important is making
sure that we look at how we can continue to get effectiveness, alignment across the organization, as well as get cost out.

And so, the announcements we made are really a first step as we look at that. We are evaluating a cluster-led or a more
market-led model and eliminating the regional activities, as well as looking where our cost base is. So, we have a lot of
work underway. This is just the first step of some of the things that we are considering. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - William G. Schmitz>: Good morning. It's Deutsche Bank. Hey, guys, have you thought about some of the stuff
that was in the press about the capital raise, and maybe accelerating some of the reinvestment, especially in the system
side, and then, how you kind of view the dividend at this stage?
<A - James S. Scully>: So, it's Jim. So, what I'll do is I think address the question around the capital structure. And I
think the first thing we need to do is really take a step back. And when we look at the capital structure, we ended the
quarter with $587 million in cash on the balance sheet. And I would view approximately $200 million of this to be cash
for a liquidity cushion. I think it's important to note that net debt at the end of Q3 is actually down this year versus last
year, given that we took out the 2016. In addition, I think earlier this year, everyone knows that we did take those 2016s
[ph] out. (39:01) We also renegotiated the working capital facility, which we have full access to.
So, as I look at it, based upon the preliminary plans for 2016, I'm comfortable that we have the capital structure,
flexibility and liquidity to execute the plans in the context of the current backdrop. I think we've said in the past that
we're going to look at a way to pay as we go through cost-cutting and other things that Sheri mentioned. So, I think I'll
leave it at that.
In terms of the dividend, I think, given the FX headwinds impact on cash and on cash flow as we evaluate 2016, I think
it would be prudent to look at the dividend with a little bit more critical lens.
<Q - William G. Schmitz>: Okay, great. And just to follow up on that, I mean, why wouldn't you just like kind of rip
the BAND-AID off and start fresh? I know you can kind of execute the plan, kind of pay as you go, but don't you kind
of just want to move on at this stage? I mean, if you raise the money, you could do like a big cash restructuring. You
could invest in the systems. I just think it would accelerate everything. I mean, the company is costed for a business
that was 40% larger than – and obviously a lot of it was out of your control with the currency stuff. But I mean, has that
been considered at all?
<A - James S. Scully>: I think it's safe to say that we've considered everything. I don't want to oversimplify it by
saying rip the BAND-AID off. I think it's complicated. I think our footprint is complicated. I think the way our cost
structure is allocated is complicated. And I think that, given the headwinds and where we are, I think it's more prudent
to look at it in short-term phase what we're doing in terms of driving local profitability through increased pricing, and
then longer-term, in terms of what's the appropriate structure to manage it. And, as Sheri said, the first step is aligning
management for that. So, I appreciate your comment, but I think that it makes more sense to look at in a more phased
approach.

And your next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: Hi, with Citibank. My question actually has to do with the U.K., which I know is a
relatively small piece of the business, but the U.K. has been held out by you guys in the past as sort of being a market, a
developed market, where the model works, where execution has always been very strong and it's been held out as an
example of what the U.S. could look like if everything went well. So, number one, to have the U.K. now declining 9%
in local currency shows me that what was working there is no longer working. So, do you have a sense for kind of what
changed?

And then, number two, as you think about the U.S. and learnings from that, Sheri, you used the words evaluating
strategies. But I feel like we've heard for like three years that you've been evaluating strategy, so I wonder how you're
doing that. Have you hired a consultant? Because it seems like sort of the internal process of evaluating exactly what to
do and how to reinvest and how to fix the rep problem is just persistently elusive to you. Thanks.
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Thanks, Wendy. As it relates to the U.K., first of all, we still feel good about what we're doing in
the U.K. and direct selling is healthy in the U.K. As we look at what's happened this quarter specifically, it's two issues.
One is, as it relates to average order, we had a very strong year-on-year comparison versus third quarter last year. They
had a huge incentive program and product mix that supported that. So our average order is down.
We also have been improving our Advanced Leadership model. And so as we're learning from that, we need to tweak a
couple things relative to incentivizing the leadership and pulling new leaders in. And so, the team is on top of it and
very focused on that.
As it relates to North America, again, we have looked at different strategies. We've looked at it both from our internal
lens, both looking at things that have gone on around Avon. We've also brought in external people. We've had a
number of different groups look at it. Certainly, what we know is that direct selling in the United States is alive and
well. We have had trust in the field. We've had some issues that we are still focused on fixing. I think the opportunity
for us is to continue to transform the model, so that we have more of a social selling model and investing in IT and
systems to improve the representative experience. And we're doing that. It's taking longer than any of us would like, but
the team is focused on that.
As I said this quarter, we're really pleased because we're seeing some of the trends moving in the right direction, albeit
slower. It's harder for us to get the representatives moving in the right direction. And what we're seeing at the top of the
house, the top leaderships' groups are growing their business. We're seeing the new representatives coming in and
making more money. We still have that middle group there that we're focused on. We're seeing slight improvements in
retention and we are looking at it by district and we can see where we're making progress.
So, I wish I could say that it was moving as quickly as we would like, but I feel better that we're seeing those trends.
Average order are things that we can fix more easily in the U.S. and around the world. But fixing the field health is the
fundamental challenge. And it's not that we have not looked under every rock and have talked to lots of people. But,
again, it's taking longer, but I'm pleased that we're at least seeing positive signs in pockets of the business. So, thank
you for your question.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: Well, and my follow up is, do you think the margin is EMEA is sustainable? I mean, if
you exclude Russia, it looks like organic growth has slowed throughout EMEA. And I'm wondering if maybe you're
actually over-earning in that region.
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Well, we also had the Liz Earle [ph] divestiture. (45:06)
<A - James S. Scully>: Stripping the Liz Earle piece out, but I think that we're comfortable with the sustainability of
the margin longer-term. There's going to be some short-term issues around currency and on transaction as they process
through some of the increases in August. But I think longer-term, we're comfortable.
Operator
And your next question will come from the line of Chris Ferrara. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Christopher Ferrara>: It's Wells Fargo. Guys, I guess I wanted to ask about margins. I want to understand, I
guess, what's unusual in the absolute margin, meaning operating margin, versus what's unusual on the year-on-year
change, right? So, like, obviously, there are a ton of puts and takes on the year-on-year change, but most seem to relate
either to prior-year issues or to things that are probably sustaining issues like FX, unless you think FX is going to
bounce materially. So, I guess the question is, is the absolute rate of adjusted EBIT margin of 3.2%, is there anything
unusual about that number in the absolute, separate from the year-on-year change?

<A - James S. Scully>: I would say the discrete piece is IPI, which is obviously now part of the business, but in terms
of our ability to catch up in terms of price for that in the business. I'd say excluding FX, and then I'd say a little noise in
the quarter around employee incentive comp, are probably the two things that I would call out.
<Q - Christopher Ferrara>: The employee incentive comp, though, that's an issue in the year-ago period, though,
right, not in the current period?
<A - James S. Scully>: It's a combination of – the majority of it was the prior year and there's a little piece this year.
<Q - Christopher Ferrara>: Oh.
Operator
And your next question comes from the line Ali Dibadj. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Hey, guys, I'm from Bernstein. It's tough to know where to start, but let me try a top-line question
and then a margin question. First, from a top-line perspective, you guys talk about IPI tax and VAT credits, and you say
that's about 4% of an impact. But as you roll through those, should we really expect a net 4% rebound in your top line,
or are you doing things to mitigate that, so, net-net, you wouldn't get 4%? And then, continuing on the top line, if you
look at your Latin America number, Brazil was up 6%, excluding all sorts of stuff. Mexico was flat, but LatAm was up
about 9%, which means that, call it, 20% of your business in LatAm was growing about 20% or more, which sounds a
little unsustainable. So, how much of that was Argentina really driving most of the Latin America growth? So, that's
top line. I'll come back on margins in the follow up.
<A - Sheri McCoy>: In Latin America, obviously, we are seeing inflationary pricing in Venezuela and Argentina, but
Latin America would still be growing even if we subtract that out. Brazil is growing. A number of our other markets
like Colombia, et cetera, are growing. As it relates to the first part of your question relative to top-line growth, I mean,
the one area that I would point to is IPI tax, which is one that we are pricing to offset that. So, that's where we will
continue to see growth because we are managing that through price. The others, as you said, the VAT tax a year ago as
well as the divestiture of Liz Earle, would be one-timers.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: I'm debating giving you another shot at answering those questions, because I'm not sure you
answered them, but let me go to margins kind of mitigating my losses here. On margins, the $650 million valuation
allowance for the remaining U.S. deferred taxes, should we interpret that that your strategy now in the U.S. is that
you're not going to make money for a very long time? And then, going back to the question just before, I mean, why
should we – well, we not. Why should shareholders feel comfortable that you're paying yourselves more, net-net,
including the kind of negative 60 basis points reversal accrual from last year plus 160 basis points this year, so net, up
100 basis points on incentive compensation. Why should we feel comfortable that you're getting paid more for the
results you guys have been putting up? Thanks.
<A - James S. Scully>: Yeah. So, I'll take those, the first one. So, the deferred tax asset relates to our global earnings
and it relates more towards the FX pressure on our foreign earnings as we bring them back here, than it does to the
actual impact of the North American business. So, it's more of a global view. And I think it reflects the pressure of FX
running through our international markets. So, that is what led to the valuation allowance in the quarter.
As it relates to the incentive comp, I think I understood your question. The majority of the incentive comp
year-over-year comparison issue was the reversal of benefits last year in 2014. There was an adjustment, a net
adjustment, in the third quarter, which was truing up the year-to-date and we had a take-back in Q1 and we had a
charge in Q3. So, on a year-to-date basis, it's not necessarily paying management more. It's getting the accounting rate
on a year-to-date basis. But the impact was more on a year-over-year basis related to the benefits – related to the
reduction last year.

And your next question comes from Olivia Tong. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Olivia Tong>: [ph] Bank of (51:04) America Merrill Lynch. With respect to the contrasting growth between
Brazil and Russia, why do you have such a tale of basically two countries, because even if we strip out the impacts of
VAT and IPI, you're still seeing one grow at plus 6% versus the other at plus 22%? And I have to imagine there are
some differences in execution that are playing a factor in the divergence of performance, because the macros aren't
exactly thriving in Russia, either.
And I understand that you want to get a greater focus on branded innovation and for Fernando to dedicate all his time to
that, which makes sense, but how is having 80% of your business under John not going to derail some of the progress
that you've made in EMEA, but consolidating the U.S. and Asia would? And was expanding internal responsibilities
rather than going outside, was going outside for incremental talent not up for discussion? Thanks.
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Great. First of all, as it relates to Russia and Brazil, Brazil is a much more competitive beauty
environment than Russia is. And if you look at the development of where we are in Brazil, it's a very different market
compared to Russia. So, I would say the competitive environment is probably one of the key components of that, as
well as the coverage in the fields. We have a very broad coverage in Brazil, as do some of our competitors, making it
harder to get white space, where Russia has that opportunity. So, that's the key differences relative to that question.
As it relates to your second question around the organization, John has a terrific team underneath him. He has
developed great leaders. And we do bring people in from the outside. We like to bring them in ideally at the
commercial marketing or sales level or GM level. It is harder to bring someone in at the top level, so I have complete
confidence in John that he will continue to drive the business and be able to work closely with the Latin American
team.
We have David Legher, who runs Brazil and has expanded his responsibilities, has a lot of capabilities, and will partner
closely with John as they look at how we get those markets aligned and really making sure the processes are consistent
across the world.
On a separate note, North America, we continue to focus on that separately, given its challenges. And I stay close to
that business. And I think there's a lot more opportunity to get to growth in Asia Pacific. So, that's the reason for
keeping them separate. Thank you.
<Q - Olivia Tong>: And then, if I could just follow up on Q4 local currency sales implications, just with respect to the
full-year expectation for local currency sales being about flattish, that implies maybe just a one to two point
acceleration in Q4 versus Q3, even though the comp does get four points tougher. And you still have the same three
issues around Brazilian VAT, Brazilian IPI and Liz Earle. And if my numbers are right, that implies that the two-year
stack gets quite a bit better. So, can you talk through some of the things that are going to drive that? Thanks, again.
<A - James S. Scully>: I mean, I think the primary drivers behind that are some of the things that we talked about in
Q3, which are primarily Russia and Brazil and, I think, consistency across the markets. As Sheri said, we are feeling
comfortable from an Active Rep perspective and what's the health of the field. So, I think it's a combination of
continuing Russia and Brazil and then consistency across the markets.

And your next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Mark S. Astrachan>: Yeah. Thanks. Morning. It's Stifel. I wanted to ask if you could comment a bit on thoughts
about the test by your large Brazilian competitor to go into retail for some of the products and what you think that
means, or at least what it could mean for the future direct selling in the market and do you have to embrace more of
going into that channel, and obviously then, what would the implications be from a spend standpoint and how to
support that?

<A - Sheri McCoy>: Yeah. Well, certainly we know that our competitors are experimenting with that. With that said,
we also know that some of our competitors who are in retail have come into direct selling. And the growth is still
occurring in direct selling, is what we're seeing. So, particularly, in the categories we compete in skincare, color, we
will stay close to it. I think that it's a question around where the investment goes, whether it goes into representative
and consumer spending or it goes into retail spending.
As we've looked at it for some of our markets and we have experimented, it hasn't been as successful as one might
think. So, it's something we stay close to and we'll continue to watch, but not something that we would focus on today,
particularly given the issues and challenges in these markets. I think supporting our representatives, making sure they
have what they need to be successful is critically important, given the consumer spending concerns, et cetera. Thank
you.
<Q - Mark S. Astrachan>: Okay, great. And then just following up, on strategic alternatives, wondering if you could
comment sort of broadly on that or just sort of specifically on the progression that seems to have played out, at least in
the media through the year, that earlier in the year, there were strategic alternatives, including potentially selling North
America, then there was the whole business, and then there was a potential PIPE. Are you done from a strategic
alternatives exploration standpoint or any sort of commentary on that topic would be helpful?
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Well, I think it's fair to say that sometimes the media gets it wrong, sometimes they get it right.
So, I'm not going to comment on speculation. What I will say is that Jim and I and the management team are in
constant conversations with the board looking at what's the right thing to do to continue to make sure we are creating
shareholder value, and supporting our representatives. And we're going to continue to make sure we have those
dialogues and do the right thing. We owe it to our shareholders and we owe it to our representatives and associates.
Thanks.

And your next question comes from the line of Stephanie Wissink. Please state your affiliation, then pose your
question.
<Q - Stephanie Schiller Wissink>: Thank you, from Piper Jaffray. We have one clarification and then one question.
And I think, Sheri, it was you that mentioned several times the word engagement. If you can help define what that
means or the metrics that you're looking at, and how that might differ from the metrics you look at for your Active
Reps.
And then I think, Jim, you also mentioned that part of the pricing increases that you took were related to engagement
and earnings potential. Can you just give us an update on the changes to the incentive model and then what you're [ph]
kicking in (57:36) as you look out into 2016 for the sustainability behind those pricing changes to ultimately support
that engagement and that incentive model? Thank you.
<A - Sheri McCoy>: So, as it relates to Active Representatives and representatives' engagement, Active
Representatives is a number that actually talks about how many people are placing an order during a given period. And
what we look at is when we say representative engagement, we're looking at how long are they staying with us, how
easy is it to bring people in. We actually do a global representative satisfaction survey in our top 12 markets, so we can
look at how they feel about service, how they feel about on-boarding, how they feel about our communications, et
cetera, how they feel about compensation. So, we monitor that.
And so representative engagement is a broader element. It manifests itself in people placing orders, but we look at it
from that standpoint. So, as I look at it, as an example, the U.S. compared to one of our other, a stronger-performing
market, I can see the difference on the global survey about where we need to focus. So as an example, our service and
transaction focus in the U.S. needs to continue to be fixed relative to some of the other markets like a Poland, for
example. So, that's how we look at representative engagement.
I'm going to turn it to Jim for...

<A - James S. Scully>: So, on pricing, I said two things. In terms of pricing, the first was to address the current
pressures, making sure that we're pricing effectively in the local markets to drive local market profitability. In my
prepared remarks, what I said was that in Russia we take a deliberate approach to pricing in order to keep the
representatives engaged. And what that means is to take a competitive view on pricing in order to make sure that the
rep stays engaged with Avon and has compelling prices. So it was two different things, one about Russia and then one
in general about the local markets.

And our final question today comes from Javier Escalante. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Javier Escalante>: Good morning, Consumer Edge. My question has to do with a metric that you referred to, this
ending rep count. And you mentioned that you had seen progress. So if you can tell us in what markets you have seen
the sales force increasing. Particularly in the U.S., you drop a lot of numbers, but essentially, the rep activity, which is
the only information that you disclose, have been declining for 22 quarters in a row. At the same time, you mention that
you are able to attract 500,000 reps. So, I would imagine that there is a one of very top reasons why it is you are unable
to retain those reps that you get from those surveys, what are those reasons? If you can tell us what are the main reasons
why reps drop and how it can be fixed. And I do have a follow-up.
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Sure. Javier, as I look at our ending representative chart, and I'm looking at the top 12 markets,
three-quarters of our top 12 markets are in good shape relative to ending reps where we're seeing improvement. So, and
this is something that we're going to continue to look at because basically, it says that these people have signed up,
have not necessarily placed an order or a consistent order, but we need to have the bodies in the business before we can
even get the activity. And so, it's important for us from looking forward to make sure that we're improving that piece.
As it relates specifically to the U.S. market, what we get is about 500,000 people coming in through our different lead
generations, who say that they would like to – or they're interested in Avon. And then we look at how many of those
are converted. And we can see this around the globe, and we have benchmarks. Brazil, for example, is the strongest on
conversions. So, we can see what that number is. We're weaker on conversion in the U.S. And part of it has to do with
our systems of how we were allocating people to the representative, the follow-up piece and some of the systems issues
that we're dealing with. So, we've been investing there.
I think the point I was trying to make is, as we look at it from a brand perspective, people are still interested in Avon.
And we're not having a problem getting people interested. What we need to do is get the on-boarding right and make
sure she's earning more. And as I mentioned on the call, the new reps are starting to earn more, so we're seeing that.
We've put more incentives there. There's not enough of them. The top of the house is doing better. It's that middle
group there.
The positive is we're seeing less churn in that, which is what I was referring to on retention, but it's still not enough to
move the needle when we're looking at hundreds of thousands of people. So, that was what I think is something that
we're going to continue to look at and we'll spend more time as we're discussing some things around how we can do a
better job giving you indications of how we perform something that we will consider as we move forward. Thank you.
<Q - Javier Escalante>: And, Sheri, finally, more a suggestion, if this ending rep count is something that is very
important to you to measure progress and your ability to stabilize the business or your progress to stabilizing the
business, why you don't disclose these numbers to investors so we can track? Because this Active Representatives, it
really doesn't help us and to the extent that you, yourself, don't use it. So why don't you just disclose this on a quarterly
basis? Thank you.

<A - Sheri McCoy>: Yes. I think that's a good suggestion. And it's something that Jim and I have talked about and as
we've done a lot of work preparing for our Investor Day, this is an area where we are looking at giving you more
granularity and visibility to this, and then looking at how we think about our KPIs moving forward.
Operator
