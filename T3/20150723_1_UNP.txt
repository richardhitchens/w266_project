Good morning, everybody, and welcome to Union Pacific's second quarter earnings conference call. With me here
today in Omaha are Eric Butler, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Cameron Scott, our Executive Vice
President of Operations; and Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer.
This morning, Union Pacific is reporting net income of $1.2 billion or $1.38 per share for the second quarter of 2015.
This is a 3% decrease in earnings per share compared to the second quarter of 2014. Solid core pricing gains were not
enough to overcome a significant decrease in demand.
Total volumes in the second quarter were down 6%, led by a sharp decline in coal. Industrial Products and Agricultural
Products also posted significant volume decreases.
As you recall, first quarter volumes were down 2% and we began realigning our resources early in the year, storing
locomotives and furloughing employees. These efforts continued throughout the second quarter. We've made
meaningful progress right-sizing our resources to current volumes. And I'm encouraged to report that we've made these
improvements while posting strong safety performance.
But our work is not finished. We will continue to become more agile with our network and our resources. We remain
focused on providing safe and efficient service for our customers and strong financial performance for our
shareholders.
With that, I'll turn it over to Eric.
Eric L. Butler
Thanks, Lance, and good morning. In the second quarter our volume was down 6%, with gains in Automotive and
Intermodal, more than offset by declines in Coal, Industrial Products, and Ag Products.
We generated solid core pricing gains of 4%, but it was not enough to offset the drop in fuel surcharge and the mix
headwinds, as average revenue per car declined 5% in the quarter. You'll see the impact of lower fuel surcharge
revenue as we discuss each business group. Overall the decline in volume and the lower average revenue per car drove
a 10% decrease in freight revenue.
Now let's take a close look at each of the six business groups. Ag Products revenue was down 7% on a 7% volume
decrease and flat average revenue per car. Grain volume was down 19% in the quarter. Our domestic feed grain
shipments declined 6%, as we returned to more normal seasonal shipping patterns compared to the strong demand last
year. Export feed grain was impacted by the strong U.S. dollar and abundant global grain supply, driving our export
shipments down 36%. In Wheat our expert shipments also declined, but were partially offset by moderately better
domestic shipments.
Grain products volume was down 3% for the quarter. Ethanol volume declined 6%, driven by extended plant
maintenance down time, following a record year of production. Partially offsetting the ethanol decline was increased
demand for soybean meal exports to China and an increase in biodiesel shipments. Food and refrigerated shipments
were down 2%, driven primarily by fewer potato shipments and also due to lower frozen meat exports.
Automotive revenue was up 3% in the second quarter on a 7% increase in volume, partially offset by a 3% reduction in
average revenue per car. Finished vehicle shipments were up 8% this quarter, driven by continued strength in consumer
demand. The seasonally adjusted annual rate for North American automotive sales was 17.1 million vehicles in the
second quarter, up 3.6% from the same quarter in 2014. This is the first quarter with a SAAR rate above 17 million
vehicles since the third quarter of 2005. In Auto Parts volume grew 5% this quarter, driven primarily by increased
vehicle production.
Chemicals revenue was down 1% for the quarter on a 1% reduction in average revenue per car and flat volume. Plastics
shipments were up 11% in the second quarter. Stable resin pricing led to strong buyer confidence in the market. And
we also saw strength in export volume. Petroleum and liquid petroleum gas volume was up 10% in the second quarter,
driven primarily by strength in several LPG markets. Our volume gains were offset by a 29% decline in crude oil

shipments, which continue to be impacted by lower crude oil prices and unfavorable price spreads.
Coal revenue declined 31% in the second quarter on a 26% reduction in volume and a 7% decrease in average revenue
per car. Southern Powder River Basin tonnage was down 28% for the quarter, as demand for coal continued to be
impacted by mild weather and low natural gas prices. In addition to soft demand the volumes were also impacted by
heavy rains in June that flooded coal mines in the Powder River Basin and damaged our main line. Colorado/Utah
tonnage was down 31% for the quarter, driven by both the soft domestic demand and reduced export shipments. I'll talk
more about our outlook for coal in just a minute.
Industrial Products revenue was down 14% on a 13% decline in volume and a 1% decrease in average revenue per car.
Construction products revenue was down 5% for the quarter. We experienced higher-than-normal rainfall in the
southern part of our franchise during the quarter, which led to construction delays that impacted both cement and rock
volume. We still think the construction market is fundamentally strong, particularly in Texas, and that our construction
products business will rebound.
Minerals volume was down 24% in the second quarter. The reduction in drilling activity led to a 28% decline in
shipments of frac sand. Finally, metals volume was down 27%, as lower crude oil prices reduced drilling-related
shipments by nearly 50%. Also the strong U.S. dollar continued to drive increased imports, which reduces demands
from domestic steel producers.
Intermodal revenue was down 5% as a 2% volume increase was more than offset by a 7% decrease in average revenue
per unit. Domestic shipments grew 3% in the second quarter, as we continued to see strong demand from highway
conversions and for premium services. International Intermodal was up 1%, as our recovery from the West Coast port
labor dispute was muted by the strong comparisons from 2014. You will recall that the second quarter 2014 results
included pre-shipments ahead of the West Coast port labor contract expiration.
Additionally we experienced a slowdown later in the quarter due to relatively high retail inventory levels and softer
than expected retail sales. I'll update you on our expectations for peak season in just a minute.
To wrap up let's take a look at our outlook for the rest of the year. In Ag Products overall crop conditions in our
territory appear favorable at the moment. However low commodity prices and abundant global supply creates
uncertainty in our volume outlook for grain. In grain products we expect demand for soybean meal to remain strong in
the near-term. And ethanol production should return to seasonally normal levels. Automotive should continue to benefit
from strength in sales and we expect growth in finished vehicles and auto part shipments.
In Coal, while the weather has been closer to seasonally normal temperatures recently, we expect lower natural gas
prices, higher inventories, and low export demand to continue to be headwinds in the second half of the year. Although
we anticipate continued year-over-year declines in the back half of the year, we expect that volumes will sequentially
improve from second quarter levels.
Most Chemical markets should remain solid for the remainder of the year with strength expected in LPG and plastics.
We continue to expect that the crude oil prices and unfavorable spreads will remain as significant headwind for crude
by rail shipments for the rest of the year.
Lower crude oil prices will also continue to impact some of our Industrial Products markets. Rig counts are down
roughly 50% from their peak in 2014 but seem to have stabilized in recent weeks. We expect our frac sand shipments to
level off as well, though they will be significantly lower year-over-year given the strong comps. The reduction in new
drilling activity along with the strong dollar will continue to be headwinds for our metals business.
The housing market continues to strengthen year-over-year. And we believe our lumber franchise is well-positioned to
grow with demand. In construction products we anticipate to return to growth as weather conditions normalize.
Finally, in Intermodal the relatively high current retail inventory levels could moderate our growth in the second half of
the year in both domestic and international. However many of the consumer confidence and spending indicators are
still positive, so we're preparing for a normal peak shipping season, though it could be muted. As always highway
conversions will continue to present growth opportunities in domestic Intermodal.

Overall while there is uncertainty in some of our markets, we continue to see opportunity in several others. We will
continue our focus on solid core pricing gains and on business development across our diverse franchise.
With that I'll turn it over to Cameron.
Cameron A. Scott
Thanks, Eric, and good morning. Starting with our safety performance, our first half reportable injury rate improved
23% versus 2014 to a record low 0.82. Successfully finding and addressing risk in the workplace is clearly having a
positive impact, as we improve towards our goal of zero incidents.
In rail equipment incidents or derailments our reportable rate increased 17% to 3.46, driven by an increase in yard and
industry reportables. To make improvement going forward we will continue to focus on enhanced TE&Y training to
eliminate human factor incidents. We will also continue making investments that harden our infrastructure to reduce
incidents.
In public safety our grade crossing incident rate improved 11% versus 2014 to 1.97. We continue to drive improvement
by reinforcing public awareness through channels, including public safety campaigns and community partnerships.
Moving to network performance, we continue to face a very dynamic environment. Significant volume swings and
business mix shifts have led us to more frequently address our transportation plans. Add to it the numerous
flooding-related outages we faced during the quarter, and it was a challenging operating environment.
During the quarter, we experienced 64 weather interruption days, caused by more than 100 weather-related track
outages, including a significant interruption in the Powder River Basin during early June. We define interruption days
as more than 50 hours of train delay associated with weather or incident events.
The strength of our franchise and investments we had made in resources and infrastructure have enabled us to mitigate
the impact of these events. We rerouted trains where possible, while our engineering crews worked around the clock to
restore operations. I'm very proud of the men and women of Union Pacific who've faced these challenges head on,
enabling us to generate year-over-year improvement in both velocity and terminal dwell. That said, we know there is
more work to do, and we're working diligently to improve service and reduce costs.
Throughout the year you have heard us discuss the importance of resource alignment as a key lever to reduce cost.
While we strive to be as real time as possible, the reality is that there is a time lag in adjusting the resource space,
especially during periods of volume swings and business mix shifts.
As you can see in the charts on the right, we have made meaningful progress rightsizing our TE&Y workforce and
active locomotive fleet throughout the first half. Our total TE&Y workforce was down 4% in June versus March. More
than half of the decrease was driven by fewer employees in the training pipeline. We expect a further reduction in the
third quarter.
By the end of June, we had around 1,200 TE&Y employees either furloughed or in alternative work status and had
about 900 locomotives in storage. This is up from the end of the first quarter, when we had around 500 TE&Y
employees furloughed or in alternative work status and 475 locomotives in storage.
While we still have some work left to do, we are now getting closer to having our resources aligned with demand. But
as always, we will continue to monitor and adjust our workforce levels and equipment fleet as volume dictates.
Moving to Network Productivity. Even in the face of less-than-optimal operating conditions and lower volumes, we
were able to generate some efficiencies during the quarter. We ran record train lengths in nearly all major categories,
remaining agile and adapting our transportation plan to current demand.
We were also able to generate efficiency gains within terminals as productivity initiatives led to record terminal
productivity despite a decline in the number of cars switched. Growth capacity investments, whether it be in the form

of sidings, double track or terminal infrastructure, have enhanced our ability to generate productivity and have
increased the fluid capabilities of our network.
However, as was also the case in the prior quarter, the associated time lag in adjusting resources to lower volumes
continued to lead to inefficiencies in other areas. This was particularly evident in efficiency metrics such as locomotive
productivity, which is measured as gross ton miles per horsepower day. While lower coal and grain volumes did create
a mix headwind, this fleet productivity metric was down 8% versus the second quarter of 2014.
To wrap up, as we move into the back half of the year, we expect our safety strategy will continue yielding record
results on our way to an incident-free environment. We will continue making operational improvements by leveraging
the strengths of our franchise to improve operational performance. And while our resources are now more closely in
line with demand, we will continue our focus on other productivity initiatives to reduce costs. Ultimately, safety and
service will drive our ability to run an efficient network, all of which creates value for our customers and increases
returns for our shareholders.
With that I'll turn it over to Rob.
Robert M. Knight
Thanks. Good morning. Let's start with a recap of our second quarter results. Operating revenue was just over $5.4
billion in the quarter, down 10% versus last year. A significant decline in volume and lower fuel surcharge revenue
along with a negative shift in business mix more than offset another quarter of solid core pricing.
Operating expenses totaled just under $3.5 billion, decreasing 9% when compared to last year. Drivers of this expense
reduction were significantly lower fuel expense along with volume-related reductions and cost-saving initiatives. The
net result was an 11% decrease in operating income, to $1.9 billion.
Below the line, other income totaled $142 million, up from $22 million in 2014. Included in this amount is the
previously announced Fremont, California land sale, which contributed $113 million to pre-tax income or $0.08 per
share to total earnings.
Interest expense of $153 million was up 11% compared to the previous year, driven by increased debt issuance during
the last 12 months. Income tax expense decreased 7% to $734 million, driven primarily by reduced pre-tax earnings.
Net income decreased 7% versus last year, while the outstanding share balance declined 3% as a result of our continued
share repurchase activity. These results combined to produce a quarterly earnings of $1.38 per share, down 3% versus
last year.
Now turning to our top line. Freight revenue of about $5.1 billion was down 10% versus last year. In addition to a 6%
volume decline, fuel surcharge revenue was down about $400 million when compared to 2014. All-in, we estimate the
net impact of fuel price was a $0.06 headwind to earnings in the second quarter versus last year. This includes the net
impact from both fuel surcharges and lower diesel fuel costs. Of course, this is a turnaround from the first quarter,
where we had the benefit of surcharge lag and more favorable spreads. Assuming fuel prices and associated spreads
remain at current levels, we estimate that fuel will be a slight headwind to earnings for the remainder of the year.
Business mix, as we guided on our first quarter earnings call, was a negative contributor to freight revenue for the
second quarter. The primary drivers of this mix shift were significant declines in bulk grains, frac sand and steel
shipments, along with an increase in Intermodal volumes. Looking ahead, business mix will likely continue to be a
headwind to freight revenue for the remainder of the year. A 4% core price increase was a positive contributor to
freight revenue in the quarter.
Slide 21 provides more detail on our core pricing trends. Core pricing continued at levels that are above inflation and
reflects the value proposition that we offer in the marketplace. Of the 4% this quarter, just under 0.5% can be attributed
to the benefit of the legacy business we renewed earlier this year, and this includes both the 2015 and 2016 legacy
contract renewals.

Moving on to the expense side, slide 22 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which
increased 5% versus 2014. Lower volumes were more than offset by labor inflation, increased training expense and
operating inefficiencies.
Looking at our total workforce levels, our employee count was up 4% when compared to 2014. About half of this
increase was in our capital-related workforce. Excluding our capital-related employees, our force level grew by about
2.5% but is down 500 sequentially from the first quarter. And as Cam just discussed, we are continuing to adjust our
TE&Y workforce level to better align with current demand.
While we have made progress, we continue to look for every opportunity to rightsize our workforce and focus on labor
productivity. By year end, we now expect our net overall workforce levels to come in somewhat lower than the 48,000
that we reported at the end of last year.
Labor inflation was about 6% for the second quarter, driven primarily by agreement wage inflation. And remember that
the first two quarters of this year includes a 3% agreement wage increase effective the first of this year on top of the
3.5% wage increase from last July. For the full year, we still expect labor inflation to be about 5%, including slightly
higher pension costs.
Turning to the next slide. Fuel expense totaled $541 million, down 41% when compared to 2014. Lower diesel fuel
prices along with a 10% decline in gross ton miles drove the decrease in fuel expense for the quarter. Compared to the
second quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rate deteriorated 2%, largely driven by the decline in coal volumes,
while our average fuel price declined 36% to $1.99 per gallon.
Moving on to the other expense categories. Purchased services and materials expense decreased 6% to $600 million.
Reduced contract service expenses associated with our subsidiaries was partially offset by an increase in locomotive
material expenses. Depreciation expense was $497 million, up 6% compared to 2014. We still expect depreciation to
increase about 6% for the full year.
Slide 25 summarizes the remaining two expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $312 million,
which is down 1% when compared to 2014. Lower locomotive lease and freight car rental expense were the primary
drivers. Other expenses came in at $225 million, down 1% versus last year. Lower personal injury expense was
somewhat offset by higher state and local taxes. Year-to-date, other expense is up 7%, consistent with our full year
expectation of a 5% to 10% increase excluding any large unusual items.
Turning now to our operating ratio performance. The quarterly operating ratio came in at 64.1%, an increase of 0.6
points when compared to the second quarter of 2014. The operating ratio benefited just under a point from the net
impact of lower fuel prices in the quarter.
Turning now to our cash flow. Cash from operations for the first half increased to just under $3.8 billion. This is up
17% compared to 2014, primarily driven by the timing of tax payments and changes in working capital. We also
invested more than $2.1 billion this half in cash capital investments.
Taking a look at the balance sheet, our adjusted debt balance grew to $16.6 billion at quarter end, up from $14.9 billion
at year end. This takes our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio to 44.2%, up from 41.3% at yearend 2014.
We continue to target an adjusted debt to cap ratio in the low to mid-40% range and an adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio
of 1.5x plus.
We have made meaningful progress towards our targets, as we continue to execute our cash allocation strategies. Our
profitability and cash generation enable us to continue to fund both our capital program and cash returns to
shareholders. Since the first of the year we have bought back about 15 million shares totaling $1.6 billion. Between the
first and second quarter dividends, along with our share repurchases, we returned $2.6 billion to our shareholders in the
first half of 2015. And this represents roughly a 15% increase over 2014, demonstrating our commitment to increasing
shareholder value.

So that's a recap of our second quarter results. As we look towards the back half of the year, we will continue to focus
on achieving solid core pricing gains. However we expect volumes to be down somewhat year over year in the second
half, given the market dynamics that we are experiencing in many of our business segments. Also as we discussed
earlier, business mix will continue to be a headwind on freight revenue.
On the expense side we noted on our first quarter earnings call that inefficiencies cost us as much as 2 points on the
operating ratio. We've made good progress since then. We estimate that these extra costs added just under a point in the
second quarter. And in the third quarter we expect to reduce these costs even further. While we continue to improve, it
is not likely at this point that we will achieve record earnings on a full year basis, given this year's challenges.
Longer term however we expect to be on track to achieve our long-term financial guidance. And as always we remain
committed to providing our customers with safe and efficient service and our shareholders with strong financial returns.
So with that I'll turn it back over to Lance.
Lance M. Fritz
Thanks, Rob. With the challenges of the first half now behind us, our focus is on the remainder of the year and beyond.
Clearly there are still a lot of moving parts. We'll keep a close eye on crude oil and natural gas prices, the upcoming
grain harvest, the strong dollar impact on balance of trade, as well as the continued demand for autos and the outlook
for the consumer economy. All of this leads to a fluid demand picture across many of our business segments.
While the volume outlook is uncertain, we remain laser focused on operating safely and efficiently no matter what the
market environment. We will continue to reduce costs and improve productivity as we further align resources with
demand. While we've made some progress, there is more to be done.
Longer term we continue to be optimistic about the strengths of our diverse rail franchise. We remain committed to
providing excellent service for our customers and strong returns to our shareholders in the years ahead. So with that
let's open up the line for your questions.
Robert M. Knight
Lance, if I can interrupt, if I can make one comment before we take the first question?
Lance M. Fritz
Sure.
Robert M. Knight
We just understand here recently that some of you have had trouble accessing the slides on our website. They are back
up and running now. So if you have any difficulty, we suggest you log out and log back in. And they should be up and
available for you. We apologize for that.

Operator
Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Due to the number of
analysts joining us on the call today, we will be limiting everyone to one primary question and one follow-up question
to accommodate as many participants as possible. Thank you.
And our first question today comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please go ahead with your
question.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Morning.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Wanted to touch on, Rob, what you just kind of wrapped up there with. When you think
about sort of earnings progression as we go through the rest of the year, clearly we sort of had the pinch point here in
the second quarter with resources relative to volume. Volume gets better a little bit sequentially and resources are still
adjusting.
Do you feel like getting back to year-over-year earnings growth is something that can be achieved by the fourth quarter
of this year? I don't want to get too specific in terms of guidance. But just want to get a rough sense of sort of the puts
and takes about trying to get back up to a positive trajectory. And then thinking out into 2016?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah, Chris. I mean, we're focused on obviously improving earnings as best we can. And
you're exactly right. We're going to be laser focused on continuing to rely on the resources and be as efficient as we can
on the costs.
But I think what we're calling out in my comment to just think that there's – it's not likely that we will beat last year's
record earnings is the reality of what we're seeing in the business mix, particularly the coal volumes. I mean we're not
calling for any dramatic turnaround in our coal volumes, as Eric pointed out. While we are seeing some sequential
improvement as we speak right now, we are anticipating that that will be a challenge.
The other thing I would just point out, Chris, in the way you're looking at is recall last year actually was a – is a very
tough comp for the fourth quarter in particular. So we've got that sort of headwind if you will in terms of getting back
above that level.
So we're focused on taking advantage of every opportunity we can. But we just see some continuing softness in some
of our key markets, and that's going to be the key driver.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: That's great. That's helpful. And just a quick follow-up on the coal you that mentioned there.
As you see that sequential improvement into the 3Q, any kind of sense you can give us on how to think about that
specific commodity group in the back half? Or just maybe the third quarter? And maybe where sort of stockpiles are, so
we can get some rough sense there? Thank you.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Eric, can you take care of that for us?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Well, it all depends, Chris, as we always say, depending on weather. Inventory levels are still
higher than the five-year average. They have come down about three or four days. The burn is increasing, but they're
still higher. The volumes will depend on weather. It will depend a lot on natural gas pricing. At current natural gas
levels, it remains a difficult comparison for coal to remain – coat is about a 30%, 32% market share today, versus a
39%, 40% last year. The big change in that is natural gas pricing.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks for your time.

<Q - Allison M. Landry>: Thanks. Good morning. So I just wanted to talk a little bit about the mix headwind that you
mentioned going forward. So based on some of your comments if grain volumes do end up materializing, you do see a
rebound in construction products, and potentially some muted growth on the Intermodal side, is there a scenario where
mix could be flattish? I guess I'm just trying to understand maybe some of the puts and takes and the magnitude of the
negative mix in the back half.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Rob, you want to take that?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah, I mean, if what you just outlined, Allison, came true, those would certainly be
positive contributors to the mix. And as you know I don't give guidance on mix. It's rare that we do. This year is unique
in that we are confident that the mix headwinds are in front of us. So we're giving that directional guidance.
And I would just remind everyone that because of the great diversity of our business mix, which is a very strong
attribute of the Union Pacific franchise, we tend to have a lot of mix swings in our business from quarter to quarter.
So the points that you're making would certainly contribute. Would they be enough to overcome some of the other
headwinds like the coal, the shale, the sand, et cetera? Perhaps not. But every opportunity we have to narrow that gap if
you will and improve on the mix, we'll certainly take advantage of it.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Yeah, I'd like to add to that. This is Lance. So our commercial team has a robust business
development pipeline. And they're pursuing business opportunity that presents itself to us because of our wonderful
diverse franchise.
And so to Rob's point it's hard to be precise in making a future call. There are opportunities and puts and takes. But the
guidance we've given you is what we think is our best guess.
<Q - Allison M. Landry>: Okay. And just a follow-up question. Could you give us a sense of how much the
inefficiencies cost you in the second quarter?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah, Allison, just to rephrase that. We said it was up to about a 2 point, or call that $100
million, in the first quarter. It was closer to just under a point let's say in the second quarter. So from a dollar standpoint
call that a $50 million improvement from first to second quarter in those efficiencies. And again we're focused on
continuing aggressively to get that – remove those efficiency as quickly as we can.
<Q - Allison M. Landry>: Perfect. Thanks. Sorry I missed that last part. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your questions.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Hey, thanks. Morning, guys.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Morning.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Just want to clarify one quick thing first. Rob, your comments about earnings growth, what are
you assuming for the second quarter? Is that based on $1.30 or $1.38?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: In the second quarter? $1.38. Yeah. Including – I guess what you're getting at is the land
sale. Yeah all in.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Okay. So a question on coal. We understand some of the pressures. But seeing such -- so much
more weakness in your volumes relative to BNSF. And is there any color you can provide on maybe is there a big
market share loss or customer loss that we should be thinking about? And when that began? And then are you starting
to see any pressure from the utilities on a pricing standpoint?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: I'm going to let Eric answer that question.

<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yes. As we mentioned at the last quarter, Scott, we do think we came into this year at a different
place than our Western competitor in terms of inventory levels of our key customer utilities. And we do think that that
has had an impact.
We also think, as we mentioned in our comments, that some of the flooding and track outages that we experienced
particularly in June had an impact that you probably won't see in the numbers of our Western competitor.
One of the other impacts that we have seen is that there are probably a couple of specific customers that have had
outages and have had challenges in their energy markets in terms of them competing that are probably
disproportionately impacting us than our competitor. We think over time that kind of works its way out. But certainly
in the second quarter it had an impact.
We always compete for business. And we think we have a market value. We are continuing to focus on the strong price
in terms of your second part of your question. And we feel good about the market value and the price for our services.
And that is reflected in our results in the second quarter.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Okay. Thanks. And just the next and last question I want to ask about share buybacks. It seems
to me for the past several years you guys have had this really unique story with the legacy pricing. And that's behind us
now. But it seems to me you still have a really unique opportunity in terms of having by far the least leverage of any of
the rails. And given the weakness in the stock and may be tougher to grow earnings, do you start to think about using
that optionality more aggressively? And why not?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah, Scott. I mean you know the guidance we've given in terms of the metrics that we're
comfortable with. But to your point on the share buyback, if you look at first half this year compared to last year's first
half, we're up about 10% in terms of our share buyback. And we will continue to be opportunistic. And at the prices
that we're seeing right now, we think those are nice entry points. So we will – we are certainly, as we always have, buy
more when it's down and less when it's up. But your longer term question I think is answered in our comfort with our
longer term metrics that we've given.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Yeah. And Scott, this is Lance. I want to react to something that was in your question, which
said tougher to grow earnings going forward.
Again I want to re-emphasize what we've constantly focused on with our investors. And that is we've got an
industry-best franchise. It's got plenty of opportunity for growth and business development. And we've got plenty of
opportunity to continue to improve the productivity and efficiency of operations. So for the very long-term we feel very
good about our long-term guidance.

Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Kenneth Scott Hoexter>: Great. Good morning. Just a follow-up on the coal just for a second. But want to go
back to last quarter. You thought coal was going to be down 5%. At that point it was already running down in the
mid-teens.
So I just want to think back to the inefficiencies as you noted. Have you been maybe slower to cut costs in addition to
the inefficiencies? And I guess, Lance, the question would be, what gets you to move quicker, thinking about how to
balance cutting costs and staying ahead of that? But then if you get that inflection on volumes at some point to still be
prepared? So how do you as – think about how quickly you want to cut out some of those additional costs?

<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Sure. So, Ken, putting this all in context. Right? So this time last year, second quarter last year,
we were behind in resources, experiencing substantial growth. And as rapidly as we could filling our pipeline with new
employees. We came into this quarter or this year, and in the first quarter as you note declined 2%, which was not our
expectation. And then further declined in the second quarter.
So as soon as we recognized this year that we need to make adjustments, we've been doing so. The big thing that has us
mismatched right now is really two parts, and Rob hit both. One is our capital program. And the type of capital we're
spending is demanding that we have more capital head count. So there's a head count imbalance there, it grew
year-over-year. And our training pipeline where we were just filling it up in the second quarter last year. And we're
now emptying it out in the second quarter this year.
As we move into the third quarter, all of that is happening at a rapid pace and will continue to happen. And I expect by
the end of the third quarter, much more balance as regards training and as regards overall head count and resources
targeted on the transportation product.
Answering your question, could we do things faster? Hindsight is a luxury we typically don't have in planning the
business. I certainly wish we had better clarity in what our markets would be doing, what the mix would look like. We
certainly would be making adjustments more rapidly if we did.
However in the pragmatic world we're in right now, there is an opportunity for us to be better. We're working very hard
right now on trying to figure out ways to be more agile with our resources, to be quicker in recognizing market shifts,
and being quicker in being able to take those actions. So I think it's a fair question.
<Q - Kenneth Scott Hoexter>: No. I appreciate that. It just clearly seems tough to see with some more volatility on
the volume side.
On the follow-up I guess maybe just throwing it to Eric, on the – I think the question before was talking about more on
the coal side and the competition, if you're seeing that impacting pricing. It seems like with your positive 4% pure
pricing you're not seeing too much. But I want to understand. Are you seeing kind of across the other commodities? As
Burlington has improved their service levels, are you seeing increased competition on the volume side? And any kind
of thoughts on pricing and what that may do outside of your legacy renewals?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Ken, as we always say we have a tough competitor. They always have been a tough competitor.
Always will be. Not only is the Burlington a tough competitor, but we do compete with other railroads in other
markets. We also compete with trucks. Trucks are also a tough competitor, and lower fuel prices are helping them.
That being said we feel good about our value proposition. We're continuing to focus on the strategies and initiatives to
improve our value proposition. It's our goal to have the best service and value proposition in the industry. And if we do
that we think we'll be able to price appropriately for our value.

<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Morning.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Rob, can I follow-up on this line of questions here? Just thinking about your OR or
your margins in the back half of the year. I think if we look back the last couple of years you've had quite a bit of
sequential improvement in profitability. And so we're talking about a lot of pluses and minuses here. Business mix
should be negative, still lower volumes year-on-year, but sequentially improving, still getting price. And then you
talked a lot about the fuel impact in the second quarter and how that could be incremental headwind. You have wage

inflation with head count reduction.
So as you balance all this out and with the best view right now, I mean how do you feel about the operating ratio
heading into the second half of the year?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah, there's a lot of moving parts as you point out, fuel being a big one in terms of the
impact that that has on the operating ratio itself. But our focus would be that that is an opportunity still for us to make
year-over-year improvement. And the way things look at this point in time, fuel would probably help in that regard,
unless it dramatically changes and spikes up.
But we are focused on – for all the efficiencies that we plan on taking, the continued focus on price, the diverse
opportunities that still will present themselves, we are focused on still improving the operating ratio year over year.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Okay. That's helpful. And, Eric, can you comment a little bit on grain markets?
Because there's a big discussion that if we have another big harvest or relatively large harvest, which I think the
government is calling for right now, how much of that could we actually store if folks decide they don't want to sell
into a low commodity price environment? Or are we going to end up having to move the volume anyways?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah, that's a good question, Brandon. As you know, the outlook right now is that the yields
look strong. You're still relatively early in the growing season, so anything could happen from a weather standpoint.
But right now the projections are, while it may not be a record crop like the last two years, it still will be a pretty strong
corn and bean crop.
As you suggest, storage of crops are relatively high because U.S. grain has not been able to compete as effectively
because there have been strong world grain crops and the strong U.S. dollar. So there is a speculation that says if it is a
strong crop, there will have to have the current products or the crop move. And so that would be a positive for us in the
second half of the year. And there's always uncertainty in our markets. But that is one of the scenarios that could be
positive for the transportation system.

The next question is coming from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your
questions.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Hey. Good morning, guys. Rob, with the weather events that we had this year kind of
being a lot worse than last year, is there any estimate for the cost you that guys maybe incurred this quarter that
wouldn't be there if weather would have been a little more favorable? Or is that just too hard to call?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: I think it's too hard to call, David, to be honest. It'd be rolled up in those inefficiencies that I
called out.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Okay. And then from a mix perspective, the revenue ton miles were down sort of 14%
relative to the car load decline of mid-single digit. Where in the business, Eric, do you see the biggest negative mix on
the length of haul right now?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: As Rob said, there's a lot of ins and outs in terms of mix. And we actually have had ins and outs
in terms of mix across the business line. Coal certainly is a negative mix item, as you might imagine. But we have
grown our Intermodal business, which is a longer haul, so that would be positive. There's always lots of ins and outs
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: But I mean, is the fall off in frac sand, for example, were those sort of longer length of
haul than your average industrial product shipment?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Frac sand is probably right around the average length of haul for industrial products. Certainly
the fall off in that has had a revenue mix impact, as Rob talked about.

Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please go ahead with your questions.
<Q - Thomas Wadewitz>: Yeah, good morning. Wanted to ask you about volumes in second half, and I know that it's
kind of a directional question, I know it's hard to have tons of granularity on this stuff. But volumes were down 6%
year-over-year in second quarter, I think the comparisons may be just a touch easier in third. So the way we should
look at this as less worse year-over-year in third quarter, is that a pretty reasonable assumption? And then when you
look at fourth quarter, a little bit less worse? Or I don't know, any kind of broad comments on just thinking about
modeling volumes year-over-year third quarter and fourth quarter?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: So before I let Rob speak to it in perhaps more detail, the way we're thinking about volumes in
the second half, and we said it, is we're expecting a normal seasonal pattern. So seasonally we see a peak in the second
half and the third quarter. But there's a lot of reason for us to think that it's a muted peak. So I think that says
sequentially better, but there's headwinds against year-over-year.
Rob?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah, Tom, I would just reiterate what we said earlier, and that is we expect them to be
down somewhat in the back half. And we're not giving quarterly guidance on the volume, but the thing I would just
point out is that I'd like to think that the sequential improvement that we're starting to see that Eric pointed out in coal
will help in that third quarter year-over-year look. And then the fourth quarter is a little bit more of a challenge for us.
So we're not calling it, but we're certainly focused and hopeful that things from a year-over-year perspective don't look
like a 6% down kind of number. But we aren't giving precise guidance on that.
<Q - Thomas Wadewitz>: Okay, that's good. I appreciate the comments. And then the follow-up question. On the
expenses, obviously there's a lag on some of these items, so I suppose training expense and maybe in some of your
materials expense and some others, how would I look sequentially at some of these categories where you have seen
improvement? If I look at purchased services, you're down quite a bit sequentially. Is that down more in third quarter
versus second? And I guess another category, rents, was kind of flat sequentially. Are some of those categories down
more in absolute terms in third quarter versus second?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Rob?
<Q - Thomas Wadewitz>: Thank you.
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah, Tom, this probably won't shock you, but you're going to stump me in terms of trying
to get into individual expense categories. But I would just say that kind of all of the categories are stones that we are
uncovering and looking for opportunities in every single category. Labor, of course, shows up across the board. And
that I would say as a large position is what we're really focused on that might show up of course in multiple expense
categories.
And as I pointed out, remember, we took the $100 million of inefficiency or misalignment in the first quarter down to,
call it, $50 million-ish in the second quarter. And we're focused on going after that $50 million and then some. I mean,
our focus is to not just to stop there, but continue to achieve as efficient of operations as we possibly can, matching
against demand.
So long answer to your short question, but I would say it's across the board that we're going to expect ourselves to make
improvements.
<Q - Thomas Wadewitz>: Okay, great. Thank you.

Our next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Bascome Majors>: Yeah, thanks for taking my question here. So, I mean, clearly there were a lot of volatility
and low visibility in the second quarter relative to where you thought you were entering the quarter from a demand
perspective. I'm just curious, now versus two months or three months ago, what's your sense from your customers? Are
they seeing more stability and low visibility? Or is there any conviction that things have stabilized on top of the
comments you made on coal earlier?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: So let me start with that and then we'll get it to the expert in Eric. When you look at our top
line, the story that we talked about in first quarter really is the same in second quarter, just more acute. And that is there
are areas of the economy that feel pretty stable and pretty good and it's reflected in the consumer side of the economy
and specifically in things like our automotive shipments, in the domestic Intermodal product, a couple of other things
like that. This acute impact in the energy side of our business, specifically coal and shale energy-related product, is
largely driving that top-line problem.
Eric?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah, I mean that's right. I'm not sure there's much to add. But the economy feels pretty good.
Most of the macroeconomic indicators are going in the right direction. You know them as well as I do. And we're
seeing that in our business. The issue we have is a significant shortfall in coal, driven by natural gas, mild weather and
some episodic issues with some large customers of ours and, frankly, the falloff in our shale-related business. But aside
from that, the economic indicators and the economy, our customers are feeling pretty good. The trends are already up
the correct direction.
<Q - Bascome Majors>: Well, thank you for that. If I can just get one more in on the margin front. You mentioned
that the headwinds from operational inefficiencies were about 1 point less in 2Q versus 1Q. But if I net out the impact
of fuel surcharges, you'd have to go back quite a ways to see the net year-over-year margin decline as steep as you saw
this quarter.
So, just as we try to directionally understand the drivers here, can you kind of rank order mix, demand-related and
simply a function of what the marketplace is giving you versus whether it's a timing lag between the shifts you've seen
in the marketplace and have addressed the resource resizing already to some extent? And how significant is the net fuel
headwind for the year that you alluded to in your prepared remarks earlier?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: So, Rob, you want to take the...
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah. Let me try to answer that just simply by saying, I mean they're all contributors and
they're all challenges that we deal with in our daily lives. But I would say if you look at the second quarter, the biggest
hit, if you would, would start with volume driven by coal. And then second on the list I would say is the mix impact,
which obviously is impacted by that coal falloff as well. But the mix impact of changing within our business mix, the
sand, et cetera, the grains, et cetera. And those would be the big drivers.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Yeah, what's part disappointing and part encouraging, and Cameron walked us through this.
We had areas of real productivity improvement that our team drove, both the commercial and the operating team, from
the standpoint of train size improvement to near-record levels on almost every product, continued improvement in
switching efficiency. And it was overwhelmed by this mismatch, this imbalance in resources. And we're aggressively
going after that and we'll get that right.
<Q - Bascome Majors>: All right. Thanks for that color. I really appreciate it.
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Thank you.

Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Brian P. Ossenbeck>: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my call. So clearly a lot going on in the volume
aspect. I want to talk more about the regulatory front, where there's also a lot going on. We've got two transportation
spending bills in Congress. If you look in the Senate version, which may or may not make it, there's actually a whole
lot of stuff in there about rail, PTC, hazardous materials, recording devices, et cetera.
So with that and the recent [ph] challenges on the (52:55) standards, I wonder if you can just give us kind of a highlevel
view [inaudible] (53:00)? It's always something to look at and be cognizant of. But anything that you're especially
focused on though the remainder of 2015 and into next year?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Brian, you broke up just a little bit when you were asking the detail of your question. Let me
tell you what I think I heard. And you tell me if that's right.
You're asking broadly there's a lot going on in the regulatory environment. And what do we see coming out of that in
the next – rest of the year and next year?
<Q - Brian P. Ossenbeck>: Yeah. That's good. Thanks.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Okay. So our first primary focus in Washington is an extension on Positive Train Control or
PTC. We've been crystal clear with our regulators and elected officials that we need that. That Union Pacific is not
going to make the deadline. There is really no railroad that will make that deadline, and the industry needs an
extension. I believe everybody understands that.
It looks like there's an opportunity to have that happen as maybe part of a highway bill or some other vehicle. The hard
part of that is we've got to start making plans in case a PTC extension does not occur. And we'll have to then start
communicating to our affected customers and commuter agencies what those plans are and what the timing is. And that
probably starts up sometime in September. So there is a bit of a clock ticking on that.
The second thing we are focused on intently is HAZMAT regulation, as you pointed out. We are in that dialogue. We
think the regulation as published by the DOT has a couple of flaws. More broadly we are very supportive of a new tank
car standard. We've been asking for it both as a company, as an industry for years. And we are working diligently to get
that standard right, to make it more safe than it currently is.
And then the last thing we're working pretty hard on is different issues in front of the FTB, which is our primary
commercial regulator. And we're active in that dialogue and trying to navigate that for the best of our company.
<Q - Brian P. Ossenbeck>: Okay. Thanks, Lance. That was a good overview and hopeful I've found a better spot for
cell signal for the quick follow-up. I was just wondering with all the stuff going on with coal as you look into next year
– this is another regulatory question, with the Mets ruling being kicked down to the circuit court by the Supreme Court
a couple weeks ago, do you think that, one, I guess ever had really any impact in your service area? And two, if it did,
do you see any potential benefit from that rule being kind of thrown back for a reconsideration? Thanks.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: So I'm going to let Eric answer the specific question on coal emissions regulation. I'll just start
with a broad statement. And that is we believe coal needs to continue to be a robust part of electricity generation in the
United States. It's low cost. It's abundant. And it can be clean in terms of its emissions. And it's very important for the
U.S. economy and for the U.S. manufacturers to be competitive on a global scale.
Eric?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah, in terms of the specific question we don't think that the – while we applaud the ruling, we
don't think it's going to have a significant impact. Either entities were already planning for it, and/or they might still
plan for it, just because they don't know what might happen on the inevitable appeal that will occur. Or it wasn't going
to have a significant issue any way. So the fact that it was remanded I don't think is going to have a significant impact

Our next question is coming from the line of Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your questions.
<Q - William Jeffrey Greene>: Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Lance and Rob, I wanted to just explore a little bit the
relationship between OR and the coal franchise. As you know a lot of investors think of coal as being highly profitable.
And so if coal weren't to come back or even go down further from here in a longer term sense, so like a secular decline,
does it impede your ability to achieve your long-term OR? Or do you feel like productivity and price alone can allow
you to achieve that, even if the coal franchise ends up much smaller than it is today?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: I'll let Rob answer more specifically. But I'll give you an overarching reaction. And that is there
are lots of puts and takes in our business over the long term. Our franchise is such that we've always been able to find
growth opportunities and take advantage of them. And I'll remind you that our overall business strategy is predicated on
a industry-best, a demonstrably better service product and pricing for that value. Along with productivity all of that tells
me I am confidence in our long-term OR guidance. Rob?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah. Lance, I actually would just reiterate what you just said. We are not – first of all,
we're not calling for the death of coal as a business unit for us. We're experiencing a bit of a hiccup here.
But I would say first of all that obviously that size of a business is a positive contributor to our OR. As it shrinks, or
any business shrinks, we have – as we've talked and as you know – we have a lot of diverse opportunities in front of us
that give us a lot of confidence. And that's what keeps us as confident as ever that we could still meet our long-term OR
guidance.
If we were to see it take a step down, any business unit take a step down, we would have to do the things that we've
done over the last decade. And that is right size our organization and make sure that we're being smart about adjusting
our costs accordingly, so that we can continue to make progress on our financial results.
<Q - William Jeffrey Greene>: Okay. Fair enough. A follow-up question just is on the dollar. A lot of investors sort
of ask me about whether – rails were really sort of pseudo commodity plays. And a weak dollar effectively caused a lot
of stuff in North America to move, not just sort of the crude by rail, but a broader industrial implication. And so do you
feel like a strong dollar impedes your ability to get the car loads back to let's say over 180,000 a week or something? I
mean is this sort of a real kind of risk factor that we need to keep in mind when we think about modeling longer-term
volumes?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Eric, you want to handle that?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah. I don't think so. Certainly as you know when you have strong currency moves one way or
the other, it could affect commodity flows. We see that in all of our commodity markets.
But long term North America is still kind of a strong, productive, secure, relatively low-cost place of production. It's
also a huge consumption market. And those things will continue to drive us being in the sweet spot for our
transportation services, whether it's export or import. So long term it's not – it doesn't move the needle.
<Q - William Jeffrey Greene>: All right. Thanks for the time.

<Q - Robert H. Salmon>: Hey good morning. If I could shift it back a little bit to kind of the core pricing. I was a little
bit surprised that it actually was stable sequentially at up 4.5% – up 4% rather with half a point coming from the legacy
with kind of weaker coal volumes. Rob or Eric, could you talk a little bit more about what drove that? Because I would
have thought with less coal that would have actually been a headwind to core pricing? So any additional color? If it's
coming from kind of the 2016 renewal that you got a little bit more of a benefit this quarter? Or you're just getting
stronger pricing across the franchise?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: I'm going to throw it to Eric, but I'm very proud of the team for their results in the second
quarter. In a very difficult environment they effectively priced for the value of the product, and that was a good
outcome.
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah. I mean Rob can talk about kind of the legacy impact. But we're doing what we said. We
have a value product, and we're pricing for it.
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah. And I think too, specifically to your – the legacy question, I would say that was
comparable to what we saw in the first quarter. I mean where we said about a half point of the 4% was legacy roughly.
But you're also pointing out – and again I'm as confident as Lance and Eric and pleased with that performance. I think it
shows that we're getting value in the marketplace. And as you also are pointing out and just to reiterate for others, the
way we calculate our core price is if it doesn't move, we don't count it. So we're hopeful that if and when coal resumes
some of the volume pickup, that some of those repriced contracts will be positive contributors to our margins as we
move forward.
<Q - Robert H. Salmon>: Rob, could you give us a sense that had coal either been flat or the decline in line with Q1 in
terms of overall carloads, what core pricing would have looked at this past quarter?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah. I really can't give you that size. And there's a big mix even within the coal line. And
I'm not giving that level of specificity. But just suffice it to say there was some value left there by not moving it.
<Q - Robert H. Salmon>: Fair enough. Appreciate the time.

Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowan & Company. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. I want to talk a little bit about the Intermodal franchise.
Can you guys focus on going forward just how much you think the competition has increased from the truckload side,
as some capacity has crept back into the marketplace? And also longer term given the issues that the West Coast ports
have had, do you feel there's a chance that the West Coast could lose some permanent market share to the East Coast?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Eric?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: So, Jason, in terms of the first question. Clearly lower fuel prices will incrementally nominally
make truckers more competitive. And clearly as the shale play has gone down, there appears to be what we think is a
temporary alleviation with some of the driver shortages – or temporary reduction I should say. There still are long-term
driver shortages out there. But some of the move from labor from that to truck drivers has alleviated some of the
shortage.
And so trucks continue to be a competitive option. I would point out in the second quarter we set again another all-time
domestic Intermodal record. Our volumes set another record. We continue to see huge conversion opportunities. And
we think as we have the service value proposition, we'll continue to be able to penetrate and take advantage of that.
In terms of the West Coast port, clearly that had an impact certainly in the first quarter. In the second quarter as some
of the backlogs were cleaned up, that had a positive impact. But as we said we had a tough comp year over year
because of the pre-shipping that occurred the previous year.

I think one of the things that are instructive to look at is kind of the spread rates, the ocean, spread rates between East
Coast and West Coast. And the East Coast ocean rates have actually increased about $250 on a spot basis over the last
call it couple of months, which basically is making the West Coast ports even more competitive than what they were
before the strikes.
So we think that there's some risk that there might be some nominal temporary re-routing just kind of as a supply chain
risk management approach. I think there are some surveys out there that says companies might move 5%, just as a
supply chain risk management. We're not really seeing that. And we still think the West Coast ports have an economic
and a time value for product going pretty deep into the east.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Okay. And thank you for the details. For a follow-up, Rob, maybe this is for you. Sort of just
looking at all the puts and takes. And in 2Q and looking forward, barring any other volume, unexpected volume shocks,
do you guys sort of view 2Q as sort of the low watermark for your margins?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Well there's a lot of moving parts. I would answer that by saying we're focused on making
that statement true. Of course we're going to go after, and we are making progress as we pointed out, the inefficiency
misalignment. But what we'll have to wait and see is exactly how the volumes play out. And all those variables and
what fuel does, et cetera. But I'd like to believe that that will – that statement will become true.

Our next question is from the line of Tom Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your questions.
<Q - Tom Kim>: Good morning. Thanks. With regard to domestic coal were you impacted at all by coal-fired utility
plant retirements in the second quarter? And then also if nat gases remain stable, would you expect like any further coal
to gas switching for the second half of the year?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: There's no impact from coal plant retirements. There's still significant surplus capacity of both
coal and either in other sources, so there was no impact on the retirement. We do not expect significant incremental
switching. I think all that can switch is switching given kind of current natural gas pricing.
<Q - Tom Kim>: Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the Intermodal yields, can you talk about what drove the
sequential Q-on-Q and then year-on-year deterioration in your average Intermodal ARPUs?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Our Intermodal ARC.
<Q - Tom Kim>: ARC. Yeah.
<A - Eric L. Butler>: As for all of our businesses in the second quarter, the ARC was really dominated by the fuel
surcharge reduction.
<A - Robert M. Knight>: That and I would say, Tom, and mix. Mix within each commodity group can also show up
in there. But there was nothing else. There was nothing – no other kind of marquee driver of that change.
<Q - Tom Kim>: Okay. So no like change of length in haul or anything like that? Just mostly just the surcharge?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Right.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Yeah.

Our next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Justin Long>: Thanks and good morning.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Morning.
<Q - Justin Long>: With your coal volumes down substantially right now, I was curious does that change your
approach to pricing in your non-coal businesses? In other words do you have the thought process that non-coal pricing
now needs to move higher to maintain the return profile of the consolidated business? Or do you view the pricing
dynamics between coal and non-coal completely separately?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Justin, I'm going to let Eric answer in more detail. But our team prices every single move on
the value of that move to the customer. Eric?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Nothing else. That's it.
<Q - Justin Long>: Okay. Fair enough. And as a follow-up, as we look into next year, if coal does continue to weaken
and you're losing that high margin business, how are you thinking about where CapEx as a percentage of revenue needs
to go in order to maintain or improve the current return profile of the business?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Go ahead, Rob.
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah. Justin, this is Rob. As you know the long-term guidance that we've given on our
capital spending is in that 16% to 17% of revenue. And we're not calling for again the falloff or the significant further
declination in coal.
But if it did we would – as we always do with our costs – we would right size. So I would also just point out – now
your question reminds me – that given what we're seeing this year, we expect that metric of capital spending versus
revenue to be a little bit higher this year, given what we're seeing in this fall off.
But if you look longer term we would right size the organization both from an OE and from a capital stand point. But
that's not the guidance I'm giving, because that's not where we are at this point in time. But we would take those steps.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Yeah. Something else to keep in mind, Justin, is we've got plenty of capital capacity already
built for the coal network. So it's not really driving CapEx today.
<Q - Justin Long>: Thanks. That's a good point. And I appreciate the time today guys.

Our next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Buckingham Research Group. Please go ahead with your
questions.
<Q - Jeff A. Kauffman>: Okay. Thank you very much. A lot of my questions have been asked. But let me come back
to the capital question. Just given the realignment of resources, how are your capital priorities changing, ex PTC?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: So ex PTC we do our capital planning in a similar fashion year after year after year. We take a
long-term view of what we think markets are going to look like. We see how that lays in the existing network. We find
where the hot spots exist from the standpoint of line of road constraint or terminal constraint. And then we target
capital on that.
There is a little bit of capital that gets spent on things like a specific project or a specific piece of business development.
And then of course there is a very large piece of capital that gets spent on consuming the existing network and
maintaining it. And of course that's driven by volumes and consumption. And so, Cameron, is there – what else you
want to add to that?

<A - Cameron A. Scott>: No. I think you covered it all, Lance. Our focus continues to be on the Southern region with
a lot of our capacity CapEx. And that's being driven by Eric's forecast.
<Q - Jeff A. Kauffman>: All right. And then a follow-up to that, unusual outage in the I-10 freight corridor with the
rains in Southern California. Is this an opportunity for the Intermodal franchise? As this is forcing a lot of trucking
capacity from L.A. to Phoenix to find alternatives?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Eric?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: That is one of our franchise corridors as you know. It has been. We've invested in that corridor
over time. We are growing. We'll continue to grow.
The temporary flooding that's happening out there because of the rains – as you know trucks always have lots of ways
to reroute. So there would be no significant incremental impact due to that. That is an area and a market that we're
going after with our franchise. We have and we will continue.

Our next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please go ahead with your questions.
<Q - Cherilyn Radbourne>: Thanks very much and good morning.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Morning.
<Q - Cherilyn Radbourne>: Most of my questions have been asked. But I was just curious in terms of the resource
imbalance, can you just give a bit of color as to how much of that is head count and how much is locomotives and other
equipment?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Yeah, so we are balancing locomotives real time to match the transportation plan, which
matches what demand is telling us. So locomotives from a storage count are very close to being about the right size.
And right now we have something like 900 locomotives in storage.
The head count issue, again, is a little bit part capital, which is all about whatever our capital plan is, and part we have
too many in the training pipeline and too many coming out of the training pipeline.
That furlough count, which I think we said was about 1,200 at the end of the quarter, depending on what happens with
attrition and demand, that'll continue to ebb and flow. Right now it's growing. And so we can make the fungible side of
head count, the individuals that are actually working and productive, match real time. It's the mechanism to get
qualified, trained employees that are taking us a little bit more time to get right.

number of mostly privately held IMCs that you all are putting in some pretty aggressive price actions also that would in
theory still maintain that cost advantage vis-a-vis truckload. But the pricing is sort of obscured by that fuel surcharge
that Eric talked about a minute ago, which depresses the ARC.
Can you talk a little bit about whether this is one of your strong initiatives on pricing and whether you're really getting
a lot of follow through with that or pushback from customers? And whether that has moved the profitability of
Intermodal so that it is on a par with the other commodity groups?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: No customer ever wants to take a price increase. They're always very tough discussions. We are
taking market price increases across our book of business, every segment of our business, based on our value
proposition. And we're going to continue to do that.
<Q - John G. Larkin>: Are the price increases in the vicinity of what the truckload carriers are getting, or are you not
going to share that with us?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: We reported the 4% core price increase and we're focused on getting appropriate price increases
across.
<A - Robert M. Knight>: I'll just add, I mean, you know we don't break it out by individual commodity group.
<Q - John G. Larkin>: Right.
<A - Robert M. Knight>: But as Eric and the team, they are laser focused on improving the profitability in the
Intermodal group, as they are across the board. And we're going to continue to do that.
<Q - John G. Larkin>: Okay. As a follow-on, can we talk a little bit about Intermodal service, which had a lot of
hiccups in 2014 due to weather, congestion in Chicago, growth in the energy markets, the new energy markets at least.
How is intermodal service tracking this year and when would you expect it to be back at, say, 2012 or early 2013
levels? And then once it reaches that level, do you think there's some latent demand out there that'll come back on to
the railroad, once you have more of a truckload-like service product?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Cameron?
<A - Cameron A. Scott>: Our first OS, that's our on-time origin departure for our Intermodal product, continues to
increase. We're not quite back to 2013 or 2012 levels, but we're making very good progress, particularly in Los Angeles
and in Chicago.
Over the road performance, we're still looking, as you can tell by our AAR velocity metric, we're still looking for a
mile an hour. We're properly resourced. We've got great initiatives to go find that mile an hour and deliver it. We just
don't have a stake in the ground as to when that will be achieved. But we expect to make that improvement throughout
the course of the year.
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Hey, John. This is Eric. I would say our goal is to be the best. And so we're clearly not satisfied
with where our service is. And we're going to focus. Cam and his team, my team, we're working on how do we improve
the overall customer experience and it's an intense focus. And I think as we go into the future, our goal is continuous
improvement to improve what we take to the market.

help during the quarter as we've seen at other railroads as everyone struggled with the lower volume environment and
stock prices which have declined? And if not, when might we expect, in light of the guidance for the lack of earnings
growth this year, that that might flow through and help the comp line? I just want to make sure we avoid some of the
lumpiness we've seen at other railroads.
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah, Matt. This is Rob. I would say that it's a little bit in the second quarter. I'm not calling
out or guiding that you're going to see anything lumpy in our numbers, but I would say there was a little bit of an
impact that showed up actually in our second quarter.
<Q - Matt Troy>: And second piece would be to revisit it during the fourth quarter? Is that typically how it runs, or is
it as we go?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Well, yes. I mean we always look at that – each quarter we look at what is the performance.
So we'll stay tuned in terms of what impact that has in the back half. But I don't envision it being lumpy as you're
citing.
<Q - Matt Troy>: Okay. Thank you for that, Rob. Follow-up would be just in light of the $0.01 rally in natural gas
today, could you just refresh us in terms of the switching friction or switching capability of your utility customers,
obviously there's not a singular point or price in nat gas of, say, $3.50 where everyone just cuts back. It's more gradated
than that.
Just wondering if we kind of buck the consensus that gas is going to stay low and envision or dream that one day gas
prices might start to march north. And could you just help us understand what is the band at which people begin to
contemplate going back to coal and where coal might take some share back in the grid relative to your customer base?
Thanks.
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah, Matt, as you say, it's a wide continuum. There are probably utilities that coal looks
favorable as low as $3, some $3.50, some $4. It's a wide continuum.

Our next question is from the line of Cleo Zagrean with Macquarie. Please go ahead with your questions.
<Q - Cleo Zagrean>: Good morning and thank you. I will follow up on prior questions. In terms of pricing for coal
and Intermodal, could you help us explain if maybe fuel is a bigger headwind, such that overall in terms of coal price
performance was close to the average of 4% for the company? Any insight you could help us with there, greatly
appreciate it.
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah, Cleo, this is Rob. Let me just again reiterate that we don't break it out, what pricing
we're actually getting within each commodity group.
But I would just point out that, to your point on the impact that fuel might have had, we have some 60-plus different
fuel surcharge mechanisms. So they do vary from group to group and the timing of those can be different and can
impact from quarter to quarter what the reported ARC number looks at.
But, again, our overall pricing success was 4% core price and we are confident that we're doing all the right things in
all of the commodity groups to improve that.
<Q - Cleo Zagrean>: Okay. And then my follow-up relates to the outlook for coal and your network longer term. You
were saying that it's tough to adjust the network from one quarter to the next. Understandably so. But are you seeing
any significant challenges to coal volumes from upcoming gas capacities in 2017, 2018?
And since you would have time to prepare for that, how can you adjust the network to mitigate that potential negative
impact? And you're saying also the diversity of the franchise allows for your long-term goals to be maintained. What

and weather. Today, there's surplus capacity in coal, there's surplus capacity on natural gas today, so the capacity isn't
really as much of a driver as it is kind of the point at which one dispatches versus another. It's different for different
utilities. Again, I think $3 to $4 depending on utilities, is probably a range that most utilities see today.
<Q - Cleo Zagrean>: Okay. So you are not seeing the need to significantly adjust resources longer term on account of
what you see in coal?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Cleo, we are adjusting our resources constantly to match both what near-term demand looks
like and what we think long-term demand looks like and we'll make those adjustments as the marketplace dictates.
<Q - Cleo Zagrean>: I appreciate it. Thank you.

Our next question is from the line of Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Ben J. Hartford>: Thanks. Quick question, Eric. If I look within industrial products and the 35% of the volume
that is construction, what's the split between res and non-res construction within that, do you know?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah, so I don't have it in terms of the overall construction number. If you want to just split out
lumber, historically lumber was kind of two-thirds, one-third. Right now it's probably closer to half to half.
But again housing starts are improving sequentially. The housing start number for June just came up. That was
significantly improved. I think 10% improved over the previous month. They're still more multi-family than
single-family, but the split here recently has probably been more 60/40 versus 65/35 or 55/45.
<Q - Ben J. Hartford>: So if I look at the 5% volume contraction within construction, can you help me rectify that in
the context of some of the improvement that we have seen, as it relates to housing starts recently?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah. As I said in my prepared comments the majority of that was kind of in our rock and our
cement, most of which goes on the commercial side. And that was really weather related. The demand is really, really
strong. And we're seeing that sequentially here, even in the recent weeks. The second quarter there were some heavy
rains that kind of impacted the volumes that we saw.
<Q - Ben J. Hartford>: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks.

Our next question is from the line of John Barnes with RBC. Please go ahead with your questions.
<Q - John Barnes>: Hey. Thank you guys. Hey on the resource side is there anything in the labor contracts that
prevent you from right-sizing the labor force faster or more aggressively than what you've done already? And are there
any prohibitions about shifting that labor around to spots to where it might be in more need?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: So I'm going to start, and then I'll pass it to Cam. The short answer is not really. Our collective
bargaining agreements dictate things like rates of pay, what exactly the work needs to look like, some work
environment issues. Typically doesn't have much headwind to us when it comes to right-sizing.
When we talk about again having the training pipeline fatter if you will than it was second quarter last year, that's about
us making decisions about continuing to train, because we will graduate them into work either immediately or in the
near term. And it would be just more disruptive and more costly to take them out of training and then start over again

from scratch two [months] or three [months] or four months from now. Cam?
<A - Cameron A. Scott>: Lance, I think you answered that perfectly. And there is great flexibility to answer your
second question on flexing appropriate resources to the network as required. So no issue there.
<Q - John Barnes>: Okay. All right. That's good color. And then to go back to the Intermodal question earlier. If I go
back to my notes on your last analyst meeting, you were already talking about the potential for a couple of more
percentage points of market share movement from the West Coast to the East Coast.
And I understand what you're saying about ocean shipping rates and that kind of thing. But the ILA is already out
talking about doing a 10-year labor deal in order to provide labor certainty to the East Coast ports. Where the West
Coast labor contract is a year shorter, still leaves some very large issues like the Cadillac Tax out there left kind of
unnegotiated as of yet.
Is there any concern that the severity of the downturn this last time has more permanently impaired the West Coast
ability to attract that volume back? And is some of that volume shift we've more permanent than maybe you had
originally expected it to be?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah. So it's always a concern. It's in our franchise interest to have the proportion of business go
through the West Coast. So that's always something we look at.
At the end of the day we do believe economics win out. And today, and we believe in the future – unless there's some
substantial change, difference between the East Coast, West Coast – today the West Coast option is the economically
better option to go deep and to the east. We've historically said that the Appalachian Mountain chain was kind of a
cross-over point. Things west of that typically it's clear the West Coast is a better economic option. Things east of that
the East Coast is a better competitor.
So we'll always look at that. We do not believe anything substantial or significant has changed economically from the
historical equation. There may be some minor adjustments for supply chain risk management issues in the short term,
but we're not seeing anything significant or sustainable.
<Q - John Barnes>: Okay. All right. And just a follow-up on that. If there's any pressure on your international
Intermodal volumes, are you in a position to more aggressively grow the domestic Intermodal piece as a means of
offsetting any of that weakness? And thanks for your time guys.
<A - Eric L. Butler>: So I'm not sure I would connect the two. The domestic market is where we have been growing. I
mean if you look at it, the international market has had a much smaller slope. The domestic market shares huge truck
conversion.
You're still going to have a huge investment needed for highways. You could talk about we're not really investing in the
Highway Trust Fund, even tough to get an agreement. You could talk about the driver shortages. You could talk about
the economic and the environmental benefit of Intermodal versus over-the-road trucks.
I mean it's a story that we've been talking about for the last half-dozen years. We still think that there's a growth
opportunity story there on the domestic Intermodal side. And again the second quarter was an all-time record for us on
the domestic Intermodal side. We think that on a volume basis, we think that there's still opportunities.
<Q - John Barnes>: Okay. Thanks for your time.
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Thank you.

<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: I'd like to ask about a sector I believe there's a little more cause for optimism. And
chemicals are a material high-ARC segment in the franchise. Excluding crude I think some classes of chemical car
loads grew nicely, maybe even double digits in the period.
So low natural gas hurts coal. But could you just focus a little further out and comment on the flip side of cheap natural
gas? And share some of your expectations for chemical product manufacturing development?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah. We talked in the past and continue to talk about the huge plastic expansion that we're
going to see in this country with the low natural gas prices. We think that you're going to see it even with natural gas
going up to as much as $5, $4.50, $5. We think that's still a sweet spot for the expansion that's happening in the Gulf.
We have a great franchise. It's a franchise strength of ours, take advantage of it. There's a billion – multibillion dollars
of investments going on. And we think – I think we've said publicly that we think we'll see the benefit of a lot of that
starting in 2017 and 2018. But we think that that's a franchise strength of ours.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: And then I'd like to ask a question about operations. On the subject of right-sizing the
locomotive fleet could you discuss how you think about the value of removing one locomotive from the fleet? Are most
of these removed assets going into surge capacity storage, rather than being sold or divested? Or do they show up in
lower lease expense? So just the value of removing a single locomotive please?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Cam?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: This is Rob. Let me jump in on – and if Cam wants to add he certainly can.
Keith, I mean I'm not going to break that out. But I would just say that of course when we get a new locomotive. And
we have an opportunity to put another locomotive in storage or just through efficient operations we have an opportunity
to put a unit in storage, we're putting the least efficient of the fleet in. And we're always looking at are there
opportunities?
I mean for the most part those go into our storage. And they're there for – available for surge. Where there are
opportunities for us to discontinue an existing lease or something, we'll do that. But that's not a big driver at this point
in time.
So I think it's safe to assume that as we free up a locomotive, it's going to be our least efficient from a fuel standpoint,
from a maintenance standpoint, and from a DPU standpoint, that goes into that surge category.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: And there's an aggregate benefit. The fewer locomotives we have active in the fleet, the less
maintenance we have to do in aggregate.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Thank you.
