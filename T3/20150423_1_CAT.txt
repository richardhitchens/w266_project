MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter 2015 Results Conference Call. [Operator
Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mike DeWalt. Sir, the floor is yours.
Michael Lynn DeWalt
Thank you very much, Dana, and good morning and welcome everyone to our first quarter earnings call. I'm Mike
DeWalt, Caterpillar's Vice President of Finance Services. And on the call today, I'm pleased to have our Chairman and
CEO, Doug Oberhelman and our Group President and CFO, Brad Halverson. Remember, this call is copyrighted by
Caterpillar, Inc., and any use, recording or transmission of any portion of the call without the expressed written consent
of Caterpillar is strictly prohibited. If you'd like a copy of today's call transcript, we'll be posting it in the Investor
section of our caterpillar.com website. It will be in the section labeled Results Webcasts.
This morning we'll be discussing forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties and assumptions
that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward looking information. A discussion of some of
the factors that either individually or in the aggregate could make actual results differ materially from our projections,
that can be found in our cautionary statements under item 1a, Risk Factors, of our Form 10-K filed with the SEC in
February of 2015, and it's also in our forward looking statements language in today's financial release. In addition,
there's a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that can also be found in this morning's release. And again, it's posted at
caterpillar.com.
Okay with that, let's get started. This morning, we'll be reviewing financial results for the first quarter and our revised
outlook for 2015. And then there are about three points that I would like to start with actually before we get into the

details. And the first is that from a macro standpoint, in our view, not much has changed since our last earnings
conference call in January. So we're staying pretty focused on the things that we do have some control of, and that's
execution and operational improvement, you know, things like safety, quality, market share, efficiency, cost control,
inventory turns and cash flow, and we continue to make progress.
And that brings me to my second point. Given the environment we're in, we were pleased with our first quarter results.
Sales in the quarter were pretty close to what we expected, and we were pleased with the bottom line.
And that brings me to my third point. And that's reminder of what we said in our year-end conference call back in
January. We said that we expected the year to start out stronger than it would end, and that's still what we expect. And
that's probably evident to you if you consider our first quarter actual results and what we're expecting for the first year.
Okay, with those three points, let's get into the quarter. Sales and revenues were $12.7 billion, and that was about 4%
less than the $13.2 billion that we had in the first quarter last year. $342 million of that decline in sales was a result of
the stronger dollar, and sales volume was unfavorable $295 million. Those two items were partially offset by a small
improvement in price realization. That was $105 million, definitely in the right direction, but less than 1%.
Now the only region in the world that was up was North America, and that was up 9%. The North American
improvement was pretty much across the board, with each of our segments being in positive territory. Outside of North
America, that wasn't the case, and sales in each of our segments were down in Latin America, Europe/Africa/Middle
East, and in the Asia-Pacific region. In total, sales and revenues were off 18% in Latin America and sales of all of our
equipment segments, that's Resource Industries, Construction Industries and Energy & Transportation were down
double digits.
Construction was off 23% and a sizable portion of that was the absence of a large order from the Brazilian government
that we had in the first quarter last year, and weaker construction activity in general in the region, particularly Brazil.
Resource Industries was also down 23% in Latin America, reflecting continuing weakness in mining, and that's pretty
much the case in every region. And Energy & Transportation was down 11%.
Sales and revenues in the Europe/Africa/Middle East region were down 12%. Construction Industries was off 14%, and
most of that was from less favorable dealer inventory changes and the impact of currency on our sales. Resource
Industries was also off 14%, again weak mining and Energy & Transportation was down 8%.
Sales and revenues in Asia-Pacific were down 13% with the most significant decline in Construction Industries at 21%.
Construction Industries were down substantially in China and lower in Japan as a result of the stronger dollar versus the
yen. Our sales in Japan, which are in yen, essentially translated into fewer dollars. Okay, that's a recap of sales.
Profit per share though was higher in the first quarter than it was in the first quarter a year ago. This year, it was $1.81
per share. A year ago in the first quarter, it was $1.44 a share. Now we had restructuring costs in both quarters. In the
first quarter of last year, we had $0.17 per share of restructuring costs, and that was mostly from the actions that we
took in our European operations. This year, we had $0.05 per share of restructuring costs in the first quarter. So
excluding restructuring, profit per share improved from $1.61 a year ago to $1.86 in the current quarter, in the first
quarter.
Now the primary reasons that profit per share was up, number one was the $120 million gain that we had from the sale
of our remaining ownership in what was our third-party logistics business. We also had, as I mentioned a minute ago,
$105 million of positive price realization, and we had $77 million of favorable currency impacts that helped operating
profit.
Now I'm just going to stop there for a minute and chat about currency. It's a subject that for us seems to be frequently
misunderstood, and I'd just like to clarify things again. We do have substantial sales that are in currencies other than the
US dollar. And where the dollar strengthens, that causes those sales to translate into fewer dollars, and that's a negative
for our top line. That said, we also have substantial manufacturing operations and we source substantial purchase
material outside the US. So a lot of factories outside the U.S., a lot of sourcing outside the U.S. And that results in
lower costs when translated to US dollars.

And that's exactly what happened this quarter. Sales translated into fewer dollars, as I mentioned a little bit ago, $342
million fewer. However, the impact on costs was favorable $419 million. And the net to operating profit was positive
$77 million. While we're not 100% exactly balanced in our currency exposures, we do have reasonably offsetting sales
and cost positions that usually keep the profit impact of exchange rate swings to a reasonably manageable level. Okay,
that's the story on currency.
I'll kind of get back to profit now. I'd already talked about the positive items and offsetting those positives for the
quarter, we did have lower sales volume, and that was negative to our operating profit about $83 million. And we had
higher costs. The most significant cost factor was a change in the timing of expense related to the vesting of
stock-based compensation. The timing change won't have an impact on the full year versus 2014, but it did add to costs
in the first quarter. Okay, that's a quick run through of profit versus the first quarter last year.
Let's turn to the balance sheet and cash flow. Machinery and Energy & Transportation operating cash flow was a little
over $1 billion in the quarter, but that was about $800 million lower than the first quarter last year. And most of that
decline came from higher incentive compensation payments in the first quarter of this year, and they are based on
performance in 2014.
We used about $400 million of cash in the quarter to repurchase shares, and with relatively modest needs for CapEx
this year, we currently expect to continue to repurchase shares in 2015. And as you might expect, the timing and the
amount that we ultimately repurchase, well, that will be subject to business and market conditions as we progress
through the year and on our cash deployment priorities. Our balance sheet remains strong with a debt to total capital
ratio of 37.1%, and that's about right in the middle of our targeted 30% to 45% range. And it was slightly favorable
versus year-end 2014. If you net cash with the debt, our net debt to capital ratio at the end of the quarter was 18.3%.
Now before we get into the revised outlook, I'll just recap changes in the order backlog over the last quarter, because I
suspect many of you are interested in that. We ended the first quarter with an order backlog of $16.5 billion, and that's
about $800 million lower than year-end 2014. The decline was split between Construction Industries and Resource
Industries. You might have expected that Energy & Transportation would have also declined from year-end as a result
of weakness in the oil industry. It was in total, however, about flat. We did have a decline in the backlog because of
weakness in oil, but that was about offset by an increase in the backlog for locomotives.
Okay with that, let me go through the 2015 outlook. As I started out, in terms of overall world economic growth, we
don't expect much change from the outlook that we provided with our year-end results in January. And the same goes
for our sales and revenues. We're holding it at about $50 billion for 2015. Now while we're not changing the sales
outlook, just as a reminder, we do expect 2015 to be over $5 billion lower than 2014.
And as we said last January, and I'll reiterate today, the impact of substantially lower oil prices is the most significant
reason for the decline. And we still think the most significant impact from oil will be from engines and other equipment
that we sell for drilling and well servicing. And that's the spot where we expect a large drop in demand this year. We've
already started to see the impact of that in our order backlog as new orders have not kept pace with sales and the
backlog has declined. And we'll start seeing that hit sales over the course of 2015.
We also expect that indirect effects from substantially lower oil prices will be negative in 2015 versus 2014. In
countries and in some regions of the U.S. where oil production is significant for either government receipts or for the
local economies, it will likely be negative for sales of construction equipment and for our electric power generation
business. In some cases, it can be fairly direct, like building a road to service a new well, or it can be very indirect, like
construction spending in a country where the government relies on oil revenue to fund spending. Because many of
those construction-related impacts are indirect, it does make it tough to measure, but anecdotally, we believe we're
already starting to see the impacts of that in our construction business.
Now in addition to oil, there are several other factors that are contributing to the year-over-year decline in sales. The
stronger dollar is a headwind to sales, but again not profit. Commodity prices in mining are generally weak, particularly
iron ore and coal, and that's negative for mining in our Resource Industries segment. With weaknesses in agriculture,
we're expecting lower sales of industrial engines, and we expect our rail business to be down in 2015 after a great year

in 2014. And we expect weakness in the construction industries of key developing countries, like China and Brazil, and
that was certainly evident in our first quarter.
So that's a recap of our year-over-year changes, down from 2014, but no change in the top line outlook for 2015. We
did raise the profit outlook again this morning. Our previous outlook was $4.60 per share all-in and $4.75 excluding
restructuring costs. This morning, we raised the profit outlook to $4.70 per share all in and $5 per share excluding
restructuring costs.
Now the changes from the previous outlook include more restructuring activity. We've increased our restructuring cost
estimate from about $150 million expected for this year up $100 million to about $250 million, with almost all of the
increase related to facilities that produce mining products. We added the $120 million gain in the first quarter on the
sale of our remaining ownership in the third-party logistics business. That wasn't in our previous outlook. And based on
our first quarter actual results, we made some additional improvements to the profit outlook.
While we held the top line and made a modest improvement to the bottom line of our outlook, 2015 is still shaping up
to be an uncertain and challenging year. There continues to be softness in Latin America, particularly Brazil. China
growth is concerning. The stability and scale of economic recovery in the United States remains concerning. Europe is
still a question mark. Mining hasn't shown improvement yet, and while we're still planning a sharp decline in our oil
related sales in 2015, there is still a concern around that.
So to wrap up and move on to the Q&A portion of the call, sales and revenues in the first quarter were about as we
expected, and we had a solid profit quarter. We repurchased $400 million of shares in the quarter. The balance sheet
remains strong, and we're very focused on operational performance and cost control. But it still looks like a tough year,
and we have not seen meaningful signs of recovery in many of our cyclical businesses.
So with that, we're ready to move on to the Q&A portion of the call.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. [Operator Instructions] Please hold while we poll for questions. And I am showing
our first question is coming from Ted Grace. Sir, your line is live.
<Q - Ted Grace>: Hey, guys. Congratulations on the quarter.
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Thank you.
<Q - Ted Grace>: Two questions on guidance, the first on revenue. Mike, I know you said you're reaffirming at $50
billion. Last quarter, you walked through expectations for Construction Industries and Resource Industries and E&T. I
was just wondering if you're reaffirming each of those or have there been any tweaks across the business segments at
the revenue level?
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Yes. No, I would say by and large, it looks pretty close to what we said at the end of the
year.
<Q - Ted Grace>: Okay. That's helpful. And then the related question would be on the EPS side, you raised guidance
$0.25. I know you mentioned $0.14 is from Cat Logistics. I was just wondering if you could walk through the other
puts and takes. It looked like incentive comp would have been about a $0.05 tailwind if I read it correctly.
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Your know, I would say that's our fault. We rounded to the nearest $100 million last
time, and we rounded to the nearest $10 million this time. There was by and large little change in our forecast for
incentive comp. We did raise guidance $0.25, and you would normally think that would add to incentive comp, but
most of the add was for the gain that we had on the sale of the Logistics business, and our comp is based on OPACC,
operating profit after a capital charge. And that gain was below operating profit, so it's really not having any impact on

the incentive comp.
<Q - Ted Grace>: Okay. Was there any incremental benefit from restructuring that you'd realized in 2015 that was not
previously anticipated?
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: I would say not that was not previously anticipated. I mean, we did expect benefits
from restructuring to be better this year. So no, I wouldn't say we added anything for that. Now we did add to
restructuring costs and down the road, after those are complete, those should definitely lead to more benefits, but
actually in the short term there are related costs for things like rearrangement that aren't included in the number that can
tend to be a little bit negative around the time you're actually doing it.
So I'd say on balance, that is relative to our original outlook not a big reason for change. We took the profit outlook up
mostly because of very good cost control in the first quarter. I know we don't give quarterly guidance, but we were a
little better than we thought we were going to be in the quarter, and some of that of course was timing, but some of it is
spending that we don't think we'll have to make as the year goes on.
<Q - Ted Grace>: Okay. And FX, was that any dynamic in the revision?
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: No, not much. In fact, we didn't really change our outlook for currency. We did do a
spot check on the impact on profit of recent changes, and it was pretty neutral. So we'll take another look at that at
mid-year and see if there's any changes needed for that.
<Q - Ted Grace>: Great. Thanks a lot, and best of luck this quarter, guys.
<A - Douglas R. Oberhelman>: Thanks, Tim.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jerry Revich. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.
<Q - Jerry David Revich>: Good morning, it's Goldman Sachs. I'm wondering if you could talk about what was just
the magnitude of material cost benefit that you realized this quarter, and I know you're working hard with the supply
chain. Just help us understand how we should think about the puts and takes over the balance of the year for material
costs with volumes coming down but commodity costs that should be, let's say, lower sequentially. Can you maybe
give us some more color there?
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Yes actually, material cost control has been, it's been a real positive actually, not just in
the first quarter, but over the past few years. The team has done a great job. That's a combination of the purchasing
group and the design group in terms of designing for cost reduction, so it's been pretty good. It was a decent positive
again the first quarter. If memory serves me, it was in the neighborhood of 1.5%. Now to the extent that we buy things
in non-US currencies, we wouldn't be including it in that kind of number. We isolate the impact of currency on our
expenses separately, at least for those that are denominated in foreign currencies.
<Q - Jerry David Revich>: Okay. And Mike, my follow-up on the dealer inventory side, how should we think about
inventory levels over the balance of the year and out of the inventory build that we saw in the quarter, is it in the right
regions? Is it in areas that you folks want?
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Yes, I mean we did have an inventory build the first quarter, and we didn't talk a lot
about that in the release, and partly because I think sometimes it gets taken out of context. We expect an inventory
build in the first quarter. The selling season from dealers to end customers tends to be heavier in the summertime, and
so dealers add to inventories ahead of summertime. That occurred this year in construction industries.
We have order of magnitude 180 million dealers, or not million, 180 dealers roughly around the world, and at any
given point in time, you've got some of them that probably have a little too much and some that have probably a little
too little. If we look at our months of supply on hand, we kind of try to judge that in a reasonable range, and we do look

at that by region. And by and large, I think our dealer inventory we would say is in a reasonable range. Now from here,
we definitely believe it'll come down over the course of the year. That happened last year. That's kind of normal to have
a build in the first quarter and then have dealers sell that down as we go through the year.
<Q - Jerry David Revich>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from Seth Weber. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.
<Q - Seth R. Weber>: Hey. Good morning. It's RBC. I wanted ask about the Resource Industries segment. The margin
there in the first quarter actually went up sequentially even though revenue was down. I mean, do you feel like the
margin has bottomed in that business at this point?
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: No, I wouldn't say that, Seth. I think if you look at it sequentially, you always have to
consider that we have some reasonable seasonality between the first quarter and the fourth quarter or fourth quarter to
first quarter in discretionary costs. So fourth quarter was a pretty heavy quarter; first quarter was a pretty light quarter
in terms of spending. So I think that has a lot to do with the sequential improvement. Now I think Resource Industries
margins will likely come down as the year progresses. We kind of said before we thought something around breakeven
was probably reasonable. I think that we're going to add spending over the course of the year. We've got some R&D
programs that we need to do there. We talked about that in January. So my guess is coming off of a pretty light quarter
for costs and some increase in engineering as the year goes by, and probably not a lot of change in the top line. Margin
will probably moderate from where it's at.
<Q - Seth R. Weber>: So just to be clear, to get to a breakeven kind of number, would you go negative in a given
quarter for the year?
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Once you get around breakeven, the numbers are so small that $10 million or $15
million one way or the other could cause that. I mean, if we were positive in the first quarter, we're thinking breakeven
for the year. If it slipped a little below that at a quarter during the year, that wouldn't be surprising.
<Q - Seth R. Weber>: Okay. Thank you. And if I could just ask a follow-up on the aftermarket business for Resource
was down, revenue is down. Is there any kind of light at the end of the tunnel there? What do you think needs to happen
there for the aftermarket business to get better on mining?
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Yes, that's a very good question. We've been asking ourselves that. We've got
customers with some parked equipment. We think again, there's been some cannibalizing of equipment in the field.
We're looking. I think customers are pushing out rebuild times. In our view, that can't keep happening, but it has been
happening. So when that turns around, it's like the industry overall. It's a little bit hard to predict the timing, but we
understand where both parts sales and equipment sales are to what's, at least for equipment, a reasonable replacement
level. It's far below that. But when that's going to turn around, it's hard to say.
<Q - Seth R. Weber>: Fair enough. Okay. Thank you very much, guys.

<Q - Eli S. Lustgarten>: It's a nice quarter. We're all impressed. We talked a little bit about the breakeven in Resource
now. Can you talk to us about what we should expect profitability wise, which were very impressive in both the
Construction and in E&T, particularly we know environment is going to drop in E&T, but you did north of $0.15 on the
16% in Construction and over 20% in E&T. And while we expect it to come down, in order to hold the guidance where
you are, I mean these numbers had to come down quite a bit. Can you give us some idea of what we should expect and
do we think, does Construction go below double-digit operating margin for the year? But what happens as the year
unfolds and the business weakens?
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Yes, so I think, and this really goes kind of across the company. I will touch on several
of the segments, but we expect that the first quarter was kind of seasonally low on costs, so just as a matter of course,
discretionary costs will go up a bit from the first quarter level. We do plan to spend some more on R&D, and we talked
about that last January.
We're looking at negative mix. We'll have negative product mix in E&T because of the decline in the oil business that's
coming. We also expect some negative mix in construction industries. If you look at what they sold in the first quarter,
it was relatively balanced between we have three pieces of construction, earthmoving, excavation, and building
construction products, or BCP, our smaller equipment. So what we actually sold in the quarter, at least in terms of new
equipment, was fairly balanced between those three subsectors. But if you look at what was ordered and what we think
is going to happen for sales as the year unfolds, probably not a lot of change in total for construction, but a bit more of
a shift to BCP, smaller machines.
I think part of that is in countries like China where the selling season is very early in the year, that helps excavation
sales and then that tails down later in the year. So we're looking at some negative mix in construction as the year goes
on. I don't think for the year, we're not at least in our contemplated in our outlook, we're not going to fall below double
digits for construction. E&T operating profit percent will I think for sure come down, or I don't know, I guess I can't
say for sure. We would expect it would come down. And mostly because of declines in the oil business, which tends to
be bigger, a little bit higher-margin product.
<Q - Eli S. Lustgarten>: And can you, a follow up, can we talk a little bit about what's going on in pricing across the
businesses? I mean, you did signal out that one of the problems in the Resource business was basically pricing more
than anything else. So what's going on in the other two sectors pricing-wise? Are things relatively holding or is there
some more price competition showing up?
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: That's a good question and it's interesting. When the numbers get this small, sometimes
we end up talking too much about numbers that are relatively small. I mean, we had for the company overall $105
million of price realization. That's less than 1%. I think the segments that are doing better right now, Construction and
Energy & Transportation, Construction, in particular, did a little bit better. But part of that is really from three things.
One is we had last year this big Brazilian order from the government, and while that was good volume, it was pretty
low price. So without that, sort of our average price level is up a bit. We had some favorable geographic mix, and we
did take list price increases, small but up, at the beginning of the year. So that all contributed a bit.
I think with Resource Industries, it's been down year-over-year for the last, certainly the last couple of quarters. I can't
remember the third, but probably in the third last year as well. It's just a tough business right now. It's dog eat dog. And
although a lot of that product that we sell is dollar-based, the sales are conducted in dollars a lot in mining, some of our
key competition like Komatsu probably has more of a yen cost base than we do, and they're being aggressive. So it's a
tough industry.
<A - Douglas R. Oberhelman>: Yes, Eli, it's Doug Oberhelman here. Mike said dog eat dog. I would rather say it Cat
eats dog but be that as it may, we are seeing a very competitive marketplace right now. We did post up a little price
realization in the first quarter, which I was very happy to see, but I will tell you with a yen that's off over 50% in three
years, euro, Brazilian currency, pound currency off 20% to 30% in the last year, all of our competitors aren't in the U.S.
So it really is a competitive environment out there, but we are not giving up our PINS goals, our market share goals.
We're doing as well as we can be expected in a tough market that we are. Certainly our cost management the last
couple of years has helped that, our lean manufacturing where we generated cost advantage has helped, and we're still

Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ann Duignan. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Ann P. Duignan>: Hi, JPMorgan.
<A - Douglas R. Oberhelman>: Hi, Ann.
<Q - Ann P. Duignan>: My first question is really, I suppose it's to you, Doug. We talk about Europe and the euro
being weak and what that's doing to help the European manufacturers export. But are you seeing any signs of European
economies getting any better at all? Or is that something that you think might be on the up and come going into 2016?
<A - Douglas R. Oberhelman>: I think it's in our future. I said on the show this morning that it seems to me that with
the QE coming in by the ECB with a euro that's off, like I said, 25% or so in a year's time, with energy prices where
they are, the stimulus of all three of those and not to mention continuing lowered rates which has finally happened
across Europe, I liken the Eurozone an awful lot to the period of say 2010, 2011, and 2012 in the U.S. where there was
a lot of stimulus. We didn't see much growth, but we see better growth now, so I am convinced it's coming. I don't
know if it'll be, when it'll be, and I'm not going to predict that.
But we still see, and I was just with several of our European dealers, we still have the north/south divide. I think the
Germans would say they see some green shoots in that economy. We're not seeing it in our numbers, but they were a
bit more optimistic in Germany. Of course a euro at $1.07, $1.08 really benefits those exporters. So I think we're in the
early stages of what will be a recovery. I don't think it's going to be a boom, and I think it's going to be anemic growth,
probably looking a lot like what we've seen here. But it'll feel better when it happens for sure, Ann.
<Q - Ann P. Duignan>: I'm sure it will. And then just switching gears, my follow-up, we track the U.S. construction
industry shipments from census data, and those have been down about – orders are down about 27% in Q1. That's just
through February. Can you talk about what you're seeing out there on construction industry orders? Does that include
exports that might have weakened because of the strength of the dollar? Or what's going on out there in terms of
industry orders on the construction equipment side? Thanks.
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Yes, I haven't looked at it by region so much, but I know that for our construction
industry segment, if I look at orders in the first quarter, all I'd tell you is they're not down – they're down, I mean no
doubt about that. But our backlog was a little bit lower in the first quarter. But our orders were certainly not down
anywhere near that order of magnitude.
<Q - Ann P. Duignan>: Okay. And does that have anything to do with the fact that your dealers cannot cancel orders,
so we might be seeing some delivery we may have to have inventories corrected later in the year? Or have you changed
that policy? And then I'll leave it there, sorry.
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Yes, we actually work very closely with dealers to help them set sort of in combination
what an appropriate level of inventory for them is. I mean the last thing we want is a dealer ending up with too much. I
mean it never helps anybody if that's the case. So I don't think there's any, there's no, as far as I know, I can't see any
inventory problem sitting out there. If you were going back and looking two years ago, that was the case, but that's just
not the case now. I'm probably not looking at the same data that you're looking at on the 27%. All I can tell you is our
orders aren't down. Are you talking versus a year ago, Ann?
<Q - Ann P. Duignan>: Yes. It's the U.S. consensus data, or census data, excuse me.
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Yes.

Thank you. Our next question is coming from Steven Fisher. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Steven M. Fisher>: Great, thanks. It's UBS. Just a follow-up on that last question there. How did the 9% increase
in North American construction sales compare to your expectations? And I know you were earlier in the year looking
for North America to be up for the year. Is that still the case, and should we maybe now be prepared for some
year-over-year declines in North American construction as the year plays on?
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Yes, I think on balance in our outlook in January, and I kind of updated that a little bit
today, we expected construction sales to be down 5% to 10%. But then and now, the only region that's likely to be in
neutral to positive territory is North America. The first quarter was by and large about what we expected.
<Q - Steven M. Fisher>: Okay. So North American construction still expected to be up for the year in the context of
that down 5% to 10%.
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Yes, I would say the total is down 5%, 10%. The only region that's not really down is
North America, but the numbers are very small. I would say it's within the margin of error to be neutral to positive.
<Q - Steven M. Fisher>: Okay. And then can you just give us a sense of the pace of the bookings on the Solar
Turbines in the quarter and maybe how far out that backlog extends now for the business? Are you putting anything in
there for 2016 yet? Thanks.
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: The answer -
<A - Douglas R. Oberhelman>: I'll take that, Mike.
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Yes, go ahead.
<A - Douglas R. Oberhelman>: I just came back from Solar in San Diego two days ago and got a pretty good
briefing. I would say their forecast, which is rolled up into ours for 2015, is there's a pretty good line of sight to that.
They would not speculate and really don't know much beyond that into 2016 as yet. I would say around gas
compression of course, which is the big piece of Solar business, that has held up, and there's a lot of pipeline work
going on. There's a lot of pressure behind it that's required, and that's our turbine and compressor in most cases. So I'd
say, it's again a challenging environment, but for gas compression the rest of the year, they're pretty much I think going
to end up where we thought they would be and that's good. And we're not going to do anything about 2016 and even
speculate today. We will later in the year because things are evolving so quickly here that I don't know what it will be,
and we're concentrating on 2015. But Solar I think has got a year that we're pretty confident about that's baked into here
as well.

that's a potential more in the second half?
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: No, I think we've seen weaker, I'm going to use the US regions as the example here.
We've seen certainly a decline in orders in business there. We've actually even seen some decline in parts sales in those
regions. So yes, anecdotally I would tell you I think we are seeing the impact of lower oil prices in our Construction
business today.
<Q - Andrew M. Casey>: Okay, thanks Mike. And then if I could follow up on the pricing questions specific to
Construction, you gave a litany of things. Is it your sense that full year pricing may be more like flat coming off the
strong Q1 performance because you have more difficult comps related to Brazil construction, the shift to BCP, and then
what you described, the competitive marketplace?
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Yes, when we did our year-end release, we said that we expected price realization to be
favorable but less than about 0.5%. And by and large, I think that is still the case. I mean the first quarter was in
positive territory. I think we expect it in the year in positive territory, but pretty small numbers. By and large, if you
think around 0.5% plus or minus, you're probably in the ball park.

Thank you. Our next question is coming from Andrew Kaplowitz. Please announce your affiliation then pose your
question.
<Q - Andrew Kaplowitz>: It's Barclays. Good morning, guys. Nice quarter.
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Good morning, Andy.
<Q - Andrew Kaplowitz>: Mike, can you talk a little bit more about your backlog movements within the quarter? You
noted an improvement in locomotive backlog and in your segment commentary you talked about a large locomotive
project in Asia. So can you talk about what drove your locomotive backlog? Is that sort of the ending of the North
American locomotives or is that more international related growth?
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Okay. So the Asia comment around the quarter was locomotive shipments can be kind
of lumpy. We had a decent size order for multiple locomotives go out to a customer in Australia, so in the quarter. So
that was the kind of genesis of the Asia comment in the quarter. In terms of the backlog, we during the quarter took an
order from one of the North American railroads for new locomotives. And what the railroads do is they will place an
order, and it's usually for multiple years, and you'll produce portions of it kind of over the course of the contract. And
we had an order placed in the first quarter from a North American railroad.
<Q - Andrew Kaplowitz>: Got it. But it's a long-term contract when it comes down to it.
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Sure. Oh yes, absolutely.
<Q - Andrew Kaplowitz>: Okay. So just shifting gears, you increased your restructuring costs to $250 million, up
from $150 million with the increase primarily related to facilities that produce mining products. Can you talk about
your decision process when it comes to restructuring Resource Industries? You disclosed in your 10-K that you've got
36 mining related facilities as of the end of 2014. So how do you gauge when to take action regarding these facilities?
And can you talk about the payback period and benefits you expect in your recent actions?
<A - Bradley M. Halverson>: Yes.
<A - Douglas R. Oberhelman>: It's Doug here. Brad, just before you do that, I'd like to come back to that locomotive
order that Mike mentioned to one of the big six in North America. That was a Tier 4 order for our new emissions
locomotive which will be available in 2016. And there has been a lot of discussion around our Tier 4 readiness, and that
was a big order for us, and we'll start shipping that in 2016. While a long-term contract, it starts pretty quickly. As soon

as we have that technology ready, which as I say will be next year. Sorry, Brad.
<A - Bradley M. Halverson>: No, no, it's good. Hi, Andy. It's Brad. Let me talk a little bit about this. There's been a
lot of discussion about it, and we've been fairly active in terms of the studies that we do here. We'll go through a
process where we are cyclical. We've seen this before. On the one side, we want to be ready for the upturn. Our
business model is to produce quality products, lowest owner operating cost, produces parts and service for us and the
dealers and repeat business. And so on that side, given the fact that our sales can move fairly dramatically through the
cycles, we want to be ready to be able to meet that demand.
But on the other side, it's absolutely clear, and a good question, that this current economic environment presents a lot of
opportunity. So we've been at this since 2013. In fact if you kind of add up what we've done in the last three years
including what we've planned to do in 2015, we'll incur roughly $900 million of restructuring cost. We've closed or
downsized roughly 20 facilities, about 5 million of square feet during that period again through 2015 and about 15,000
employees, which is unfortunate. All in then, if you look at the benefits, we mentioned to you before that we believe
after 2015, the benefits per year would be $400 million to $500 million per year.
With what we've done, which we've had higher benefits on than we anticipated and what we have in place, we'll be at
the high end or exceed that in terms of our benefits per year. And so it's a robust process. It's done by our product
source planning group with involvement across all the facilities, all the regions. There's been some discussion about big
facilities. It's very hard to close a single source Decatur facility in terms of the mining trucks. It would be the same for
East Peoria. So those things just don't dollar out in terms of return to shareholders, and we do a net present value
calculation through that.
So I would say that we're continuing to look. We've added a few more in the mining space. If you go back to 2012, we
were at $66 billion in sales; we're $50 billion now. We've lost roughly $16 billion. 75% of that is mining, and we've
held at a 25% decremental pull through right in that range. And so there's a lot of things going on that support that,
including lean and material costs. But I would say that we're pretty happy with that pull through over that three-year
period. We've done that with little price and higher quality and growing market share. So I'm not saying we won't have
more to do, but that process is ongoing, and we've been pretty active in it.
<Q - Andrew Kaplowitz>: Okay. Thanks, Brad.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from David Raso. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question.
<Q - David Michael Raso>: Evercore ISI. Good morning. I'll keep it pretty simple. I'm just trying to figure out the
cadence of earnings for the year. The first quarter was $1.86 ex the restructuring, and almost never is the second quarter
not as high or higher than the first quarter. Maybe once in the last 20 years, and that was a quarter when you were just
starting to buy Bucyrus. So even if I pull out the gain on the first quarter, call it $1.72, if the second quarter is then also
$1.72 or higher, to do your full year, the back half of the year has to be doing $0.70, $0.75 per quarter.
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Yes. I'll, without being -
<Q - David Michael Raso>: Is there conservatism in the guidance or does it drop off that sharply?
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: No. What I would tell you is if you look at our internal forecast of the three quarters, I
mean, they're very close to each other. So we see it beginning in the second quarter. The second quarter we would
expect to be lower than the first quarter on sales. And to your point, that doesn't happen very often, but our forecast for
this year is second quarter actually lower than the first quarter on both sales and profit, not much different through the
rest of the year. I mean, there are small pluses and minuses, but, by and large, you can look at our full year, take out our
first quarter, and think about the remainder as close to what we're thinking.
<Q - David Michael Raso>: All right. I mean, I'm just trying to figure, if so we're saying the second quarter is
dropping to call it $1.20 or something like that and the last two quarters are $1, the drop-off from energy and some

locomotives, what's the offset in the second half of the year to make up for some of that? You still have the earnings
dropping off. I'm just trying to understand, they drop off pretty sharply. So what are some of the things we're expecting
to be better?
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Yes, so a couple of things. So you're correct in the idea that, particularly for
reciprocating engines, we'll have fairly sizable declines in the second half of the year, actually probably beginning
sometime in the second quarter and continuing on through the year. But there are other parts of the business, like Solar,
where the timing of the year is usually the second half is higher than the first half, and we certainly see that happening
this year.
We have I think marine sales a bit higher in the back half of the year than the front half of the year. And much of the
rest of the business is actually reasonably, in fact, I just looked at this this morning, kind of almost anticipating this
question. The rest of the year for most of the rest of the businesses are, by and large, relatively stable as we go through
the year. So the drop-off will be more oil, but it'll be mitigated a little bit by timing in some of the segments and a little
bit of an increase in marine.
<Q - David Michael Raso>: Then it's not related to that. The inventory, you mentioned a bit of a tick-down through
the rest of the year. Can you help quantify it company level as well as dealer level?
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Yes. If I look company level, I'm going to be a little bit more vague, because we have
continuing benefits from our lean manufacturing journey above and beyond where we were last year baked in. We've
got, I'll say, aggressive goals in our forecasts. So I would say without giving a number, we're looking for kind of a
cadence of improvement as a result of that or a decline in inventory as we go through the year, not massive, I mean,
certainly not like we had in the fourth quarter of last year. But our forecast would reflect modest declines in each of the
next few quarters.
<Q - David Michael Raso>: So the dealer inventory for the year, I think we -
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Oh, the dealer inventory for the year.
<Q - David Michael Raso>: Yes, about $1 billion.
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Yes, yes, sorry. Yes, I don't think we've given a number, but we added to inventory in
the first quarter. Our forecast would reflect all of that coming out plus a little bit more.
<Q - David Michael Raso>: Okay. That's helpful.
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: It's a case where our sales for the year are coming down from $55 billion to $50 billion,
and not all of that is oil. Some of that may be oil related, but it's still in construction. So I think that we'll probably end
the year a bit less than we were last year. Mining inventory is going to continue to come down a little bit this year, not
as much as last year, but kind of continue edging its way down like it did in the first quarter.
<Q - David Michael Raso>: All right. Appreciate the detail. Thank you.

question.
<Q - Robert C. Wertheimer>: It's Vertical Research. Good morning, everybody.
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Good morning.
<Q - Robert C. Wertheimer>: So I guess the question is on capital allocation. The commentary on share repurchase in

bounding opportunities in oil and gas, I'm not sure, whether we should expect you to cut back on share buyback for a

couple quarters just in case something develops? Or how you think about staging that, if you buy something and then
reissue shares or what, how do you think about that?
<A - Douglas R. Oberhelman>: I'll take that one, Doug Oberhelman here. We really haven't changed our priorities of
cash at all. If anything, the top priority to maintain the balance sheet is I think becoming more important to us as the
uncertainty around us continues on, if not increases. We reported that we're about I guess 37% or so of debt to debt and
equity. That's been trending down and we'll trend that down throughout the year. We bought $400 million of shares in
the first quarter, which I think is a reasonable planning rate for the rest of the year, assuming our plan holds up.
We will end, I have no doubt we'll end the year with cash, a lot of cash, as we did the first quarter, over $7 billion. I
think in this area of uncertainty where day-to-day one never knows what's going to happen, and having recently been
burned on that in 2008 with a big downturn and a weak balance sheet, that's where we're going to be. The other thing,
and I've said this before is that we are continually looking for growth opportunities, and that strong balance sheet
allows us lots of flexibility for growth, for protection, maintain our dividend, modestly increase it, as we've said before,
and buy shares back.
But I would say that we're in the driver's seat with cash generation, with our inventory turnover rising, our lean
manufacturing freeing up cash. And as these other priorities work through, share buyback will likely over time continue
to be an important thing for us. But in 2015, we're just planning right now on that $400 million until kind of per quarter
or so, or so, given the uncertainties and the challenges we face that we see every day in the marketplace.
<Q - Robert C. Wertheimer>: That's wonderful. Thank you, Doug. If I can ask my follow-up, Mike, I think you
mentioned that oil and gas and the drilling completions and, Doug, I believe you mentioned that Solar looks okay. Is
there any risk or is it long enough into this downturn to see if there's a risk to parts a la mining, not just in fracing
completion drilling but just production, pipeline, anything else? Do you anticipate right now that this is isolated to
drilling and completion, or could it spillover either on pricing or volume of the rest of it? Thank you.
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: You never say never about anything, but generally speaking, if you're going to produce
and you're going to move things through, oil through a pipeline or you need the equipment to work to do that. If there's
hesitation, if there's customers maybe like mining, they have the possibility they could push out things like overhauls
and rebuilds, that potentially could be a negative. I would say we're not really seeing a lot of that right now outside of
kind of the drilling and fracing where activity is off. Remember though, and I think this needs to be said, a lot of our
business in oil and gas, probably most of our business in oil and gas is gas. And so far that's held up pretty well.
Demand for gas is good, and the compression businesses is doing pretty well. So oil is just one piece of our oil and gas
business.
<Q - Robert C. Wertheimer>: Thank you, Mike.
