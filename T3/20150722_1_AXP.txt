MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the American Express Second Quarter 2015 Earnings
Call. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over
to Toby Willard, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Sherwood S. Willard, Jr.
Thanks, Cathy. Welcome. We appreciate all of you joining us for today's call. The discussion contains certain
forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are based
on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results
to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release and
earnings supplement, which were filed in an 8-K report and in the company's other reports already on file with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information relating to comparable GAAP
financial measures may be found in the second quarter 2015 earnings release, earnings supplement and presentation
slides, as well as the earnings materials for prior periods that may be discussed, all of which are posted on our website
at ir.americanexpress.com. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.
Today's discussion will begin with Jeff Campbell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will
review some key points related to the quarter's earnings through the series of slides included with the earnings
documents distributed. Once Jeff completes his remarks, we will move to a Q&A session.

With that, let me turn the discussion over to Jeff.
Jeffrey C. Campbell
Well thanks, Toby, and good afternoon everyone. And welcome as well, Toby, to you as this is your first quarterly
earnings call since you took over the leadership of our Investor Relations function from the capable hands of Rick
Petrino a few months ago.
Overall, our results this quarter reflected what we consider solid core underlying earnings performance. Reported Q2
EPS of $1.42 was relatively consistent with the prior year. though understanding our performance is more complex
than usual this quarter for several reasons. As expected, the results reflected discrete impacts, including a significantly
stronger US dollar versus last year, the impact of various changes to our co-brand partnerships, and the initial stages of
a ramp-up in spending on growth initiatives. On a year-over-year basis this quarter, EPS growth was also impacted by
the prior year net benefit related to the business travel joint venture transaction, and of course business travel's Q2 '14
operating results.
Looking through the complexity of these items, our core underlying earnings performance was generally consistent
with the financial outlook framework that we first shared with you at our Investor Day in March. We continue to view
this framework as a useful way to understand the drivers of our performance through the period of the multi-year
financial outlook we first provided in February of this year. Accordingly, we have included this financial outlook
framework as the first slide in our earnings presentation today.
Looking at our results through this lens, we saw a revenue growth of 5% after adjusting for FX and the prior year
impact of business travel revenues. We built upon this revenue performance with disciplined expense control, and the
return of significant amounts of capital to shareholders.
This solid core performance included making strong progress on some key initiatives. Highlights included the launch of
the Plenti loyalty coalition program in the US, the expansion of our OptBlue small merchant program in Canada, the
rollout of two new Centurion airport lounges, refreshes of our Gold and Starwood products, as well as the launch
earlier this month of Amex Express Checkout, our online merchant checkout solution.
As we expected, our solid core underlying performance was impacted by the discrete impacts from the strong dollar
and FX, along with the changes in our co-brand partnerships. In terms of our spending on incremental growth
initiatives, we are really just starting to ramp these up. And you will see them much more concentrated in the second
half of the year. As a result of all of this, while year-to-date our earnings are up approximately 5% versus last year, we
would expect earnings per share for the second half of the year to be down versus the prior year, consistent with our
discussions on investor day.
For these reasons, our full year 2015 EPS outlook remains unchanged, as we continue to expect earnings per share for
the full year to be flat to modestly down. Just where in this range we end up will be a function of the level of
incremental spending we do during the second half of the year, along with our billings and revenue trends.
We also believe our outlook to return to positive earnings per share growth in 2016, and to be within our target range of
12% to 15% earnings per share growth in 2017 remains appropriate. As you recall, this outlook does not contemplate
the impact of any restructuring charges or other contingencies.
Now to turn to a high level review of our financial results for Q2, as you can see on slide three, reported billings growth
was 2%. On an FX adjusted basis, billings grew 6%, significantly higher than our reported rate, but modestly slower
than the first quarter. I'll provide more details on our billing performance shortly, but we did see some deceleration in
volume growth in the US that was partially offset by improving growth across most international markets.
Reported revenue growth was down 4% due to the inclusion of business travel revenues in the prior year and the
stronger US dollar. Excluding these items, adjusted revenue growth was 5%. Net income was down 4% versus the prior
year. The decline was primarily driven by the net benefit related to the business travel joint venture transaction and

business travel operating income in Q2 2014, which together contributed approximately $0.08 to EPS in the prior year.
Below the net income line, we made our first preferred dividend payment during the second quarter, which reduced
EPS by approximately $0.02. We also continued to leverage our strong capital position to provide significant returns to
our shareholders. Over the past year, we have repurchased 51 million common shares, which translated to a 4% decline
in average shares outstanding.
This decline in shares outstanding benefited EPS, which was down only 1% versus the prior year, despite the 4% drop
in net income. This performance resulted in an ROE of 28% for the period ended June 30, well above our on average
and over time target of 25% and demonstrating the continued strength of our business model.
Let's now move to a more detailed review of our key performance drivers during the second quarter starting with billed
business on slide 4. On an FX adjusted basis, billings growth slowed modestly from 7% in Q1 to 6% in Q2. As you can
see, the primary driver of that decline is the US, where we saw growth of 5%, down from 6% in Q1. I'll provide more
details on the drivers of the US performance by segment in a few minutes.
Across our international regions, we saw strong growth in JAPA, which was again the fastest growing region in the
quarter, up 16% on an FX adjusted basis. This solid performance continued to be powered by strong growth in China
and Japan. We also saw improved performance in EMEA, where the growth in the UK remains in the double digits.
The decline in volumes in the LACC region was driven by Canada, which is being impacted by the end of our
relationship with Costco in Canada. Outside of Canada, we are seeing improved performance in LACC, particularly in
Mexico, where growth has accelerated during 2015.
To turn to Costco in Canada for just a moment, while it is still early, we continue to be pleased by our efforts to capture
the spend of the Costco co-brand card members. As you recall in September of 2014, we launched a new cashback card
in Canada that was offered to former Costco Canada Card Members and it appears to be resonating well. Through the
second quarter, we have been able to retain over half of the out-of-store spend related to the former Canadian Costco
co-brand product.
Now I would pause here and highlight that this result is very specific to the Costco relationship in Canada and has little
relevance for the US. As we've said, the two situations are very different, with the most important distinction being that
there was no portfolio sale in Canada. If you assume there is a portfolio sale in the US, it would have a profound impact
on our ability to capture the spend and lend of the Costco card members in the US. Obviously, the sale itself
automatically moves the card member relationship.
In addition as you might expect, when a portfolio is sold, there are likely to be contractual restrictions on what types of
marketing activities the seller is permitted to engage in. We realize that all of you remain extremely interested in the
status of our Costco co-brand portfolio sale discussions with Citi. The reality is this is a very complex transaction, and I
can't comment on the specifics during the negotiation. I will remind you though, that our contract with Costco imposes
its own constraints on the sale process. We will of course abide by the contract and we'll continue to update you as
appropriate.
To return to billings now, and to provide you with some additional perspective on our international performance, we
included slide 5 this quarter, which shows total international volume growth with and without Canadian volumes on an
FX adjusted basis. As depicted by the green line on the slide, international volume [indiscernible] (11:35) excluding
Canada increased to 13% during Q2. And this trend is being driven by improved performance across all of our
international regions excluding Canada.
Looking at the results by segment on slide 6. We saw a sequential decline in growth in GCS, where billings were up
2% on an FX adjusted basis. Similar to last quarter, we continued to see slower spending across a number of corporate
customers primarily in the US. In our US consumer and small business segment, we also saw some deceleration in
growth to 6% in Q2. This performance continues to be impacted by gas prices, which were down 27% year-over-year. I
would remind you that gas billings comprise about 2% to 3% of our volumes. The US billings performance also reflects
the current external economic environment, which remains uneven.

Another driver of the sequential change in billings growth in the USCS segment was our Costco US portfolio.
Historically, Costco billings have tended to generally grow in line with the USCS average growth rate, but in the
quarter, while still positive, Costco co-brand card growth rates slowed to well below the segment average. The slower
growth is in part due to a decrease in new card acquisitions. As you would expect during the wind down period, we
have agreed with Costco to reduce our joint marketing efforts.
Turning to GNS, this continues to be our strongest billings growth segment with FX adjusted growth of 16% during the
current quarter. This consistently strong growth demonstrates the diversity of our business model, given the much
higher than average returns on equity of the GNS business, and the fact that more than 85% of GNS volumes are from
international markets. And again I'd remind you that the slower growth in ICS is being driven by the end of our
relationship with Costco in Canada, which I just discussed.
In all international regions, you see that like other US companies with a significant global footprint, our reported results
are being significantly impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates. Over the past year, the dollar has strengthened
by 10% to 30% year-over-year against the currencies that we are most exposed to outside the US, as you can see at the
bottom of slide 7.
Looking at the comparison of our reported and FX adjusted revenue growth rates for the last eight quarters, as you can
see in the trajectory of the blue dotted line on the slide, our adjusted revenue growth remains consistent with recent
trends, in the 5% range. However, during the second quarter, foreign exchange had a slightly larger impact on our
results than in Q1, dragging adjusted revenue growth down by 4 percentage points.
As you know this revenue impact is partially offset by the benefit we receive from having certain expenses
denominated in international currencies, but there is a bottom line impact, especially when rates move this
dramatically. Over the longer term, we continue to believe that being a global company that generates revenue in a
diverse set of markets around the world is a strength of our business model. At current FX rates, we would expect to
see similar drag in the third quarter, but a smaller impact in Q4, as we begin to lap the significant strengthening of the
dollar that occurred at the end of last year.
Turning now to loans. You see on slide 8, that worldwide loans were up 4% versus the prior year. In the US, which
constitutes the majority of our loan portfolio, growth continues to outpace the industry and was relatively consistent
with the prior quarter at 7%. Looking forward, we continue to believe that there are attractive opportunities to gain a
greater share of loans from both our existing and new customers without significantly changing the overall risk profile
of the company.
Regarding the Costco loan portfolio in the US, which we consider of course to be a very high quality portfolio, we had
previously disclosed that it made up about 20% of worldwide loans as of the end of 2014. It remains at approximately
20% of worldwide loans today, though the growth rate in the portfolio is starting to slow in line with spending. On the
international side, reported loan balances were down year-over-year due to the negative impact from FX rates and an
expected decline in loans related to the Costco Canada co-brand portfolio.
So putting it all together on the revenue side on slide 9, you can see that revenues declined by 4% on a reported basis,
but increased by 5% when adjusting for FX and business travel revenues in the prior year. While this adjusted growth
was consistent with last quarter, we did this quarter have a benefit related to certain merchant rebate accruals, and we
also had some unfavorable timing impacts in the prior year. These items collectively benefited the year-over-year
discount revenue growth rate and also resulted in a 1 basis point increase in the reported discount rate versus the prior
year. These specific impacts, as well as the decline in Costco Canada merchant volume, where we earned a much lower
discount rate, more than offset the expected downward impact on the reported discount rate from growth in the
OptBlue program and industry mix changes.
I'd remind you that from quarter-to-quarter individual merchant-related items can cause fluctuations in the reported
discount rate. More broadly, we've said for a number of years that you should expect to see the reported discount rate
decline 2 to 3 basis points a year on average, due to changes in the mix of spending by location and industry,
volume-related pricing discounts, competition, and more recently, growth of OptBlue, amongst other factors.

Regarding OptBlue, we have been pleased with the progress we have made signing up merchant acquirers for the
program and the pace at which those acquirers have added new merchants to our network. Year-to-date, we have signed
up over 700,000 new merchants in the US through OptBlue and we are focused on driving card member spending to
those incremental merchants. We are also undertaking similar efforts to improve our small merchant coverage in many
other markets around the world, as evidenced by the launch of the OptBlue program in Canada this quarter.
Coming back to our revenue performance more broadly, as we have seen in prior quarters, the gap between total
discount revenue and total billed business growth was again impacted by GNS and cash rebate products growing faster
than the company average.
Before moving on, let me first touch on a couple other items on this slide, starting with the other key component of
revenue, net interest income. Here we saw a healthy 8% growth rate driven by our continued efforts to grow our loan
portfolio, as well as lower funding costs. As the majority of our loan portfolio is in the US, the impact of FX is smaller
on net interest income than on other revenue lines. Turning to net card fees, other commissions and fees and other
revenue, these lines were all impacted to a greater extent by foreign exchange and also reflected growth in loyalty
coalition revenue and some timing items in the prior year.
As we discussed at Investor Day, the loyalty coalition business is one of our most important initiatives to find profitable
growth in adjacencies, and we have been expanding the business into our acquisition of Loyalty Partner in 2011. The
program is a tangible example of how we can leverage our digital capabilities to provide value for merchants while
creating a new revenue stream for the company. During the quarter, together with our merchant partners, we were
pleased to launch Plenti, our loyalty coalition program in the US. While it is still very early days, we have been
encouraged by the initial response and the program already has more than 20 million total collectors.
Moving now to credit performance on slide 10. You can see that our lending credit metrics remain at or near
historically low levels, with our write-off rate declining slightly versus last quarter, and our delinquency rate remaining
flat. As you can see on slide 11, this steady lending credit performance, as well as lower write-off rates in our charge
card portfolio and benefits from FX helped drive a 4% decline in provision versus the prior year.
Though we experienced a year-over-year decline in provision this quarter, looking ahead we would expect reserves to
build modestly, in line with loan growth and any changes in credit performance. Therefore we would expect provision
to increase year-over-year and represent a headwind to growth in the second half of 2015. Moreover, as we discussed at
Investor Day, we did build into our multi-year financial outlook an assumption that we would see some steady upward
tick in write-off rates and a modest build in reserves over the outlook period.
Shifting now to expenses on slide 12. On a reported basis, expenses declined 4% versus the prior year. Clearly there
were a number of items impacting expense growth year-over-year, including the business travel joint venture related
items and business travel operating expenses in the prior year. Expenses also benefited year-over-year from the change
in foreign exchange rates. I'll walk you through these impacts in more detail as we review marketing and promotion
and operating expenses performance in a few moments. First however, let me touch on a few other items on this slide.
Rewards expense grew by 1%, which was a bit slower than reported billed business growth. Growth this quarter does
include a portion of the discrete impact from our renewed co-brand partnerships. However that impact was more than
offset by a decline in membership rewards related expenses, in part due to an enhancement to the ultimate redemption
rate estimation process in certain international markets that occurred last year.
Turning to cost of card member services. You see a significant year-over-year increase of 26% consistent with the
commentary provided last quarter. As you recall, a portion of the expenses in this line have increased as a result of our
renewed co-brand partnerships, and we would expect these elevated levels of growth to continue for the remainder of
2015.
Let's focus now on marketing and promotion expenses on slide 13 and make a few points here. First, recall that last
year in Q2, we leveraged the gain from the business travel joint venture transaction to support an elevated level of
spend. Lapping this elevated level, along with this year's beneficial impact from FX, led to the decline of 21% you see
year-over-year.

Second, we have been clear since the Costco decision was made in February that we intend for spend on incremental
growth initiatives during full-year 2015 to be relatively similar with the elevated level we were at in full year-2014.
This remains our intention. I would also point out that while the largest piece of this incremental spending will flow
through the marking and promotional line, a portion will also hit operating expenses contra revenue.
Last, looking at slide 13, you see that we were still in the process of ramping up our initiatives in Q2. You should
expect to see marketing and promotion expense increase substantially in the second half of the year. As we have said,
the elevated level of spending in 2015 will focus on the many growth opportunities that we have across our company. It
will support key initiatives, including acquiring new card members; gaining additional spend and lend from existing
consumer, small business, and middle market customers; expanding our presence internationally; growing our
merchant network to programs such as OptBlue; building our loyalty coalition business through things like the launch
of Plenti in the US; and introducing new digital capabilities.
Turning now to operating expense performance on slide 14. Our reported results continue to reflect the impact of
business travel in the prior year across a number of expense categories, complicating line by line comparisons.
Additionally this quarter's results were significantly impacted by last year's items related to the creation of the business
travel joint venture. Excluding expenses related to the business travel joint venture transaction as well as expenses from
business travel operations in 2014, adjusted operating expenses in total decreased by 5% in the quarter, aided in part by
a benefit of FX.
Moving to slide 15, adjusted operating expense growth year-to-date remains well below our 3% growth target. As
Steve Squeri noted at our Investor Day in March however, we are not achieving this disciplined expense control for a
cutback in investment levels, but rather through ongoing efforts to increase the efficiency of the organization. We
continue to make strategic investments within operating expenses to support our growth initiatives.
This is just one example. Earlier this month, we leveraged our unique technology and assets to launch Amex Express
Checkout which allows Amex card members to check out quickly and securely on merchant websites using their Amex
log-in credentials. Looking ahead to the second half of the year, I'd point out again that a portion of the incremental
spending on growth initiatives will hit operating expenses, including technology initiatives to enhance our small
business and corporate capabilities.
Now shifting to capital performance on slide 16. During the current quarter, we returned 97% of the capital we
generated to shareholders while maintaining our already strong capital ratios. Our Q2 performance demonstrates our
confidence in the company's ability to generate capital while maintaining its financial strength and we remain
committed to using that capital strength to create value for our shareholders. Looking at the capital ratios on the bottom
of the slide, I'd remind you that the greater year-over-year increase in the Tier 1 capital ratio was driven by our recent
preferred issuances that we made our first dividend payment this quarter. This payment is recognized as a reduction of
earnings available to common shareholders and therefore reduced our EPS by 1% during Q2.
Let me now provide an update on the DoJ lawsuit before I conclude and take your questions. We are disappointed that
our request for a stay of the decision in the injunction was denied this quarter. We have of course moved forward to
comply with the trial court's remedy. As a result of the stay being denied, we can no longer enforce certain contractual
provisions that prevent US merchants from steering customers to use other credit and charge cards. We are appealing
the trial court's ruling, because we believe it will not provide any benefit to consumers, and will in fact harm
competition. Steering is not a good thing for consumers, and we believe many merchants agree. At this point, given that
the remedy just took effect earlier this week, it's too early to tell what the impact in the marketplace will be. We are
staying focused on delivering value to merchants, and deeply believe in the strength of our value proposition. I'd also
remind you that there are a number of other private merchant litigation cases in the Eastern District of New York and
other proceedings seeking monetary damages that will begin to progress as our appeal is being heard.
So let me now conclude by stepping away from some of the complexity I just took you through and going back to the
key themes in our results. Our results show solid core earnings performance built upon our financial model of having
diversified growth businesses, disciplined expense controls and capital strength. While billed business growth overall

slowed modestly from the first quarter, we saw positive momentum across many areas of our business, including
international merchant acquisition and loyalty coalition.
Going forward, given our 5% EPS growth year-to-date, simple math would indicate that EPS growth will have to be
negative for the balance of the year to meet our continued outlook for full year EPS growth to be flat to modestly down.
As I mentioned, the biggest driver of where we end up within this EPS range will be the level of incremental spending
on growth initiatives over the balance of the year, as well as our billings and revenue trends.
Going back to our Investor Day in March, we discussed our plan to leverage incremental spending in 2015 to help drive
sustainable growth going forward. We continue to believe this is the appropriate long-term strategy, and also that we
have a range of attractive growth opportunities. All this is also consistent with our previous comments that quarterly
earnings performance will be more uneven than it has been historically while we go through this transitional period.
Given this dynamic, our focus has been on our full-year earnings outlook, rather than our performance in any individual
quarter.
Stepping back, as we've discussed in multiple forums over the past couple years, we of course have three on average
and over time financial targets: generating EPS growth of 12% to 15%, a return on equity of 25% or better, and revenue
growth of above 8%. Clearly our top focus when we think about these targets is generating consistent EPS growth of
12% to 15%, which in most environments we have a fairly good track record of achieving over the 20-plus years that
the targets have been in place. Our recent revenue performance has been below our aspirational 8% target, and we
expect to remain below that level during the near term given some of the discrete impacts on our performance I noted
earlier, as well as the current low inflation and low growth economic environment.
However when you think about our financial targets, the revenue target is just one of the facilitating levers that we use
to help drive 12% to 15% EPS growth. We have consistently demonstrated that we can achieve our EPS target across a
variety of different economic environments without having 8% revenue growth. In the context of our year-to-date
results, we believe that our core earnings performance continues to demonstrate the strength of our business model, and
that we are doing the right things to position the company for the long term.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Toby for some details on our Q&A session.
Sherwood S. Willard, Jr.
Thank you, Jeff. As a reminder, our ongoing goal is to provide a greater opportunity for more analysts to ask a question
during the session. Therefore before we open up the lines for Q&A, I will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself
to just one question. Thank you for your cooperation in this process. With that, the operator will now open up the line
for questions. Operator?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please go ahead.
<Q - Sanjay Sakhrani>: Thank you. I guess I was trying to get a little bit more color on some of the commentary you
had around retention of the Costco portfolio given the sale process, and how we should think about a gain that might
occur if in fact you sell the portfolio and you can't go after those customers. Could you just talk about how that affects
the 2016 guidance? Thanks.
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: All good questions, Sanjay. Thank you. So the points I was trying to make in my remarks
were we can now give you a little bit of information and are trying to help you understand what's going on in Canada,
where there was no portfolio sale, where we were able to reissue cards, with in fact the same card number, and where
we're pleased that we're tracking to retain over half of the out-of-store spend.

As I give people that detail, I think it's really important to realize that that is a completely different situation from what
may happen in the US. And if you assume there is a portfolio sale in the US, where all the card members are
automatically moved to new cards from a new issuer, and if you assume that in general these contracts, to your point
Sanjay, have restrictions around marketing, I want to caution people that you would expect to get a very, very different
outcome from what is happening in Canada, if that's the way the US were to play out.
When you think about a portfolio sale and assuming there is a gain, we've been I think consistent for quite some time in
saying that we would use that gain or at least portions of that gain to help fund continued spending on a variety of
growth initiatives. And when you think about our company and our growth opportunities, we have many, many
opportunities to grow in every part of our business in every part of the globe.
And so the efforts we may or may not make at times around Costco card members are just one small piece of what is a
much broader pie of opportunities we see to really effectively continue to spend at elevated levels, marketing,
promotion and certain other things. So I wouldn't overly try to tie, Sanjay, the elevated levels of spending with any
particular segment including the Costco segment. It's really an elevated level of funding that we are applying to the best
opportunities we have, which occur all across our business.
<Q - Sanjay Sakhrani>: Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Ken Bruce with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kenneth Bruce>: Thank you. Good afternoon. My question relates to marketing and promotion expense. You
obviously are looking to increase that in the back half of the year. Looking back at some of the recent experience, going
back to 2010 and 2011 where you really did increase spending pretty dramatically then to drive growth, the levels that
you accelerated spending at that time were considerably higher than what I think you're basically guiding to for the
back half of the year. So I guess the question is, do you think that taking marketing and promotion expense to say
somewhere in the 34, 35, 36 basis points per unit of billing is going to be sufficient to get to the growth you need to
achieve your targets? And if I'm thinking about it wrong, is there a way to dimensionalize that?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Well, I think the way I would think about it, Ken – it's a very good question – is we have
a range of opportunities. On the other hand, we want to be really prudent about only focusing on those opportunities
that offer really good returns for our shareholders. When you look at, in fact one of the slides in the presentation today
which lays out the last eight or nine quarters of spending around marketing and promotion, I would say if you stare at
that slide a little bit, it will give you a more realistic sense of the range of spending that we would consider elevated and
that we would consider a range where we can very efficiently and very effectively in today's environment deploy all the
dollars. I'd be cautious about going back and looking at analogies from 2010 and 2011. It's a very, very different
situation. So I think if you look at that more recent set of histories and think about the highest levels, that's probably
more what we think we can target and be really effective.
<Q - Kenneth Bruce>: Good. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. We'll go next to James Friedman with SIG. Please go ahead.
<Q - James E. Friedman>: Hi, my question is about Europe and the changes in the interchange environment there.
Just looking for some high level thoughts on how you might characterize your strategy now that competitor cards have
their interchange rates capped. Do you see that as an opportunity going forward?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Well, that's a very good question, James. Let me step back and say clearly as a general
matter, we don't think regulation is a good thing for consumers and merchants and for this category. When you look at

the European Union regulation and the final layout of it, it certainly confirms our view that most of the reforms are
really targeted at addressing concerns around Visa and MasterCard's interchange practices. But as we've long said, the
reality is there are always impacts in these situations on our business, some of which can create challenges for us.
We've talked in this particular case in particular about the fact that there's some new cross-border dynamics that are
putting some pressure on our discount rates in Europe.
All that said, one of the strengths of our business model is we're out there every day having to prove our value to card
members and merchants and every day evolving the way we work with both to demonstrate that value. That does give
us an ability to flex and demonstrate our value in ways that others can't necessarily in this regulatory environment. So
we are working hard to manage some of the negative impacts of the regulation and use other parts of it to find ways to
be even more creative about adding value to merchants and our card members. And I would say, while obviously the
legislation hasn't had any, or much material impact yet, we're pleased with the results we see right now in Europe, and
we're going to work really, really hard to try to continue those.
Operator
Okay, thank you. Our next question is from David Ho with Deutsche Bank. Go ahead, please.
<Q - David Ho>: Good afternoon. Could you talk about some of the interest rate headwinds that you might face and
whether or not that's baked into the 2016 guidance and what you may do as a company to offset some of those on paper
headwinds from the liability sensitivity that you have currently?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: So good question, David. We of course are unusual in that a rising rate environment in
isolation, if you hold everything else steady, is a negative for us. And we put a number in our 10-K, just to use round
numbers, that says all else being equal, a 100 basis point rise in all interest rates will cost us around $200 million a
year. When you look at the outlook we provided, we tried to be realistic in that outlook and so we built a steadily rising
rate environment into that outlook. For that matter, I'd remind you we also built a little bit of steady uptick in some of
the provision costs as well. So relative to our outlook, you would have to have a spike in interest rates that was much
quicker and larger than what the general economic consensus has been to cause us to see any impact relative to that
outlook.
In terms of how we think about offsetting the impact of those rising interest costs, if you look historically, there is
usually some natural hedge here, because as a general matter, central banks and the Fed tend to raise rates more when
there's a little bit stronger economic environment and raise it a little less when the economic environment is not so
strong. And obviously the rest of our business benefits tremendously when there's a little bit stronger economic
environment. Beyond that, the reality is the largest source of our position on our sensitivity to interest rates is the
strength of our charge card franchise. We love that business. We think it's a great business. And so it just comes with
this one aspect that we have to manage as interest rates at some point inevitably rise. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And next we have Craig Maurer with Autonomous. Go ahead, please.
<Q - Craig J. Maurer>: Yeah, hi. Thanks. I wanted to ask if you could frame the OptBlue discussion a little bit
differently, versus your historical penetration, versus Visa and MasterCard in the US in terms of merchant coverage.
How has the additional 700,000 merchants helped you close that gap?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Well, yeah that's a good question, Craig. I think there's a couple aspects to this. So
because you first have to close the actual coverage gap, and then you have to make progress on closing the perception
gap. And there's a time lag as you do both pf those things. So the program that we first began to talk about a little over
a year ago was one where we said, boy, if you play out the incremental merchants that we think we can get if you look
at just the cycle of most merchants and how often they re-up, the smaller merchants with acquirers, then you have a

multi-year process here before we believe we can get to the point where in fact you signed on most merchants in the US
relative to a MasterCard, Visa. You clearly have a process that then extends beyond that to match that with perceptions
and to drive card members to those merchants.
If you think about the things I said a few minutes ago, as I pointed out that we're really pleased with our progress this
year on OptBlue and we've signed 700,000 new merchants under it, we also have to wait until you get them signed up
and then you have to go through a process to drive business to those merchants. And we're engaged in that and we're
certainly not to the point today where we would say that we have materially closed the coverage gaps. And we're not
going to go out and start talking about that until we've gotten further into this.
So this is clearly a multi-year effort because you're talking about a couple of million merchants who ultimately have to
add on to the roll. And it's a multi-year effort to change perceptions, but we're really pleased with the way it's going.
We feel strongly that when you take a multi-year view of this company, this is a really important part of our growth
story and we will continue to give you a sense each quarter of how it's going
<Q - Craig J. Maurer>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. We have a question now from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Go ahead please.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Great, thanks. I was just wondering, I mean given the commentary you made about the
opportunities for marketing, why did you wait until the second half? And could you talk a little bit about how some of
the new products that you're been marketing and will be marketing, especially like the 6%/3%/1% rewards card will
impact the profitability?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Well, all fair questions, Moshe. We went into 2015 as we began the year in January with
an assumption that we would be continuing our very long-term partnership with Costco and we set marketing plans and
we set budgets and we sent the management teams off to execute on that plan. When we changed that plan in February
and decided to go down a different path, and concluded that we think in the long run we can generate more value for
our shareholders with the path we've now gone down, we really had to do a little bit of a reset.
And we manage the company for the long term. We want to be thoughtful when we choose to do something as dramatic
as we've done, go to our shareholders and say we're going to ramp up spending this year and it's going to result in not a
lot of earnings growth, and in fact EPS could even be down a little bit this year. We want to be really thoughtful about
the way we deploy those resources. And so while we began to deploy them in the second quarter to be as thoughtful as
we wanted to be, reality is it's taking us until the third quarter to get fully ramped up. So we think that's the right way to
run the company, the right results. And as we said beginning back in February, we're stepping away a little bit from
overly focusing on each individual quarter.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: And the rewards? The impact on rewards costs of the new products?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Well look, the rewards environment in general has always been competitive and it's pretty
competitive right now. What we really try to focus on, Moshe, are a couple things. Number one, ultimately this is about
broad customer value proposition. Rewards is one component of that. We have a brand. We have a reputation for
security and trust and service. We try to leverage those things. Second, we have a very broad portfolio of products in
the US and we do that because we think there's tremendous value in making sure you're delivering to different customer
segments the things they value the most, whether it be cash back rewards products, things that use our membership
rewards program, which is of course still by far the largest and most diversified rewards program, or our many
co-brand products.
And by focusing on the broader customer value proposition, by making sure we're being really thoughtful about how
we segment the different customer groups and produce something that they're going to most highly value, we think we
can get to the best possible result, both for both our card members and our shareholders without having to compete

dollar for dollar on every single aspect of every single product. So we feel good about some of the latest things we've
launched and certainly the big launch in the last twelve months was around the EveryDay card last year. That card has
performed better than we had anticipated. It has reached a little bit different demographic, which is exactly what we
were trying to do and so we're pretty pleased with that.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. We'll go next to David Hochstim with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - David Hochstim>: Yeah, hi. Thanks. I wonder with the benefit of another three months of analysis, if you could
provide more color around the decline that we've seen in GCS billed business. And is weather a factor on comparisons?
And what's the outlook for some improvement in the third quarter? And I guess really just wondering why that declined
so much more rapidly than USCS billed business, for example.
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: So, very good question, David. So two things. There was a sequential decline here, Q1 to
Q2, from 4% to 2%. That decline actually relates to one product with actually mainly one large customer. And it's an
airline fuel buying product; very, very low margin product. As an old airline CFO, I'd point out the airlines are a little
flush with cash right now and so they're sort of minimizing their use of these products which help them out with cash
flow. That's what caused the drop from 4% to 2% as you go from Q2 to Q1.
Now 4% is still a low number, and as I said last quarter, boy, as we have really scrubbed all our customer base, all I can
tell you is, it is US driven, not the international markets. It is very broadly spread in terms of a slowdown in just the
organic growth spending trends amongst our midsized and larger clients. It's T&E oriented and it seems to be very
broad spread. So you can draw different conclusions from that. Is this companies tightening T&E budgets as they think
about the economic environment; is it a little bit of fare pressure on the airlines? We have lots of different theories, and
you can add your own. But those are the facts as we see them.
<Q - David Hochstim>: Was there any change late in the quarter that would lead to a different trend in Q3?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: We're always very cautious, David, about reading too much into trends that occur over a
couple of weeks. So I would say no. We'll just have to see how Q3 plays out.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Don Fandetti with Citigroup. Go ahead, please.
<Q - Donald Fandetti>: Yes, Jeff. In terms of your American Express Checkout product, I thought it was pretty
interesting that you can use your existing ID and password. I was just curious what you've found as you've rolled that
out to merchants. Are you having to offer any type of economic incentive? I know some of the networks have
suggested that it can be a little tricky to get the merchants to prioritize that. And how quickly do you think you can
grow that penetration to your top merchants?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Well of course, very, very early days here. We have just announced the product. It's
available with a small number of initial websites, with a longer public list of people who will soon be adding it.
Certainly, we have done some pilot sites before we launched it, and of course the key here that everyone is trying to get
to with these products is you're trying to get to a much higher percentage of people who go all the way through to the
end and buy what they've been looking at in any particular online or mobile experience. And I would say, we and the
couple of merchants we had doing pilots with us, were very encouraged by the results that we achieved in terms of
improving those rates of getting people through to the final, final step.
So when you think about the economic arrangements, I obviously can't comment on the specific economic
arrangements, but what this is really about and the real pot of gold that everyone is chasing here is, can you get those

rates up significantly, and to the extent you can prove that you can, then the economics take care of themselves for
everyone. And that's what we are seeking here. Now, I'll go back to where I started. It's very early days and we're going
to have to see how things progress here, but we are encouraged by the early results. We think we have a product with
some very interesting features relative to some of the other alternatives. It is very simple. It is very quick. But we'll
have to give you an update as time goes on.
<Q - Donald Fandetti>: Okay. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Sameer Gokhale with Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead.
<Q - Sameer S. Gokhale>: Hi, thank you. So, just a quick first question about the steering injunction, which became
effective on the July 20. At this point, have you notified all merchants that they can in fact steer? I just wanted to get a
sense for that. And then, in terms of earlier this year, there was a restructuring initiative involving 4,000 jobs and just
wanted to get an update on that, have you completed that restructuring with the 4,000 jobs. Just an update on that would
be helpful. Thank you.
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: So let me take those one at a time. So, start with the DoJ. So you are correct. The judge's
order became effective at the beginning of this week and we are in the process of following that order. One part of that
process is notifying all of our merchants of their right to steer, and that will be happening per the order in the next
several weeks. There's other aspects to it, but that's certainly one of the most important parts.
As we think about the order, I think the first thing I would say is, as we sit here and think about it today, we believe that
in the near term, the financial impact of this order is within the financial outlook that we provided at Investor Day.
Reiterated it again today. Clearly in the longer term, we're going to have to see how the marketplace reacts to the order
and think about what impact that's going to have on our business model. So that's where we are with the DoJ.
Much more straightforward question, yes, we took a restructuring charge last year that involved about 4,000
employees. We are well into that, however there is still a significant portion still to come. Some of this involves fairly
complex moves as we right-shore. Interestingly enough, a lot of this is moving from one non-US location to another
non-US location in some of our operations. That has to be done very thoughtfully, and so there's a very experienced
team at doing this who is involved in that process, but they won't be done until much closer to the end of this year
<Q - Sameer S. Gokhale>: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, Jeff.
Operator
Thank you. We have a question now from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Mark C. DeVries>: Thanks, follow-up questions on what's embedded in your EPS growth guidance. What does
it contemplate in terms of FX? I'm assuming it's consistent with what you laid out, Jeff, for a fading headwind from FX
in the fourth quarter. And if that's the case, does it assume no further appreciation in the dollar? And therefore, what
might happen if we see continued dollar strength? And also what happens if credit is more benign than you're thinking
and you don't see the provision ramp in the back half of the year? Could we expect that to fall to the bottom line or
would you expect to kind of reinvest the benefits of that?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Yeah, two good questions. So on FX, essentially what is built into our multi-year
financial outlook, to use broad strokes, is roughly the rates you see today. And so to the extent, because it is hard to
imagine, these may be famous last words, that you could have another move as dramatic as you have had in the last 12
months beyond where we are today. If you do, that will be a tough headwind for us that we'll do our best to manage. I'd
just remind you that the movement of the US dollar so far so fast against so many currencies all at once as it's done in
the last nine months, you have to go back quite a number of decades to find another move like that. So it could happen,

but we'll have to see.
On credit, you're correct. We've built in both in the back half of this year as well as into our 2016 and 2017 outlook,
some modest and steady uptick in the provision and growth of the loan provisions. Clearly, we have a very steady track
record now in growing our loans above the industry average. What happens if that is more benign, well, that will be a
very good thing.
What I would say in terms of the bottom line is what we are trying to be true to at this point is the financial outlook that
we provided to people, and making sure we are really well positioned to demonstrate and to execute upon once we've
lapped all the FX, once we've lapped all the co-brand changes, once we've lapped Costco in the US, demonstrating to
people that the business model, the financial model that have produced 12% to 15% EPS growth rates, is in place and is
working well.
And so if credit is a little bit more benign, we will frankly look to see whether we are operating within the financial
outlook that we have and whether we have other growth initiative funding that we in fact think it could be for our
shareholders very profitably redeployed or whether we want to take it to the bottom line to make sure we feel
comfortable that we can come in with the kind of outlook we've provided. So boy, there's always a lot of moving
pieces. We'll have to see where they all come out, but hopefully, Mark, that gives you at least some sense of how we
will think about things.
<Q - Mark C. DeVries>: Yeah, that's helpful. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Hey, Jeff. It's Eric Wasserstrom. How are you? I just want to follow up on David
Hochstim's question. One of the themes that's come out from the recent slate of bank reporting has been some
enthusiasm after many quarters of maybe not so much enthusiasm about the growth in C&I credit demand and the
growing growth in middle market demand. And to the extent that corporates now are demanding more credit,
presumably to fund operations, do you think that that potentially signals some pick-up in spending in the middle market
and corporate universe?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Well boy, Eric, I've got to say this is one where I hope you're right and I hope that's a
signal. But all I can do is tell you what we are seeing in our corporate business. And I'd remind you, it is a T&E – well
we do lots of things in the GCP segment. The biggest component is still tied to more or less T&E oriented spend by
mid to large size companies. And so, I have read some of those same comments that you just referenced. We'll have to
see whether they show up in our results over time. Certainly through June 30, it would be hard to see that.
<A - Sherwood S. Willard, Jr.>: Hey, Cathy, we probably have time for one more question.
Operator
All right, thank you. That will come from Cheryl Pate with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, please
<Q - Cheryl M. Pate>: Hi, good afternoon. I just wanted to circle back to some of the earlier comments on OptBlue
and sort of closing the perception gap. Can you just maybe help us think through, is that increased signage with the
merchants or is it more proactive with the card members? And then how would you tie that into, I know we've talked
about in the past the economics sort of moving to the positive on OptBlue at some point this year? Thanks.
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: A good question, and the answer of course is yes. It's sort of all of those things. So there's,
not to get overly tactical here, but you have to get the merchants signed up. The reality is we have trained over many
decades our card members to look for little stickers in the window and so you literally send teams of people out to
make sure the stickers are going up in the windows and that helps. There's an element of educating our card members.

Now, here's there's sort of a – you have to think about the pacing and the timing. You wouldn't necessarily, if you were,
Cheryl, an Amex card member, which I'm sure you are of course, want to get an email from us every single time we
signed up any merchant within ten miles of you, because you'd get tired of seeing all the emails and you'd ignore them.
So you kind of have to be thoughtful about when is the right time to communicate in the most impactful way to our
card members and when do you make sure you're doing that soon enough so the merchants who sign up start to see
Amex card members and feel good about what they've done.
So, there's no magic here. It's a matter of balancing some of those basic blocking and tackling things we need to do, but
we're very focused on this. I'll go back to that's why I said, so far this year we're pleased with all the sign-ups and we
are very focused now on continuing the sign-ups but also beginning to drive more business to those merchants. I would
say we remain on track for this year for the program overall to be a positive to our bottom line, when you look at the
net of all the positives and negatives. And we are tracking to our plan over a couple of years, to much more
significantly close the coverage gap.
Jeffrey C. Campbell
So Cheryl, thank you for that last question, and thanks to everybody for joining us on tonight's call. I guess I'd go back
to probably where I started and where I ended earlier which is there is a lot of complexity in our results. But we think
that this quarter does again reflect solid core underlying performance. With that, I will wish you all a good evening and
thank you for your continued interest in American Express.
