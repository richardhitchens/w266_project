I will now turn the call over to Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf.
John G. Stumpf
Thank you, Jim. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. We earned $5.8 billion in the first quarter, which
reflected the benefit of our diversified business model and our continued focus on the real economy. By building
relationships with our existing customers and successfully generating new relationships, during the past year, we were
able to grow loans and deposits and increase our revenue. Our capital levels remained strong and we continued to focus
on rewarding our shareholders by increasing our dividend and reducing our shares outstanding.
Let me highlight our growth during the quarter compared with a year ago. We generated $21.3 billion of revenue, up
3% from a year ago with growth in both net interest income and non-interest income. We had broad-based loan growth
with our core loan portfolio increasing by $54.2 billion or 7%. Our deposit franchise continued to generate strong
customer and balanced growth, with total deposits reaching a record $1.2 trillion, up $102.1 billion or 9% and we grew
the number of primary consumer checking customers by 5.7%.
Our credit performance continued to be very strong, with net charge-offs down $117 million and our net charge-off
ratio declined to 33 basis points. Our financial performance resulted in strong capital generation, and returning capital
to our shareholders remains a priority. Our net payout ratio was 61% in the first quarter. We're extremely pleased that
our 2015 capital plan allows us to increase our quarterly dividend by 7% to $0.375 per common share for the second
quarter of this year, of course, subject to board approval.
Our ability to increase our dividend every year since 2011 demonstrates the benefits of our diversified business model
and conservative risk management as well as our disciplined capital management process. We have over 90 different
businesses that are benefiting from the continued strength in the U.S. economy. While the first quarter economic
headlines, again, demonstrated that the economic recovery has been uneven, I believe the underlying economic
expansion, that is approaching its sixth anniversary, remains largely on track.
Interest rates remain low; homes are affordable; consumer and small business confidence remains high; and the labor
market is approaching full employment after a record 54 consecutive monthly payroll gains. I'm optimistic that the
improving U.S. economy will continue to provide Wells Fargo with many opportunities to better serve our customers,
our communities, and reward our shareholders.
John Shrewsberry, our Chief Financial Officer, will now provide more details on our first quarter results. John?
John R. Shrewsberry
Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. My comments will follow the presentation included in the quarterly
supplement starting on page two. John and I will then answer your questions.
Wells Fargo had another strong quarter, earning $5.8 billion and $1.04 in EPS in the first quarter and returning net $3.3
billion of capital to shareholders. Our results were driven by average loan and deposit growth and lower expenses,
while we maintained our strong capital and liquidity positions.
Our results also benefited from a net $359 million discrete tax benefit in the first quarter primarily from a reduction in
the reserve for uncertain tax positions due to the resolution of prior period matters with U.S. federal and state taxing
authorities. As a reminder, we also had $423 million discrete tax benefit in the first quarter of last year. We take a
prudent approach in accounting for our tax liability, which can result in discrete tax benefits depending on the
resolution of prior period matters with taxing authorities.
Page three highlights our results compared with a year ago, including increased revenue and pre-tax pre-provision
profit, strong loan and deposit growth and lower share count reflecting net share repurchases.

Page four highlights our revenue diversification and the balance between spread and fee income in the first quarter. The
benefit of the diversity of our 90-plus businesses was demonstrated by our ability to grow both net interest income and
non-interest income in the first quarter compared with a year ago, which was a key driver of our performance. As I've
highlighted in the past, the drivers of our fee generation vary based on interest rates and economic conditions. For
example, market-sensitive revenue, which includes trading and gains from debt and equity investments declined 22%
from a year ago, dropping from 14% of fee income to 11%.
However, other businesses had strong growth and we generated higher trust in investment, card and mortgage banking
fee income. With this broad-based growth, we were able to grow fee income 3% from a year ago.
Let me highlight some key drivers of our first quarter results from a balance sheet and income statement perspective,
starting on page five. I believe our balance sheet has never been stronger. We generated core loan and deposit growth
and have increased liquidity and capital to record levels.
Let me take a minute to describe how we're managing in the current rate environment. We've been able to perform well
across a variety of rate cycles over time because of the diversification of the business model. We're often asked about
how we manage our interest rate risk, in particular, the timing of making investments in a lower rate environment. As
you might imagine, we evaluate our interest rate risk position continuously and frequently weigh options to alter the
overall sensitivity of the balance sheet.
We consider factors such as the expected growth in loans and deposits; performance under a wide range of rate
scenarios and the trade-offs between the protection from lower rates afforded by adding duration and the consequences
of those actions in higher rate scenarios. Based upon these analyses, we then make decisions about the kind of
instruments we use. We can purchase securities outright or extend the duration of variable rate loans with interest rate
swaps, and the magnitude and profile of the duration we add. All in all, we try to balance a number of considerations
and maintain flexibility as conditions evolve.
Turning to the income statement on page six, revenue declined from fourth quarter as net interest income was lower,
reflecting two fewer days in first quarter than lower income from variable sources. However, non-interest income grew
from the fourth quarter even though the fourth quarter included $217 million gain on the sale of government guaranteed
student loans. The growth in fee income reflected momentum across our businesses, which I'll highlight throughout the
call.
As shown on page seven, we're continuing to have strong broad-based loan growth in the first quarter, our 15th
consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Our core loan portfolio grew by $54.2 billion or 7% from a year ago, and
was up $914 million from the fourth quarter. Linked-quarter commercial loan growth was driven by real estate
construction and lease financing. Consumer loans grew as growth in non-conforming mortgage, auto, security-based
lending and student loans was largely offset by payoffs in the junior lien portfolio and seasonality in credit card.
On page eight, we highlight our loan portfolios that had strong year-over-year growth. C&I loans were up $31.9 billion
or 13% from a year ago with broad-based growth across most of our wholesale businesses. Core 1-4 family first
mortgage loans grew $13 billion or 7% from a year ago, reflecting continued growth in high-quality non-conforming
mortgages primarily jumbo loans. The credit quality of our core mortgage portfolio remains strong with only seven 7
basis points of credit losses in the first quarter.
Credit card balances were up $4 billion, or 15% from a year ago, benefiting from strong new account growth and the
Dillard's portfolio acquisition in the fourth quarter. Auto loans were up $3.7 billion or 7% from last year. While we
continued to benefit from the strong auto market, new originations were down 10% from a year ago, reflecting our
continued risk and pricing discipline in a competitive market.
As you can see on page nine, we had $1.2 trillion of average deposits in the first quarter, up $97.5 billion from a year
ago, and up $25 billion from fourth quarter. Our average deposit cost was 9 basis points consist with the fourth quarter
and down 2 basis points from a year ago. We successfully grew primary consumer checking customers by 5.7% from a
year ago, and primary small business and business banking checking customers increased 5.5%. Our ability to

consistently grow primary checking customers is important because these customers have more interactions with us,
have higher cross-sell and are more than twice as profitable as non-primary checking customers.
We grew net interest income on a tax equivalent basis by $396 million or 4% from a year ago, reflecting strong growth
in average earning assets up $170 billion or 12%. Net interest income declined $190 million from fourth quarter due to
two fewer days in the first quarter and lower variable income. The net interest margin declined 9 basis points in the
fourth quarter due to strong customer-driven deposit growth. This reduced the margin by 5 basis points, but had
minimal impact to net interest income.
Lower interest income from variable sources due to reduced loan fees, PCI loan recoveries decreased the margin by 3
basis points. Liquidity-related activity, which was not LCR related, but taken to demonstrate market access and
liquidity of our securities portfolio reduced the margin by 1 basis point. All other balance sheet growth and repricing
did not impact the margin in the first quarter.
Our balance sheet remained asset-sensitive and we're well-positioned to benefit from higher rates. We believe we can
grow net interest income in 2015 compared with 2014 even if rates remain low, as we demonstrated last year. Total
non-interest income increased $29 million from fourth quarter and grew $282 million from a year ago, up 3%. Trading
gains increased $229 million from fourth quarter, primarily from higher customer accommodation trading, reflecting
better markets in high grade, high yield and RMBS as well as seasonality.
Mortgage banking revenue increased $32 million from the fourth quarter on higher origination volume, up $5 billion or
11%. 55% of originations were for refinancing, up from 40% in the fourth quarter, as rates declined. We ended the
quarter with a $44 billion application pipeline, the highest pipeline since the second quarter of 2013, and we expect
funding volumes to increase in the second quarter given the size of the pipeline and the seasonal home buying that
typically occurs during the second quarter spring buying season.
Our gain on sale ratio increased to 2.06% in the first quarter, as pricing margins expanded, reflecting strong refinance
volume and lenders priced to balance volumes and capacity. We currently expect the second quarter gain on sale ratio
to be at the higher end of the range we've seen over past five quarters, 140 basis points to 206 basis points. Servicing
income declined $162 million from the fourth quarter, as MSR results declined $127 million, reflecting higher
pre-payment expectations associated with reductions in FHA mortgage insurance premiums. This valuation adjustment
directly reduced our servicing results in the quarter.
As shown on page 12, expenses were down $140 million from the fourth quarter. Our first quarter expenses included
$452 million of seasonally higher employee benefits expenses from higher payroll taxes and 401(k) matching as well as
$236 million for annual equity awards to retirement eligible team members. These seasonally higher expenses were
offset by lower salaries, reflecting two fewer days in the quarter, lower revenue-based incentive compensation and
reduced outside professional services, equipment, travel and entertainment and advertising expenses.
While we will not have the seasonally higher personnel expenses in the second quarter, there are certain expenses that
will increase, including salary expense, reflecting higher day count and annual merit increases, and certain expenses
that are typically lower in the first quarter, such as outside professional services and advertising expenses are also
expected to increase. Our efficiency ratio improved to 58.8% in the first quarter and we expect the efficiency ratio for
the full year 2015 to remain within our targeted range of 55% to 59%.
Turning to our business segment starting on page 13, Community Banking earned $3.7 billion in the first quarter, down
5% from a year ago and up 7% from the fourth quarter. As I highlighted earlier, we had continued strong growth in
primary consumer checking customers, up 5.7% from a year ago. Our broad-based and industry-leading distribution
channels are one reason for this growth.
While our customers actively use all of our channels, including more than 75% of our deposit customers visiting a
banking store at least once within the last six months, mobile banking is growing the fastest. We had 14.9 million
active mobile customers, up 19% from a year ago. Our customers are increasingly using this channel with mobile
banking sessions, up 38% in 2014, while customer usage of our stores has remained stable.

We also continue to successfully grow retail bank households. February was our highest monthly net gain of retail bank
households in four years. These new households provide us with growth opportunities as we focus on meeting their
financial needs through our diversified product line. An example of how we're capturing this opportunity is in our debit
and credit card businesses with card fees up 11% from a year ago. Debit card purchase volume was up 8% and credit
card purchase volume increased 16% from a year ago. Our credit card business continued to have strong new account
growth and active account growth.
Wholesale Banking earned $1.8 billion in the first quarter, up 3% from a year ago and down 9% from fourth quarter.
Loan growth continued to be strong with average loans up $35.7 billion or 12% from a year ago with broad-based
growth across many businesses. We're excited about our announcement last week regarding the purchase of $9 billion
of commercial real estate mortgage loans from GE Capital. This is a portfolio of performing loans, primarily in the
U.S., the United Kingdom and Canada, which are active lending markets for us. We also agreed to provide $4 billion of
financing to Blackstone Mortgage Trust for their purchase of a commercial mortgage portfolio.
We expect these transactions to close in the second and third quarters of this year. This is an excellent example of how
the combination of our balance sheet strength, the expertise of our team members and our relationship focus positions
us to capture opportunities for growth, both organically and through acquisition. While we remain disciplined in
deposit pricing, we continue to benefit from strong deposit growth with average core deposits up $44.4 billion, or 17%
from a year ago.
Wholesale Banking also had broad-based fee growth, up 11% from a year ago with many of our diversified businesses
growing at double-digits. Investment banking fees grew 44% from a year ago and we increased our market share to
4.9%. This growth reflected continued improvement in our equity capital markets and investment grade originations.
Treasury management revenue grew 11%, reflecting new product sales and repricing.
Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement earned a record $561 million in the first quarter, up 18% from a year ago and up 9%
from fourth quarter. WBR's pre-tax margin was 24% in the first quarter, close to their long-term target of 25%. These
strong results reflected 8% revenue growth from a year ago, driven by 12% growth in net interest income and 8%
growth in asset-based fees. The partnership between WBR and Community Banking has been successful, generating
over $1 billion a month in closed referred investment assets. During the past year, 58% of referred assets were from
new investment clients of Wells Fargo.
We're also benefiting from increasing our license to private bankers in our banking stores by 15% from a year ago. This
partnership has also contributed to the growth in brokerage advisory assets, which were $435 billion, up 12% from a
year ago. WBR's strong loan growth continued up 14% from a year ago, the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit
year-over-year growth. This growth was driven primarily by an increase in high-quality non-conforming mortgage
loans and security-based lending.
Turning to page 16, credit quality in the first quarter remained strong with our net charge-off ratio declining to 33 basis
points of average loans. Non-performing assets have declined for 10 consecutive quarters and were down $618 million
from fourth quarter. Non-accrual loans declined $338 million and foreclosed assets declined $280 million. The reserve
release was $100 million in the first quarter, down $150 million from the fourth quarter and down $400 million from a
year ago.
Let me update you on our energy portfolio. We had $18.5 billion of oil and gas loans at the end of the first quarter or
2% of total loans outstanding. The size of this portfolio was relatively stable from fourth quarter, up only $65 million.
Approximately 55% of our portfolio was in the exploration and production or upstream sector. We've been an industry
leader in the energy sector for over 40 years and we take a disciplined approach to not only underwriting, but also
managing these loans and relationships. Our teams constantly monitor and evaluate this portfolio on a loan-by-loan
basis. In the first quarter, we performed an even greater review of each loan in this portfolio, and in March, we began
the spring redetermination process for our reserve-based loans. We realized minimal credit losses related to energy
loans in the first quarter and our allowance at the end of the first quarter contemplated the inherent credit losses
associated with our oil and gas exposure.

Our capital levels remain strong with our estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III using the advanced
approach fully phased-in at 10.53% in the first quarter. Last month, the Federal Reserve and the OCC announced that
we may begin using the Advanced Approaches capital framework starting in the second quarter. This approval did not
include stipulations requiring us to increase our current Advanced Approach, RWA.
We returned $3.3 billion to shareholders in the first quarter through dividends and net share repurchases. Our common
shares outstanding declined by 7 million shares in the first quarter, reflecting 48 million shares purchased during the
quarter, partially offset by 41 million shares issued primarily through employee benefit plans, which are seasonally
high in the first quarter. In addition, we entered into a $750 million forward repurchase contract that settled earlier this
month for 14 million shares.
We expect to reduce our common shares outstanding through share repurchases throughout the remainder of the year.
As John noted earlier on the call, our 2015 capital plan included a proposed increase to our second quarter dividend to
$0.375 per common share, subject to board approval.
In summary, the first quarter demonstrated the benefit of our diversified business model as shown by the results we
highlight on slide 19. Through our consistent focus on serving our customers in the real economy, we have realized
growth across many of our businesses that will help drive future momentum. We've grown primary consumer checking
in small business and business banking checking customers. We've added new credit card accounts, increased debit
card purchase volume and achieved strong retail bank household growth.
Mortgage originations have grown, commercial card volume has increased and we've grown investment banking
market share. Treasury management fees have grown at a double-digit rate. We've increased assets under management
and we have higher retail brokerage managed account assets. I'm optimistic that our diversified business model will
continue to generate opportunities for growth and will enable us to continue to invest in our businesses.
We will now be happy to answer your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Yes. Good morning.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Good morning.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Good morning, Erika.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Thank you so much for giving us a detailed rundown in terms of how you're thinking about
your liquidity strategy. And I also appreciate the $28.4 billion in deposit growth came from consumer and escrow. But
taking a step back of the $1.2 trillion in period-end deposits, how much would you classify as non-operational
corporate? And I guess, we're just wondering, is adopting a similar strategy as your other large bank peers on
non-operating deposits, will that be able to alleviate some of the liquidity pressure on the NIM without much give-up
on the LCR?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: It's a good question. And I'd say the answer is we're not impacted in the same way as
some of the other banks, who have gone to the measures that they've announced to discourage those types of deposits.
We're not constrained by the leverage ratio at this point. We're not meaningfully impacted by institutional
non-operational deposits and our G-SIB score. And so we're serving institutional customers, and in some cases, taking
their deposits if it makes sense in the context of the bigger relationship. But we're not in the same position as the couple
of banks, who have had to go out of their way to drive down either leverage or change their leverage outcome or drive
down their G-SIB score.

So we will – we're thinking about those relationships in a way where we can do the most good for Wells Fargo
shareholders. So if other people are charging more or are consolidating business activity to be willing to take those
deposits, there's an opportunity for us to improve our business with those same types of customers, but it's not quite as
urgent, because we don't have those problems.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: I guess, a better way to think about it is a lot of this excess deposit growth is going be
positive for your LCR and NSFR given that it looks like it's mostly retail, so low outflow, high ASF factor type of
deposits.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: That's correct. And, Erika, the other thing that I know you're aware of, we love the entire
relationship. So surely on the retail side, that's even true on the wholesale side, when we become the primary
accountholder or think of it as financial partner with a customer and deposits lead with that, good things happen. So
that's all part of serving customers broadly and deeply.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: And just as a follow-up and I'll step back. You've been very consistent in terms of falling in
that 55% to 59% efficiency ratio range. And you're consistent in terms of your forward guidance. I guess, again, given
some of the other large bank guidance and efficiency out there, will the take rates for Wells Fargo to move further
down to the 55% portion of that range?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Well, that would be one way to do it. An increase in rates, which would have an increase
in revenue with a lot of associated expense would do that. There are other ways to move a little bit lower in the range
depending on the mix of where revenue comes from, and the initiatives that we have to manage expenses. But we're
comfortable in the range. We're at the higher end of the range today, which is still an industry-leading level. And these
other folks who are enacting their efficiency plans are coming toward us. So we're going to keep doing what we're
doing.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: But we're not standing still. I mean, we still – we watch every expense around here as we
repurpose dollars we save and the things that we have to invest in.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Got it. Thank you for taking my questions.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Thank you.
Operator
Your next question will come from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura. Please go ahead.
<Q - Bill Carcache>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Good morning.
<Q - Bill Carcache>: Good morning. Can you put into context for us whether the investment opportunities that you
discussed that you see before you at the moment are – do you see them as growing? Or are they getting harder to
identify as you look ahead at, say, the next 12 months versus the last 12 months?
And then relating to these investment opportunities, how should we be thinking about the trajectory of your payout
ratio longer term? As you generate more capital going forward, is it fair just to view your payout ratio as being
inversely related to your investment opportunities? I guess, I'm asking from the perspective of, just, kind of, a general
overall view that higher payout ratios are better. But I'm wondering if that's really how we should be thinking about it
for Wells Fargo, given that your capital position is already largely optimized and you're not sitting on a lot of excess
capital at the moment, so when and how should we be thinking at that?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: So by investment opportunities, you're referring to our deployment of liquidity? Or are
you referring to, like, the GE Capital case where we're buying a portfolio of loans with customers?

<Q - Bill Carcache>: I think the GE Capital case, any other RWA growth for attractive return generation?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yeah. So serving our customers and deploying our capital in that way is the first call on
our capital. We're trying to grow earning assets with customers, with cross-sell benefit and create new and bigger
relationships with customers that we have. So certainly, a certain amount of that factored into our capital plan, so that
we're imagining doing that while returning capital to shareholders at a high level. But if the landscape were to shift, so
that the opportunity became more meaningful for us to originate more assets and in some cases acquire more assets that
are good for us, then I think we would be looking long and hard at that.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: As far as return on capital to shareholders, I think our record speaks for itself and I know John
mentioned it in his comments that we very much appreciate investment our shareholders have made in us and that we're
stewards of their capital. And returning as much as that is prudent is what we plan on doing and want to do. There's no
reason for us just to keep adding capital. On the other hand, first call is to grow the business. As John mentioned, and
we will return as much as I mentioned as we prudently can. As you just saw recently with our increase in our dividend,
or at least, the ability to increase the dividend.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: The trick, of course, is to only take advantage of investment opportunities that are
capable of generating the kind of return on equity that we've been generating and to keep distributions up, to keep our
capital level at the point, you used the term optimized. So that it's – we're not carrying excess capital that's harder to
produce that return on. That's the balance.
<Q - Bill Carcache>: That's very helpful. My last question is on a dynamic that we're seeing with loan growth
outpacing deposit growth across the banking system as a whole. But for the larger banks, including Wells Fargo, I
guess, we're still seeing deposit growth outpacing loan growth. I was hoping that you could just talk about what you
think may be driving that? And do you see anything on the horizon that you think could change that? I guess, in other
words, just lead to loan growth outpacing deposit growth at the large banks as well?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Well, I think every large bank has a slightly different business mix. And so their –
whatever accounts for their loan growth is going be unique to them. In our case, because we've done such a good job at
attracting retail households and attracting wholesale relationships that are bringing meaningful liquidity in, deposits
have been – deposit growth has been outpacing loan growth for some time.
And it would take a big move in loan growth, which could include utilization of existing credit facilities, or incremental
funded loans in order to catch up with that, it would have to be in a higher economic growth environment, I think, for
loan growth to get into the 9% range, which is where deposits have been. Now if we're adding loans – if we're buying
portfolios of loans like we are in the next couple of quarters that will certainly have an impact on that. But that's not
probably something that you would project into the future at that same pace. So I don't see that turning around in the
near term.
<Q - Bill Carcache>: Got it.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: In fact, this is some of the strongest deposit growth years I've seen in my 30 some years with
the company. And I think it's partly because of the way we work together as a company, our distribution, the
convenience we provide for customers, our focus on this. So it's been very strong. And all signs are that we'll continue
to have a very strong deposit growth profile.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: And at 9 basis points, it's not as though we're overpaying...
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Exactly.
<Q - Bill Carcache>: That's very helpful. Thank you for taking my questions.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: You're welcome.

Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Hi. Good morning. John, we wanted to ask – just go back to the efficiency ratio. Is it
reasonable to expect kind of as long as rates stay low and credit is as good as it is right now, you're likely to stay at the
upper end of your targeted range? I think John Shrewsberry, you said last call you'd be okay kind of staying at the
higher end of the – in this kind of environment. And is there any expenses that are kind of still cyclically elevated?
Maybe just give a little more color there.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yeah. We're continuing to – we're always looking for ways to be, as John said, as
efficient as we can and to make the most of every dollar we spend. At the same time, now is the time when there are
big demands in information security and compliance and risk management. And so if we're finding dollars on the
efficiency side of the ledger, we're reinvesting them either in products and services for our customers or in becoming a
best-in-class across all risk management aspects. And so that's probably going to keep us here at the higher end of the
range unless we have a breakout in some revenue category, or we have an increase in rates, which is fine. At 58%,
59%, it's still an attractive level to be performing at. And we're improving our company every day.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And on TLAC, John, is there kind of some thoughts that you could share in
terms of preparing for TLAC? The rules obviously aren't finished yet. But are you taking steps to kind of prepare for
your assessment of the most likely proposal that you'd see on that front?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Sure. So we've got a variety of analyses of most likely our best case/worst case, and they
look a lot like what's out there in the public domain. We're going to end up issuing more term debt during the phase-in
period. And we'll probably start in the relatively near term to leg into it so that we don't end up with an enormous
overhang that has to be issued in a short amount of time. There's still a lot to know...
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: [inaudible] (34:35)
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Go ahead.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Oh, no. I'm sorry. Go ahead. I was going to say is preferred as well? If you could just
kind of – where are you on preferreds relative to where you think you might need to be?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yeah. Well, there's a little bit of preferred left to leg into our capital plan, but not much.
And, of course, there might be more if there's RWA growth and the whole capital stack expands pro rata. I think we're
at 149 basis points of preferred today and our target is 150. So we're pretty close there. But if we grow RWA then
there's an opportunity for more of that. The big job to do is going be on the senior unsecured side.
And so we need to know what the total quantum is as a result of where we end up in the 16% to 20% range as a base.
We need to know what's included and excluded. And there's still things on that list that are being resolved both in the
international and domestic standard. And then we need to know the exact phase-in period, which we think we know. So
when you look at those calculations with what we have maturing or otherwise running off, and then, as I mentioned, the
growth in RWA that will lead us to what our annual issuance has to be to get there on time when the rule is final.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kenneth Michael Usdin>: Hi. Good morning. John, I was wondering if you could provide any color to help us
understand on the new loan purchases? Is there any way to put in context either the yield of the portfolio relative to the
existing yield of the Wells Fargo book? And do you bring over expenses with it? Or is it largely just interest income
coming over as has happened in your prior acquisitions of loan books?

Page 10 of 18
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yeah. So the yield on the portfolio looks a lot like our commercial real estate portfolio
today because the loans look a lot like our commercial real estate loan portfolio today. And it's not coming over with
material expense. So I think we probably will have to add some small number of incremental people, but we have, as
you know, we're the largest commercial real estate lender in U.S. today. We've got a big seasoned team all over the
country that's close to borrowers and close to properties. And that's the core team that will be managing the portfolio. If
we're adding people, it's in the – I don't know, tens or maybe dozens of incremental professionals in order to help with
asset management, but not a big number in the context of the size of the portfolio.
<Q - Kenneth Michael Usdin>: Okay. And then as a follow-up. With regards to potential other portfolios that GE had
talked about, given your positioning in terms of helping them through the structure, as you mentioned, do you guys get
a different look? Or have you already taken a look at other parts of the book and this is just the first tranche of what
could be more? Or what's your just general perception of the opportunity set that could come forth for Wells Fargo?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: They're a great customer. And we're trying to continue to help them and work together
like we did here. They've mentioned in their announcement that there is more to do. And we'll go through in any way
that we can be helpful to them in ways that are good for our shareholders as well. So there is opportunity there. I can't
really be specific about it because there are competitive processes at work. And this is their balance sheet after all. But
we will definitely be working closely together to see if there are other ways that we can help them.
<Q - Kenneth Michael Usdin>: Okay. And then one little just follow-up on your credit comments. Understanding that
energy is baked into this quarter and that you still net release reserves, can you just kind of give us the pushes and pulls
within the credit buckets in terms of how much more improvement do you continue to see on the rest of the books, ex
the energy side? Or have we really just kind of gotten to the end of the natural improvement?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Well, I mean, there is still a meaningful improvement in first mortgage in particular.
You've seen charge-offs, they continue to come down. NPLs are down. The portfolio is performing very, very well. So
as a result, there was room to take stock of what we think the issues are with the energy portfolio and end up with a net
reserve release, a modest one, but a net reserve release. So it's quarter-by-quarter. We'll look at it at the end of the
second quarter and see what the numbers tell us, but things do continue to improve.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Yeah, but, Ken, I think you should also add that while there's still more improvement to be
had on residential, on the other hand, our commercial side has been close to or even in a recovery position, that won't
last forever. So, I mean, there's always pushes and pulls here. But overall, credit is really, really doing well here. And
that's kind of an industry phenomenon, but especially here at Wells.
<Q - Kenneth Michael Usdin>: Understood. Thank you, guys.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yep.

Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill & Partners. Please go ahead.
<Q - Scott Siefers>: Good morning, guys. Just a couple quick questions. So, John, the tax rate has kind of bumped
around. And this quarter obviously, you had the discrete issue that you called out, but what's the appropriate FTE tax
rate to use going forward?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: The best way to think about the remainder of the year tax rate is to take the $359 million
discrete tax benefit out of the first quarter and then recalculate the tax rate.
<Q - Scott Siefers>: Okay. And...
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Which would get you to the mid 32%s.

<Q - Scott Siefers>: Yeah, exactly. Okay. Thank you. And then the other one, when you had been talking about the
mobile growth, you had noted also that branch use has not been declining. I guess, just from you guys' perspective,
who's coming in and what kind of stuff are they doing? And just as you look at overall branch traffic and the need for
branches, is it a good thing that people are still coming in and that it makes for an easier, more direct cross-sell or is it
more of a negative in that, you have to make mobile investments, but you can't really leverage via fewer branches
necessarily or as much branch reduction as you might hope? How do you think about that dynamic?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Yeah. Here's how we think about that. We start out with customer. And customers tell us
branches are important. We hear that every day. And while our other channels are growing, in fact, if you think about
the 12,000 consumer interactions we have a minute in this company, 80% or so are, what I would call, digitally
supported, either it's a online or a mobile – and mobile being our fastest growing. But our stores, our 6,200 stores are
still busy. 75% of our customers come into a store once every six months. Even millennials or our most advanced on
the digital side visit our stores, visit ATMs. And about 85% of our growth sales happen there thriving solutions. So it
doesn't mean we have to build 5,000 square foot or 6,000 square foot stores.
As you probably know and we've talked in the past, we've tried some different concepts where we have 1,000 square
foot stores that at night become an ATM vestibule; in the daytime, the walls fold in and they become a full-functioning,
digitally-enabled store. So we're doing that kind of thing. But our most loyal customer today is not necessarily the one
who has the most products. It's the customer who does the most things with us, uses the most channels most often.
So there's a – and we're increasingly becoming an information provider. We're in the information business as much as
we're on the retail side, in the financial services business. So this is really by connecting all the channels. Not about
trying to drive customers into what's cheaper for us. That's not how we think about that. We think about what's best for
them. And branches still remain an enormously important part in that.
<Q - Scott Siefers>: Okay. That's good color. I appreciate it. Thanks a lot, guys.

Your next question comes from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Joseph K. Morford III>: Good morning, guys.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Hey, Joe.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Good morning.
<Q - Joseph K. Morford III>: I just – I guess, first compared to the fourth quarter, the commercial loan growth was a
little slower outside of real estate construction. Was some of that seasonal or were there other factors in play there?
And just, in general, how do you feel about the current levels of demand on the commercial side?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: So the big Q4 to Q1 change is that we closed the sale of the student loan portfolio in Q4,
which created a big C&I loan that happened toward the end of the quarter. So the step-off there was from a pretty
elevated place. That has an impact in the calculation. I think in the first quarter, we feel good. Pipelines look pretty
good. We talk to the leadership of the business and people are active. So from one quarter to the next, tough to tell. The
year-over-year trend in C&I loans is really, really healthy. And then that step-off calculation is a little disadvantageous
just to the math, but business is good.
<Q - Joseph K. Morford III>: Okay. And then, I guess, the other question was just, I was curious what your early
read is on the spring selling season this year. I know you're starting to see any signs for return of the first time home
buyer.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Well, Joe, since we're a big retail originator, that's obviously a big opportunity for us. As your
question would suggest that the first time home buyer had been a bit absent in this recovery compared to what it's been
in previous recoveries. But I think some of the work that the industry did along with the GSEs in understanding

There's a little bit more activity going on. Wage increases and increases in employment have been helpful.
Affordability is really – it's a good time to buy a home. So we're – you never know. We're hopeful. We're going into the
quarter with the highest pipeline, $44 billion that we've had in a couple years. So we're well-positioned. And we'll have

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Hi. Can you hear me?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Yeah, hi, Mike. Good morning.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Hey. Can you talk a little bit more on the housing backlog? How does it look by region and
what are the areas of strength?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: It's hard to say. The mortgage business that we're looking at right now, we're talking
about national statistics. I guess, obviously, when we're talking about affordability and particularly for first time home
buyers or people who are most likely to benefit from the easing of the credit box that John just referred to, they
probably would have the hardest time in the hottest markets, which no surprise, are coastal markets in big cities, sitting
here in San Francisco and many of you in New York. So things are more affordable in the middle of the country. That
wouldn't come as any surprise. Most of what we're referring to are just the national pipeline and statistics. And as far as
I can tell, the production is pretty balanced from our various mortgage offices.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Mike, just a couple of things you probably already know. As John mentioned, there are certain
markets where the biggest challenge for housing is lack of inventory. I mean, still entire Bay Area is a bid market
where you bid for houses. I mean, my daughter and son-in-law bought a house recently. You have to write a letter and
tell them how nice you are and how many children you have, a nice letter, plus a lot of money will get you in the
bidding process. That's not true, of course, everywhere. But I was in Miami recently. And that market's – it's stunning
how that market's really doing so well. And you would have looked back six years ago and you couldn't imagine what's
going on today. So it just depends – and it's a bit – about what's happening in those local economies. In the Bay Area,
of course, what's happening within migration, technology and so forth has really created a lot of activity here. So it's bit
of a mixed bag. But, all in all, we're optimistic about the second quarter here.

those type of branches?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Yeah. We have – the first one there was NoMa, North of Massachusetts. And we had a
second. Now we're doing a couple others in other markets. But I don't want to suggest for a minute that that you'll see

6,200 NoMa's with 1,000 square feet across the franchise. I think it's a bit of everything, meaning, that there is some
hub and spoke, where you have a larger, established branch or a store that's been there for many years. And then you
have others around that maybe wouldn't be as large. You have some like the case in North of Massachusetts, where you
couldn't get 5,000 square feet and 1,000 square feet is optimal for that market.
So this is really about looking at our distribution. And we call actually health of your distribution. Are you in the right
location with the right hours, the right people, the right footprint? And does the store or the branch work in concert with
all the other channels of distribution so customers can start transactions one place, finish another place? Is there
ubiquity? Is there one version of the truth and – around information so – and how customers serve themselves or want
service from us. So it's a whole bunch of things that really matter in this. And I think the proof in the pudding is our
ability to grow primary checking accounts. I've never seen growth of 5.7%. And like John mentioned, it's not that we
overpay on deposits, 9 basis points. I mean, this is the magic of how this thing all works together.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: And also, over by NoMa, you also opened up one in the Safeway, or I think it was a Safeway out
there.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Yep.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: I mean, I know a lot of people are moving away from supermarket banking. I don't think you
were a big player in that area, but is that working out also?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Yeah, at one time, this goes back a number of years. And in 1998 when the former Norwest,
the side of the family I came from, and Wells merged, Wells was hugely indexed, over-indexed to grocery stores. And
then we've been adjusting that since that time. But again, we think of it as density within a market. And sometimes to
fill out that density, a freestanding ATM machines, sometimes it's in-store, sometimes it's a NoMa 1,000 square foot.
So it all fits into what we call the S-curve.
And maybe I'll just digress for a second. If a community has, let's say, 500 banking locations, that's optimal for a
community and you have 20% of those, 100, and that's the optimal amount, you'll actually get more than 20% of the
business. You'll get 25% of the business because certain competitors will have 10% of the stores and they'll get 8% of
the business. So there's a magic to the density and where the density is and how it works together. And that's just part of
our learnings after many, many years. So sometimes grocery stores fit into that, sometimes they don't. It surely would
not be a lead-only strategy, but as an augment, it's very powerful.

<A - John G. Stumpf>: Yeah, it's a good question. We think of customer, Nancy, and I'll get to the specific question,
but the way we think about business here is around relationships, relationships with team members, my 11 direct
reports have 28 years with the company. We think of relationships with our customers, our communities, our
shareholders. Buffett's been an owner of ours 25 years. I mean, we love long-term things. So as it gets to investment
banking activities, we think of that as another solution, another product, another service.
And most of the revenue that comes from that business is from existing customers who we have been doing business
with for a long, long time. When you are the number one middle market bank, when you have leadership positions in
energy and ag and commercial real estate and you do business with 80%-plus or 90% of the Fortune 500, you're going
get opportunities to serve customers deeply and broadly.
And if that means that through our skills and our people and our value proposition that customers, corporate customers
want us to help them with valuation, issuing debt, issuing equity, wonderful. If we're not good enough to get that and it
goes someplace else, we just have to work harder. So I don't really look at lead tables. I guess, I read where – in fact, I
read for the first time when I read the journal that we were number seven or eight or nine, I can't remember what the
number was.
I could have cared less. Absolutely cared less. I only care that we do the right thing for customers. And if that means
we're moving up, terrific. If that means that others are growing faster because they're taking risks or doing things that
don't make sense us to, God bless them. That's how we think about it, not as a standalone business, as one more way to
help customers succeed.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: So I guess, that's sort of it may or may not grow?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: I mean, just based on our skills and the market availability.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Actually, a couple data points to I give you, Nancy, just to help you dimension it. But if
you look at Wells Fargo compared to peer group on the risks that we run that we report in our 10-Qs and 10-K, we've
got a more modest set of trading businesses with a very low risk profile at least as measured by VaR, which is the
popular public version of that. Our investment banking fees, while we're thrilled and happy to have them, amount to a
couple of billion dollars a year or something like that on a $90 billion revenue base we've got.
I think this quarter we were in the $420 million, $430 million range for trading revenue, which is appropriate for the
needs that we have, for customer accommodation, and for managing our own risks. But still in the scheme of a $1.7
trillion balance sheet, the equity that we carry and $90 billion worth of revenue, it's just – it's another one of – there are
a couple of the 90-plus businesses that we refer to. And it's not imagined to grow in an outsized way from where it is
today. We're always trying to do more, serve customers better, we have great people. And – but if we imagined – if we
doubled the size of the business over some period of time while the firm grew at a steady organic rate, we'd still be in a
relatively modest percentage of the overall firm.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: And, Nancy, the risk really would be if you ever saw where the market is shrinking, let's say,
in investment banking or capital markets, and we're outsized growing because we're taking on risks with customers'
relationships that we have not known, that's where you see the imbalance. And that's again just not who we are.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Okay. Second question for John number two. In mortgage banking, if you could just repeat
what you said about gain on sale, I was writing as fast as I could, but I missed the number and where you expect it to be
in the second quarter?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yeah. So we're – the first quarter was at about 2%, a little more 2.06%, which is the high
end of the [ph] five-quarter (57:51) range. And the second quarter is operating in that neighborhood. So we're going to
be – we feel like we're going be at the high end of the range in the second quarter as well.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: There's a lot more discipline this time around, Nancy, with gain on sale margins, as you well
know, compared to, because you've been around – you've seen this industry for a long time. And that's a healthy thing.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Okay. All right. Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Good morning.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Hey. Hi, Matt.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Just a follow-up on the mortgage competitive landscape here. It's interesting, we
saw JPMorgan out earlier today with a big increase in correspondent originations versus a year ago. And I think maybe
you've been a little more consistent in that business. So maybe it's just some ebbs and flows, but if you could just
remind us on the correspondent and maybe talk about the mix that you're going after right now?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yeah. I don't know if it's a mix of going after as much as a mix of what's coming in.
We've been very consistent as you said. What happens when rates pop down and refis spike up is that our own
servicing portfolio results in a lot more applications because the easiest thing for somebody to do when they want to
take advantage of a rate rally is call Wells Fargo, because we probably already have their mortgage. And so that's going
to have a bigger influence on a strategy that we might have around correspondent.
I think you can see in the supplement that retail was $28 billion and correspondent $20 billion of this quarter's activity.
And that's not an inconsistent blend versus the last several quarters. There are more correspondents these days, as you
know, that go direct to the agencies because the agencies have opened the window to them. And that's also a lower
margin business for us. So all things being equal, we're happy to be a retail lender, but we do serve a big correspondent
constituency.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: And, Matt, if you go back in time, we actually had a larger share of the correspondent, because
there was a number of competitors who backed away, walked away from that market, who come and go from time to
time. So that will ebb and flow as participants either stay in or get out or whatever.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: And then just circling back on expenses and I guess, I'm focused on, call it, the
people costs, the salaries, commissions, incentive comp, employee benefit. If you sum those three lines, it's up, I think,
6%, 7% versus a year ago. I know there's the trading, kind of, nuance that we need to adjust for. But is there some
impact of the mortgage pipeline impact on those numbers as you kind of staff up in anticipation of a higher volume?
I'm trying to reconcile why that growth might be so much versus revenue and some of the categories and fees?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yeah, I wouldn't look toward mortgage. I would look toward risk management and
investments that we're making in along those lines. The beauty about mortgage in the first quarter was that this refi
pipeline helps use the capacity that we would have needed in the fourth quarter and we anticipate needing in the second
quarter. So it was a greater level of utilization. The – for better or for worse, the changes in year-over-year are a variety
of other things, including business mix, by the way, in terms of how commissions get paid and other revenue related
incentives. But it would be that plus investments made in compliance and risk management, cyber and information
security, things like that. Those are – we have the best people and those are not inexpensive.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Any way to size that either on an absolute basis or versus a year ago? Is that
overall bucket of, call it, non-revenue related costs?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: I don't have an accurate number. I think we've talked $100 million a quarter. A couple of
quarters ago as having been an observable increase in that category. And it's not any lower than that today. Maybe,
we'll see if next time around we can put a finer point on that.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. All right, thank you very much.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: You're welcome.

[Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities.
Please go ahead.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Thanks very much. John just to follow-up on your energy-related comments and I
appreciate the detail you've provided, but can you just clarify was there in fact any increase in general or specific
reserves for that portfolio or any downward migration, internal risk ratings or anything of that nature?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: You know there is a little bit of downward migration, not enough to meaningfully drive the
reserve. There is a little bit of an increase in NPAs but negligible. And we realized minimal losses in the quarter in the
energy portfolio.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Okay.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: So – but the change in reserve reflects all of what – of the actual migration, the actual
observation of performance in the energy portfolio.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Understood. And one of the other institutions indicated that based on the forward price
curve, they would expect some of the pressure on E&P sector to subside. Is that a view that you share?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: I'd have to say yes. I mean, we're in the middle of our spring redetermination process for the
borrowing-based loans, so we'll have a better feeling afterwards. We have noticed a lot of capital raising going on in
this space. We talked last quarter about our – the risk to our investment banking income around energy-related firms,
because we're large in that space and we had a great first quarter in energy investment banking, because lots of equity
was raised, lots of firms went to the debt market to turn themselves out. So that's a very positive sign. There's people
taking steps and changing their balance sheets and improving their risk profile. So that and the combination of where
the forward curve demonstrates the energy prices might be going, is helpful. But that's – again that's reflected in our
early view of our allowance and it'll be better informed once we finish our borrowing base redeterminations.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: And typically when is that?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: During this quarter.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Great. Thanks very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Thank you. I wanted to kind of drill into the mortgage banking a little bit more. In that
when we managed ours, and we had this recognition origination at close and not interest rate lock, whenever
prepayments kicked in, servicing income kind of was compressed as you had to write down the servicing for the
expected prepayments. But origination income wasn't at its full run with refi. So in my mind I was just trying to look at
this first quarter as kind of the launching pad going into a much stronger – and not to quantify that, but just a stronger
return on revenues and mortgage from that timing effect.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Actually I think that's a pretty astute observation, because we would be valuing the MSR on
prepayment expectations, which reflect that lower interest rate and we haven't taken the gain on the pipeline and what's
locked and slated to close in the second quarter.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Two follow ups to that thought process. 71 basis points on the servicing portfolio has to
be closed to all-time low. Are we getting to the point that even with prepayments we wouldn't need much more
revaluation, given that you've already incorporated a lot of the expected prepayments into the current evaluation?

<A - John G. Stumpf>: It's a good observation, but it's tough to say. We look at that calculation regularly, but in
connection with our preparation of our financial statements on a quarterly basis and take everything into account that's
available then, and that's when we strike the value.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: And then lastly, when you convert your unclosed pipeline of $44 billion into what would
be a normal pull-through into originations in the next quarter, I get to something like $75 billion to $80 billion. Does
that seem about right in a sense that that's the kind of run rate you're getting into at this point?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Tough to know. We don't know what hasn't happened yet and that's what's going to – it's going
to the applications that will be received and pulled through in the quarter. So too early to speculate.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Good thing is that half of it is already done in the unclosed pipeline. So you at least know
that part.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: That's right.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: All right. Thank you.

Our final question will come from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
<Q - John Pancari>: All right. Thanks for taking my questions. A quick question on the margin. Wanted to get some
color on the 13-basis point decline in commercial loan yields. I know you indicated that was partly impacted by fees.
Did the lower loan fees account for all of that or how much of it was downward pressure on yields from pricing
pressure?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: It's more PCI loan recoveries and lower loan fees than competitive pricing pressure. So those
things that we call the variable components of interest income are harder to predict, and when a loan gets resolved that's
been sitting in workout, sometimes it comes through the margin line. And then if a loan prepays or there is a loan fee
hung up in its carrying value, then that sometimes comes through interest income as well. It's those types of items that
are tough to plan for, tough to budget and in this particular quarter, we're lower than the prior quarters.
<Q - John Pancari>: Okay. And then how does that play into your margin outlook? Is it fair to assume still mid-single
digit basis points compression per quarter as we move through 2015?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: It's too tough to call, because it depends on what happens with deposit growth, it depends on
what happens with loan growth and then other investments that we make in the securities portfolio. That's what's going
to drive it. It's led by what happens to deposit growth. And of course, if there were a move in interest rates that would
have an impact as well. We're not trying to forecast it in this instance.
<Q - John Pancari>: Okay. That's all right.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Our real focus is on generating growth in net interest income and the margin is more the
result, not the reason.
<Q - John Pancari>: Right. Right. Okay. And then on that front, then, John, I guess if you could just talk a little bit
about loan growth expectations? I know you gave us some good color on what you're seeing on C&I. But CRE, you
saw still declines in your total CRE book. Want to get some thoughts around a sustained inflection in that portfolio
organically, and then is it also fair to assume that the loan growth overall should remain in the mid-single digit range at
this point?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Tough to call because it depends on the mix. We've got a variety of commercial and consumer
asset types here that each have their own market and cyclical dynamics. I think we expect cards were probably at a
seasonal low in the first quarter, so between seasonality and issuing new cards, that business probably grows.

Auto, we've kept – it's grown, but kept relatively stable. It's gotten to be a more competitive market and we've picked
our spots, I think, a little bit more delicately. In commercial real estate, it's going be tough to spot the organic
component of it because the purchase of the GE portfolio and this incremental loan to Blackstone Mortgage Trust is
going have a big impact in the second and the third quarters. But if I'd add anything to that it's that now the competitive
dynamic in commercial real estate lending is a little bit different because a big competitor is exiting the business. That
probably means something for us organically, if that's helpful.
<Q - John Pancari>: Okay. Thank you. And then my last question is just on the credit side. The oil and gas reserve
post what you did this quarter. Can you quantify where that reserve stands right now?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: We don't call it out specifically. We capture the whole portfolio in our overall allowance
for loan losses and feel that that is absolutely adequate for the loan book that we have, which incidentally, has never
been better overall. Oil and gas loans are approximately 2% of the total portfolio.
<Q - John Pancari>: Right. Okay. Thanks again for taking my questions.
