listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion of the call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and
if you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.
I would now like to introduce your host, Mr. Tony Takazawa, Vice President of Global Investor Relations of EMC. Sir,
you may proceed.
Anthony T. Takazawa
Thank you. Good morning. Welcome to EMC's call to discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter of 2014.
Today we are joined by EMC Chairman and CEO, Joe Tucci; David Goulden, EMC Information Infrastructure CEO;
and Zane Rowe, EMC CFO. Joe will begin our discussion with his view of what is happening in IT and EMC's vision
and strategy. Zane will then discuss the consolidated EMC results, some details regarding our performance and also
provide our expectations for 2015. David will comment on the EMC Information Infrastructure business, what he has
seen in the market and the Q4 performance. After the prepared remarks, we will then open up the lines to take your
questions.
We are providing you with our projected financial model for 2015. This model lays out all of the key assumptions and
discrete financial expectations that are the foundation of our outlook this year. We hope that you find this model helpful
in understanding our assumptions in context and ensuring that these expectations are correctly incorporated into your
model.

This model is available as background in today's slides, available for download in the Investor Relations section of
emc.com. Please note that we will be referring to non-GAAP numbers in today's presentation unless otherwise
indicated. A reconciliation of our non-GAAP comments to our GAAP results can be found in the disclosure today, in
our press release, supplemental schedules and the slides that accompany our presentation. In addition, all financial
comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise indicated.
As always, the call this morning will contain forward-looking statements and information concerning factors that could
cause actual results to differ can be found in EMC's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
With that, it is now my pleasure to introduce Joe Tucci. Joe?
Joseph M. Tucci
Thank you, Tony. I would like to extend a warm welcome to everyone joining us for today's call. As always, thank you
for your interest in EMC.
Overall, we are pleased with our execution and results in Q4. Year-over-year, our revenue grew 5% and our non-GAAP
EPS grew 15%. Within these results, revenue grew 16% at VMware, 2% at EMC II, and 18% at Pivotal. But since
Pivotal has essentially moved to a subscription model, bookings is a better metric of future success and in Q4, I am
pleased to report that Pivotal's bookings grew over 75%.
Our Q4 results clearly exhibit a good balance of growth and opportunity across our family of companies. And
undoubtedly we will compare quite favorably the results posted by our large cap enterprise IT peers as our strategies,
products, services, solution, and execution sets us apart in the minds of our customers. Additionally, we continue to
invest heavily in the quarter to where the IT puck is going. Investments that we firmly believe will pay off down the
road.
Looking at the year 2014, we came in within a half of percentage point of hitting our revenue goal of $24.57 billion.
We were exactly on plan for non-GAAP EPS at $1.90 per share. Again, solid execution against these two metrics. Zane
and David will give you additional information and perspective on Q4 in 2014 in a few minutes.
Before I shift my remarks to the year ahead, I would like to publicly thank the 68,000 plus people of EMC, VMware
and Pivotal, along with our ecosystem of great partners around the world for their dedication, hard work and vast
expertise and for always striving to meet and exceed the expectations of our customers.
Now moving to 2015. We fully expect the secular IT shifts of cloud computing, mobile and Big Data to continue with
even more focus by customers on cyber security. In 2015, we expect all of our IT spending to accelerate a bit in
constant currency terms, perhaps to 3% growth overall and 3% storage. But taking a stronger dollar into account, we
expect that some of this growth will be moderated by currency head winds, when measured in U.S. dollars. Against this
backdrop, our 2015 plan, as approved by our board of directors, is for consolidated EMC to grow revenues by 7% to
$26.1 billion and non-GAAP EPS by 4% to $1.98. And is always the case, the board will approve and assign us a free
cash flow metric at the next scheduled meeting.
We are confident in our ability to meet and hopefully beat our 2015 plan. Why? Because we have a very strong and
growing position in cloud infrastructure and computing with our software-defined data center and hybrid cloud
technologies, our services, and our world class partner ecosystem. We help our customers build out private clouds in
their data centers and off-site managed clouds in our partner's data centers, while also availing them to the benefits of
public clouds, like VMware's vCloud Air.
Together these cloud computing options provide our customers the cost efficiencies and agility they need. We are
confident in 2015 because we are hoping either way with a new and very importantly, open developer's platform, Cloud
Foundry. This platform provides customers with the ability to build new applications using modern, again open, data
fabrics, and in-memory computing to build and deploy applications faster with far more agility.

These new wave capabilities help customers to implement new digital business models, which they will need to
transform and grow their future business. We are confident in 2015 because we have made large strategic investments
in six new business/product areas. We firmly believe that each of these will exceed $1 billion in annual revenue in
future years. To demonstrate the opportunity in these six products/business areas, we expect their combined revenues to
exceed $2 billion in 2015. That's up over 100% over 2014. And while 2015 still represents an investment year for us in
these six areas, our non-GAAP EPS flow improved from a high-teen cents per share cost in 2014 to a low-teen cents
per share cost this year.
And lastly and perhaps most importantly, we are confident in 2015 because we are blessed with a truly talented
workforce and strong leadership team across the EMC family of companies. And they deeply believe in our strategies
and our future, and they have a track record of excellence in execution.
I would like to take this opportunity to also thank our shareholders. We have had very constructive dialogues with a
number of you. We listen to you and we have learned from you. And you, our shareholders, respectfully listen to us and
I believe you learn from us as well. We added two additional, well-respected, experienced board members, who will
undoubtedly add fresh perspective to the board and to management. And I can assure you that our entire board is very
focused on creating sustained shareholder value.
And to demonstrate our confidence in our bright future, the board has approved the continuation of our accelerated
capital return policy. In 2015, we will again return approximately $4 billion to our shareholders in dividends and
buybacks.
In closing I would like to invite you to join Zane, David, Pat, Paul and me on March 10th for our strategic forum. At
this forum, we will focus on our products, services, and solution strategies and offerings, and why we believe we will
win in our chosen markets.
Thank you again for joining us today. I'd now like to turn it over to Zane for his formal remarks. Zane?
Zane C. Rowe
Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone. Today I'll walk through our consolidated results, capital allocation strategy and
provide our outlook for 2015. I will also highlight the results of the Pivotal and VMware businesses within the contexts
of EMC and then hand the mic over to David for additional insight into the Information Infrastructure business.
I'm pleased to report that EMC had a solid quarter with record consolidated revenue, $7 billion, up 5% year-over-year,
and EPS is $0.69, up 15%. For the year we grew revenue 5%to $24.4 billion, and grew EPS 6% to $1.90. The team
executed well in Q4 and over the course of 2014, enabling us to continue to outpace much of the tech industry. I want
to thank and congratulate all of the team members across the EMC federation for all of their efforts throughout 2014.
Our global business is impacted by the dramatic currency movements we've seen that began most notably in the second
half of 2014. This FX headwinds impacted revenue by 2 points of growth, or about $115 million year-over-year in Q4
which is about $40 million greater than we had expected as of our last report.
In Q4, North American revenue grew 6%. The U.S. was up 7%. EMEA was also up 6%, a very good result given the
currency headwinds their cost us three points of growth. APJ was up 2% and Latin America was up 8%. Our BRIC+13
markets grew 7% year-over-year.
Looking across our three major businesses, Pivotal's revenue increased 18%; VMware 16%; and EMC Information
Infrastructures 2%. The ability to cross-sell products continues to be strength of ours, and we are seeing growing
success in our joint efforts to serve customers' needs. Few key areas where we are demonstrating our collective
strengths are in converged infrastructure and cross-federation solutions.
Converged infrastructure is a fast growing opportunity that helps customers transform their IT infrastructures. It is a
market we've pioneered with the creation of VCE several years ago and an area where we expect to continue our lead in
both integrated systems and referenced architectures. We are excited to welcome VCE into the EMC II family.

We had strong momentum in 2014 for our converged infrastructure offerings where VSPEX annual product demand
grew over 40% for the year. In addition VCE demands growth in Q4 exceeded 50% for the seventh quarter in a row.
The integration work between EMC and VMware has been a key element of the successful creation of these solutions.
The teams have been working on more product and EMC II will announce a new offering soon.
Cross-federation solutions including integrated technologies and targeted services from across our portfolio are helping
customers transform their IT. The ability of Pivotal, VMware and EMC Information Infrastructure to work closely
together results in differentiated solutions with broad transformative capabilities. This integrated solution capability
opens up the potential for large $100 million plus long-term opportunities with customers that would be more difficult
to address separately. Look for us to roll out several new solutions here as well.
As customers move forward with their transformation projects, our converged infrastructure and solutions capabilities
position EMC to be a trusted strategic partner. Pivotal, VMware and EMC II together create a unique value and in
2015, we're taking this cooperation to new levels. We continue to strengthen our technology integration and we're
working to increase our operational coordination in areas like collaborative account planning, additional cross selling
initiatives and differentiated joint services.
Looking at line items driving our earnings growth in Q4. Consolidated gross margin in Q4 was 65.4%, up 170 basis
points sequentially and 80 basis points compared with Q4 of 2013. Gross margin was helped year-over-year by
improvements in both EMC II and Pivotal gross margins, as well as the increasing mix of VMware. Gross profit
increased 7% year-over-year to $4.6 billion and contributed $0.11 to the quarter's non-GAAP EPS.
Operating expense grew 3% year-over-year, yielding good operating leverage during Q4. EMC II demonstrated good
cost controls with OpEx down 3% versus last year. VMware OpEx was up 16%, reflecting their ongoing investments in
the business in addition to the impact of the acquisition of AirWatch. Pivotal expenses also grew 10%. The growth in
Q4 consolidated OpEx over last year amounted to an impact of $0.03 per share. Operating margin grew 150 basis
points and operating profit grew a healthy 11% over Q4 last year, to $2 billion.
Tax rate was 23.8% and costs $0.02 versus last year. Our share repurchase program contributed $0.02 versus Q4 2013.
As a result, we finished Q4 with non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.69, up a solid 15% and in line with our
expectations.
We generated $1.8 billion in free cash flow in Q4 and $5.04 billion for the full year 2014. Free cash flow was lower
than our target, due to the higher than expected days sales outstanding, which were higher due to the timing of
collections in the quarter. For the year, free cash flow was approximately $1.1 billion higher than our 2014 non-GAAP
net income.
Our consolidated total cash and investments at the end of 2014 was $14.7 billion, $4.3 billion of which is in the U.S.
We repurchased approximately $1.6 billion worth of EMC shares in Q4 and returned about $240 million to
shareholders via our quarterly dividends. For the year, we returned almost $4 billion to shareholders through $3 billion
of EMC share repurchases and $900 million of shareholder dividends.
We remain committed to our balanced capital allocation strategy with a focus on returning capital to shareholders via a
combination of share repurchases and cash dividends. While we're not changing our long-term approach, we believe
that it makes sense to continue our enhanced buyback program at this time as a part of our ongoing capital structure
optimization. Following the $3 billion repurchase program in 2014, we expect to repurchase another $3 billion of EMC
shares in 2015. Upon completion of this program, we will have repurchased $9 billion worth of EMC shares over the
three years ending 2015. We expect 2015 fully diluted shares outstanding to average 1.960 million shares.
For 2015, we expect revenue of $26.1 billion and EPS of $1.98. There are three factors impacting this forecast that are
worth highlighting, namely the year-over-year impact of currency rates, the inclusion of VCE in 2015, and the cost of
our six key investments that Joe mentioned. Based upon year-end rates, we expect FX to negatively impact revenue by
approximately $550 million in 2015, or around 2%. We have a natural hedge on the expense line, so we expect this will
cost us $0.10 in EPS for the year. Consolidation of VCE results will have a notable impact on the income statements.

EMC's portion of VCE's financial result has historically been recognized within our other expense line. In 2015, VCE
results will no longer impact the other expense line. Instead, EMC will recognize 100% of VCE's revenue, COGS and
operating expenses individually within the corresponding lines within EMC's consolidated income statement.
This change will result in incremental 2015 revenue benefit of just over $700 million or about 3 points of growth. This
incremental revenue is from Cisco and VCE related products and services as the revenue associated with EMC and
VMware products and services was already recorded in EMC's consolidated revenue. This change will also result in
incremental COGS and operating expenses which will negatively impact EMC's gross and operating margin. The
impact to operating margins this year will be about 250 basis points. The inclusion of the incremental portion of VCE
will have the effect of reducing consolidated 2015 EPS by $0.04.
We continue to invest in the six areas that Joe referenced: ViPR, XtremIO, DSSD, AirWatch, NSX and Pivotal. Each of
these has its own growth trajectory with very impacts on our financials. For example, we expect XtremIO to achieve
profitability this year, while DSSD will require increased investment, even though it will launch late this year. These
investments cost us high-teens EPS last year and we expect this to improve to low-teens in 2015. This is one area we
will give you more color on at our upcoming strategic forum.
We're projecting operating margin of 21.4% in 2015, including the effect of currency rate changes, the incremental
impact of including VCE and our ongoing investments.
I'll take a moment to comment on our Q1 2015 assumptions to help you with your model. We believe that the changes
we made to our order fulfillment process last year will result in a new normal quarterly revenue seasonality.
Historically Q1 revenue has been approximately 23% of annual revenues. We now expect it to be around 22% for Q1
2015 and in future years with the offset coming in Q4. Q1 2015 EPS will be impacted by a number of factors, including
the year-over-year revenue comparisons, the impact of VCE, and the lower incremental benefit from VMware in Q1.
While the positive underlying growth trends in 2015 are being impacted by the FX changes and VCE accounting, we're
establishing a solid foundation for the future while also delivering growth today as we transform our business.
One example of where we're focusing our investments and building momentum is in Pivotal. Pivotal is the fastest
growing of our federation businesses. Pivotal has focused its business around three key areas. Platform is a service
where we introduced Pivotal Cloud Foundry in 2014; the data fabric opportunity, where we completed the first year of
selling the Pivotal Big Data Suite; and agile development services. They are very successful Pivotal Labs.
Customers are leveraging this portfolio to build their platform applications that are transforming their businesses. Both
of Pivotal's new subscription products, Pivotal Cloud Foundry and Big Data Suite, are off to a very strong start with
about 100 enterprise customers representing approximately $80 million of total contract value booked in 2014. Pivotal's
move to a more subscription-based revenue model in 2014 will lead to a better long-term revenue profile that does have
an immediate impact on near-term reported revenue growth.
To give you a sense for the strength of demand here, Q4 total bookings exceeded $100 million and grew over 75%
year-over-year. This is indicative that Pivotal's expertise in helping enterprises along their transformational journey is
in high demand and unique in the marketplace. The cloud foundry foundation is seeing success in establishing cloud
foundry as the global industry standard open stores PaaStechnology, and it is now the fastest growing open source
project ever. The foundation now has a broad set of over 45 members, including some newer members like
Hortonworks and Docker.
Pivotal is also becoming an increasingly important factor in our cross-EMC solutions. These solutions offer a
combination of products, converged infrastructure and services that offer unique value prop to customers. We will have
more to say about our new data lake solutions, including Pivotal and EMC technology in the very near future.
Now turning to VMware. VMware continued its solid growth trajectory with Q4 revenues within EMC up 16%
year-over-year. VMware demonstrated good progress across all three of its strategic areas of focus, in the
software-defined data center, hybrid cloud, and end-user computing. NSX grew customers by 60% quarter-over-quarter
and now has over 400 paying customers. It's showing great momentum with an over $200 million annual bookings rate.

End-user computing grew licensed bookings over 60% year-over-year. And looking specifically at AirWatch, the
customer count increased to over 15,000 in Q4. As the leader in the enterprise mobility management space, AirWatch
has been a great success in its first year within VMware.
Within the hybrid cloud opportunity, vCloud Air is also showing significant momentum with thousands of customers
now signed on. With the position of trust VMware holds in the enterprise data centers, vCloud Air is becoming an
increasingly important cloud service weapon in the EMC infrastructure arsenal.
We also expect that vCloud Air will become even more popular with customers with the expansion of EMC
value-added storage services within it. VMware has been moving to expand its offering for the software-defined
enterprise over the course of the last couple of years. A significant measure of this progress is the fact that licensed
bookings, beyond standalone vSphere grew nearly 40% year-over-year in Q4 and are now greater than 55% of the total
licensed bookings. So we're making good progress there.
Overall, EMC delivered solid Q4 and 2014 results, while transforming our business and investing heavily in the future
on our stakeholders' behalf. In a tough IT environment, we grew, gained share, and continued to position our self well
while also returning capital to shareholders. We look forward to continuing to build upon these results in 2015.
Now I'll turn the call over to David to discuss the Information Infrastructure business. David?
David I. Goulden
Thanks, Zane, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by thanking the entire EMC II team for solid finish with
year of accomplishment in the IT market that is changing rapidly. We continue to innovate across all of our businesses.
In Storage, we cemented a decisive lead in the all-flash array market segment. We leveraged our portfolio to create new
and differentiated business outcomes to customers and we continue to gain share.
These share gains in Storage are a direct result of our investments and our ability to manage these investments in the
context of our existing market-leading portfolio. EMC is the best of breed information infrastructure provider. This is
true for traditional data center environments where the vast majority of enterprise workloads run on [indiscernible]
(25:31) infrastructures as well as the next generation data center environments where the vast majority of new
workloads are going in the future running on object and ACFS infrastructures. This is a key differentiator for EMC and
customers are increasingly turning to EMC to bridge between a traditional and next generation data center
environments.
With these advantages, we grew our Storage business 3% in Q4 and 2% for the year and grew faster than our peers
during 2014. Within Storage, emerging COGS revenue grew 40% in Q4 and 2% for the full year. At over $2.3 billion
of revenue in 2014, emerging COGS now represents a significant share of our Storage revenue and one that is growing
fast. We expect the emerging COGS group to continue to grow at over 30% in 2015 and over the year as the second
largest component of Storage revenue after unified and backup recovery.
We would not be seeing this level of success had we not invested as aggressively as we have done. With the acquisition
of and investment in all-flash arrays through XtremIO, the in-house development of our unique software-defined
storage platform ViPR and our continued innovation scale out file storage with Isilon, integration of an object storage
appliance with ECS, we help in ensure through our continuous lead in inflation infrastructure extends well into the
future as customers transition to the third platform of IT.
Highlighting the major accomplishments across our emerging storage portfolio this last year, XtremIO entered 2015
with remarkable momentum with bookings more than doubling from Q3 of 2014 to almost $300 million in Q4 putting
XtremIO at well over a $1 billion run rate for bookings, by far the fastest growing COG in the history of EMC. In its
very first year in the market, XtremIO have secured a commanding lead of the market segment for all-flash arrays. This
is because XtremIO has the right architecture. It scales out linearly with data services always executing in line,
resulting in consistent, predictable, low latency. This is why nearly 40% of the Fortune 200 plus XtremIO and why we
have over $130 million plus customers.

ViPR continues to prove its differentiated value, exceeding our expectations on both revenue growth and customer
acquisitions in Q4, even securing non-EMC customers, validating value proposition for heterogeneous storage
management. Isilon's strong close 2014 secured a year of accelerating revenue growth as a benefit from a number of
tailwinds, including the growing demand where file implementations are expanded to the point where they require a
true scale out system to manage them. And for big data analytics, where Isilon's native Hadoop capabilities can offer
advantages in ease of use and low cost of ownership. In fact, the customer count for Hadoop on Isilon grew from over
400 customers in Q3 to over 600 in Q4.
Our Unified and Backup Recovery business grew in Q4 against a tough compare and was up 4% for the full year.
While the VNX product cycle annualized in Q4 is [indiscernible] (28:56) that continues to drive flash adoption with
flash capacity shipped on the VNX up almost 7% year-on-year in Q4. VNX also added 2,000 new customers in the
quarter, the majority of which are new to EMC storage.
Our data protection offerings showed solid growth in Q4. Companies are investing in our data protection architecture to
reduce risk as they undergo massive data center transformations, and we're committed to expanding our value
proposition here. We recently enhanced our cloud capabilities in Backup with the acquisition of Spanning which backs
up cloud-based applications and the acquisition of Maginatics, which offers data protection and mobility across private,
public, and hybrid clouds.
Our high-end VMAX business was down 7% in Q4 and 30% for the full year. This decline reflects the marked
slowdown in the high-end market in 2014 as new third platform workloads, such as Hadoop, are often best suited for
alternative architectures that we have in our arsenal. We at EMC have uniquely armed ourselves with a full portfolio of
storage technology, providing our customers with the right tool for the right job.
VMAX with its strong lead in the high-end market and a double-digit increase in its store-based capacity in 2014 will
continue to be a storage mainstay for many years to come. One of the biggest changes with VMAX3 is that it is 100%
x86-based differentiating from its peers in the high-end. This enables us to accelerate innovations with improvement
via software a sustainable, competitive advantage.
With VMAX3, we also added HYPERMAX. This allows us to consolidate file gateway, management consoles, and
almost any other infrastructure workload creating a TCO storage for large scale primary storage that is second to none.
And to compare this [indiscernible] (30:53) out VMAX a quick review.
VMAX scale and architecture enable 16 terabytes of global cache, 384 Intel cores and over 3 terabytes of flash, which
can be shared across 40,000 virtualized workloads. This raw horsepower combined with the hallmark data services, for
reliability, availability and serviceability, make it unique. With the transition to VMAX3 occurring at the pace we
expected, representing about 30% of the new systems sold in Q4, we're well positioned for 2015. Taking all this into
account, we expect the VMAX rate of decline to ease a little in 2015. As we look back at 2014 and ahead to 2015, the
one constant is change. We've experienced change before here at EMC. In fact, looking back over the past four years,
there has been a dramatic shift within our major storage lines towards more emerging technology.
We've continued to grow the storage business and outgrow our competitors while moving these newer technologies.
And we're managing this transformation while sustaining the profitability levels of the storage business. More
specifically, for 2014 our gross profit in storage grew versus 2013, even with a significant mix shift and in a tough
market environment. This speaks volumes about EMC's exceptional resiliency in the face of change and our philosophy
that with change comes opportunity. To capture this opportunity, we continue to transform in key areas of the
Information Infrastructure business, with our products, converged infrastructure, and in solutions.
First, the transformation of our product. With the growth of our storage product reflecting a shift in dynamics for the
storage market as a whole, we transformed our [ph] storage event (32:41) organization in 2014, streamlining it into two
divisions, a core technologies division and an emerging technologies division.
To maintain our key competitive differentiation as best of breed in traditional storage and to lay the foundation for
growth as primary storage and backup steadily converge, in Q4 we combined our enterprise and mid-tier storage

division and our Backup Recovery into one operational unit, the Core Technology division. This pooling of resources
allows our continued investments in traditional storage to go further by reducing overlap and increasing the reach of
innovation across the full core technology portfolio, as opposed to product-by-product. As a core technology, this
product is mission critical enterprise block workloads, our XtremIO all-flash array is now also managed within the
Core Technology division.
This rationalization of resources also allows us to direct dollars saved towards next generation systems. And our
Emerging Technology division will focus on turning technology breakthroughs into leading edge product with their
portfolio consisting primarily of Isilon, DSSD, and our software-defined storage portfolio including ViPR, ScaleIO and
Elastic Cloud Storage.
The second change is in the area of converged infrastructure. As customers look to transform their IT infrastructure for
agility and the foundation for delivery of IT as a service, they're looking for a step function in the ease of deployment
and ease of management that comes with converged infrastructures like Vblock and VSPEX. With VCE adding a
record number of new customers in Q4 and the remarkable growth of Vblock and VSPEX over the last two years, it is
clear that customers' preference for converged infrastructure is becoming a new normal. We expect continued strong
growth here. The addition of VCE will earn us $0.04 less per share than business as usual this year, but in aggregate,
we expect VCE to contribute to operating profit dollars in 2015.
This incremental investment offers tremendous opportunity and VCE is now the foundation of our converged
infrastructure business unit which now includes VSPEX, Vblock, and new products like the one Zane mentioned to
you, which you'll hear about next week. And beyond this, you can expect to see several other exciting develops
throughout 2015. Our market lead in converged infrastructure, in both integrated systems and referenced architectures
is a key strength as we look forward. IT transformation is a prevalent theme with many large customers. Converged
infrastructure allows them to transform their IT infrastructure, but in many cases customers are looking for broader IT
transformation. We're addressing these broader transformations via our cross-federation solutions, our third area of
focus in 2015.
Our enterprise hybrid cloud solution, which builds on the capabilities of all parts of EMC, incorporates private cloud,
managed private cloud and public cloud technologies, and it's helping our customers tackle broad IT transformation
agendas. The larger EHC-based projects we have won span many quarters in many parts of the world and have a
potential to grow to exceed $100 million each. We're focused on replicating these successes with even more customers
in 2015.
With our Enterprise Hybrid Cloud solution, we can have customers up and running in as little as 28 days, deploy
applications 75% faster and can drive down IT costs by 25%, compared with traditional project rollouts. We can build
this quickly because we've packaged 40,000 hours of consulting work into our EHC solution. EHC is a standardized,
virtualized, and automated infrastructure for deploying data center workloads, enabling customers to take advantage of
[indiscernible] (36.27) and economics for both existing and new applications.
This is why in Q4 alone, EHC won us many engagements, including a large U.S. based insurance underwriter, a West
Coast utility, a telecom company in the Middle East, and a top 10 global financial institution. EHC enables true
transformation at a time when customers need it. Our partners see the value proposition here as well and several are
getting up to speed to sell EHC with us.
To help with this, we have formalized incentives to capitalize on the power of leveraging the EMC II, VMware, and
Pivotal go to market, as Zane alluded to earlier. Customers tell us of their desire that we work more closely together
and in 2015, we expect to drive greater synergies and an even better customer experience through closer alignment
between the EMC, VMware, and Pivotal technology and field team.
With customer engagements becoming more consultive in nature, customer satisfaction with our services team is more
important than ever. And in 2014 both our professional and managed services teams earned even higher marks in
customer satisfaction than the already high CSAT scores of 2013. EMC is often cited as a share gainer in CIO surveys
as in this recent survey from Credit Suisse. This position of trust is a major strength at any time, but especially during

times of major industry change, as our customers are experiencing right now.
By continuing to focus on creating the best customer experience as customers seek nothing sure of transformation of
how IT works in their business, we're helping to ensure we retain this top spot with customers. We're doing what we
need to continue to earn customers' trust when it comes to handling their data, whether they're restoring, optimizing,
leveraging, or protecting it. Robust data protection includes not just availability but security as well.
And in a world of increasingly mobile, social, and cloud base, our RSA security division is increasingly important, key
part of our information infrastructure offering. RSA revenue grew 4% in Q4 and 5% for the full year. Our market
leadership in GRC, our technology leadership in security analytics, and our strong base in risk-based identity position
us well to help customers to cure their next generation cloud-based IT environments.
IIG revenue was down 8% for Q4 and down 1% for the full year. As the transition to a subscription- based revenue
model, it's been accelerated by the rapid growth of Syncplicity, where revenue growth doubled in Q4 and for the full
year. We also saw a nice increase in profitability in 2014, which we expect to sustain.
As we look ahead to 2015, we expect IT spending growth and storage spending growth in constant currency to be a
little stronger than it was in 2014. We also expect to see storage opportunities for EMC's offerings and we enter the
year energized. We have aligned our business to reflect the changes and opportunities in today's market. We continue
to innovate and lead and gain share in a slower growing, but massive market segment for enterprise network storage
and the backup and recovery of these storage systems. We are making enormous strides in the faster growing areas of
storage, such as all-flash arrays, where we're also the market segment leader.
We're the market segment leader in the converged infrastructure market segment. We have significantly higher market
share in these new areas than we do in the enterprise network storage market. We're leveraging the power of the
federation to help our customers with broader IT transformations for both existing apps and for new apps. And we're
working on truly game-changing technology across all areas of federation to bring to market in 2015. With these
advantages in a time of rapid evolution of enterprise data center supported by a customer faith in team, there's a debt
that leveraging this broad portfolio, to deliver a bigger outcome for our customers and partners, we are confident we'll
continue to out-execute the competition in 2015 and beyond.
With that, I'll turn it over to Tony for Q&A.

Thanks David. Before we open up the lines for your questions, we ask you to please try and limit yourself to one
question, including clarifications. This will enable us to take as many questions as possible. And thank you all for your

Certainly, one moment. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.
Your line is open.
<Q - Amit Daryanani>: Thanks so much. Good morning, guys. My question is really on XIO and VMAX dynamics.
XIO clearly seems to be doing very strong, same time VMAX has slowed down quite a bit. There's a lot concern I think
that XIO may be cannibalizing some of the VMAX sales. If you can just talk about how much of that is true, how much
of that are you seeing? And is XIO really bringing net new customers into the EMC family?
<A - David I. Goulden>: It's David. Let me take that one. So great question. We are very impressed with both
platforms, and we really have a power of [indiscernible] (41:38) going on here. Let me explain what I mean by that.

Specifically with regards to XtremIO, we've actually updated our data on that since we spoke to you last time. We
looked at the sales in Q4 and the sales of XtremIO are in what I call a third, a third, a third. What I mean by that is a
third of them are going into existing EMC accounts where people are re-hosting a workload that's either existing on a
VMAX or a VNX, so it impacts both. A third of them are into EMC accounts for net new workloads and a third of
them are into net new accounts. So, essentially two-thirds of the XtremIO sales are into either new workloads or new
accounts and only a third is re-hosting workloads sitting on an existing EMC platform. So we feel good about that
particular dynamic, and we also feel very good about our strength and position with VMAX, but we'll save that for
another question.
<Q - Amit Daryanani>: Fair enough.

Operator
Our next question is from Maynard Um with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
<Q - Maynard J. Um>: Hi. Thank you. If I take your constant currency revenue guidance and then remove the
emerging storage growth of north of 40% and then $700 million from VCE, the remaining pieces look like they are
growing. Can you just talk about the make-up and visibility of that? You referenced VMAX declines moderating but
can you walk through the other segments and then just talk a little bit about what impact the mix shifts might have on
your gross margin? Thanks.
<A - David I. Goulden>: Yeah, Maynard, that sounds like a multi-part question, but let me address the revenue part.
So, yeah, obviously there are number of, and it's a little complicated with the impact of VCE and also the impact of FX,
but let me kind of give you a couple of perspectives, because Zane told you exactly how much each of them were. So,
if you kind of normalize them out, and I realize that's only a piece of theory rather than actual, but you normalize them
out and actually the storage business will be growing faster in 2015 in constant currency than it was in 2014, and I
actually also see a gross margin improvement in 2015 versus 2014, when you normalize them out as well. So perhaps
that's the best way to think about the moving parts, and if there's more specifics, we can take that in a follow-up
question.
<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: All right. Thanks, Maynard. Next question please.
Operator
Our next question is from Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Your line is open.
<Q - Aaron C. Rakers>: Yeah, thanks for taking the question. I'm going to build on that a little bit. When you take all
the emerging pieces and you strip out the $2 billion in revenue, you strip out VMware, it really looks like, by my math,
the core business looks to be in declining anywhere from 3% to 5%. So first of all, is that math correct and how are you
thinking about the goalpost of that $2 billion with regard to that dilution to the EPS line, when do you think that
becomes neutral to positive to the overall EPS story?
<A - David I. Goulden>: Why don't we start with the second part of the question, all right, which is why
[indiscernible] (44:37)? In terms of those five areas, those six areas, the answers to where they're going to go beyond
2015 is something we'll talk about at the forum, which we mentioned, so we're not going to get into that today.
On the normalization calculation, I mean, obviously there are a number of things going on inside of the business. If you
strip out everything that's growing, then obviously, you know, then certain parts of the business are up and certain parts
of the business are down. Remember what we talked about VMAX, we do expect that even though we're very excited
about the technology in VMAX3, a lot of new enterprise apps are going into different types of workloads that are more
suited to Hadoop and object storage systems, and that part of the business will actually be down a little bit less than it

was in 2014. So you've got to look at the puts and takes, but I think it's now a little bit unfair to strip out everything
that's growing and only look at what's left.
Then you've got to look at the portfolio and how we're shifting and how does the portfolio moves with a high
percentage towards the new areas, you actually see our growth rate picking up. It's really representative of the
transformation we've been doing of the business and how that transformation is now kind of showing through in terms
of accelerating revenues and improving gross and operating margins.
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: And let me add a little color. When our sales force goes in, they don't think about declining,
what's declining, what's growing. What they think about is what do the customers need? And then we have a whole
portfolio of products, and as you can see, that's our strength. And as we're doing that, you can also note that our gross
margins are doing well. So it's not that we're substituting free or low gross margin product for high gross margin
product, but that's the way we approach it. It truly is, as David said, the power event.
That is the power of EMC, is the fact that VMAX has a great fit in many, many of our customers but also along with
many time to XtremIO, along with many times to Scale IO. And the fact that we can do that and with the margin profile
that Zane laid out is, I think, our strength. You should not look at it, these are declining, that's all bad, this is all good.
It's kind of how does this work in terms of the customer set and it's working quite well.

Our next question is from Alex Kurtz with Sterne and Agee. Your line is open.
<Q - Alex Kurtz>: Yeah, thanks guys for taking the question. Just on the buyback, I think there is some expectation
going into this call and the analyst meeting the next couple of months here that the buyback may have been bigger,
based on Elliott's involvement, so can you just give us your thoughts on how you got to that number and whether or not
you could upside that during the year?
<A - Zane C. Rowe>: This is Zane. Thanks for the question. First off we obviously are benefiting from a strong
balance sheet and as Joe talked about, a lot of good investment in the company. So, as you mentioned, I think there are
expectations across-the-board on a buyback. We feel very comfortable with the flexibility we have. I mean, part of this
is about balance and it is about a philosophy that hasn't changed at the company. So it is a balanced approach to it. We
feel like we do have flexibility for a number of different options, should they arise through the course of the year.

Our next question is from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Your line is open.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Hi, many thanks. I was wondering, David, if you could flush out a little bit more on VCE
and talk about the strategy now that it's a consolidated within EMC. And specifically, Cisco has notional investment
there, might you broaden out to other networking vendors? When would you anticipate that profitability would improve
or is it always going to be a drag on margins? But if you could just flush out the strategy as you look at VCE that would
be helpful.
<A - David I. Goulden>: Well thank you, Keith. First of all we're very excited to have VCE as part of the family. We
talked about how rapidly it's been growing. It just logged up its seventh quarter of 50% plus bookings growth. And, of
course, CI is a very strategic piece of the infrastructure agenda going forward. So I think it's a great asset to have.

In terms of where we're going with it, a couple of points. First of all, we're very committed to the partnership with
Cisco, very committed to Vblocks, I mean, why change a good thing? That's working exceptionally well. So, we'll
continue to incorporate more technology from EMC, from VMware and also new technologies from Cisco as well. And
we don't really have any short-term plans to significantly broaden the portfolio. What we are focused on doing though
is bringing a lot of our convergence of structured assets together. So we used to run VSPEX as a separate program.
That's now part of the VCE. We're doing some new work rolling out next week around new converged lower-end, high
performed converged system. And that's now part of the VCE or. So it's really creating a consolidation place to bring
all of our converged infrastructure assets together and then leverage them more or closely.
And then finally from a margin point of view. I mentioned the fact that obviously compared to business as usual with,
as an impact for 2015. But I did want to re-enforce that if you look at the aggregate effect of VCE together, it does
punch the operating margin dollars in 2015 even though compared to business as usual, it's a little worse. And as the
business grows, we think we can continue to deleverage and improve our position.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay. Thank you, David.

Our next question is from Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Thanks. And yeah, my question is for David and Zane. Just in terms of maybe looking at
the guidance this way, let's strip out the impact of VCE, strip out the impact of VMware, the revenue growth of
predominantly [indiscernible] (50:35) information storage seems to be 2% to 3%. And the margins operating-wise
seems to be going down if I take out VCE and the impact of VMware. Is that the right way of thinking about it? And
I'm trying to think about [indiscernible] (50:49), David, versus your comments on the confidence this year, the storage
market reaccelerating, IT spending being better and gaining market share. I know currency is a headwind by probably a
couple of points as well. But it just seems like that guidance is either conservative or there's some caution built in.
Maybe I'm viewing the market wrong.
<A - David I. Goulden>: So, Kulbinder, I think you are missing a little bit. You're missing the impact of FX. So, you
can take out VCE, take out VMware, and I think you've also got to normalize for FX because for the EMC
infrastructure business, it's about 2.5% of revenue growth impact. So you back that out, and you actually find on a
constant currency. We expect the EMCI business to grow faster than it did in 2014. We expect the gross margins to be
better than they were in 2014. And we expect the operating margins to be better than they were in 2014. The FX impact
is not insignificant. 2.5 points of revenue, basically about 70 points of gross margin, about 80 points of operating
income when you look at just EMC II, so that's the way you need to think about it. So it basically does deploy a story
that we expect the storage market to do a little bit better in 2015. We expect the EMC Storage business to do better in
2015, and we expect to do better in the storage market in 2015.

<A - David I. Goulden>: Yeah. I mean basically the stock is doing considerably better than its last – I think on the
back of a lot of news, mostly related to currency, tech has had some pretty bad days, so we're looking at tech in a bit of
a trough. Basically, you know Elliott has been a good shareholder and very constructive. We've had a lot of dialogues.
There's – we have tremendous potential. And I think the forum on the 10th is going to be important. We're not going to
talk about structure, just to kind of address what probably everybody's thinking, but we are going to talk a lot about the
options we have, our strategies, our products, why we can win, some of the actions we will take. And I think you'll see
that we're doing a lot better than almost all the companies that were born in our era so to speak. And we had a
consistent growth. We've got great opportunities in our investments. And I think a lot of what people want to know is
exactly when did these kind of headwinds on these investments we make will become tailwinds and those are the kind
of things we'll lay out for you and why we think we can win in the market.
So again, we have a very open dialogue with Elliott as we do with a lot of shareholders, and I think a lot – there's a lot
of attention and I think the 10th will give you a lot of the answers you want. But we're not going to – just again, we're
not talking about structure on the 10th, we're talking about our products and our options and how we can win.

Comes from Jayson Noland with Robert Baird & Company. Your line is open.
<Q - Jayson A. Noland>: Great. Thank you. I wanted to follow up on the emerging growth portfolio. There's lots of
new and impressive up-and-comers, hyper-converged, and efficiency-based technologies, companies that are taking a
lot of share, David. Are you happy with the portfolio as it sits right now and just basically wondering if there's an
acquisition that needs to be made here or is it more of a tuck-in and build from – build internally?
<A - David I. Goulden>: Jason, I mean I'm really happy with what we're doing in that emerging area. Again, 40%
growth in the quarter, 60% plus for the year, $2.3 billion business, now bigger than all the little guys put together in
that segment. I don't want to give away too much, but there will be a hyper-convergence theme around our
announcement next week in terms of an area where we're going to play aggressively ourselves. So we think we've got
the key assets. We're doing more joint work with VMware to bring some new solutions together. So I feel really good
about where we are.
You can now look across the segment in the emerging area. We are the market leader in all the segments we could play
in. We've done incredibly well with XtremIO. I think we'll do incredibly well with our new solutions as well.

government sequestering and lots of things and now with the fold-in of VCE, could you kind of update us on what
normal seasonality is, kind of not only for Q1 but I guess just normal for your full year?

more efficient will have an impact on what we would call sort of new normal or a typical revenue profile through the
course of the year. And what we try to do is just help you out and give you a sense of what impact that would have on
revenue with the new normal being 22% of our – of a full year, revenue coming in the first quarter and that's a swap
from the fourth quarter, so it's a point off where you would historically see our percent of revenue mix in the first
quarter and that's a trade off with the fourth quarter which will obviously increase the opposite amount.
And then the remaining two quarters are roughly flat if you were just to think of that profile through the course of the
year.
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: Correct, from a percentage point.
<A - David I. Goulden>: Jim, just to add to that, just to help a little bit on what we said about Q1. Remember we kind
of started our change in order fulfillment process this time last year and you saw we had little bit more than 22% in Q1
last year because we didn't quite complete those changes until Q2, so we can now explain to you that we actually got
there and we talked about 22% is what we expected last year. We overshot a little bit last year but we've now kind of
locked in more of that 22% level for this year.

leadership transitions at EMC. You've talked publicly about February plus or minus a few months in terms of being a
transition. Obviously the standstill agreement with Elliott had a date inscribed to it as well around September. So I'm
wondering, a) if the two are related in any way and b) if you can provide an update on how we should be thinking about
leadership transition at EMC in the near term. Thank you.
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: Sure. Thanks, Toni. You know I think I've been inconsistent and basically because I, with the
board, they gave me a contract that ends sometime in February. I think a lot of there was a lot of focus. I tried to say
that February was a guidepost. And I said it could be couple months or couple quarters earlier, which obviously was
not, and it could be a couple months, couple quarters, a few quarters later and then I've also said that the board has
talked to me, and I would look favorably upon staying on as an involved Chairman, not the CEO but involved
Chairman for a longer period than that. So basically this is still within the guidelines. I mean I'm not – I don't want nor
does the board agree with that and that we're not going to put another date with another contract. I'm serving at the will
of the board, the will of all the employees here, and of course the will of our shareholders. And I'm really excited about
our opportunities and our prospects. So it's not directly related to Elliott but it's just kind of what we're going to do to
make sure everything is as smoothest succession we could possibly have here, Toni.
<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: Thanks, Toni. We'll have a few concluding comments from Joe now. And then we'll
end the call. Thanks.
