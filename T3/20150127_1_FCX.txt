On the call today are Jim Bob Moffett, Chairman of the Board; Richard Adkerson, Vice Chairman, President and CEO;
Jim Flores, Vice Chairman and CEO of Freeport-McMoRan Oil and Gas; with several other from our senior team here
today joining the call. I'll start by briefly summarizing our financial results and then turn the call over to Richard who
will review our recent performance and outlook using the slides, web materials that are on our website. As usual after
our remarks we'll open up the call for questions.
Today FCX reported a net loss attributable to common stock of $2.9 billion or $2.75 per share for the fourth quarter of
2014. There are a number of special items in the quarter which are detailed in the press release. The net loss attributable
to common stock included net charges of $3.1 billion or $3 per share in the fourth quarter, primarily associated with a
reduction in the carrying value of oil and gas properties pursuant to SEC full cost accounting rules, and goodwill
impairment charges as further detailed in the press release.
These were partly offset by non-cash mark-to-market gains on oil and gas derivative contracts and a net gain from the
sale of the Candelaria and Ojos mining operations which were completed in the fourth quarter. Copper sales totaled 972
million pounds in the quarter and 3.9 billion pounds for the full year. Gold sales were 377,000 ounces in the fourth
quarter and 1.25 million ounces for the year 2014. Our oil and gas sales totaled 12.1 million barrels of oil equivalents in
the fourth quarter and were 56.8 million barrels of oil equivalents for the year.
Our average realized prices for copper during the quarter were $2.95 per pound. That was below the year-ago period of
$3.31 per pound. Gold prices averaged $1,193 per ounce, below last year's fourth quarter of $1,220 per ounce. And our
average realized price for crude oil in the fourth quarter was $78.02 per barrel which included $7.77 per barrel of
realized cash gains on derivative contracts. Operating cash flows for the quarter totaled $1.1 billion; capital
expenditures totaled $1.8 billion. As previously announced, we completed the sale of our interest in Candelaria for $1.8
billion in cash during November. We ended the year with total debt of $19 billion, and the consolidated cash position
totaled $464 million.
I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard who will be referring to the materials in our slide presentation.
Richard C. Adkerson
Good morning, everyone, and we're thinking about all of you on the East Coast dealing with this snow storm. It's even
raining here in Phoenix, so it's a strange year in a lot of ways. We're going to focus today on our company's response to
the new commodity price environment we're having to deal with. The situation we face now in some ways is mindful of
2008 when the price of copper dropped 60% in just a quarter and a half. Beginning mid-year in 2014 we saw the
significant drop in oil prices, and oil dropped about 50% during 2014. Then in the fourth quarter we saw copper prices
drop, and copper prices dropped almost 20% in the fourth quarter and then going into this year we're seeing further
drops.
Now, what does this mean to us overall? One thing, we're having to change our focus from our previously-stated debt
reduction targets by 2016 because under these commodity prices those targets are unrealistic. We will be seeing higher
cash flows from our mining business as we complete projects and add volumes and reduce CapEx. And we see 2015 as
a bridging year to get us to higher cash flows that we have before us even without increases in commodity prices. We
want to emphasize we're not backing away from our objectives of reducing leverage, and going forward we're going to
continue to prioritize debt reduction.
We have a track record as a company of taking necessary actions and executing plans to maintain financial strength
during periods of weak commodity prices, and that's what we want to talk about today. We're prepared to deal with
whatever commodity price environment we have to live with. In many ways there is a disconnect today, kind of unlike
2008, between the current fundamentals of the marketplace and what we're seeing with commodity prices. But the
market is what the market is, and we're not developing plans that's based on and assumed near term quick recovery in
prices. So that's kind of setting the stage for what we want to talk with you about today and be prepared to answer any
of your questions about it.

Turning to slide three, we have made good progress in this moving towards achieving higher volumes from our
business. The Morenci expansion is complete following the completion of the Tenke expansion earlier, and the
Morenci is expected to reach full rates in the first quarter of this year. The Cerro Verde expansion is physically more
than 50% complete. We've incurred a lot of the cost and contracted for other costs. We have a substantial construction
project going on there. To-date it's going well, and we're targeting a 2016 startup of Cerro Verde.
The Lucius project operated by Anadarko, that we're a significant investor in, has achieved his first oil production in
this month. We had a successful production test at our Highlander project in South Louisiana that Jim will be talking
about, and positive drilling results in our deepwater projects at Holstein Deep and Power Nap. We as previously
reported completed the sale of our Caldelaria project in Chile. We had a successful $3 billion senior note offering
which essentially allowed us to repay all of our 2015 maturities and also to retire some higher coupon debt.
We are today talking about a plan to take aggressive actions in response to these commodity prices. We are cutting our
capital expenditures in 2015 by $1.5 billion, that's over a third decrease in our oil and gas CapEx. And we engaged in a
project, a process to obtain third party funding for some of our Gulf of Mexico development project. Things that this
company has done before, and we'll be talking about how we've been using that to mitigate our capital expenditures
further. Kathleen reviewed the financial highlights on page four and I won't repeat those. Those are there for your
purposes. You can see that our unit cash cost are in line with our guidance for the year at about $1.50 a pound.
Turning to page five, I mentioned the status of our expansion projects. The three projects that we undertook to
substantially increase our volumes are on track. Our capital expenditures will be declining. We'll have substantial free
cash flows beyond 2015. And in the oil and gas business we've had strong operational performance. Our efforts
continue to identify substantial resources that will be the basis for future growth with lower risk development
opportunities, and we're reducing spending in response to today's conditions without eliminating that opportunity for
future growth.
And you can see in these charts just how significantly, suddenly and recently commodity prices have dropped. We had
roughly two years of copper prices that bounced around between $3 and $3.50. Before this drop we had three years of
oil prices where Brent was over $100, and then this sudden change, as I said in many ways, appears to be disconnected
from the current fundamentals of our business. Note, on the copper chart, on the left side of the page, our stock price of
course in directionally follows the movement in copper prices. But I think the gold exchange stock is one indication of
this disconnect between today's prices and fundamentals.
Historically, in weak economic times, exchange stocks and inventory sales by consumers will be increasing. And today
while we've seen a recent relatively small uptick in global exchange stocks, they're still low by historical perspectives,
and certainly not rising to the point that would indicate a drop in prices like we've seen.
Page six talks about what our current focus is, and that's protecting our balance sheet. We've completed $5 million of
asset sales. We reduced CapEx. We've, as I mentioned, did this bond financing to strengthen our liquidity. We are
continuing, as we speak today, to work with our management team, and we'll be working hand and glove with our
board on a real-time basis as we go forward into 2015 to decide what further actions need to be taken.
We'll be monitoring the state of commodity prices, the performance of our business, how we're doing in terms of
meeting these plans, completing our project at Cerro Verde, for example. We are looking for partners to help provide
funding for our CapEx in the Gulf of Mexico, as I mentioned. We're working with our bank group and holders of our
bank term loans about dealing with issues that would further improve our financial flexibility. We're in good shape
now, but we want to make sure that we are taking every step to stay that way as we go forward.
In Indonesia, as we work with the government to get our contractor work issue resolved, we just this week signed an
extension of the MOU that we had signed last July. And in that MOU, we responded to a very strong position of
Indonesian government about the advancement of development of a smelter in Indonesia. And we are working with
partners and with site preparation and construction plans to go forward, that in conjunction with getting a resolution of
our contract situation.

As we look forward as to what we are planning to do, we're presenting a plan for you here today, and that plan involves
reduced CapEx, reduced cost, and pursuit of capital expenditures where it's economically rational for us to do so. The
plan we're presenting to you today involves a continuation of the payment of our current cash dividends to our
shareholders. We'll be working with our board to review all aspects of our financial policy and our financial planning
as we go forward. And I think you can see, judge from our past history that our board is going to be prepared to do
what's necessary to protect the liquidity of this company.
Page seven shows the cost reductions and deferrals that are planned today, involves a significant reduction of $1.5
billion of capital expenditures with $1.2 billion of that coming in the oil and gas business. And we're taking advantage,
every opportunity that we can, of achieving cost reductions in all of our global operations. Particularly our mining
business, lower oil prices is leading to lower cost and also lower commodity prices. In terms of some of our input costs,
it's also giving us the opportunity to achieve a lower cost structure, and we're going to take every advantage of that that
we have.
The strength of this company and the strength of Freeport-McMoRan lies in our long term assets, and those remain in
place. And as a company we remain highly positive about the future outlook of our business even as we deal with the
current situation. We have substantial long-lived reserves both in our mining business and our oil and gas business.
These reserves are in a diverse portfolio of world scale copper assets, and strategic position in the Gulf of Mexico
taking advantage of existing underutilized and well-placed infrastructure. We have a very large valuable resource
potential.
In copper we have over 100 billion pounds of proved and probable copper reserves at $2 copper, and roughly that same
amount of mineralized material at a $2.20 price range, and additional resources beyond that. So we have within our
company the resources for long-term profitability and growth, and in the same way in the oil and gas business our
resource base is very large and gives us a basis to have future growth there.
Now, talking about the copper business, I referenced the fact that there's an apparent disconnect now between the
copper price and market fundamentals. Clearly the market is trading on the basis of the oil price decline and the impact
generally on commodity prices. Traders are looking at the relative values of metals in relation to oil. They're looking at
the relative value of copper in relation to other metals. And what we've seen is a significant decrease in prices, but
inventories remain low.
The fundamentals of our business in dealing with customers remains relatively strong. The market is relatively tight.
And from a supply standpoint, the consensus expectations of very large surpluses that were expected in 2014 have not
materialized. This surplus expected in 2015 appears to be much smaller than anticipated. Supply is coming on slower.
Disruptions are more frequent. And beyond 2016, the market remains to be uncertain.
All of this reflects the global macro economic, political uncertainty that we see around the world. China is in a slower
situation, but the government is responding with economic stimulus. And, in fact, there's a lot of positive things in
China. Imports rose by 12% year-on-year in 2014 and set records at the end of the year. Domestic cathode production
set new records in November and December. State grids announced an increase of 9% in their spending next year. And
so even though China's growth rate is slowing, it's still consuming a lot of copper. In the U.S., the fundamentals are
stable. Despite the price volatility our customers are continuing to have confidence in their business going forward.
Supply side issues still significantly underlie this market. As I said, the forecast for large surpluses has not materialized.
Exchange stocks are low. New projects are facing delays. As you read fourth quarter earnings reports and announces
you'll be struck by the number of production declines that are being announced around the industry. Grades are falling.
People are constraining CapEx. All of this will be very supportive of copper prices as we go forward. Lower prices is
taking a lot of scrap out of the marketplace and that's going to be supportive of prices. So we continue to see long-term
fundamentals. The stronger dollar is an issue for the marketplace, and that's one thing about it.
Now, I want to refer to page 10 which is a chart I've used before. But just to put all this in perspective about what the
world is going to need for copper. The top chart is total copper consumption. This includes consumption of directly
used scrap in addition to consumption of refined metal. And if you assume a growth of 2.5% over the next 10 years,

and that embeds a growth rate in China that's half of the growth rate over the last 10 years, the market is going to
require another 7.6 million tonnes of copper. And over this same period, existing mines are going to decline.
[ph] We can't (20:52) expects existing mines to decline by over 3 million tonnes. So that's 10.7 million tonnes shortfall
that's going to be made up – need to be made up over the next 10 years by expansions, new projects, and scrap. To put
that number in perspective, in 2014 the top 10 mines in the world are estimated to produce less than 5 million tonnes.
So the requirement for the next 10 years are twice the annual production of the 10 largest mines in the world. We have
to get through this current situation, but the fundamentals of our market are very positive and we're very optimistic
about it.
Page 11 shows our mining unit production cost experience for the fourth quarter, roughly in line with what we had
guided to in our third quarter earnings release. It does reflect the sale of the Candelaria operations in early November,
and it does reflect in Indonesia some higher royalties and export duties that we have agreed to pay in connection with
these MOUs that we signed. But you can see that our cost experience continues to be positive. Cerro Verde is in the
stage of full-blown construction now. We have 12,000 to 14,000 workers there to have a project that will be the world's
largest concentrating facility. This construction is advancing, expected to be completed late in 2015, and we've incurred
roughly three-quarters of the cost of the project to-date.
As we looked at constraining capital, quickly it was clear that delaying Cerro Verde was not economic for our company
because of the stage of the project, the amount of money that's spent and the coming volumes beginning in 2016 and
going forward. We're going to be focused on managing the completion of that project. In Indonesia, we continue to
engage in active discussions with the new government being led by Joko Widodo to amend our contract or to extend
our right to operate beyond 2021, the expiration of the existing contract or the initial term of the existing contract.
We've approached this process with an aim of keeping a positive long-term partnership in Indonesia. We're focused on
working with the government for the economic development of Papua and to provide significant benefits to the overall
Indonesian economy. Our existing contract continues in place as we speak, and we are focused as we go forward in
being responsive to the aspirations of the government, the people of Indonesia, and taking into consideration our need
for assurance of legal and physical terms to support the major investments that we're making.
The MOU that we signed last July has been extended until July of 2015. We this week got approval to continue to
export. We had a six-month license which needed to be renewed, and it has been renewed. And as I mentioned, we're
advancing plans for the new smelter project in parallel with our COW amendment, and we're all focusing on Papua
development during this process. At Grasberg we've completed development to the access to our underground ore
bodies and continuing with development of the Grasberg Block Cave and the Deep MLZ mines. So development
capital of almost $3 billion has been spent to-date in total, $2.3 billion to Freeport, and our share of development
capital is expected to average $700 million a year over the next five years.
This is an important project as this replaces the production coming out of the Grasberg pit. The pit is now expected to
extend until the end of 2017 roughly. That's been delayed somewhat by the labor issues we faced in recent times. Just
let me say, we're making progress with those now and expect during the first quarter to return to normal levels of
operations. While we're not spending significant capital on further development projects in the mining business, we are
continuing our studies on the potential for a very large-scale expansion at El Abra, or the further expansion of our
Tenke Fungurume project in the Congo where operations are going well.
Then we have a resource that provides us optimism about future long term growth. And in our U.S. mines where we
have large sulfide resources at our Bagdad mine in Northwest Arizona and the Safford/Lone Star mine where we have
an enormous resource. All these things are the future for our company, and we're continuing studies without spending
current capital on the projects.
Jim, I'll turn the mic over to you and let you talk about oil and gas business.

Thank you, Richard. Good morning. And 2014 was an outstanding year operationally for the oil and gas business,
primarily the fourth quarter. We successfully rotated out of the low margin shale project. We had one of the better shale
plays out there in the Eagle Ford, and now they're under a lot of pressure, obviously, with the low prices. But in that
rotation we were able to increase interest in our high margin areas like the Gulf of Mexico, mainly increased interest in
Lucius and Heidelberg with excellent revenues during the year of $4.1 billion, cash operating margin of $2.9 billion,
and almost 57 million barrels of oil equivalent in production of sales in 2014.
The drilling results we had in the fourth quarter in mainly successful Holstein Deep, Dorado, King and Power Nap are
all four significant new development opportunities for our company. They're also the first three truly development
projects adjacent to our world-class infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico that gives us all the operating leverage and the
high margins to our business.
The aspect of the long-term play of Freeport-McMoRan oil and gas of developing resources in and around our existing
infrastructure and driving production and reserves higher, while reducing our costs because most of our costs there are
fixed, is off to a great start. Although we were obviously going to take action here to reduce our CapEx exposure
because of the low commodity prices. Operationally, the plan is working just perfectly.
On the ILT, the Inboard Lower Tertiary/Cretaceous, our significant discovery in Highlander, we've significantly – we
were able to flow test the Highlander well at 43.5 million cubic feet of gas a day. The first production below 29,000
feet in the Gulf Coast on shore, and we were able to prove that we have a large gas reserve there in Highlander. And I'll
talk a little bit about that going forward.
In California, with excellent execution, drilled over 177 wells with over 100% success ratio, as expected. So all in all,
we were rolling out of 2014 looking forward with a lot of optimism of 2015, until page 17 the price of oil fell out of
bed, and the market gone down 50%, 60%. This is unexpected from a lot of people's standpoint. We thought oil would
get a little soft but we had no idea it would find a mind of its own and create this kind of calamity.
The oil and gas market is under severe stress. Our business is healthy as anybody's out there because of the rotation out
of the shales, and so we actually have economic projects to go forward on. At the same point in time with our cash flow
impaired and the ability of the company from a standpoint of funding its obligations, we need to raise some capital.
And the way we do that is take our development projects and find outside funding just like we did in 2008, you'll see
the drop.
In 2008, 2009, we were in the same situation and we took our Lucius project right after the financial crisis and we were
able to do some project financing there. It's a nice rate of return for our investors and as well us. We basically got 75%
of the project free of charge going forward, and it just came on production, as Richard said, here in January this year.
So we're going to repeat that financing going forward. And the only way we can do that is because the strength in
economics of the projects and the operational leverage of time back to our facilities to where the investors feel like they
have a great shot at buying the oil low and with good execution and be a part of a great project that will enjoy the oil
prices at a higher level in the future. So we're in a unique position to raise that funding and also having done it before,
and I'll go over Lucius case study in a second.
The other operational highlights. The steady production performance of California. We completed our maintenance at
Marlin. We sold 12.1 million barrels of sales in the fourth quarter. Cash operating margin was about $0.5 billion and
$64 million worth of net hedging – realizations of our hedge book. It does extend in the 2015 with about, I think, the
mark on that's about $500 million of [ph] deposit (31:41) right now.
Responding to market conditions. We've gone through a significant capital reduction, 34%, of $1.2 billion of
announced CapEx cuts. That's basically from our previous $3.5 billion budget at 2.3%. And when you're making these
budgets based on risk success, when you go through a fourth quarter when every well works, obviously you expect
your budget to increase the following year. So it's a direct $1.2 billion discount or reduction in CapEx to 34%, but in
real terms it's probably much higher than that based on the success and the development that would cause, because we
obviously had it risked in our budget. It all rolls over in a 43% discount in our capital spending in 2016 of $1.7 billion.
Now the development joint ventures we're going to be talking about will be in addition to these reductions. And we'll

go through that and that's where talking about defer into discretionary spending.
We'll focus on our highest priority projects. Anything marginal or anything discretionary, anything kind of out on the
frontier has been shelved. And when you reduce spending this much, you slow growth and you preserve the resource
value for the future better price when economics are better. It's just the function of reducing capital and reducing
activity. And then lever the past success with [ph] third-party (33:14) funding arrangements. And that's what page 20,
the Lucius case study, is all about.
We had discovered Lucius, drilled a couple of delineation wells and established the reserve, and we basically project
financed it with $450 million of 8% convertible preferred into a 20% equity positions. With warrants and everything
else, then it'd be about 25% at the end of the day. And with a $300 million bank revolver at that subsidiary level that
allowed us to fund all the development at Lucius. It basically came in on time and on budget. And this is where we had
a third-party operator, it was right after the financial crisis. And at the time we did the funding, well, the moratorium
for drilling in the Gulf of Mexico was still in place post the Macondo deal.
This situation we have going forward, we have projects that come on in 18 months to 24 months that come on much
faster. There, we're a operator. We own 100%. We have the equipment in place, the plan in place to execute on. So
we're in a much better position physically and operationally, and interest rates are much lower to repeat this financing
going forward. We had these thoughts in mind anyway going forward because we'd sold our Eagle Ford production,
and our cash flow is going to be down in the oil and gas sector of our company, so we just accelerated those plans. We
can do this multiple times.
We're going to do it at Holstein and Heidelberg. Those are two developments we went out with first. Then we're going
to King and Marlin, and then far and out we can continue every successful resource that we establish. We can project
finance this, we think, at very favorable rates to the company. And really highlight the true value of our exploration
business to our company versus just developing the reserves on our balance sheet to be able to leverage that part of the
business.
Page 21 is the list of these projects we're talking about. Holstein Deep and Heidelberg, one's green and one's blue, will
be in our initial joint venture. We've already done Lucius and then we have, in the black, Dorado, King and then we
expect to drill Kilo/Oscar, and the rest of them in mid-2015. Power Nap is part of our Vito project, which is a great
validation of our Vito acquisition last year. It's the first exploratory well out of that [ph] sale (35:42) that strong
portfolio and is down to fantastic reservoirs. So we're off to a great start establishing our inventory for our development
joint venture as a result to drive those high returns to the shareholders.
I mentioned earlier about the Inboard Lower Tertiary/Cretaceous update and Highlander. This is a significant geologic
and engineering milestone. It is still producing gas below $3, so economically challenged. Therefore, we're idling most
of this, not all of this activity this year and to see what happens with better gas prices. Highlander well should be on
here in the first quarter. On production, we're going to be monitoring that closely and pressures and so forth, but all
indications we have truly validated a significant reservoir in the gas business, but we need better economics to go to the
width and obviously the best economics and best cash flow are going to be in the oil side of our business in the Gulf of
Mexico. So a great success and the team got a long time coming on the flow test and the success and then we'll deal
with it and develop it when the prices are a little bit better.

All right. Thanks, Jim. Now, before we get to questions we'll take a view of our 2015 outlook. On slide 23 is our sales
outlook which is for copper, gold, molybdenum and oil, consistent with our previous guidance. Unit costs of $1.53 for
copper, $18 a barrel equivalent for oil is also consistent. Operating cash flows, and I'll show other analysis of this, at
$2.60 copper and $50 oil, our plan would provide $4 billion of operating cash flows, each $0.10 of copper is $350
million of variance in that.

Our current plan for capital expenditures is $6 billion. That's a reduction from $7.5 billion of earlier guidance. And this
does not reflect the participation contributions to be made under these arrangements that we are currently pursuing that
Jim talked to you about of where we're looking for partners and project-type financing to come in for our development
in the Gulf of Mexico.
Page 24 shows our production outlook, and I mentioned earlier the growing volumes that we'll be seeing in our
business beyond 2015. 2015 shows 4.3 billion growing to 5.4 billion. You can see increasing volumes of gold as we get
closer to the bottom of the pit, our completing mining at Grasberg and our volumes for molybdenum.
And oil and gas sales, quarterly sales this year, the first quarter is expected to be our weakest quarter from a volume
standpoint. That's just a function of our mine plans and as a ramp-up of our labor issues. But by the end of the year, we
would see increasing growing in copper sales throughout the year.
Our sales by region are shown on page 26. The growth in North America is primarily Morenci. The decline in South
America primarily reflects the sale of Candelaria. And you can see Indonesia growing as a result of improved
productivity from our labor group.
Our unit costs for 2015 are detailed on slide 27. Notably we see a decrease in our site production and delivery costs on
a unit basis from $1.90 to $1.81. But that is offset by higher royalties and export duties, for instance, in Indonesia, but
still at a very attractive rate in the $1.50 range.
Now EBITDA analysis, cash flow analysis is shown on page 28. We show a variation, again, with oil at $50 and copper
varying between $2.50 and $3.50. This is an average of 2016 and 2017. You can see cash flows of $6.4 billion a year
average at $2.50 and over $8 billion at $3.00.
Sensitivities are on page 29. Our biggest sensitivity, of course, is copper price. $0.10 change is $350 million on cash
flow. For oil, $5 is $150 million in cash flow. So those are going to be key factors we're going to be watching as we go
forward.
Page 30 shows our declining capital expenditures going from projected $6 billion in 2015 to just over $5 billion in
2016. Again repeating, this does not reflect the plans that we're on right now to have a significant portion of these cash
flows in the oil and gas business fund through participation by third parties. So that is our plan.
I mentioned earlier, our strong commitment to a strong balance sheet management. At year-end, we had no borrowings
under our $4 billion bank credit facility. We also have a separate $1.8 billion line of credit at Cerro Verde to help fund
that project along with the cash flows. This project is generating from its current operations. We had $425 million
drawn under that separate facility at the end of the year, but that's another aspect of our balance sheet management.
We have a strong resource base, strong cash flows and capital discipline. We're taking the steps already to deal with
this current situation and we're going to be responsive to what we have to deal with. And as I said, this is going to be a
real-time effort working hand-in-glove with our Board to make decisions as we go forward.
In summary, we're going to protect our balance sheet and liquidity and we're going to complete our near-term mining
projects, continue with our oil and gas investments where that makes economic sense, work on these third-party
investments with the primary goal imperative of preserving this really attractive and large long-term asset base for the
future benefit of our company.
So with that we will open the line for questions, and Jim Bob, Jim and I are here with Kathleen to respond to whatever
questions you might have.

Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question
will come from the line of Michael Gambardella with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael F. Gambardella>: Hi. Yes, good morning, Richard.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Hey, Mike.
<Q - Michael F. Gambardella>: In the past, I mean since you made the oil and gas acquisitions few years back,
you've consistently said that the oil and gas part of your business would be self-funding. And I know you talked to a
little bit about how you've done some of those things in the past, but do you still think you'll be self-funding for 2015?
And given what you see right now and how specifically do you plan to address that?
<A - James C. Flores>: Mike, this is Jim. That's a target. It's going to be difficult to be totally self-funding with the
horrific drop in prices. And our plan was to be self-funding to replace the revenues that we did not have in 2015 due to
the sale of the Eagle Ford. So we're moving toward additional funding sources and so forth, but it's going to be a
challenge to make it dollar for dollar. Hopefully, we can raise about $900 million in this first development joint venture
off of the $2.3 billion to get close to it, but I know even though it's January, I'm optimistic we can get another one done
as well, but we'll see what the market holds. But we're going to try to offset as much as we can.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: And Mike, I mentioned here in my comments that we're having to deal with this sudden
change in the cash flows from just how quickly prices are moving, not for oil and gas but also for copper now. And
2015 is a bridge year. I mean we're going to have higher volumes in 2016, so the way we're looking about this issue
about our goals for oil and gas funding and so forth, and for managing our balance sheet is really how we deal with this
over a two-year period.
We have the financial flexibility to do it, but that's really the focus of where we're getting to. We're going to be
monitoring and see what prices do and so forth, but that's really the way we're looking at it. That's our long-term goal.
Our long-term goal remains for oil and gas to be self-funding. It builds assets. In longer run, it's going to be, with
success, it's going to be generating substantial cash flows.
<Q - Michael F. Gambardella>: And could you talk a little bit, just staying on the oil and gas side, how you could
turn the growth back on for oil and gas, because you've cut it pretty dramatically here also?
<A - James C. Flores>: Well, the outside funding, as I said, that turns the growth back on. We share some of that
growth. So it will be muted, but say it'll be 75% of the growth that we had before once we're able to secure these
financings and show some visibility there. So by year-end, we could have couple of these things done and returning
growth back on, but it wouldn't be as high as it was before, because obviously we're sharing some of that growth with
our investors that are putting up the money.
<Q - Michael F. Gambardella>: Right. Okay. Thank you.
<A - James C. Flores>: No problem.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Thanks, Mike.

Your next question comes from the line of Tony Rizzuto with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.
<Q - Tony B. Rizzuto>: Thanks very much. And yeah, it is good to see the response to these deteriorating market
conditions. And just a follow-up to Mike's, thinking about on the mining side, are there other mining assets that you
deem to be noncore in nature?

<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Tony. I'm sorry. Tony, when you look at our mining assets, the bulk of those assets are
existing producing mines that have significant undeveloped resources that we believe are going to be much more
valuable in the future. The reason for selling Candelaria was, it was not one of those mines. It was a very good
operation, good production, fully developed, but it did not have the significant undeveloped resources that we have at
El Abra, Peru, Tenke and Cerro Verde, Tenke are in our U.S. assets.
So in that sense, those assets, the bulk of our assets, would be viewed as core and important for our business. We do
have some older mines in New Mexico. We're mining some at Miami. We're completing that, but those are really
operations that we are mining to manage our reclamation obligations and so forth.
Now we do have in the plans for dealing with our situation in Indonesia, plans to divest interest in PTFI over time.
We've indicated that the government that we would increase the Indonesian ownership in Indonesia to 30%. It's
currently 9.36%. Exactly how that will proceed is dependent on our progress with this MOU. The first step is to offer to
the government, and we talk about the possibility of a listing on the Indonesian Exchange, but that is one area of
divestment. Interest in our mining assets is strong. We would have the option of selling interest in those assets if that's
what we decided we wanted to, but they are core to our future.
<Q - Tony B. Rizzuto>: Okay. And just a follow up here. How important is maintenance of the dividend at the current
level? You talked about the bridge year 2015 in some previous conversations, and you obviously have some flexibility
around that. But just can you give us a little bit more color in how you view the maintenance of the current level of the
dividend?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, Tony, this is a Board decision. And as I said, we're going to be working very
closely on our Board on a real-time basis as we go forward. We have developed a plan now that includes the
preservation of the dividend. There's uncertainties about the future of commodity prices, and there's different views
about whether prices are going to rebound in the near-term and medium-term or – there's talk about oil prices staying
low or weakening. So all of those things are things we're going to have to work with our Board in keeping our finger on
top of it. And that is going to be a decision that the Board would make. And all I can say is right now, we've developed
a plan that preserves the dividend in this plan. And our expectation is the Board is going to take steps to preserve our
liquidity as we go forward. We all want to keep the dividend. And we're going to work hard to try to do it.
<Q - Tony B. Rizzuto>: Okay, Richard. And just a follow-up on a question for Jim. Jim, it sounds like the plans, at
least for the first tranche and first funding might be pretty advanced at this stage. Is that a fair assessment?
<A - James C. Flores>: Well, Tony, the success we've had in the past, we got great partners. We got a lot of interest,
and mainly because you think about what oil properties out there in this vast array. Just taking North America that
actually have economics at these levels, they're not the shales. And it had so much capital and there's a tremendous
amount of private equity capital that's unused out there. I think the [ph] bank is as time (51:44) as much as $100 billion
of unused capital and then fresh capital has just been raised. There's a lot of mezzanine capital. And that's backing a lot
of countercyclical investors that want to do just like we did at Lucius is buy oil when it's $50.
And so the [ph] media schedule (52:15) is robust. And we're not ruling out international players, [ph] stopping (52:07)
wells or those types of things. But having done this and having the makeup of our properties where we 100% control,
operate they're actually producing now. Taking away a lot of the operating risk and timing risk with these larger
projects is key to attract financing. So we're just going to be arguing about how much we give up as a company and
how much the investors need to get their returns. And that's a good healthy argument for a good transaction, I think. So
we're hitting the ground running.
And just think about this as a multiple way of financing. And irrespective of where oil prices are, it still gives us the
best rate of return as a company of identifying these assets and then financing the development with third parties to
drive higher returns for FCX. So we had these thought processes in mind, and but sure come in handy when prices do
what they just did.
<Q - Tony B. Rizzuto>: All right. Very helpful. Thank you very much, gentlemen.

Your next question comes from the line of Sal Tharani with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Sal Tharani>: Thank you. Richard, can you give us an idea of your write-down between the gas and oil assets for
MMR and PXP? How was it distributed?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: We follow full cost accounting, Sal. And under full cost accounting the original
acquisition cost of both PXP and McMoRan went into what's called a full cost pool. And then as we go forward, all
cost of exploration and development for oil and gas reserves go into that single pool. So all the costs are kind of like a
mix master. They just get all blended together, and then they're subject to a ceiling test that's prescribed by the SEC that
puts a limit on how much of those costs that can be capitalized.
And so in our write-down, there's two aspects to it. First of all, the cost in excess of this SEC ceiling amount has been
written off; and then in addition, there was goodwill assigned to the oil and gas assets and all of that goodwill has been
written off. So it's not possible to distinguish it between McMoRan and PXP, and this, of course, is a function of
pricing.
Under the SEC rules, they currently require that the prices used for these full-cost ceiling tests be a trailing 12-months
average. And so in our ceiling test, those costs, the oil price that was used was roughly $90. It's $95, actually,
Kathleen's telling me. And that's because that's a 12-month average. And as we roll into 2015, as we talk about in the
press release, and if prices stay low that average is going to come down and that would be indicative of further full-cost
write-offs going into 2015. All the goodwill is gone, so it's just a question of the ceiling test.
<Q - Sal Tharani>: Okay. And also, the cost decline on the unit, not the gross cash cost you have from 2014 to 2015.
I'm talking about this high production delivery cost, $1.90, $1.81...
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Right.
<Q - Sal Tharani>: ...is it all coming from the lower fuel or is there anything else in there also?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: No, it's lower fuel is a factor, but of course lower energy costs rolls into all other costs,
logistics and things like that from suppliers. But with commodity price dropping some of our costs are related to steel,
for example, the steel balls that we use in our grinding processing facilities, things, component parts for maintenance
and truck tires, there's across the board this change in the commodity price environment's affecting cost. And one of the
things we're doing is trying to make sure we take full advantage of that.
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: Yes, Sal. Further to that, we do forecast here the significant benefit from the lower diesel
prices. Offsetting some of that is, we do have higher consumption as we're mining higher rates, productivity, improving
in Indonesia, we're mining higher rates at Cerro Verde. So we do have some consumption offset. And then offsetting
that, we do have some improved volume. So you net all that together, and you see the decline from $1.90 to $1.81.
As Richard talked about, we believe there will be some additional benefit from other commodity index type of cost,
which we've reflected some of that in this plan but we expect to see, if commodity prices stay low, we expected to see
additional savings as we go throughout the year.
<Q - Sal Tharani>: Great. And lastly, Kathleen, can you give us an idea of your appetite for increased debt and how
the rating agencies will look at that you think?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: For increased debt?
<Q - Sal Tharani>: If you need to. If you need to, if the commodity prices remain low and you need to borrow some
money to pay for the shortfall. What is your appetite for that?

<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, our plan is to manage our business so that we don't increase debt. I mean we're
going to take steps as we can to improve the maturity schedule of our debt. There will be times because of the nature of
our business that we'll have some draws under our bank credit facility. So that's what our credit facility is for, to give us
bridges to deal with short-term issues, whether they come up from business risk or so forth.
But in terms of thinking about substantially increasing our debt level over time, that's not what we're focused on. We
still, as I started out saying, is we have plans of reducing our debt level, we're just not going to be able to do it within
the timeframe that we had originally targeted.
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: And 2015, Sal, is that bridging year. In terms of getting to the point where we see free cash
flows, substantial free cash flows, coming out of the mining business and then we've got these initiatives underway to
offset some of the CapEx in the oil and gas business. So you might see some increase in 2015, but that is not our plan.
Our plan over time is to take leverage down.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: And you've all seen that the credit rating agencies are focused obviously as you would
expect them to be on lower commodity prices and we're working with them and we're working with a plan to do
everything we can to preserve our credit ratings.
<Q - Sal Tharani>: Great. Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of David Gagliano with BMO. Please go ahead.
<Q - David Gagliano>: Hi. I just have a few quick clarification questions really. First of all, does the oil and gas
production targets, do those include an assumption of project financing?
<A - James C. Flores>: No, they do not. That will be added once we get the financing secured.
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: The CapEx and the production are both aggregate with no partner.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: With no partner at this point. So that's the baseline then you can build from there as we
announce next.
<Q - David Gagliano>: Okay, great. And then the operating cash flow numbers, are those before or after a minority
interest payment?
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: Those are before. The minority interest payments will come out of financing.
<Q - David Gagliano>: Okay, right. Okay so finance. And then last question, does the CapEx reflect any expectations
futures for potentially for a smelter in Indonesia?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: No, they're currently not in there. Our plans would be to develop as we did with the
smelter that we developed in the mid-1990s to do a structured financing for that project, which would be based on a
contract for TCs and RCs. And it would be a PTFI type contract for processing fees that would provide the basis for
financing. And then the amount of equity that would be required depends on the participation by the partners that we
put together with it, but it is not in there at this point.
<Q - David Gagliano>: Okay, great. All right. That's all I had. Thanks.

dropped to about 56 million barrels, 57 million barrels and now the math on that implies $41 per BOE of CapEx. Is this
a reasonable measure of sustained CapEx for the business, $41 BOE?
<A - James C. Flores>: No, because you've got different complexions of what's being spent and what didn't, because a
lot of the wells that are being drilled are being hooked up timely. So you're getting a muted production number. I would
use close to the $30 BOE is a reasonable run rate under our non-stress scenario. And, Brian, that's basically what
happens when we bring in third-party financing. We drop that number from $30 BOE to $20 BOE and get our cost in
line in a $50 BOE, $60 BOE oil environment. So that highlights the goal of what we're trying to do with the financing,
but $30 BOE is more representative of a real market.
<Q - Brian Hsien Yu>: Okay. So if you're spending at a $40 BOE rate then does that imply maybe at this rate in 2018
and 2019, we should see a growth in production of the oil and gas?
<A - James C. Flores>: If we didn't do any joint ventures that's correct. You'd be growing at a $20 BOE rate because
you'd just be completing wells and putting them on instead of drilling any, but you'd drilled them in the first couple
years. But our plan is to do the outside financing and take it from a $40 barrel rate, your number, down to $20 BOE and
grow the business with our partners, say 75/25.
<Q - Brian Hsien Yu>: Okay. And second was just on the outside finance team. If I looked at what happened with
Lucius, you sold 20% interest in the project but then the convertible preferred were backed by the parent company. And
if we take that same analogy then in a way doesn't that involve the mining assets again or is the plan to just limit any
kind of outside financing purely to the energy assets and not involve FCX, the parent company and the mining side?
<A - James C. Flores>: Brian, I'm not sure that was guaranteed by the parent company. I think you're reading through
something there.
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: It's at the subsidiary level, Brian. So there's not a guarantee.
<A - James C. Flores>: Yeah.
<Q - Brian Hsien Yu>: Oh! Okay. Yeah, I thought the party that purchased it they had some warrants to purchase PXP
common stock.
<A - James C. Flores>: Now the warrants were for the subsidiary.
<Q - Brian Hsien Yu>: They were subsidiary. Okay. Got it.
<A - James C. Flores>: That's why I said instead of – it's 20% face, but when you look at the full percentage of the
subsidiary they got 25%. I'm sorry. If I blended that I'm sorry. But it's all at the subsidiary level, to about 25%.
<Q - Brian Hsien Yu>: Got it. Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Oscar Cabrera with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - Oscar Cabrera>: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Just I want to get back to the question on the
dividend. Is there, in your lines of credit or a debt, any covenants that would limit you from paying the dividend if
commodity prices stay low, and were at a low end of your expectations in operating cash flow.
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: Oscar, this is Kathleen. There's not a specific covenant on the dividend. We have
maintenance covenants, financial covenants to maintain and that's all going into our plan. Richard mentioned we are
having some discussions about some flexibility with the covenants as we bridge through 2015, but there's not a specific
covenant on the dividend.

25% of, I'm assuming, cash flow on this well where you're expecting to get 50% of the CapEx. Can you just go over
that, please?
<A - James C. Flores>: When you said – let me tell you how it works [ph] until (01:06:21) I couldn't follow your
math, Oscar. Basically as a financial, we have $900 million of CapEx ahead of us at our Holstein Deep and Heidelberg.
We're asking investors to put up the 100%, putting up $900 million, and for that they'll get an X amount of return on
the capital they put up, plus a residual interest, probably in a note form of an override, and that would generate above
market returns for their capital, somewhere on the low end, 10% to 12%, on the high end, 16% to 20%, depending on
what oil prices do.
And there's a lot of capital out there that have contacted us, they want to do those types of things. We'll use that capital
once – and it's selling a piece of the growth, it's not selling our existing assets, existing cash flow, those types of things,
but it's helping us to accelerate the growth instead of just postponing spending and production performance, we're
actually going to be able to in effect accelerate it with the third party capital. That will all be at the subsidiary level.
And with the current – with the structures, they'll form equity at that level. So there won't be any debt to consolidate or
anything to FCX, and it's a great win-win for both parties and they get the upside of the oil on the piece they get, and
we get the upside of production of oil.
And one thing you'll see in oil and gas business, we've also affected our operating costs because if you're not growing
production, your operating costs are going to stay high or increase. One thing about doing the joint venture, we're able
to have more production go to the same facilities, and you'll see our operator, our LOE costs go down too. So the
purpose of lowering the CapEx cost through the joint ventures, and also increasing the production or accelerating the
development will also lower our operating costs. And [ph] it'll end up (01:08:19) getting our operating costs down
below $20 from where they are and in the low $20s from where they are in the high $20s now, and then we also have
our fixed G&A costs and so forth. And then you have our capital costs.
So we got our capital costs in the $20s, we got our operating costs in the low $20s, we're a $40, $45 cost environment
or expense environment in 2016. That's our goal on the gas side. And we can live and prosper in a $60 world. It's not as
fun as $100, but it's still – we got to right-size our costs, and this is the most aggressive and best way to do it.
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: And Oscar, one of the things that you can think of in terms of this funding is we did it on
the mining side several years ago with the expansion at Grasberg where someone came in and funded the development.
We added volume and shared those volumes. So it's not exactly, but it's just another analog that you can think about
and help [indiscernible] (01:09:22).
<A - James C. Flores>: It's lot of different structures, lot of different deals, but the key about having is having quality
projects with good economics where you can do it. That's the big difference.
<Q - Oscar Cabrera>: Fair enough. Grasberg is 60%-40% with real [ph] tint of it (01:09:34). What would be the
attributable production then in the required CapEx? We just – you were looking at 80 million barrels, so are we looking
at 70 million now and an additional $1 billion in expenditures? What's the amount?
<A - James C. Flores>: I'll tell you what, Oscar, sign a CA and I'll send you a teaser and show you exactly what it is.
We're looking for investors. Seriously, there's a three-well development, a five-well development, a 10-well
development, depending on success. But it's somewhere between, call it net to FCX, between 30 million barrels and 70
million barrels.
<Q - Oscar Cabrera>: Okay. Great.
<A - James C. Flores>: Depending on the success.

Your next question comes from the line of John Tumazos, with John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Please go
ahead.
<Q - John C. Tumazos>: Thank you. The debt target had been $12 billion net looking forward a couple of years. Has
debt target changed? Should it be lower because you've divested some assets, impaired some assets, JV'ed some assets
and prices changed? Where do you think the debt target is going to be for 2016, 2018?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, John, I started out by saying that the change in copper and gold prices has really
result in us having to shift the focus from reaching any sort of debt target certainly in the 2016 timeframe to adjusting
our business to be responsive to much lower copper and oil prices. And that's what we're doing now. As we go through
this process, we'll have a longer-term goal of debt reduction in adjusting our balance sheet. But we're going to have to
see how the world evolves to say how we're going to respond to it, and it would just be impossible right now to set any
sort of debt targets within time frames. We'll be talking with all of you on a quarter-by-quarter basis and reporting to
you how we're responding to it. We're not backing away from our debt reduction objective and having a very strong
balance sheet is what we're going to do. It's just the realities are, we have to deal with the world that's put before us, and
that's the way we're going to approach it.
<Q - John C. Tumazos>: Thank you. It's tough times and we appreciate all your efforts.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, I appreciate that, John. As you know as well than anybody, we've been through
these several times before, and we were always aware that that's a possibility, and we've been preparing ourselves for it
and now it's our job to execute.
<Q - John C. Tumazos>: Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Littlewood with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Nathan D. Littlewood>: Good morning, guys. Thanks for the opportunity. Listen, I had a few more questions on
oil and gas as well. The first was just about the production and decline rates. You've given some really useful guidance
on what's required in this business to maintain output at that sort of mid-50%'s sort of level. But under a best scenario,
could you talk a little bit about what the unremediated decline rates look for each of these oil and gas assets?
<A - James C. Flores>: Well, just look at an average. Think about somewhere around 12%, 13% in our business, and
remember that with the timing of oil and gas coming on, spending, like we have some spending in our Vito project in
our budget that didn't come on till 2020. It's not a direct correlation to decline rates to capital being spent, there's some
different variations. But if you think about 12% decline rate in the business, that will get you kind of where you need to
be on the maintenance capital which will be lower than what you're seeing in our CapEx.
<Q - Nathan D. Littlewood>: Okay. And would the Gulf of Mexico number be a bit higher than that's?
<A - James C. Flores>: Use 13% to 14% there and use 4% to 5% in California.
<Q - Nathan D. Littlewood>: Okay.

<A - James C. Flores>: And that'll get you kind of there.
<Q - Nathan D. Littlewood>: Got you. Okay. And just on this whole funding side of things, obviously, at current oil
prices the underlying assumption here is that the oil and gas business is willing to lever up to spend the capital that
you've got planned here. What am I a little unclear on though is just how much further you're willing to leverage this
business up? I mean, how much further debt, how much more debt is appropriate here for this business to take on
before a more drastic change to the production outlook might be required?
<A - James C. Flores>: When you're saying lever up, Nathan, what are you talking about? Talking about CapEx spend
or are you talking about actually balance sheet debt?
<Q - Nathan D. Littlewood>: Well, the balance sheet debt. I mean, there's no way that this business can generate
anywhere near $2.3 billion in cash flow on $50 oil. So...
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: Right. What we're working to do is to obtain third party funding for some of these capital
expenditures, not in the form of debt but in the form of an equity participation by these investors in these projects. So
it's not leveraging up, it's sharing the CapEx with other third parties and sharing the economics of a development
activity.
<A - James C. Flores>: And try to drive a net neutral goal that I was trying to be clear. It's going to be difficult to do
that in 2015, but we think we'll be able to achieve it in 2016, just timing and capital inflows. So I guess the global
answer to your question, Nathan, is that we don't have much appetite at all to leverage it up, lever it all, we're going to
do whatever we can to not do that.
<Q - Nathan D. Littlewood>: Okay. Cool.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: I think this is important point to make because we're talking about joint venture
participations, not debt obligations of the consolidated group.
<A - James C. Flores>: That's correct.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: You're obviously giving up some of the equity in these assets at the asset level, but in
return because these projects have been put together, value has already been created in them, you'll have people willing,
and this kind of gets back to Oscar question, to pay more than their proportionate share of the forward cost because
they're compensating our company for all the good work we've done in identifying the assets, developing them to date,
presenting the opportunity.
<Q - Nathan D. Littlewood>: Okay. So these equity and JV opportunities, this is sort of independent of the $900
million, the Holstein and Heidelberg that was mentioned earlier. Is that correct?
<A - James C. Flores>: No, that is how we generate the $900 million.
<Q - Nathan D. Littlewood>: Okay.
<A - James C. Flores>: That's $900 of CapEx going forward in the Holstein and Heidelberg projects. We're going to
get through the development JV to fund that $900 million, which will reduce the $2.3 billion.
<Q - Nathan D. Littlewood>: Okay. So you're going from $2.3 billion to $1.4 billion, I guess, what I'm getting at is
that a $50 oil, there isn't $1.4 billion of cash flow coming out of the business.
<A - James C. Flores>: And then we're going to do the next one at Marlin and King to keep going, and I was trying to
make a point. I'm not sure it's all going to line up in the same year and Richard talked about it. It's really kind of the
two-year type of scenario to make sure that we get to a net neutral condition and...
<Q - Nathan D. Littlewood>: Okay.
<A - James C. Flores>: [indiscernible] (01:17:58). Then on top of that, these projects drive such good economics for
Freeport at any oil price, they're good business based on finding discoveries, to delineate them, and get somebody to

help develop them with us so we can drive higher returns for the shareholders. So it's kind of a continuation of a plan
we were discussing. It takes on greater importance now that you highlight because the cash flows are not there to fund
our projects right now. And so but it still drives better economics even in a higher oil price environment, that's all
[indiscernible] (01:18:31).
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: And keep in mind for 2015 if you're thinking about the numbers, we do have the puts in
place that really give us a higher realization than $50 for 2015. So we've got that $20 of price protection. We've got to
pay this, the put premiums of just under $7 a barrel. So our cash flows from oil and gas in 2015 will be higher than
what you would expect in the $50 market.
<Q - Nathan D. Littlewood>: Absolutely, indeed. Now, that's all really helpful. Thank you. So just one final question,
and I guess a higher level one here, your approach or attitude towards diversification of the business is a little bit
different to other diversified mining companies. I mean, if I look at some of your peers, they've all demonstrated a
willingness in the past to sort of subsidize unprofitable businesses with profitable ones for a period. I guess, Rio Tinto
with its iron ore and aluminum businesses is a pretty obvious and recent example.
It sounds that your approach towards these two businesses is as it was from the beginning, which is that, they're sort of
still two separate buckets; you've got a mining or copper bucket and an oil and gas bucket, and the two are sort of not
subsidizing one another. Just wondering if that is an approach that's necessarily set in stone going forward, I guess,
what I'm thinking about is some of the costs of capital that you're talking about here for external funding of the oil and
gas business seems to me to be significantly higher than the cost of capital that the copper business has got access to at
the moment, and the copper business is generating some cash. So why would you not use some copper earnings to
support oil and gas?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, it comes back to the company's overall financial situation. When we announced
the acquisitions in oil and gas business, we talked about our entry into that business in two stages. The first stage was
going to be one of de-lever. In other words, we incurred significant debt in acquiring the oil and gas assets. At that
point we had a clear-cut path because of commodity prices and paying that debt off in a reasonable amount of time.
And then we said we were going to go forward beyond that point and investing where returns were greatest as far as
shareholders. And I think that's still the way that we would see it, is these significant, recent declines in commodity
prices are requiring us to take steps to protect our balance sheet currently. We want to work hard to protect our credit
rating.
I think that's important for credit investors as well as equity investors and it has other implications to our business. And
so that means we're going to be focused on looking at alternative sources of capital in these joint ventures and the oil
and gas business provide us a near-term way of doing that, is something our organization has been experienced in, as
the industry is experienced in. There's a huge amount of capital, as Jim said, available to do those sorts of things. So we
are having a primary objective of protecting our balance sheet and our liquidity in the current environment. We don't
believe the current environment is going to be the long-term environment. We don't have any predictions of when it
will turn, but we believe it will turn, and then we'll be in a position of allocating capital in a different way.
<A - James C. Flores>: Just on a standpoint of the oil and gas business, there's flexibility to fund itself, fund its
projects, but really we're all about driving high returns to our shareholders. If we're using outside capital on a promoted
basis to develop these assets and we can manufacture these assets as we have in the past with great expiration results or
exploitation results and we have this huge project in the Gulf of Mexico with tens of billions of dollars worth of
development opportunities, maybe at some point in time it makes sense. But right now, it's much better to accelerate
the PV of that and the reserve life of our Gulf of Mexico business, and we need to use outside funding to do it and we
drive higher returns for the FCX shareholders.
So it's a pretty cut – get away from the cost of capital aspect, I mean, if copper is generating $5 billion of excess cash
flow a year and so forth, then you'd be having to measure oil and gas returns against other shareholder initiatives and so
forth. But right now the best initiative for us is to run our business balance like Richard talked about and make sure that
we take advantage of the market and the project financing and accelerate our oil and gas business for the benefit of all
the FCX shareholders.

<Q - Nathan D. Littlewood>: Okay. Thanks very much, guys. Appreciate your time.
<A - James C. Flores>: Thank you.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: And, Nathan, I'll just say, one thing 2008 has taught us and one thing this current
environment has taught us; if you're in these commodity businesses, diversification within commodities is not going to
pull you out when these broader-scale things happen to you. So we are focused on what are the best assets; what are the
best returns for our shareholders; how do we manage our balance sheet to allow us to take advantage of this great asset
base; and that's what we're focused on.
<Q - Nathan D. Littlewood>: Absolutely.
<A - James R. Moffett>: Listen, this is Jim Bob. I want to make a couple of general comments. Earlier someone
mentioned the Rio Tinto financing [indiscernible] (01:24:27). The reason the financing was so optimistic for us was
that there was no production that was taken from the existing reserves. We [ph] attempt (1:24:56) to only participate
60%-40% in the new reserve. With the platform we have, [indiscernible] (01:24:52) 38 with the platform we have in
the deepwater we acquired from BP, BP spent years trying to put those platforms in the right place. That's why there's
so much oil [indiscernible] (01:25:08). And what you need to understand is the existing wells that we have and the
existing reserves weren't really earned by the investor that comes in. There always be a participation in the additional
wells that are there. So that's exactly why the Grasberg deal that we structured. Now, the reason why the Grasberg deal
would be so, on such a promoted basis is because of the great asset that was found out there. But for the same reason,
what you're seeing with these big platforms [indiscernible] (01:25:55) we have the deepwater trends. And I want to
emphasize this again, that all those studies and geological work that went into putting those platforms in the right place,
we just didn't throw darts at the wall.
Secondly, we've finally got a discovery that we've been looking for onshore. The well that was tested in the Tuscaloosa
is the second largest well that we've ever tested onshore. Flatrock which is [indiscernible] (01:26:33) would have been
the biggest well before that. But these deep [indiscernible] (01:26:40) formation that had the right [indiscernible]
(01:26:47). And we control and hold [indiscernible] (01:26:52) onshore. Dozens of prospects have the same Tuscaloosa
formation as their primary target. [indiscernible] (01:27:04) Tuscaloosa trends to the north and [indiscernible]
(01:27:10) over to the east so much as a measure [indiscernible] (01:27:17) to give you a chance to look at it. So we
control some huge amounts of reserves and it will be drilled in the future. So this is not an ordinary portfolio. Just like
Grasberg wasn't ordinary. When I first started working on the financing [ph] that the (1:27:53) Grasberg, a lot of people
in the mining business said, you can't promote a mining asset to raise the oil and gas, Jim Bob. Well, if you've got the
right asset it is. We have the right assets and you've just got to give it a little time to do what's necessary to make the
assets have their maximum value.
<Q - Nathan D. Littlewood>: Thanks again. I appreciate all the color. Thanks, guys.

Your next question comes from the line of Steve Bristo with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Steve Bristo>: Yeah, thanks for taking my question. I just want to come back to this $900 million in project
financing. You were mentioning that if you do that $900 million that's turning the growth back on. So if you do actually
get the $900 million, how much does that actually impact the $2.3 billion you're currently forecasting that doesn't really
have the growth built into it?
<A - James C. Flores>: Well, yeah, you bring up a good point, Steve. It adds a couple hundred million of growth
capital back into the $2.3 billion. So it's probably a net $600 million or $700 million of net reduction in CapEx that we
add $200 million or $300 million back of gross spending that we have to do to execute on that plan.
<Q - Steve Bristo>: Can you just walk me again how you went from that $40 per BOE down to $20 for your share of, I
guess, capital spending?

Page 19 of 21
<A - James C. Flores>: Well, it's directionally from the standpoint, you have to add additional joint ventures; you can't
just do it with $900 million. You've got to continue to do the Marlin and King joint venture and then the subsequent
joint ventures after that, on all the development that we go forward. So basically you take a half to 60% of our CapEx
spending and do it in third party joint ventures for development, and you can get to that number. But it's going to take
some more inputs that [ph] I could (01:29:40) go through at a later date with you. I can't go through them all right now.
<Q - Steve Bristo>: So the $20 was a target then. You're currently at $40 and – okay.
<A - James C. Flores>: It's a target because if we get our cost down to $25 and our CapEx investment down to $20,
that's $45 in a $50 environment.
<Q - Steve Bristo>: Yes. Okay.
<A - James C. Flores>: That's what it is. You kind of back into the target, and then you have to do what you have to
do to get there.
<Q - Steve Bristo>: And would the $900 million be fully just in 2015 or is there any of that that really impacts 2016
spend?
<A - James C. Flores>: That's in 2015. So it would be a net $600 million, $700 million in 2015. Think about it that
way.
<Q - Steve Bristo>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Sussman with Clarkson. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jeremy R. Sussman>: Yeah, hello. Good morning.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Good morning.
<Q - Jeremy R. Sussman>: Just obviously there's been a lot of discussions about JVs and farming out some of the oil
and gas reserves. Just can you give us a sense, I think you talked about sort of over a two-year timeframe, but when, it
sounds like you've had some discussions, so I guess when can we maybe expect an update from you guys in terms of
obviously the ability to update our numbers in terms of production, et cetera?
<A - James C. Flores>: Sometime this summer. We'll be updating as we go.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: And we'll give you a status report at our next quarterly call. We're coming up on the time
of year of metals and mining conferences, so we're going to, as always, we're going to be transparent and give our
investors the current status of things.
<Q - Jeremy R. Sussman>: Okay, great. But it sounds like we should have some clarity by the summer on some of
this.
<A - James C. Flores>: Well, we hope to. It all depends a lot on commodity prices. If commodity prices stay low then
probably have it sooner rather than later because investors will be a little bit more hungry as where it's inverted and
they get a little less hungry as oil prices recover.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: And as Jim talked about, this is not like it's going to be one fell swoop deal. I mean we're
going to make steps. It's going to be an ongoing process. So it's just these things happen very quickly, as I keep saying
over and over. And we're responding to it and we started this process of talking with potential third party investors, and
we're going to advance that as quickly as we're able to.

<A - James C. Flores>: Yeah. And, Jeremy, look, the big deal is it's the maximizing the returns to the FCX
stakeholders. That's the key objective here. And sure it offsets CapEx in a low price environment and everything else,
so.
<Q - Jeremy R. Sussman>: Right.
<A - James R. Moffett>: This is Jim Bob again. I want to be sure to remind everybody that these joint ventures we're
talking about on the platforms that we have, the existing platforms, they would not participate in current production and
current reserves, all the additional reserves, [indiscernible] (01:32:48). Identically, as I referred to the Grasberg
financing, none of the initial production was included in the Rio Tinto deal. It all depends upon speculations, finding
new reserves as they participate [indiscernible] (01:33:10). So remember you got a lot of investment we'd put into
major hubs out there. Nobody else has these hubs and for that reason [ph] new (01:33:26) production is down near the
hubs, maybe drilling around on a wildcat basis and these people bring production to you. We've got all these platforms
are under capacity so we have the ability to sell and develop these wells up on a promoted basis. And we also have the
advantage of people drilling discoveries out there that they know they can't build and put their own outstanding
platform and we'd bringing reserves to you.
<A - James C. Flores>: All right. And that's in particular on page 41 the slide presentation where it talks about our
reserves, it includes Highlander and Holstein Deep and the Holstein Deep reserves and growth what we're talking
about, we're talking about doing a joint venture. That will give you a representation of when we talk about net amounts
of [indiscernible] (01:34:25) in the joint ventures.
<Q - Jeremy R. Sussman>: That's great. Thank you. Thank you very much for all the color.
<A - James C. Flores>: No problem.

Our final question will come from the line of Garret Nelson with BB&T Capital Market. Please go ahead.
<Q - Garrett S. Nelson>: Hi. Good morning. Could you remind us what the annual maintenance CapEx is for the
mining business? On the CapEx guidance slide, is that $1.2 billion number for other mining CapEx in 2015 a good
number to use, or perhaps that $1.2 billion is not entirely maintenance CapEx?
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: That's a good number to use. It's in the range of a $1 billion to $1.5 billion, but the $1.2
billion that we've got in 2015 is a good kind of run rate to use. We've taken steps to defer things when we can, but on
an ongoing basis it's in that range.
<Q - Garrett S. Nelson>: Okay. And then again on that slide, the $2.5 billion of major CapEx on the mining slide for
2015, you footnote that that primarily includes Cerro Verde in Grasberg underground development. Cerro Verde will
obviously drop off this year, but if you would, how much CapEx specifically is budgeted here both for Grasberg
underground development and for Cerro Verde in each year, 2015, 2016, 2017?
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: The Cerro Verde CapEx is split between 2015 and 2016. We had $3.1 billion incurred
through 2014, and most of that difference will be spent in 2015 with some trailing into 2016. We also have the
Grasberg underground which, as Richard said, will average $700 million a year net to our interest. We do have a couple
years where it is higher than the $700 million average and some that are lower than the $700 million average, but that's
about what we're spending on average for the Grasberg underground.
We've also got some other projects in 2016. We've got, in 2017, we're expanding the Miami smelter, and then as you
get into 2017 we start the development of extension of the Safford mine. So we've got some CapEx in 2017 for the
Safford extension, as well as the Miami smelter. But the bulk of the Cerro Verde spending is completed in 2015.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: By far the bulk. I think it's roughly $500 million left in 2016. But I do want to point out
that this is the project that's scheduled to finish right at the end of the year. So it's a big construction project. As I said,

we've got 12,000 to 14,000 people there, and we'll update you as we go through the year. There's a possibility that some
of these costs may go over into the next year. But right now things are looking very good.
<Q - Garrett S. Nelson>: Okay. Thanks a lot, Richard and Kathleen.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: All right. Thank you, Gary.
