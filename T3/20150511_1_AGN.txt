Brenton L. Saunders
Thank you, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with the obvious. We had a terrific quarter on all key
measures, and we are on an excellent trajectory for 2015 and beyond. Actavis' first quarter performance was
highlighted by double-digit non-GAAP revenue growth versus the prior year, double-digit growth from key North
American brands, double-digit growth from global generics and double-digit growth from Anda, our distribution
business, three rock-solid pillars to which we are adding the Allergan business.
While keeping focused on customers and driving robust growth, we also achieved a long list of accomplishments
during the quarter, including: completion of a largest deal in healthcare over the last 10 years; expanding the reach of
our International portfolio; executing deals that increase our focus on profitable generic markets such as Auden
Mckenzie in the UK, while completing divestitures that sharpened our brand therapy focus, such as our respiratory and
Doryx deals and Pharma Tech deal.
Ramping up productivity of our branded/generic R&D team with four new brand product approvals and about 20 new
generic launches in the United States. And completing the largest financing ever in healthcare. Not to mention kicking
off one of the most thoughtful and rapid integrations I've ever seen.
I am so proud of each of the people on our combined global team. One thing is clear: this combined team rallies
quickly around surprising opportunities, focuses on the key objectives and executes flawlessly. When it comes to
execution, we are like a finely tuned, high-performance engine.
Even though we just closed the Allergan acquisition on March 17, we have already made significant progress on the
integration and we're doing exceptionally well on our cost synergy capture. How did we do it? We quickly named the
new management team with skilled and experienced leaders from both companies. But we didn't stop there. In the vast
majority of countries, we designed our entire organization all the way to the front line pre-close so we could rapidly
inform our colleagues about their future, give them certainty and move quickly to the new go-forward team.
For example, our global sales force of approximately 7,500 representatives has already been realigned in all but a
handful of countries with the intent to minimize customer disruption. We also stood up our new international model

with one country manager per country, allowing us to operate as one company, while taking full advantage of our
global brand and generic capabilities.
Being bold, nimble and focused during the integration is how we are staying on track with our aggressive synergy
targets and, more importantly, how we will keep our sales momentum going. After just six weeks, we are making great
progress on our integration milestones and are on track to deliver about 80% of our synergies by the end of the first
quarter of 2016.
And in a moment, David Nicholson will give an overview of the tremendous progress in the pipeline and will make a
few comments about the R&D portfolio prioritization, which is nearly complete.
Tessa will also join us to describe our financial performance in detail. But from a high-level perspective, you can see
the impact of our transformation over the past 12 to 18 months. Non-GAAP net revenue was $4.2 billion, a 65%
increase, largely driven by the Forest acquisition with only two weeks of Allergan in the results; $4.30 in non-GAAP
EPS, even with the impact of the Allergan financing; $1.8 billion in adjusted EBITDA; and $525 million in cash flow
from operations, more than $800 million if you add back the one-time cash charges for severances, restructuring and
integration.
Turning to the business performance. On a pro forma basis, total U.S. branded sales increased 5% if you exclude
Allergan and increased 17% if you exclude Namenda IR. Eight of the top-10 Actavis brands are growing double digits
versus prior year; not just growing, thriving. In fact, many of our key products are hitting new highs in volume and
market share, including Linzess, which is now approaching a run rate of $400 million annually.
Bystolic had a strong performance, running towards $650 million annually. And Lo Loestrin, Estrace and Minastrin are
really soaring with the focus we are putting on women's health. Liletta will likely be a beneficiary of that focus.
Meanwhile, Namenda XR sales are up sharply, as we continue to drive the conversion rate and have resolved last year's
supply constraints.
Physicians and caregivers continue to convert more patients to Namenda XR with its more convenient and cost
effective profile. Over 70,000 physicians have prescribed Namenda XR, which is a testament to its usefulness and
treatment with patients with Alzheimer's disease. Our patient awareness campaign focused on caregivers and their
loved ones with Alzheimer's disease has been well received and is helping with conversion. We are currently at about
50% and climbing towards 60% by the end of the second quarter.
And we expect to exceed that figure with the launch of Namzaric, which opens up the donepezil market segment worth
about $2 billion. The primary source of business for Namzaric will be the donepezil or donepezil-plus-Namenda IR
market. The main point here is that the market for Namzaric is bigger than the market for Namenda XR. Namzaric will
give patients all the benefits of combination therapy for Alzheimer's disease in one pill, once a day. We intend to
support Namzaric with formulary access and direct-to-consumer marketing. Shipping begins this week and full
promotional launch later this month. Given the broad use of combination donepezil and memantine therapy, we think
there's a great opportunity for Namzaric to expand the once-a-day branded market.
Turning to the Allergan business. Here again, we come back to our theme of double-digit growth. In the midst of
planning for the integration, legacy Allergan delivered double-digit pro forma sales growth of 13% in constant currency
to $1.75 billion for its final quarter. Allergan drove this performance while maintaining inventories in the customary,
well-managed range. The performance was broad-based, driven by continued strong performance across the company's
Eye Care, Botox and Aesthetic businesses.
Eye Care was up 14% in constant currency, driven by Restasis and Ozurdex. Botox up 16% in constant currency,
driven by growth in therapeutic. Skin Care, Breast Aesthetics and Facial Aesthetics up a combined 12% in constant
currency. International Allergan sales were also up double digits in constant currency, with all three units, Eye Care,
Medical Aesthetics and Specialty Care achieving double-digit growth. We are capitalizing on the exceptional sustained
performance of Actavis and Allergan to create an impressive leader in Growth Pharma.

So the bottom line on our combined company brand performances, strong performance for our key brands, including
Namenda XR, Linzess, Botox, Restasis, Bystolic and Ozurdex. Meanwhile, you only have to look at the performance
of Lo Loestrin, Saphris, Minastrin and the GI products to see that our team has firmly established a core competency in
re-launching products that we acquire.
This ability to invigorate acquired products is a differentiator for us. We acquire assets to grow them, and we succeed.
That opens up more possibilities for us than is appreciated, more growth, more leverage and more credibility for other
bolt-on deals.
While it is early, we're off to a very good start with our new launches, and we are now poised to be a significant player
in the increasingly important antibiotic space with Dalvance and AVYCAZ. This is where our model of development
prowess, life-cycle investment and smart business development is creating an enduring, competitive advantage.
Turning to the North American Generics & International business, sales were up 20% this quarter in constant currency
versus prior year. North American sales were $1.2 billion and continue to benefit from the contribution from key
products like generic Concerta, Lidoderm and Intuniv. Special capabilities and being first to file again and again
combined to make our Generics business a best-in-class competitor.
This year, we have launched 20 generic products in the U.S., including our most recent launch of generic Pulmicort,
following our court win last week. We also launched generic OxyContin, Temovate and generic ophthalmic products as
well.
This quarter, we also launched our Generic Injectable business after we regained the rights to about 20 injectables from
Sagent at the end of 2014, giving us added strength with hospital purchasers. On the R&D side, our Generic business
continues to fire on all cylinders, with seven confirmed first-to-files out of the total of 18 total filings posted on the
FDA website this quarter.
On the International side, non-GAAP sales were $527 million, growing 20% excluding foreign exchange. We launched
close to 100 products during this quarter. International revenue growth was driven by multiple markets, including
Russia up 41% on a constant currency basis, driven by our strong sales organization and OTC performance, and the UK
up 22% on a constant currency basis driven by new product launches.
Our strategy in International generics is to continue allocating resources to markets that deliver high growth potential
and where we can be among the leaders. That is why we divested generic products in Australia and invested in Auden
Mackenzie acquisition in the UK, which is expected to close in the second quarter.
Let me close with a few comments on our preliminary view of the 2015 financials. We are certainly off to a terrific
start. We had previously planned to provide guidance at the end of Q2. But given the strong performance this quarter,
the progress we're making on integration synergies and the impact of foreign exchange and divestitures, we felt it
would be good to give you our preliminary view of 2015 today.
First, since we acquired Allergan on March 17, as-reported revenue is projected to be in the range of $20.5 billion to
$21 billion. On a pro forma basis, full-year sales are projected at $22 billion to $22.5 billion, which was consistent with
or slightly ahead of our prior comments of $23 billion, if you exclude the impact of foreign exchange and the multiple
divestitures such as respiratory and Pharmatech.
Our current view on 2014 non-GAAP earnings per share on an as-reported basis, including Allergan as of March 17, is
in the range of $17 to $18.50. We will narrow the range over time. With this view, you can see that we have put
together a terrific company with a very compelling outlook for 2015. And we are executing like a high-performance
engine, driving towards our aspirational target of $25 per share in EPS in 2017. We look forward to giving you more
refined guidance on our second quarter call.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Tessa, who will provide you with an overview of our financial performance
during the quarter. Tessa?

Maria Teresa Hilado
Thank you, Brent. Good morning, everyone. Before I turn to our results, I would like to remind you that the current
quarter results, which I will discuss, now include 15 days of financial contribution from the Allergan acquisition, which
was completed on March 17. The Allergan business contributed $258 million in net revenue and $113 million in
adjusted EBITDA in the quarter.
Turning to our results for first quarter on slide 15. In Q1, we delivered strong performance with top-line growth across
key franchises, both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, despite negative foreign currency impact. The
year-over-year increase was also driven by the Forest and Allergan acquisitions. On a non-GAAP basis, consolidated
net revenue for the first quarter was $4.2 billion, an increase of 65% versus the prior-year quarter. Non-GAAP R&D
investment for the quarter was $284 million compared to $175 million in the prior-year period. Non-GAAP R&D
spending was $110 million for generics, $125 million for brand, $15 million for biosimilars and $34 million for
Allergan.
Non-GAAP SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 20.9%, an increase of 1.7 percentage points over the prior-year
quarter as a result of the Forest-branded products that have higher SG&A spend. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for the
quarter was $1.78 billion, an increase of 107% versus the prior year, driven by strong revenues and higher gross
margins across the business. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share for the quarter increased 23% to $4.30 compared to
$3.49 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2014.
Excluding the impact of Allergan and its related financing, Actavis non-GAAP EPS was $4.59 for the first quarter
2015, representing a 17% sequential increase from $3.91 in the fourth quarter. This highlights our continued strong
performance on top of integration activities.
Our non-GAAP tax rate improved from 16.4% in the year-ago period to 14.3% in the current-year quarter, mainly due
to geographic mix. Cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $525 million. Our cash flow from operations
would have been more than $800 million if cash charges for severance, restructuring and integration are added back.
Turning now to our business segments. North American Brands business delivered strong performance year-over-year,
powered by the acquired Forest products and growth in our Women's Health franchise. North American Brands
revenue was $1.74 billion for the quarter, up 192% versus the prior-year period, driven by the addition of the Forest
business, including strong, double-digit year-over-year growth from eight out of our top-10 products.
Compared to the prior quarter, sales were down slightly, driven by normal decline in prescription fill rates from fourth
quarter to first quarter that typically recover in the second quarter and the wholesale buying patterns. Adjusted gross
margin with the North America Brands decreased to 86.6%, largely due to partner products within the Forest portfolio,
including Namenda and Linzess. Sequentially, adjusted gross margin improved due to lower Namenda IR sales, which
carry a lower margin.
Non-GAAP SG&A as a percent of revenue increased to 27.8%, driven by expenses related to the acquired Forest
products.
Our North America Generics and International business continues to perform strongly, with non-GAAP revenues of
$1.7 billion for the quarter, up 12% versus the prior-year period. Growth was driven by strong sales of key products
and new product launches, including generic versions of Concerta, Lidoderm, Intuniv and OxyContin.
Internationally, our Generics business was negatively impact by the strengthened U.S. dollar. But at constant currency
rates, this business grew 20% versus prior-year quarter.
On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted gross margins increased 3.2 percentage points compared to the year-ago quarter, due to
continued strong performance within our International business. Non-GAAP SG&A as a percentage of adjusted net
revenue for the segment declined to 14.8%, due to the divestiture of our Western European assets and elimination of
the supportive infrastructure of that business.

Turning to our Anda business. Revenues increased $462 million, up from $300 million in the prior year, an increase of
18%, driven by a higher mix of chain drugstore sales. Gross margin for the Anda business decreased 2.6 percentage
points, 12.5%, as a result of the higher product mix of chain drugstore sales.
Slide 19 details our debt capitalization following the close of the Allergan acquisition. We ended the first quarter 2015
with total debt of approximately $44 billion and equity of $71 billion related to the Allergan acquisition and previous
financing. Currently, our leverage ratio stands at 4.1 times debt-to-pro-forma adjusted EBITDA.
Over the next 12 months, we are committed to using our anticipated strong free cash flows from our business segments
to accelerate debt repayment. We expect to achieve a pro forma leverage ratio of 3.5 times debt-to-adjusted EBITDA
by the end of the first quarter of 2016, in line with our prior guidance.
Finally, I would like to provide an overview of our key assumptions for the 2015 combined forecast Brent provided
earlier in this call. Our non-GAAP EPS of $17 to $18.50 includes key near- and longer-term drivers that we expect over
the next few months that will impact our business including: in U.S. Brands we assume the Namenda XR conversion
trending to 60% by the end of Q2; Namenda IR generic enters the market in mid-July; Namzaric launch this week.
In our Gx business, we assumed launch of generic Pulmicort; continued current market conditions for Concerta;
additional competition on Lidoderm; Auden McKenzie acquisition close late in Q2; a tax rate of approximately 15%;
2015 fully diluted average shares of approximately 386 million; and year-end 2015 fully diluted shares outstanding of
415 million. Foreign exchange rates are based on average forward consensus for Q2 to Q4.
I'd now like to turn the call over to David Nicholson, who will provide an update on our Brands R&D progress in the
quarter. David?
C. David Nicholson
Thank you, Tessa, and good morning, everyone. During the first quarter of 2015, our R&D teams focused on advancing
our near-term development programs whilst also looking towards the future and the integration of the Actavis and
Allergan pipelines.
Turning to slide 22, we have achieved tremendous progress. And I would applaud the combined efforts of our
commercial and R&D teams. We have nearly completed the rationalization of our combined pipeline. Our teams have
identified and confirmed 70 projects that will move forward as part to the combined development program, with more
than 50 projects in either late stage or registration stages of development. Whilst we have made very significant
progress on the rationalization of our pipeline, we are still evaluating certain projects.
We continue to drive these projects forward to key milestones to allow us to make cost-effective, but also data-driven
decisions. We will present our combined rationalized pipeline as part of an up-and-coming R&D day. We have
achieved significant progress across key programs from both the legacy Actavis and the legacy Allergan R&D
pipelines.
Turning to slide 23. You get an insight into the extent of our progress, to strengthen our key franchises. In the quarter,
we achieved milestones across core franchises, including Women's Health, Infectious Disease, CNF and
Gastroenterology. Key FDA and European approvals included: Liletta. This was FDA approved in February, as a
long-acting progestin-only intrauterine system, or a IUS, to prevent pregnancy for up to three years and was launched
in the U.S. in April.
To support the use of Liletta of up to seven years, we are continuing the ACCESS study. The initial results of this study
were published online in April in Contraception. The study found Liletta to be more than 99% effective for the
prevention of pregnancy for up to three years of use in women age 16 to 35, regardless of their race, history of previous
births or BMI.
AVYCAZ, our combination of ceftazidime and the novel beta-lactamase inhibitor, avibactam, was FDA approved in
March as a treatment for adult patients with complicated intra-abdominal and urinary tract infections. The AVYCAZ

launch is in progress. As you have heard, Namzaric is being launched, and we are in discussions with the FDA about
extending the range of doses that we can make available to maximize convenience to patients.
Dalbavancin was approved in Europe in February as Xydalba for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure
infections, ABSSI (sic) [ABSSSI]. We are developing a single-dose regimen of Dalvance. And in April, we announced
positive top-line results for a phase 3 study comparing a single 1.5 gram dose of Dalvance with the same total dose
given as two doses one week apart for the treatment of ABSSI (sic) [ABSSSI] infections caused by susceptible
Gram-positive bacteria, including MRSA.
The top-line data demonstrated that the single dose of Dalvance achieved its primary endpoint for control of infection
at 72 hours after initiation of therapy. The study was also positive at end of treatment, the endpoints required by the
European Medicines Agency. I will return to Botox later.
We also announced the initiation of a Phase IIb study to relamorelin, our investigational treatment to gastroparesis in
patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. We are very pleased with this collaboration with our partner, Rhythm Health.
Turning to slide 24. We achieved sNDA approvals for a lower dose of 20-milligram Viibryd, expanding dosing options
for clinicians, and for Saphris monotherapy for the acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with Bipolar
I disorder in pediatric patients. FDA has accepted our sNDA to expand the Teflaro label for ABSSI (sic) [ABSSSI]
with concurrent bacteremia.
We received FDA approval for the expanded label of Botox for the treatment of upper limb spasticity. The FDA also
approved an increase to the maximum Botox cumulative dose for adults within three months treated for one or more
indications. We remain very committed to extending our Botox franchise.
Looking ahead and moving on to slide 25, we have a significant number of regulatory milestones in the next few
months. We have upcoming PDUFA dates for Eluxadoline in the second quarter and Cariprazine in June. For
Eluxadoline, we do not expect an FDA Advisory Committee hearing on our submission, and DEA scheduling begins
once approval is achieved.
We are continuing to build out our Linzess franchise, and we expect to submit an sNDA for a low-dosage form of the
drug to treat chronic idiopathic constipation in 2016. For DARPin, our Phase II programs for AMD and DME in the
U.S. and Japan are ongoing. And we will begin enrollment in our Phase III program in the U.S. later this quarter or
early in the third quarter. This on-time start of Phase III is just one of many examples that our strong combined R&D
team is maintaining momentum during the integration of our two companies.
Restasis is on track to submit to the dossier for multi-dose preservative-free formulation by the end of the year.
I'm excited about Bimataprost SR. The Phase III trials are continuing in the U.S., and we will be starting Phase III in
Europe later this year.
SER 120, a low-dose nasal formulation for the treatment of Nocturia, is nearing completion of Phase III, and we are
looking forward to seeing the data.
I also wanted to mention our Dermal Fillers. We're continuing to roll out additional HA formulations. We anticipate
extending our Volite line in Europe and our Juvederm line in Asia during the course of this year.
In conclusion, the first quarter of 2015 has been very productive for the R&D team, and we will continue to see
momentum in the second quarter and beyond from our industry-leading pipeline.
With that, I will now turn the call back over to Brent, who will provide closing remarks. Brent?
Brenton L. Saunders
Thank you, David. As you have seen, we're off to a great start. We are taking bold actions, firing on all cylinders and

our way to achieving our key aspirations: double-digit branded revenue growth; about $8 billion in free cash flow in
2016; and our aspirational EPS target of $25 per share in 2017.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Lisa and we'll take your questions.
Lisa M. DeFrancesco
Thank you, Brent. And I'd like to ask all of you to limit yourselves to one question. If you have any follow-ups, please
reenter the queue so we can get through all the Q&A. Jackie, we're ready to take questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Thanks. Good morning. My one question is for Brent. Sometimes, the best things in life come
along when you're least ready for them. Can you speak to your readiness and desire to move on a large acquisition in
the near-term, if it were to make strategic and financial sense? Thanks.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah, Gregg. Obviously, history is a proof point of that with the Allergan acquisition,
which was not part of our strategy, but as you know was put in play. And we were able to be opportunistic as a white
knight and really combine these two great companies.
I think as you look forward, obviously, our commitment to maintain our investment-grade rating is of critical
importance to us. We will continue to look at bolt-on deals as a matter of course. I think with respect to
transformational deals, we would be limited by cash constraints, obviously. So it would have to be something truly
compelling for us to want to use our equity to do something like that.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Thanks.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you. And Brent, just another question for you. How are you thinking about your Generic
business, given that obviously there's someone out there right now who is willing to pay a very high multiple for it?
And is there a way to sell the Generic business in a tax-efficient manner? Thanks.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah. It's a great question, Jami. And obviously, that is something we get from a few
folks from time to time, and no surprise. Look, I think the generic industry is in a bit of turmoil right now with two
hostile situations going on. And you know my views on hostile situations of going concern for companies. It tends to
destroy value and cause lots of distractions.
When you look at our business, up almost 20% on top line this year, firing on all cylinders, an R&D pipeline that's the
envy of the industry, continuing to just beat on first-to-files in the U.S. time and time again, launching 100 brands – or
products outside the United States. And our way we manage it, which is so different than anybody else, I think it's
something that we take a lot of pride in and we see a lot of connectivity to generics and our Branded business.
That being said, I think if you look at trying to sell it, I'm not sure there's a tax-efficient way. We do have a reasonably
high basis in it, but it'd still be a very difficult thing to do. But I think the bigger takeaway should be, strategically, we
value that business.

Our next question comes from the line of Marc Goodman with UBS.
<Q - Marc Goodman>: Yes. Good morning. You talked about the $25 in 2017 as the target. Maybe you can just give
us a sense of the push and pulls on that number relative to where you were when you first put that number out. And I
know you said we can't do a second, but just on the LUMIGAN implant, can you just give us a sense of how long that
product is lasting relative to the daily eye drop? Thanks.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah. So, I think, Marc, it's a great question. Really, to be fair, not a lot has changed. The
good news is, as we sit here several months from when we announced the deal and came up with the $25 aspiration,
we're pretty much on course. There are obviously some minor puts and takes that occurred in the model, but overall,
we're exactly where we kind of thought we would be. Obviously, currency has moved against us, but stronger
performance has compensated for some of that. I think we're seeing good productivity out of the R&D pipeline. David
has to finish and tie up the pipeline review, which we expect to happen this quarter. But overall, I'd say we're pretty
much where we thought we would be.
<Q - Marc Goodman>: Are the synergies coming through as fast as you thought when you originally set it out?
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah. I would say we're probably a little ahead, and that's why you saw quite a large cash
charge this quarter. We're making great progress. For example, on head count, up; but for a few countries, we're
substantially ahead of where we thought we would be. And both the severances and the charges associated with that
came through in a large way this quarter. You should expect that to dissipate over time.
And so and I think we're feeling good by the bold and aggressive actions we've taken to combine these companies, get
the distraction behind us and focus on top-line growth.
<Q - Marc Goodman>: And the Namenda sales piece of it hasn't changed much?
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: No. I think – and I'll ask Bill to chime in here, but I think when you look at XR, it is an
amazing performance. Obviously, the legal setback is what it is. And perhaps we'll get a ruling from the court; perhaps
they'll delay so it doesn't matter anymore. We'll see what happens. But when you look at what our team has done and
by pulling off the shelf a plan B 24 hours after that court ruling, it's nothing short of extraordinary.
I'll ask Bill to just comment on that.
<A - William J. Meury>: Yeah. Hey, Marc. I mean, listen, we're trending toward 60%. If you add Namzaric to it,
which I think'll be a sales accelerator, we should achieve our target. And in all the research that we've done, if we can
provide for formulary coverage, then we believe we're going to be able to move more and more patients either from IR
to XR or patients to Namzaric, which is, frankly, a stronger selling proposition than even XR; fewer pills, fewer
administrations, no increase in side effects, better efficacy. And we've made sure that it's economical for health plans
and caregivers. And so it's taken a lot of effort and a lot of investment and a lot of energy, but I think we're going to
reach the target.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Plus the donepezil market, which is much bigger than the memantine market.
<A - William J. Meury>: That's right.

Our next question comes from the line of Liav Abraham with Citi.
<Q - Liav Abraham>: Good morning. Just a quick question on DARPin and your decision to move forward here. Just
curious as to what your objective is with the assets. Do you view this as a highly differentiated compound in a wet
AMD market that'll be even more competitive in 2019 than it is now? Or are you progressing forward of this in order to

potentially bring a combination DARPin, PDGF to market?
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah. I'll start and let me ask David to comment. And just one backup on LUMIGAN for
Marc. I mean I think in the studies, we're seeing it lasts about three to four months, something in that range versus the
drops, which compliance and persistence is a huge issue in glaucoma. And if you talk to glaucoma specialists, they're
dying for an effective treatment that would increase compliance and persistence for a disease that's typically
asymptomatic that's doing a lot of damage to the back of the eye.
In terms of DARPin, Liav, I think you're right on both tracks. I think the way we're thinking about DARPin is that it
should achieve the three to four times a year dosing regimen to make it really a differentiator. Obviously, people don't
like getting an injection in the back of the eye. If you look at even EYLEA, they're doing it more frequently than the
label suggests. And so doctors are really looking for something that – and patients probably even more so – looking for
something to minimize injections. So we're really trying to design the experiment – or the Phase III to hit the 12-week
dosing regimen.
The other thing I would put out there is, remember, we put nothing in our deal model in DARPin. And so outside the
cost of the Phase III study, it's essentially a free call option. And so given where we are, we think after all the modeling
and everything we looked at, it was worth going for. But you're right, it's a high hurdle to get there. And to the extent
we can, it should provide a very compelling, large opportunity for us in the future. But we've got to get there.
I think the second thing it does, it sets us up dual DARPin, and that could be a very exciting place to be, but it's early.
And so we've got a lot of work to do there as well. I don't know, David, if you want to add any color?
<A - C. David Nicholson>: Brent, I think you said it. We're very excited by our partnership with Molecular Partners.
The DARPin's anchoring binding proteins are a novel plus of therapeutically active agents. Our lead DARPin has an
incredibly high affinity for VEGF, which opens up the possibility for administration every 12 weeks. We're going to
evaluate that in Phase III.
And as Brent mentioned, coming along behind it, we have a number of other anchoring binding proteins, other
constructs. Those projects are early, so it's too early to talk about those. The dual DARPin is just in preclinical
development. It's very exciting. It's a combination of PDGF and VEGF, which should have advantages in AMD but it's
very early. It's still in preclinical development. We need to work our way through and generate more data just to see
how exciting that project is really going to be.
<Q - Liav Abraham>: And you feel comfortable with the inflammation at this point?
<A - C. David Nicholson>: We know that – I'm sure you do as well – that all VEGF inhibitors cause ocular
inflammation. It was kind of interesting for me to see the change in rate of ocular inflammation that was observed
during the course of Lucentis development. So we're very carefully watching ocular inflammation as we progress into
Phase III. We've got a Data Safety Monitoring Board in place, and we're confident that we're in control of the situation.
Yeah.
<Q - Liav Abraham>: Great. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line Ronny Gal with Bernstein.
<Q - Aaron Gal>: Good morning and thank you for taking my question. My question is for David Nicholson. David,
you keep on seeing clinicaltrials.gov trials that you guys are doing in dry eye. Can you just organize this pipeline for
us? What are the various programs? Where are they in development? When do they expect to reach the market?
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yes. So, Ronny, it's Brent. I know you wanted David. I'll turn it over to him in a second.
But to be fair, we're not ready to go into great detail on the pipeline. We will do that soon. I will tell you that we have
roughly four programs in dry eye. We think we have some really interesting ones and ones that maybe perhaps will fall

out. We'll go through that over the course of the next month or so. But dry eye is something that we're also very
committed to, and we're looking at a variety of external innovations as well as our internal programs. And you'll see us
very committed to this space for the long term.
<A - C. David Nicholson>: Yeah. I mean I think basically, that covers it, Ronny. Obviously, always happy to discuss
this with you. As you know, we continue to be very excited about Restasis and expanding the Restasis geographies.
And we've also got a novel formulation of cyclosporine in early stages of development, which we think could be a real
advance over Restasis, itself. And as Brent said, we really believe we can maintain our leadership in this franchise.
Yeah.
<Q - Aaron Gal>: Okay. And the product which you just discussed everything for the end of the year, that's Restasis
X?
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah. I mean. So – the what – I'm not sure the question, Ronny. Ask again.
<Q - Aaron Gal>: So the product that you just mentioned, the preservative-free multi-dose product, is that what used
to be called Restasis X?
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: No. Yeah, sorry. Absolutely not. That is not Restasis. That's just the preservative free,
which doctors have been asking for.
<Q - Aaron Gal>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - C. David Nicholson>: Yeah. Multi-dose formulation.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yes.
<A - C. David Nicholson>: Yeah.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan.
<Q - Christopher T. Schott>: Great. Thanks very much. Can you just talk a little bit about your expectations for the
legacy Allergan products for the remainder of this year, particularly as we get some tougher comps as the year
progresses? I guess should we think about this as a double-digit growth business for the remainder of 2015 on a
constant currency basis?
And if I can just do a quick follow-up to I think Jami's question earlier. If Actavis shares remain at current valuations,
does that change your view at all about a potential separation of your Brand and Generic franchises, acknowledging
you've got a great Generic business. But does valuation play a factor here at all if, again, we're six or nine months away
and you're still trading at a fairly low multiple on forward earnings? Thanks very much.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah. So I mean I think as you think about the legacy Allergan business, our expectation
is double-digit branded growth in a constant currency basis. I think there's nothing to suggest otherwise. The business
has a lot of momentum behind it.
We have completely solidified our sales and marketing colleagues around the world with perhaps a few countries as an
exception only. The team is absolutely committed. They've been driving lots of growth in the first quarter, and we
expect that to continue throughout the year and beyond. And that is part of the firm basis of which we believe we'll
have double-digit branded growth along with the North American Forest legacy brands.
I think to respect to your second question, Chris, in terms of the stock being perhaps at lower levels than we all would
expect. I don't think it's a question of selling the Generics business. I think it's a question of digesting this integration,
help and teach shareholders understand the value proposition here, the compelling growth opportunity that we've
created in Growth Pharma, the enduring, sustainable bottom line growth, continuing to prove out our aspiration of $25

of EPS in 2025. And then showing how the businesses support each other and add additional turbo-boosting growth to
one another.
And so it's still early. We only closed Allergan a few weeks ago, I think five, six weeks ago. And so I think no one
wants to have a trigger finger and overreact to five weeks of weakness, if you will, in the midst of closing, rebasing
your shareholders, having a lot of people sorting through different moving parts. Let's let things settle down and let us
tell our story and prove our points as we continue to execute on all cylinders here.

Our next question comes from the line of Ken Cacciatore with Cowen & Company.
<Q - Ken C. Cacciatore>: Hi. Thanks, Brent. Just wanted to flesh out a little bit of your earlier comments for hostile
versus not, combined with your discussion about potentially a large deal. And you indicate, as always, a lot would have
to come together, especially to use to your currency. But just wondering if you saw – and this is clearly down the road
– a reason to approach a larger player. When would you become more encouraging – I hate to use the word hostile –
versus remaining passive? Is there any time that you would kind of alter the philosophy that you have? Thank you.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah. I mean you never say never. I just think that doing a hostile deal against a
large-going concern, like we've seen in the industry over the last 12 months, is value-destroying. We are quite
experienced in integrations. We do them quite well. And one of the largest reasons we do them well is because we treat
people with dignity and respect. We have information exchange freely, of course, following all the rules and
regulations around gun jumping. And that allows us to get a jump on things, like you saw in this quarter with the
integration of Actavis, Allergan. But it also shows how you restore momentum by keeping people's morale high, and
that is certainly the case, for the most part, in our combined company.
I think there are opportunities to do hospital deals. I think you have to do them when you're buying a single product,
perhaps, or just a research program or file where people aren't the key driver. But in most of these businesses, people
are such a large part of the equation, I think, going hostile in virtually every instance a mistake. There could always be
an exception to that.
I think that the second thing is, there are other large players that we believe are inefficient that would benefit from our
operating model, our management philosophy, the way we approach customers in a more efficient manner. And so over
time, there may be some targets that could be surprising to folks. But we have to delever and we have to maintain our
investment-grade rating. And so those are all the factors that go into everything we look at.
And obviously, I think by now, we've earned some trust that if there's something opportunistic that creates shareholder
value, this isn't a team that sits back and watches it pass us by. We react very quickly and do things in a very creative
but value-creating way.
<Q - Ken C. Cacciatore>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI.
<Q - Umer Raffat>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. My question actually is for Tessa, not for Brent today.
Tessa, I noticed $525 million in cash flow from operations, based on the results today versus $1.3 billion in non-GAAP
net income. And I also noticed on the cash flow statement, you had $700 million in headwind from accounts receivable
as well as $200 million in inventory. So I just wanted to understand that better, if you had any color on that. Thank you.
<A - Maria Teresa Hilado>: Yeah. So good question. First, if you add back restructuring and integration charges back
into cash flow, you'll get to roughly $800 million. But $400 million in receivables change was really largely due to two
things: one, a change in payment terms with a couple of customers; and two, with higher sales, obviously, you have

higher AR.
And then on the inventory side, that was purposely done to ensure that we don't have any outages in terms of supply.
But what you'll find is towards the next couple of quarters, sequentially, our cash flow will improve in a manner such
that by 2016, we will be at roughly $8 million of cash flow. So there's a couple of puts and takes in Q1 that are, I would
say, abnormal in nature, largely due to restructuring. But you'll see that improve sequentially through the next couple
quarters.

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Michael Faerm with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Michael Faerm>: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. My question's on Eluxadoline. Do you have
a specific PDUFA date for that? And what sort of a timeframe are you anticipating for launch along for the DEA
schedule? Thanks.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah. So maybe I'll turn it to David. Do you want to...
<A - C. David Nicholson>: Yeah. As I just said, we've got an upcoming PDUFA date for Eluxadoline. We're in the
middle of labeling discussions at the moment with the agency for this potential product. Labeling discussions are going
well. Once we have finalized the approval from the division, then the scheduling goes to the DEA for finalization. The
timeline for scheduling is – it varies from company to company. So it's not possible for us to say when we'll get the
scheduling, the finalized schedule decision. The PDUFA data, as I mentioned earlier, is in second quarter.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: I would just add that our current model has us launching likely at the end of this calendar
year but most likely in the first quarter of next year. And so that's how we've been anticipating it. And we think that
that's still a very accurate way of thinking about it.
<Q - Michael Faerm>: Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Yeah. Thanks so much. My question is for Brent. Brent, could you just explain your 10%
Branded revenue growth target in some detail? Could you define that, the timing, what it includes, what it excludes,
just so we have a better sense for how you're thinking about that 10% goal? Thank you.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah. So the 10% Branded growth is a long-term goal. We expect that over our planning
period, which is a few years, that our Branded business will achieve 10% growth on the top line into the future or
better. Obviously, currency is one of the moving pieces to that. And I think if you look at it in constant currency – and
it's hard to hold management out in the field and in the countries accountable for currency; obviously, you can hold us
accountable for it here at the center but not a lot we can do about it – that we see that growth.
When you look at how we've kind of base-lined it, it really is starting in this quarter with generic IR. Then everything
else is in. And so that's how we think about it as a CAGR on a go-forward basis. And we expect that as we look at it,
we should do better than 10% Branded revenue growth throughout our planning period.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Got it. So that excludes the impact of IR.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: It excludes currency and IR. That would be the only two exclusions that I'm aware of.

Your next question comes from the line of Louise Chen with Guggenheim.
<Q - Louise Chen>: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So just a more macro question here. Curious how you think
about brand and generic drug pricing, given that there have been concerns that it may not be as favorable going
forward. Just curious your thoughts here. Thanks.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah. So let me tackle generic pricing. Maybe Paul will want to weigh in as well since
he has a deep history here. We haven't seen much of a change despite all the fanfare and publicity around drug pricing
in generics. There are obviously a few products that go up. But the model for generics is price decreases as more
competitors come into the market. That's just the way the business works. And overall, we still model a
mid-single-digit price decrease in our business.
That being said, the environment has remained pretty stable and favorable. So we don't expect that to change short
term, either. I don't know, Paul, do you have other thoughts on...
<A - Paul Navarre>: I think the only thing I would say is that our pipeline and product line gives us a bit of an
advantage because of the uniqueness of it. It allows us to be somewhat insulated from the general reduction of prices.
As you know, we've worked very hard to create that product line, and we're obviously taking advantage of the situation
as situations present themselves.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Bob, anything you'd want to add?
<A - Robert A. Stewart>: No. I think that exactly covers it.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Okay. In terms of the Branded side, again, I think our goal over the medium and long
term is to continue to climb the innovation curve with novel drugs like Eluxadoline or Esmya or relamorelin where we
believe we can continue to command the prices associated with the innovation. But in the short term, when you look at
our current price portfolio, we're reasonably well positioned. And Bill, you want to expand on that?
<A - William J. Meury>: Yeah. I don't think when we look at our sales expectations over the next several years, we're
overly dependent on price as a driver. A lot of the growth trends that you're seeing are volume based.
I would also point out that, generally speaking, our pricing strategy is tied to our IP, and most of the assets that we have
on the market right now have long exclusivity periods. And so our primary objective, generally speaking, in a market,
is market share. And as it relates to price increases, we're very realistic about what they can look like. We feel we're
predictable and reasonable. I think payers know that. I think that's the right way to be over the next several years, and I
don't anticipate any surprises to our plan because of price.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: And I would add – Philippe, you want to make a comment about Aesthetics?
<A - Philippe Schaison>: Yes. On the cash base side, we, have increased our price by 3% this year and we can see
double-digit growth from double-digit growth in our business. So we're pretty confident about the future of this
business.

<Q - David A. Amsellem>: Thanks. So on this theme of bolt-on M&A, wanted to ask about the Generics business.
And is the addition of additional businesses, either ex U.S. or small businesses in the U.S., a priority? And also maybe
talk about what kind of formulations and dosage forms might be a high priority in terms of bolstering the business via

to us in terms of technology base, we have now the full range of dosage forms that we need to be able to compete
globally.
We'll always look at opportunistic M&A in the U.S. I think we've got the scale that we need. I don't necessarily think
that another acquisition in the U.S. is really going to give us anything because I think, again, we've got the size, the
portfolio. We've got a best-in-class commercial team. Perhaps, maybe looking at some portfolios of products in
injectables and things like that, that would be the only thing I would see that would be of interest in the U.S.
Outside the U.S., we're always looking at different geographies that were already strong. You saw us do it with Auden
McKenzie in the UK. We may look in certain markets where there might be some tuck-in type acquisitions to just
increase our overall strength there, more portfolio based, more small company type of transactions. But outside of that,
I don't necessarily think that we need a large-scale transaction within the Generics business to remain viable or
competitive.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: I would say best in class.
<Q - David A. Amsellem>: Thank you.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah.

Your next question comes from the line of Randall Stanicky with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Randall S. Stanicky>: Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. Just a quick one on methylphenidate. I think you said
in your guidance reflects current market conditions. The share's been ramping. Obviously, we're going to get an update
here imminently. We don't know what the two other competitors are going to do, and there's obviously a very good
case for you where they leave the market and that leaves you with some pricing opportunity as well. So if you could
maybe just comment on how you're thinking about that situation, that would be great. Thanks.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Bob?
<A - Robert A. Stewart>: Yeah. So Randall, I guess the way we've guided is exactly how you illustrated it there. So
we are modeling it as if both the manufacturers remain in the marketplace and that we continue to hold onto or maybe
slightly pick up in share from where we're at today. But we see both competitors in the BX kind of situation. Now
obviously, if FDA does take action and/or if the manufacturers or, further, the retailers do the responsible thing by
continuing – by not dispensing the BX rated product, that would provide upside to us, both in terms of volume as well
just overall I guess stability within the marketplace. So we would see that as an upside compared to what we guided.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: And we could supply.

<A - Robert A. Stewart>: And we have 100% of the volume, and we've notified FDA that we have 100% of the
volume or inventory needed to supply the marketplace. So in the event that the competitors do come out of the
marketplace, that we would be able to ensure that all customers are served.
<Q - Randall S. Stanicky>: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.

Our last question comes from the line of David Maris with BMO Capital Markets.
<Q - David W. Maris>: Good morning, Brent. Wanted to talk to you a little bit about distraction, so both in the
Generics and in the Aesthetics business. When you see two of your major competitors coming together, is that
something that you – or potentially coming together – is that something you spend a lot of time wringing your hands
about? Or do you see that as something you're pretty happy about that maybe two competitors will be distracted for a
year or two in an integration? Is that more of an opportunity?
And separately, in Aesthetics, we've heard from a number of cosmetic derms that they've seen several of your peers
being distracted lately but they've seen no change in their Allergan sales coverage. So what have you done to minimize
the disruption to customers, and how do you think you've done holding on to share during this transition period?
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah. Great questions, David. Thanks. I think as you think about this, the generic
industry right now – I kind of alluded to this earlier. Having two out of your three major competitors kind of tied up in
knots, fighting each other in a hostile way certainly should create some opportunity for us. It certainly doesn't distract
us. It keeps us laser focused on our competitors.
And just anecdotally, I'll give you one example. I was down at the NACDS with Paul and Bob Stewart and our Branded
colleagues. And our other competitors were either there in a very light presence or not at all because they were on the
road, trying to convince shareholders that their plan or their defense was on track. And so you can already see them,
despite what they say, saying it doesn't impact them, impacting them. And so hopefully, we're already in the pole
position with respect to R&D. But this will hopefully continue to allow us to continue to be in a pole position with
respect to customer service.
On the Aesthetics side, maybe Philippe will chime in and Paul perhaps internationally. I think our goal was to really do
no harm, right? And so we approached this integration very, very carefully in that there was really no change to the
facial aesthetics teams around the world – or virtually no change around the world with a key focus on maintaining
customer focus and connectivity in the U.S. and key international markets. Philippe, anything you'd add to that?
<A - Philippe Schaison>: Listen, we're growing by 13% during Q1. We are investing heavily in direct-to-consumer
advertising. You've seen that behind Botox and VOLUMA. VOLUMA is becoming the number one filler. Has grown
30% during the first quarter. And despite [ph] a Derma (01:05:40) that is, I would say, stronger than Valeant, we're still
gaining market share. So overall, I'm very confident and very positive of that business.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah. And Paul Navarre, who runs International Brands, would you want to chime in?
<A - Paul Navarre>: So very briefly, Q1 for Medical Aesthetic was great. We grew by 15.9%. And as you say, Brent,
the sales force were actually not affected by the integration so we maintain exactly the same level of service with
customers.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Just to conclude, you couldn't do that if this was a hostile deal. These sales reps would've
been taken out by competitors. The marketing teams would've been distracted immensely. And so that's why, again, I
underscore in most situations, hostile deals are value destroying. And you have to look to do things on a friendly basis,
obviously, with a few exceptions to that rule.
<Q - David W. Maris>: Great. Thank you very much.

<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah. Thank you, David.
Brenton L. Saunders
So I think that was our last question. I would just, again, close with saying that this team has continued to take bold and
decisive action to create value. We are absolutely well on our way to achieving our key aspirations of double-digit
Branded growth, $8 billion of free cash flow in 2016 and remain committed to our aspirational target of $25 per share
in 2017.
We thank you for joining us today and taking the time to go through a quarter with lots of moving parts. And we look
forward to simpler quarters in the future. Thank you.
Lisa M. DeFrancesco
Thanks, everybody.
