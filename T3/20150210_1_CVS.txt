During the Q&A, please limit yourself to no more than one question with a quick follow-up so we can provide more
callers with the chance to ask questions. Just before this call, we posted a slide presentation on our website. The slides
summarize the information you'll hear today as well as some additional facts and figures regarding our operating
performance and guidance.
Additionally, note that our Form 10-K will be filed later this afternoon and it will be available on our website at that
time. Please note that during today's presentation we'll make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the
federal securities laws. By their nature, all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results
may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements for a number of reasons as described
in our SEC filings, including the risk factors section and cautionary statement disclosures in those filings.
During this call, we'll also use some non-GAAP financial measures when talking about our company's performance,
including free cash flow and adjusted EPS. In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find the definitions of these
non-GAAP items, as well as reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures, on the Investor Relations portion of our
website. And as always today's call is being simulcast on our website and it will be archived there following the call for
one year.
And now I'll turn this over to our CEO, Larry Merlo.
Larry J. Merlo
Well, thanks, Nancy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. This call wraps up 2014 and it was a
great year for our company by any measure. We delivered approximately 10% growth in consolidated revenues, 14%
growth in PBM operating profit, 8% growth in Retail operating profit and 13.5% growth in adjusted earnings per share
on a comparable basis. On a quarterly basis, we have consistently posted solid financial results and the fourth quarter
was no exception. Adjusted earnings per share increased 8.4% to $1.21 per share, at the high end of our guidance
range. And both the PBM and Retail segments exceeded our revenue expectations.
Operating profit in the Retail business grew 6.5%, just above the high end of our expectations, while operating profit in
the PBM increased about 1%, right in line with expectations.
Additionally, we generated $2.9 billion of free cash in the quarter and $6.5 billion for the full year, exceeding our
expectations. Also today, we are reconfirming the 2015 earnings guidance we provided back in December. And Dave
will provide the details behind our fourth quarter results and 2015 guidance during his review. So let me turn to the
business update and I'll start with the 2015 PBM selling season.
Gross client wins for 2015 currently stand at $7 billion, with net new business at $3.6 billion, both up approximately
$400 million from our update back in December. And this excludes any impact from our SilverScript PDP, which I'll
address shortly. Like the past several years, our success in the 2015 selling season reflects our high levels of service
and execution, competitive pricing, along with our unique integrated model. And our model allows us to provide
differentiated products and services that generate savings for our clients while providing better health outcomes and
convenience for their members.
Now with $7 billion in new business, encompassing about 150 new clients serving millions of new members, 2015 was
the largest and most complex welcome season in our history. And as we stated previously, we invested to ensure a
successful welcome season and that took months of rigorous planning. The investments we made were well worth it,
and I want to take a minute to express how pleased we are with the extraordinary and successful welcome season we've
had.
The feedback we've received from clients and consultants has been extremely positive. And I'm very proud of the
collective efforts of our colleagues. We expect our track record of success in winning and retaining business to
continue in the 2016 selling season, which is now underway.

Now many of you have asked what our clients are focused on, and the number one priority centers on controlling their
rapidly rising specialty costs. And we're bringing them an array of differentiated solutions. Our Specialty Connect
offering, which was rolled out by May of 2014, is gaining client interest and traction in the marketplace. The program
provides choice to receive a member's specialty script at CVS Retail or mail while preserving the central clinical
expertise that leads to better health outcomes. And physicians appreciate the ease of getting their patients started on
therapy. No other PBM can offer this today.
Clients are also interested in ways to manage specialty costs that fall under the medical benefit. And our NovoLogix
solution continues to resonate in the market. Overall, our specialty capabilities enable us to provide strong clinical
support to patients while managing trend for our clients, and this strategy is producing results. In fact, specialty
revenues were up a very healthy 56% versus the same quarter last year. That was driven by new business, the high-cost
Hep C drugs, and the addition of the Coram infusion business.
Combined, our innovative offerings enable us to optimize cost, quality and access, and should continue to drive share
gains in this fast-growing specialty sector.
Now as you know, another way we manage trend for clients is through our highly proactive approach to formulary
management. We led the market with our formulary strategy for the 2012 plan year. And since then, we've updated our
template formulary on an annual basis, and increasingly specialty drugs are part of that strategy. Our formulary process
enables our clients to provide excellent access to care while meeting their members' needs in the most clinical and
cost-effective manner.
Now in January, Gilead's Hep C drugs, Harvoni and Sovaldi, became exclusive on the CVS Caremark Standard
Commercial, Exchange, Medicare Part D and Medicaid formularies. Harvoni is the preferred agent for genotype 1.
Sovaldi is the preferred agent for the treatment of other genotypes.
And our goal was to create the lowest net cost solution for the entire population of patients with all Hep C genotypes.
We recognize the cost challenges and we remain committed to providing solutions for clients that choose to treat all
their patients, as well as those who feel it makes more sense to prioritize patients with the more advanced stages of liver
fibrosis. We believe that our strategy meets patient needs while delivering excellent value and clinical options for
clients and their members. At the same time, our formulary strategy positions us well in the 2016 selling season.
Now before turning to Retail, let me touch briefly on our SilverScript product. We ended 2014 with about 2.9 million
individual PDP lives; that was right on plan. And very consistent with what we forecasted and communicated at our
Analyst Day, we now have about 3.4 million individual PDP members, reflecting a successful annual enrollment
period. And we continue to be pleased with our progress in this growing area of the business.
Moving on to Retail, which produced solid results across the business, even with the tobacco headwind. Now we've
been tobacco-free since September and here's what we've learned over the past four months. The negative impact to our
front-store sales has been slightly less than anticipated. We know that the most heavily impacted categories were
consistent with our expectations, but the magnitude of that impact on those categories has been a bit less than expected.
Beyond the categories we expected to see impacted, other front store categories have not been negatively affected. And
based on external data, it appears that our former tobacco sales have migrated largely to convenience stores and gas
stations.
There has been no discernible impact on our Pharmacy business. And since we launched our new CVS Health brand,
customer awareness in response to the new branding campaign has been very positive and we've seen a notable
increase in customer perception of CVS as a leader.
So let's review the fourth quarter Retail results. Pharmacy same-store prescription unit volumes increased 5.3% on a
30-day equivalent basis and we continued to gain pharmacy share. Our retail pharmacy market share was 21.1% in Q4
and that's up about 55 basis points versus the same quarter a year ago. Pharmacy same-store sales increased 5.5%
versus the same quarter last year. The incidence of flu did pick up a bit in the quarter, adding about 40 basis points to
pharmacy comps.

Pharmacy same-store sales also include the negative impacts of about 150 basis points due to recent generic
introductions and another 190 basis points from the implementation of Specialty Connect. And you'll recall Specialty
Connect transfers specialty scripts from our Retail segment into our PBM segment. Pharmacy margins increased again
this quarter and were in line with our expectations.
Now as we discussed previously, CVS has contracted with 20 regional and national Part D plans for 2015, where CVS
is positioned as a preferred provider. And we've taken a disciplined approach to our participation in these networks,
ensuring that margin compression and share analysis provide the right economics.
Turning to the front store, we saw continued decrease in traffic. That was partially offset by an increase in the average
customer basket. Front store comps were down 7.2%. And adjusting for the tobacco impact, front store comps would
have been up 0.7%. The impact of the tobacco exit was about 800 basis points and that's about 100 basis points less
than we anticipated. So again, four months into it, it's still early, but we're very pleased with these results.
Front store margins benefited in the quarter from the tobacco exit. On a comparable basis to last year, including
adjusting for the tobacco elimination, front store margins improved modestly. And this underlying improvement in
front store margin reflects our discipline in making responsible investments in promotion, along with the continued
growth of Store Brand sales. In fact we made great progress in Store Brand penetration in the quarter, with Store
Brands increasing to 22% of front store sales.
And that's up about 310 basis points from Q4 of last year and about 190 basis points of that improvement reflects the
removal of tobacco from our mix. The other 120 basis point reflects underlying progress in our Store Brand
penetration. And we saw gains across health, beauty, general merchandise and edibles and we see great opportunities to
continue to garner Store Brands share.
Turning to our store growth for the quarter, we opened 50 new stores, relocated 30, closed seven, resulting in 43 net
new stores in the quarter. And for the full year, we opened 151 new stores, acquired 33, relocated 60, closed 22,
resulting in 162 net new stores and we continued to enter some new markets, including Little Rock, Arkansas and
Seattle, Washington. So overall, our 2014 store growth equated to an increase in retail square footage of 2.4%, and that
was right in line with our plan.
As for Minute Clinic, we opened 35 net new clinics in the quarter, 171 for the year, ending the year with 971 clinics in
31 states, plus the District of Columbia. And continuing on its very strong growth trajectory, Minute Clinic's revenues
and customer visits increased 36% and 33% respectively versus the same quarter last year.
At year-end, we had 49 affiliations with major health systems across the country. We recently added two new
affiliations, further expanding our platform that supports primary care both conveniently and cost-effectively.
Let me update you on the progress that has been made at Red Oak Sourcing, our venture with Cardinal Health. And we
are extremely pleased with the rapid progress Red Oak has made to date. The combined expertise of the Red Oak team,
along with the simplicity of the business structure, has enabled them to hit the ground running. They have been actively
working with suppliers on strategies that create value for all parties and have now transitioned suppliers representing
more than 95% of the combined generic spend. And as expected, we received the first fixed quarterly payment from
Cardinal in the fourth quarter and we look forward to Red Oak's future contributions.
Now before I turn it over to Dave, let me comment on the news surrounding Nexium. As you know, Teva recently
received FDA approval for the generic and we've received some questions on how that might impact our results. I just
want to note that there are still many questions regarding the launch of generic Nexium, including potential legal
maneuvers, the timing of launches as well as the number of other manufacturers who could potentially launch. So we
need clarity and answers for those questions before we can provide any more specifics.
So with that, let me turn it over to Dave for the financial review.

Thank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll provide a detailed review of our 2014 fourth-quarter
financial results and briefly touch upon our 2015 guidance, which remains unchanged from what we outlined back in
December. First, I'll start with a wrap up of last year's capital allocation program, which should clearly demonstrate
how we've been using our strong free cash flow to return value to our shareholders through both dividends as well as
share repurchases. I'm pleased to say that we have continued on our steady march of improving our dividend payout
ratio.
Recall that back in 2010 that our payout ratio was approximately 14%. We finished 2014 with a payout ratio of 27.7%,
almost double 2010's level and four percentage points higher than 2013. We paid approximately $1.3 billion in
dividends in 2014 and $317 million in the fourth quarter alone. Our strong earnings outlook for this year, combined
with the 27% increase to dividend that we announced at Analyst Day, puts us well on track to achieve our targeted
payout ratio of 35% by 2018.
Now along with these significant increases in our dividends, we have also continued to do value-enhancing share
repurchases. For all of 2014, we repurchased approximately 51 million shares for $4 billion, averaging $77.91 per
share. In the fourth quarter alone, we repurchased 14.1 million shares for $1.2 billion. So between dividends and share
repurchases, we returned approximately $5.3 billion to our shareholders in 2014.
And looking forward, we have $12.7 billion in authorization to repurchase shares and we continue to expect to
repurchase $6 billion this year. Our expectation is that we will return more than $7 billion to our shareholders in 2015
through a combination of both dividends and share repurchases, which is up more than 30% over last year. We
generated $2.9 billion of free cash in the fourth quarter. In all of 2014, free cash flow increased $2.1 billion
year-over-year to approximately $6.5 billion. The increase in cash generation was driven primarily by improvements in
collections and payables management. These were partially offset by growth in inventory and current assets as well as
increased investments in capital associated with technology and other corporate efforts. We have mentioned on our last
earnings call that the 2014 free cash flow might exceed our guidance at the expense of 2015 guidance.
And in fact, we did end the year $500 million above the high end of our goal. That was driven by the receipt of some
late-year payments a few days early. Despite the higher-than-anticipated receivable collections in 2014, the underlying
strength of our cash flow allows us to maintain our free cash flow guidance for this year of $5.9 billion to $6.2 billion.
Aside from these timing items within receivables, we continue to make strides in improving our cash cycle through
better management of payables. And we remain committed to further improvements in working capital as we look
forward. For the year, our net capital expenditures were $1.6 billion. This included $2.1 billion of gross CapEx, offset
by $515 million in sale lease-back proceeds.
And as for the income statement, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations came in at $1.21 per share, at
the high end of our guidance. GAAP to diluted EPS was $1.14 per share. We saw strong results across our operating
segments, with Retail posting results above the high end of our expectations.
So with that, let me quickly walk down the P&L. On a consolidated basis, revenues in the fourth quarter increased
12.9% to $37.1 billion. In the PBM segment, net revenues increased 21.7% to $23.9 billion. This year-over-year growth
was attributable to specialty pharmacy, including the impact of Coram and Specialty Connect, as well as increased
volumes in pharmacy network claims. Partially offsetting this growth was an increase in our generic dispensing rate,
which grew approximately 125 basis points versus the same quarter of last year to 82.1%.
We saw strength on the top line versus our guidance, due primarily to higher volumes than expected, particularly in
Medicaid, drug price inflation and mix, including the new Hep C drugs. In our Retail business, revenues increased
2.9% in the quarter to $17.7 billion, driven primarily by strong pharmacy same-store sales growth, despite the transition
of specialty revenues into the PBM segment due to Specialty Connect. Like the PBM, Retail exceeded guidance due to
higher volumes in pharmacy.
Turning to gross margin, we reported 17.9% for the consolidated company in the quarter, a contraction of
approximately 140 basis points compared to Q4 of 2013 and consistent with our expectations. Within the PBM
segment, gross margins declined 100 basis points versus Q4 of 2013 to 5.2%, while gross profit dollars increased 2.2%

year-over-year. The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily attributable to the increase in volumes, the
improvement in GDR and favorable rebate economics. Partially offsetting these drivers was the impact of client and
drug mix as well as continuing client pricing pressures.
Gross margin in the Retail segment was 31.4%, up approximately 65 basis points over LY. This improvement was
driven by the 140 basis point increase in Retail GDR to 82.4%, the benefit to front store margins from the tobacco exit,
increased Store Brand penetration as well as the first quarterly payment we received from Cardinal as part of the Red
Oak Sourcing venture. Partially offsetting these drivers was the continued pressure on reimbursement rates.
Gross profit dollars increased 5.2% in the quarter. Total operating expense as a percent of revenues notably improved
from Q4 of 2013 to 11.6%. The PBM segment's SG&A rate improved by 20 basis points to 1.4%. We spent more on
1/1 readiness for the PBM's welcome season than we expected. But with the over-delivery of revenues in the quarter,
we were able to deliver the modest improvement that we had planned.
As reported, SG&A as a percent of sales in the Retail segment deteriorated by approximately 35 basis points to 21.3%.
However, this was driven by the reduction in Retail sales related to our decision to exit the tobacco category as well as
the impact of Specialty Connect, shifting, again, sales from our Retail segment into the PBM. On an underlying basis,
SG&A as a percent of sales at Retail actually improved by approximately 50 basis points.
Within the Corporate segment, expenses were up approximately $7 million to $205 million, again within expectations.
Operating margin for the total enterprise declined approximately 50 basis points in the quarter to 6.3%. Operating
margin in the PBM declined approximately 80 basis points to 3.8%, while operating margin at Retail improved by
approximately 35 basis points to 10.1%. For the quarter, we exceeded our estimates for operating profit growth in the
Retail segment. Retail operating profit increased a solid 6.5%, exceeding expectations by approximately 25 basis
points. PBM operating profit increased 0.9%, in the middle of our guidance range.
And now going below the line on the consolidated income statement, net interest expense in the quarter decreased
approximately $4 million from last year to $131 million. This was due primarily to lower average interest rates.
Additionally, our effective tax rate was 39.6%. Our weighted average share count was 1.2 billion shares, only slightly
higher than anticipated.
So with that, now let me touch on our 2015 guidance, which remains unchanged from Analyst Day. You can find the
details in the slide presentation we posted on our website, but I'll focus on the highlights here. We continue to expect to
deliver adjusted earnings per share in 2015 in the range of $5.05 to $5.19 a share, reflecting very healthy year-over-year
growth even after removing the impact in 2014 related to the loss on the early extinguishment of debt. GAAP diluted
EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $4.77 to $4.91 a share. We expect consolidated net
revenue growth of 7% to 8.25%, which reflects solid underlying growth across the enterprise. Retail revenues are
expected to increase by 1.25% to 2.5% despite the negative impact of the tobacco exit.
Recall that we expect the tobacco exit to have a negative impact on total same-store sales of approximately 175 basis
points for the year. And it's expected to have a negative impact of approximately 575 basis points on front store comps
for the year as well. While the impact last quarter was a bit better than we expected, it's only been a few months since
we became tobacco-free. So we're maintaining our initial guidance on the impact to our comps. We expect growth in
PBM revenues of between 11% and 12.25%. We expect Retail operating profit to increase 4.75% to 6.5%
year-over-year and PBM operating profit to increase 6.75% to 10.75%. The first quarter guidance also remains
unchanged from what we talked about in December.
As you may recall, we highlighted several timing factors back at Analyst Day that affect the cadence of profit delivery
throughout this year. And while 2015 is expected to be a strong year, the cadence of profit growth is expected to be
significantly back-half weighted. We expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.06 to $1.09 a share,
reflecting growth of 4% to 7.25% versus the same period of LY. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is
expected to be in the range of $0.99 to $1.02 in the first quarter.
Within the Retail segment, we continue to expect revenues to increase 1.5% to 3% and operating profit growth of
between negative 1.5% to a positive 0.5% year-over-year.

Recall that we expect the tobacco exit to have an approximately 900 basis point negative impact on front store comps in
the first quarter. Now revenues in the PBM segment still are expected to grow between 14.5% to 15.75% while
operating profit growth is expected to be flat to down 5%.
Additionally, our free cash flow guidance for the year remains in the range of between $5.9 billion to $6.2 billion. And
I'll remind you that we are maintaining that range despite the pull-forward of some receivables into 2014.
So in closing, I'd like to reinforce with everyone two important thoughts. First, I continue to be very pleased with the
company's significant cash flow generation capabilities. I believe these capabilities should continue to play an
important role in driving shareholder value over the longer term. Second, and to that point, 2015 will be another year in
which we demonstrate our ongoing commitment to returning value to our shareholders, increasing the dividend and
share buyback programs by more than 30% over last year.
And so with that, I'll turn it back over to Larry.
Larry J. Merlo
Okay, thanks, Dave. And let me just reiterate how pleased we are with the progress that we've made this past year in
advancing our innovative healthcare strategies along with rebranding our company. And I'd like to take a minute to
thank our more than 200,000 colleagues who continue to work hard each and every day executing those strategies.
So with that, let's go ahead and open it up for your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] One moment, please, for the first question. Our first question comes from the line of
Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Robert P. Jones>: Great. Thanks for the questions. On the PBM side, I noticed EBITDA per claim was a little bit
light in the quarter and you're down year-over-year. I know you cited increased spending. I'm wondering if you could
comment on whether or not that spending was more of a pull-forward for January 1 starts or something more
incremental.
<A - David M. Denton>: Bob, I think that increased spending was really related to the 1/1 readiness efforts. We spent,
as you know, incremental money through Q4 and we talked about the incremental money that we're going to spend
actually in Q1 as we ramp up those new clients for the welcome season.
<Q - Robert P. Jones>: And then the other thing you guys cited was price compression around the EBITDA per claim.
I know you mentioned that last quarter as well. I'm just wondering if you could shed any more light on what exactly
that was. Is this something from previous PBM contracts or is it something more related to the new starts again?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Bob, I think this is just the ongoing margin compression that we're continuing to see and expect
to see as we move forward on both the PBM as well as the Retail side. So there's nothing that is new beyond what
we've been talking about probably for the last couple of years.
<Q - Robert P. Jones>: Got it. Thanks so much.
<A - David M. Denton>: Thank you.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Thanks, Bob.

Our next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open. Please
proceed with your question.
<Q - John Edward Heinbockel>: So for Larry or Jon, if you guys dissect or try to dissect the upcoming 2016 selling
season in terms of size and then composition, how do you think that compares to 2015? And do you think – are you
better positioned for 2016, given what we saw in 2015, or about the same?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: John, it's Larry. I'll start and then Jon will, I'm sure, jump in as well. But the latter part of your
question, we think we're extremely well positioned for all the reasons that we touched on earlier and that we talked
about in greater detail at Analyst Day. I think that if you go back and look at the 2015 selling season over 2014, there
was a lot more RFP activity, recognizing that we thought 2014 was an anomaly as people were preparing for the impact
of the Affordable Care Act. So we think that 2015 was kind of a return to a normal selling season and we don't see
2016 any different. It's early, but we think it will mirror what we saw this past year.
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: And, John, this is Jon. I think the size and composition is going to be similar to what
we've seen, health plans which we're seeing now, large employers that we're seeing now, you'll see the midsize and
smaller employers later in the year. And we expect to see a fair amount of state government opportunities as well.
<Q - John Edward Heinbockel>: Okay. And then just one other thing, how do you guys think about capital allocation
and buyback as it relates to share price valuation? Does that discussion come into effect at all where you might think
let's do more on the dividend side? Let's consider a special dividend? Or, is it really kind of a long-term view that over
the long term, buying back $5 billion or $6 billion a year is really the right thing to do?
<A - David M. Denton>: Yeah, John, it's Dave. We've been pretty consistent on our capital allocation program for
several years and we've outlined it and all the different components of it. I will tell you though we do look forward to
the growth of our business. We look at where we think we're going to be in several years in the future. And then we
make sure that we're performing what we would consider value-enhancing share repurchases based on where the
growth of our business and the cash generation capability of our business over the next several years compared to the
valuation. So we will continue to monitor that and we will continue to flex our capital allocation program to drive value
for shareholders in the short term as well as the long term, John.
<Q - John Edward Heinbockel>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Thank, John.

Our next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler from Barclays. Your line is open. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Thanks. Eric's going to – Eric Percher is going to ask a question as well. I have a question just
about expenses at Retail. You did a good job of managing them. I'm just wondering if you actually had to make
meaningful changes in labor hours or the way you had work done at the stores because you gave up tobacco and
Specialty Connect or was that not actually something that you had to deal with.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Meredith, it's Larry. I'll start and – we have not been doing anything out of the norm that we
haven't – that hasn't been part of our program for the last couple of years. We have always looked for ways in which we
can become a more efficient operator at Retail. And that's where our focus has been this past year and will continue to
be as we go forward.

<Q - Eric R Percher>: Sure. A question on formulary, as you look at the 2016 selling season, do you think your
formulary decision around Hep C can stand as an advantage? I know you feel there's advantages to your formulary
focus, but do you think that specifically can? And if so, does it beg the question will we ever see PBMs move to a point
where there's such a delta in what is offered by each PBM that a sponsor would choose their PBM based on product
availability?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Eric, it's Larry. I'll start and I'm sure Jon will jump in as well. But as you think about Hep C
specifically, our goal was to create the lowest net cost solution for the entire population of patients, recognizing that our
clients have a lot of flexibility in terms of the programs that we have that meets their priorities. And in addition to
achieving the lowest net cost solution, we also evaluated a variety of factors including the current and future projected
distribution of the population across the several genotypes, the average duration of therapy of the various agents,
factors that contribute to medication adherence, along with our ability to further control cost through utilization
management programs.
And I go back to some of the things that we talked about at Analyst Day where, through our formulary management
program, since it started back in 2012, we've saved clients over $3.5 billion. There is a growing opportunity in the
specialty class, recognizing that I think we ended 2014 with 31 specialty exclusions. And there's a lot more that we can
do to bend the cost curve in specialty beyond just managing the formulary. And maybe I'll ask Jon to talk a little more
about that respective piece.
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Yes. So Eric, clearly, specialty is our client's biggest concerns. Formulary is a piece of
that, but there's also a lot of other things that you can do to help manage that trend. And they're also interested in
managing it under the medical side, which we have a unique solution. So I think formulary is one piece of the strategy.
Your question around the differences in formularies between the different PBMs and the impact on that as clients make
decisions – we really haven't seen that as a factor in the selling season. We've been very effective at transitioning
members off of non-formulary drugs. We've been very effective at transitioning members from competitors'
formularies to our formularies. We're seeing that this selling season. So I'm not seeing formulary as a differentiator as
clients are making decisions. I think they're really looking at what we're able to deliver there, and we're very
competitive there. But they're also looking at all the other capabilities, differentiated capabilities that we have, that at
the end of the day, that's what makes the difference.

Our next question comes from the line of David Larsen from Leerink Partners. Your line is open. Please proceed with
your question.
<Q - David M. Larsen>: Hey, guys. Congratulations on a good quarter. Was there an impact to gross margins in the
Retail division and Pharmacy Services division due to Specialty Connect? Was there a benefit to Retail and a bit of a
headwind to Pharmacy Services and can you size that, if so? Thanks.
<A - David M. Denton>: Yeah, I can't really size that. I will say that from a rate perspective, it's slightly beneficial to,
from a rate perspective, to Retail because think about those specialty prescriptions. They're largely branded
prescriptions and branded prescriptions carry a lower gross margin than a generic prescription would. So that would
serve to lift Retail gross margins when you transfer those scripts out of Retail into the PBM.
<Q - David M. Larsen>: Okay. So...
<A - David M. Denton>: But it would be immaterial though in totality.
<Q - David M. Larsen>: Okay. So you had like 67 bps of gross margin expansion in Retail. We've been hearing a lot
about generic inflation. One of your competitors has obviously been talking about rate pressures. It's not like the

Specialty Connect had a huge impact on that, you're just performing well...
<A - David M. Denton>: No, that is not – that is certainly not the driver of rate improvement in Retail. You go back
and you look at what's driving the performance in Retail, it continues to be gains in prescription volume, along with the
improvements in GDR and our improvements in economics as we drive down the cost from a procurement standpoint.

Our next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee from Cowen Group. Your line is open. Please proceed with
your question.
<Q - Charles Rhyee>: Yeah, thanks for taken the question. I had a question on the – I think you talked about earlier
the outperformance in Retail Pharmacy and that it was all the more surprising because of the Specialty Connect
transition. At this point, is all specialty drugs that someone comes into the retail outlet, into the retail store, is that all
being recorded in PBM or are there any certain categories that you'll still end up getting dispensed out of retail?
<A - David M. Denton>: Almost all.
<Q - Charles Rhyee>: And then can you talk about what was driving the outperformance at the retail pharmacy side,
then?
<A - David M. Denton>: Again, if you go back, if you look at what's really driving, it is our continued share gains
from a pharmacy perspective. You look at the volumes of prescriptions running through our dispensing channel at retail
continues to enhance our performance from that perspective.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: And Charles, we mentioned in – I'll go back to our prepared remarks where we saw a 55 basis
point increase in pharmacy market share in the fourth quarter. We also acknowledged that there was a bit of an uptick
from the flu season that we began to see in the business in the later weeks in the quarter.
<Q - Charles Rhyee>: Okay. Great. Is there anything on the mix though? And was it more on Medicare versus
commercial, anything – any kind of color that you can provide there? Thanks.
<A - David M. Denton>: No. I don't think there was anything that was materially different than what we've seen in
past quarters from that perspective.

off of PBM in a Retail perspective? And maybe you can help us rank-order it as we think about where it falls compared
to contribution of specialty drugs with kind of like nice rebates like Hep C versus kind of like generics that are on the
marketplace today.
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Ricky, this is Jon. Still early in this whole arena. But as I – what I know today, I would
think about biosimilars as being more like branded competition. And so, the majority of the value will come in the form
of rebates. And obviously, most of that value passes along to our clients. Now to the extent that they're able to make
them interchangeable and function more like generics in the non-specialty world, then I think you would see them act
more like generics. But I think it's early to see how that plays out.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: Okay. And then just one follow-up on the specialty. Obviously, you raised a very interesting
point about the fact that the contribution that you're seeing in the way you can help manage specialty is not just tied to
formulary and that the medical side represents a very nice opportunity. So when we think about kind of like your
customers buying specialties through you and we think about the kind of like the NovoLogix offering and – what do
you think is, or what percent of your clients that buy specialty from you today ask you also to manage it on the medical
side, and how do you think that ramp can progress over time?
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Yes. I mean it's a good question. I would say on the specialty on the medical side, most
of that activity is concentrated with our health plan clients. So, we're seeing a lot of interest in that space. Obviously as
we begin to manage that, we believe it increases our dispensing opportunities as well because some of those drugs can't
be dispensed through us. And we think of our Coram platform as even being an enabler to penetrate the dispensing
space to an even greater extent than what we do today.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: And, Ricky, I think to that point, the value proposition here centers around the ability to
manage the specialty patient, not simply the administration of a particular drug. Okay, recognizing that with the various
assets that we now have, Jon mentioned Coram and our infusion capabilities along with what exists in NovoLogix, we
can demonstrate for the client cost savings opportunities by simply migrating the patient to a lower-cost, high-quality
site of service.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: Okay. Thank you. That's helpful.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Thanks, Ricky.

Our next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Please proceed with
your question.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Thanks, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Hopefully you're surviving the blizzard up
there in the Northeast, several of them.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: We were out shoveling earlier, Scott.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: It's a good thing you're in good health. So more of a conceptual question. I was just kind of
sitting back listening to the call, listening to you guys talk and remembering the Analyst Day. It seems to me if I like
kind of look out over the next 12 months to 24 months, there seems to be an upward bias to business performance. And
I wanted to see if you guys agreed with that. I look at like kind of SilverScript, I look at Medicaid expansion and how
Ohio did it. I look at the front end and the potential to upsell there with all the clinics that are coming in and just the
volumes that are going into your pharmacies. So I'm wondering if you agree with that, that there does seem to be some
upward momentum to your business if you look over the next 12 months to 24 months.
<A - David M. Denton>: Yes. This is Dave. Maybe I'll start. I think as you heard at Analyst Day, despite the fact that
we come from a very large base in the sense of the size of the company, we have a lot of growth outlooks and
opportunities in our business. We outlined over the next five years of how we're going to grow the top line fairly
significantly, gaining share across both the PBM market space as well as the retail market space and be able, through

that share gain, be able to drive performance and operating profit, and with the cash that we generate, be able to further
enhance that through the capital allocation program. So I do think as we look into the marketplace, there's always
challenges in every marketplace, but there's really a lot of opportunities for our differentiated model to plug into payers
and providers and consumers in ways that add value for them and quite frankly add value for us.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Scott, I mean it's a great question. And I think Dave answered it well. The only thing that I
would add is there's still so much flux in the marketplace. And back to Dave's point about we've got a multitude of
assets that allows us – we can be pretty nimble and I think we described that we can pivot to additional changes that we
see in the marketplace in a pretty quick and innovative fashion.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: So – appreciate that. I just had a follow-up on the same line of thinking. It also seems that
the asset productivity is important to you guys and it does seem even though there's margin pressure that the outflow of
money into assets doesn't have to be huge and so we could get some continued increase in ROIC, do you agree with
that as well?
<A - David M. Denton>: I do. I do. I think if you look at what we're trying to do here is as we gain dispensing share,
that dispensing share we can essentially leverage the fixed asset infrastructure of our business both at the Retail
segment as well as in the PBM space. And that really allows us to accelerate our returns profile.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: All right, guys. Thanks. Appreciate your answers.

Our next question comes from the line of George Hill from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - George R. Hill>: Hey. Good morning, Larry and Dave. I have a question about what I'm going to call your
clairvoyance. Because one of the things that I was – I guess you guys, in this case, you guys seem to be able to see the
future. Because when we went to your Analyst Day in mid-December, I'm intrigued that the PBM guidance doesn't
move a basis point despite all the gyrations in the Hep C market.
So I guess my question is, as we think about that – in early December, did you guys know this was coming? Did this all
play out exactly how you guys thought? Other angles are, does it not move the needle? Does it not impact enough
scripts? Are the rebates not big enough? Is the amount of money that you make at Hep C not big enough to move the
needle? I mean not even at the revenue line, it doesn't move the needle. So I guess maybe this is a planning question,
maybe this is a process question, maybe this is a market question. But I guess can you just give us some color on the
background of Hep C and how it all kind of – it all obviously played out exactly according to your expectations.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Well, George, it's Larry. I'll start and then I'm sure Dave will jump in. But I mean we
appreciate your comments. Okay. I would say that as we're doing our planning, our outlook and our guidance range
implies a range of assumptions. And I think I would say at the end of the day, it's that simple, okay, that as we talk
about our outlook for 2015, we've got, within that guidance range of $0.14, it comprehends where the market could go.
And as we've talked about this morning, we're comfortable with where we're at today and that outlook remains intact.
<A - David M. Denton>: And I would think also, George, just from that perspective, as it relates to, let's say, specialty
and Hep C, we've been planning for this event for a while. This wasn't like a shock to us. We had a lot of experience in
this category. We've been working hard with clients and within our organization to better manage specialty for them.
We see the pipeline and have a good view of the pipeline and with that constructed a series of programs that allowed us
to work to improve our performance in this area on behalf of our clients. And so this was something that was very
planful from our perspective. And we kind of saw it coming to some degree.

<Q - George R. Hill>: Okay. And then maybe – the quick follow-up then would be, is this kind of – how the Hep C
market evolved in late December, early January, is there anything different from that playbook that's different from the
playbook with how we thought about the statin class or how we should think about drugs going forward? We get a lot
of questions about – I guess we've gotten a lot of questions about this space. To us, it's just the regular PBM playbook. I
guess, from your perspective in Hep C, was there anything different in the way this kind of all unfolded?
<A - David M. Denton>: No, I don't think there's much different there.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: And George, I think this all goes back to when we started this in 2011 for the 2000 plan year. I
think that we demonstrated in that first year that this can be a cost save – a very effective cost savings opportunity for
clients. And it can be executed at – with a high degree of service to the members. Okay. And certainly this whole
process starts with ensuring appropriate clinical outcomes. And I think we continue to see those opportunities going
forward.
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: George, the only thing that I would say is different as we move into the specialty realm is
there will be more complexity around managing it. So as an example, Harvoni is for genotype 1. And so that's what's
on the formulary for those patients that have Hep C with genotype 1, and then you have other options for the other
genotypes. And so I think you will see a combination of formulary and utilization management programs. So that just
adds a little bit complexity, but I agree with Dave and Larry. It's very similar to what we've seen in the past and our
capabilities are playing out in this space as well.
<Q - George R. Hill>: All right. Thanks, guys. I appreciate the color.

Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Lisa Christine Gill>: Thanks very much. Good morning. Jon, I was wondering if maybe you could just talk about
plan design for 2015. As we talked to some of your clients in our annual surveys in December, people talked about
Minute Clinic. They also talked about maintenance, so obviously we actually talked a lot about specialty today and that
was clearly one of the things that came out when we talked to clients as well. But can you maybe just talk about some
of the other things that are changing for 1/1/2015? And you talked about spending a lot of dollars and time around
implementation. What were some of the changes that came about from a plan design perspective?
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Lisa, I think it was just more of the same, more penetration in high deductible plans and
just higher penetration of all the things that you just talked about. So we really haven't seen anything different than that,
although I will think – I do think you'll see much more aggressive management in the specialty space around plan
designs, so much higher adoption of formulary strategies. And I think as you recall at Analyst Day we did talk about, of
the new business we brought on board, 35% adopted some narrow networks. So I think you're just going to see more
aggressive programs like this with plan designs as clients begin to see these higher trends, year-over-year growth of
their drug spend.
<Q - Lisa Christine Gill>: Okay. Great. And then my follow-up question, Dave, was around Red Oak. On the generic
sourcing side, you talked about the payment from Cardinal, but did you see any incremental savings in addition to the
payment that you saw from Cardinal?
<A - David M. Denton>: Yes, we did. As we said, we're kind of in the early stages with that effort. As we indicated
back at Analyst Day, there's several different ways in which we drive economics here. Part of that is lowering our cost
of goods sold from Red Oak. And we did see some improvement based on the program.
<Q - Lisa Christine Gill>: Is there a way to quantify that? Or you're not quantifying it.

Our next question comes from the line of Frank Morgan from RBC. Your line is open. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Frank G. Morgan>: Good morning. I was curious when you gave your guidance back in December at Analyst
Day, what did you contemplate at that point in time regarding discounts related to Hep C?
<A - David M. Denton>: Frank, that's also a great question. Unfortunately, we can't get into that level of specificity.
But as we talked about earlier, our guidance, as we thought about 2015, had a range of – kind of has a range of
scenarios built within it. And at that point in time, we had some clarity around kind of how the market was going to
shape up for us there.
<Q - Frank G. Morgan>: Okay. And as you think – a lot of discussion today about the specialty and different
strategies. Are there any pieces that you're missing strategically that you feel like you need on the specialty side in
terms of – as new drugs come to market? Thanks.
<A - David M. Denton>: So, Frank, that's a great question. I don't know that there's any – we don't really have any
gaps from an asset perspective. I will tell you, though, that we've been working hard to increase our business within the
medical benefit management sector, if you will, with NovoLogix as a good example. There's probably other
opportunities for us to continue to penetrate that market, so there's probably more to come there. So probably really
early stages from that perspective.
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: I mean Frank, this is Jon. The one space we don't play in much today is the oncology
space. Most of that is administered in physician offices. We do think as the marketplace moves to more risk-based
reimbursement arrangements that that business will view the administration of drugs – they view it as a profit center
today. And as it becomes more risk-based, it'll become an expense center for them. So they'll be looking for solutions
and people that can operate in that space more effectively. So we're working hard to understand how to extend into that
space, and we think our capabilities give us a great, great platform to do that.

deflationary nature. And we believe that that will continue both in the short term as well as the long term. I think as it
relates to Red Oak, I think the team's done a terrific job in standing up that operation. They've met with the lion's share
of manufacturers and we continue to be pleased with the progress. I think that they're tracking consistent as we planned
for them at this point in time.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: And I think I'd just reiterate the three ways in which value is created with Red Oak. Obviously,
one is the fixed payment schedule, which started in Q4. The second one is, there are some additional milestones that
have been created that will allow for additional payments. And then the third is what Dave alluded to on an earlier
question in terms of just the opportunity to create additional reductions in the cost of goods by creating a more efficient
supply chain.
<Q - Alvin Caezar Concepcion>: Okay, thank you very much.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Thanks.

Our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette from UBS. Your line is open. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Steven J. Valiquette>: All right. Thanks. Hi, good morning, Larry and Dave. So I don't know if I missed this, but
was there any general color on the mix of the $0.4 billion in additional PBM selling fees and wins that you had between
health plans and employers or government contracts?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: No. Steve, it was more just general mix probably – maybe it skews a little more to the health
plan side, recognizing some of the true-ups that take place from their enrollment seasons.
<Q - Steven J. Valiquette>: Okay. And then separately, just quickly, the $0.5 million additional PDP lives that you
mentioned for early 2015. Is that net of any Medicare retiree business that you talked about at the Analyst Day that you
may have lost to public exchanges? Or do those particular member losses show up in a separate bucket somewhere
else?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Yes. No, Steve, that's a great question. And that is a net number inclusive of the variables that
you talked about. And so – and by the way, you can go back to one of Jon's slides at Analyst Day that kind of did the
mapping from where we were to what we were projecting including the shift in retirees, what we were projecting open
enrollment at that point in time and it came – the final net number was pretty close to that forecast.
<Q - Steven J. Valiquette>: Okay. Got it. Okay. Thanks.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Thanks.

Our next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research. Your line is open. Please proceed
with your question.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Thanks. Two things. First of all, just to follow on Red Oak, curious on what inning you would
say you're in, in terms of realizing the purchasing benefits from that effort.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Eric, I would say we're probably in the fourth inning or fifth inning in terms of the work and
the opportunities.
<A - David M. Denton>: Yeah, hey, Eric, this is Dave. I – the one thing I would – just one word of caution there, is
that this isn't a game where there, I think there's a beginning and an end. This is a process that is ongoing continuously.
So while we might have got to the fourth inning, as Larry just spoke about, we're going to start a new game soon

enough. And we continually need to work to improve our cost structure, and that's one way we'll do that.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Okay. That's helpful. And then secondly, there was some conversation earlier about the 2016
selling season and the composition. And it sounded like you suggested that the opportunity was similar to that which
you enjoyed in 2015. I'm just wondering if you could talk a bit further about, 2015 was obviously a great success, if
that is – obviously you aspire to repeat that in 2016. But is that reasonable to think that you could achieve a similar
level of success in 2016 relative to what you did for 2015?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Well, Eric, I think there's two comments around that. And first is the fact that as we've been
talking a lot about over the last couple years, the differentiation that the integrated model brings out into the
marketplace and how we think that we can meet clients' needs for their business and obviously their members in a very
differentiated way in terms of satisfying their goals. And I think as we're talking, as we're thinking about the 2016
selling season, I think it – based on where we sit today, it really has more to do with, we expect the RFP activity to be
at a similar level to what we experienced last year. So obviously, it's very early and we'll talk more about it as we go
through the year. But we're optimistic as a result of our integrated model.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: That's great. Thank you.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Robert Willoughby from Bank of America. Your line is open. Please proceed
with your question.
<Q - Robert McEwen Willoughby>: Hey, Larry. Have you assumed any change in strategy at your number one retail
competitor? What might you do differently this year to take advantage of any disruption or how might you be
disadvantaged?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Yeah, Bob, it's Larry. Maybe I'll start and then just ask Helena to jump in as well. And Bob,
listen, I think our focus continues to be on our business and what we can manage and control within the four walls of
what we do well every day and the opportunities that we continue to see there. And maybe I'll ask Helena just to talk
more about how she's thinking about the Retail business and the opportunities that exist there within CVS.
<A - Helena B. Foulkes>: Yeah, I think it's a good time for us, an opportunity for us, just given what's going on. I
mean, the one thing we haven't talked about yet this morning is just the successful launch of this new CVS Health
brand, which is definitely resonating with consumers. So we're seeing about a 1,100 basis point increase in their
awareness of CVS Health and consumers are really seeing our company as a leader in healthcare. And so, that's exactly
what we're hoping for. And we're using that momentum to focus on health and beauty as we talked about at Analyst
Day and just keeping our eye on the ball and running the business and hoping that all of that will come to a good
outcome for this year.
<Q - Robert McEwen Willoughby>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Thanks Bob.

Our next question comes from the line of John Ransom from Raymond James. Your line is open. Please proceed with
your question.
<Q - John W. Ransom>: Hi. Thank you. Just a couple of quick ones. First of all, assuming Nexium goes nonexclusive
as a multi-source, David, is there any reason to assume, as you've said in the past, that that's kind of the best of all
worlds for you if it blows right through exclusivity?

<A - David M. Denton>: Well, I mean, it's hard to say specifically. But my expectation as we've always said is that
we're most advantaged at the point in which there's many manufacturers in the market for a generic drug. And if that
were to occur, I assume that that would be best for us, yes.
<Q - John W. Ransom>: Great. And secondly, I'm curious about – I mean, everybody defines specialty differently.
But I'm curious about what you're telling your clients, and maybe this is a question for Jon, once we lap the Sovaldi
spike, what the specialty trend looks like from there?
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Great question. We have the PCSK9 inhibitors coming out this summer. That could be as
big – could potentially be even bigger than Hep C. So pharma is really focused in this space. So I think this is going to
be an ongoing challenge for our clients and an opportunity for us to step in and really help them manage this area.
<Q - John W. Ransom>: Okay.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: John, again, we've been communicating with clients that left unabated, you can expect to see
specialty trends in the high teens. Next, we'll take two more questions.

Our next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please proceed with
your question.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Yeah, hi. Good morning, guys.
<A>: Good morning.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Larry, you mentioned that you've taken a disciplined approach to preferred Part D networks. I
was hoping that maybe you'd give us a little bit more color on that angle given the marketplace does seem to be
competitive. How important is it for you to have a material presence in that business long term?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Well, Ed, it's a great question. And it is important for us to have a presence in that business,
which we believe we have today, recognizing all the different ways in which we can engage and touch the Medicare
consumer. And you go back to some of the things that we've talked about. We claimed it the Silver Tsunami, the fact
that you've got 10,000 baby boomers turning 65 every day.
Back to your first question, the competitive environment recognizes that participation in a preferred network comes
with associated margin compression. And I think our retail organization has done a terrific job in terms of building an
economic model that evaluates margin compression against forecasted share shifts. And there are times when the
economics make sense and we proceed. And there are other times where the economics don't make sense.
Recognizing that all Part D plans are not equal in terms of their design, whether it's co-pays or the makeup of that Part
D plan in terms of the balance between choosers and low income subsidies. I think at the same time, we also have a
unique opportunity recognizing that you saw the announcements coming out of HHS last week and the focus in terms
of moving more to outcomes management. We participate today in terms of supporting our health plan clients through
stars ratings. And we know that in a PDP plan, we can affect over 50% of that stars ratings with the ways in which we
engage and touch that patient. So we think that there's tremendous opportunities across our book of business to work
with patients as well as health plan clients in terms of achieving their goals.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Thank you.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Okay. Thanks. Last question, please.

Our last question comes from the line of Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Ross Jordan Muken>: Hi, good morning, guys, and congrats.
<A>: Thanks Ross.
<Q - Ross Jordan Muken>: So I'm curious, building a little off of what Helena said and then also just kind of going
back to tobacco, what has been the key things that both the tobacco decision as well as the rebranding have kind of
given you from an enterprise perspective that maybe you weren't looking for originally? And has there been anything
sort of unsuspecting that has been something that's been more challenging to offset the headwind? I'm just trying to see
what was assumed and how it sort of developed either positively or negatively.
<A - Helena B. Foulkes>: Yeah, I mean as Dave and Larry have said, we're pleased with where we are now. There
was certainly a lot of moving parts and it's hard for us to really identify what was driving what. But I'd say in terms of
surprises, probably things like the extent to which our 200,000 colleagues feel incredibly proud about this decision. We
thought they would, but it's really driven a very – a sense of excitement, I would say, among the organization, a sense
of pride to work for a company that would make a decision like this.
The branding I think has been, as I said before, has been successful and it's making people think differently about the
company. And what we're trying to do is say to consumers we're not just like any drugstore on any corner. We're part of
a big healthcare company. And when they see all of the assets that we have and understand all that we do, they start to
think about us very differently. So that's been a really exciting part of this decision as well. And I also think that
internally for our merchants, it's given them a sense of sort of where do we go from here. I mentioned at Analyst Day
all that we're doing around healthy food and health and beauty, and it's given them an even stronger sense of purpose to
drive those businesses, so that's really what we're focused on.
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: And then, Ross, this is Jon. To add to that, as I'm out talking and I'll focus on new
perspective clients that maybe don't know us as well as our existing clients, it's something that we talk about, our
repositioning in the marketplace as a healthcare provider, the discontinuation of tobacco. And there is clearly a halo
effect that I see from our clients that makes them feel good about potentially doing business with the company that has
taken a stand like that in the marketplace.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: And, Ross, I'll just wrap it up by talking about the provider, the physician community. And I
think that we've seen this come into play as we think about some of the health system affiliations that we alluded to in
the call. And this certainly aligns us with their goals as well. And I think it's opening up some doors to some potential
unique opportunities as we go forward.
<Q - Ross Jordan Muken>: Great. Thanks, Larry, and congrats again.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Thanks, Ross.
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Thank you.
Larry J. Merlo
