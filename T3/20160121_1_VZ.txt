Before Fran goes through our results, I'd like to highlight a few items. For the fourth quarter of 2015, we reported
earnings $1.32 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include a few non-operational items that I'd like to
highlight. Our year-end mark-to-market adjustment of pension and OPEB liabilities included a pre-tax $3.2 billion
credit, which decreased our pension and OPEB liability. This adjustment, which was primarily non-cash, was caused by
an increase in the discount rate, the adoption of new mortality assumption tables and the execution of a new
prescription drug contract during 2015.
We also incurred pre-tax expenses of $613 million, primarily related to severance costs under our existing separation
plans. On an after-tax basis, these two items amounted to a net $1.6 billion or $0.40 per share. Additionally, we
recognized a pre-tax gain of $254 million on a spectrum license transaction. On an after-tax basis, this gain amounted
to $158 million, or $0.04 per share.
Excluding the effect of these non-operational items, adjusted earnings per share was $0.89 in the fourth quarter
compared with $0.71 a year ago, or a growth of 25.4%. For the full year, adjusted earnings per share was $3.99
compared with $3.35 in 2014, an increase of 19.1%. On a non-GAAP illustrative basis, if we assumed 100% Wireless
ownership for all of 2014, the adjusted earnings per share growth rate was 16.7% year-over-year.
As a reminder, included in our Wireline results are the operations from the three states that we agreed to sell to
Frontier, which we expect to close at the end of the first quarter of 2016. We recognized a benefit of $0.13 per share for
the full year due to these assets being classified as held for sale. Additionally, the operations of AOL have been
included in our consolidated results since third quarter of 2015. Prior period results do not include AOL.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran.
Francis J. Shammo
Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and Happy New Year. Entering 2016, we are confident in our 3-Tier Strategy
of leading at the network connectivity level in the markets we serve, developing new business models through global
platforms in video and Internet of things and creating certain opportunities in applications and content for incremental
monetization. Our execution model enables us to compete effectively in every market condition and build our
capabilities for future growth and profitability as an innovator in the digital-first mobile world in 2016 and beyond.
As we reflect back on 2015, we demonstrated a balanced performance and a dynamic competitive environment. We
delivered quality growth and strong financial performance in our operating segments while improving our strategic
position and returning value to our shareholders. Overall, our full year adjusted earnings per share grew 19.1% and free
cash flow increased to $18.8 billion excluding tower proceeds, which enabled us to invest and return value to our
shareholders.
Fundamental execution on our strategies is the priority within our segments. In Wireless, we posted another quarter of
quality connections growth and profitability, with sequential improvements in postpaid growth and net adds as well as
net phone additions. Postpaid net adds totaled 1.5 million for the quarter and 4.5 million for the year, excluding
Wholesale and Internet of Things connections. Net phone additions were 449,000 for the quarter and 1.1 million for the
year.
Customer retention was also a highlight, with postpaid churn of 0.96%, down 18 basis points for the quarter. For the
year, churn was also 0.96%, which improved 8 basis points from prior year. Total Wireless revenue grew 4.6% for the
year and our EBITDA margin expanded.
Our Wireline quarterly results were highlighted by Fios revenue and customer growth. Additional Enterprise and
Wholesale revenue slightly improved sequentially while we reduced costs. Overall, our full year Wireline segment
EBITDA margin of 23.5% was up 30 basis points.
We remain committed to consistently investing in our networks for the future. Our 2015 investments have positioned us
for growth and allow us to maintain our network leadership position as consistently acknowledged by third parties.

Wireless densification enables us to add capacity to manage the growing trends of video consumption and the demand
required for the Internet of Things, as well as pre-positioning us for the future 5G technology. We invested in AWS-3
spectrum during the year, acquiring spectrum covering 480 markets for a total value of $10.4 billion.
We continued to execute a disciplined capital allocation model with the priority to invest for the future. We are
committed to returning value to shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. During 2015, we announced the
divestiture of certain Wireline properties to Frontier and intend to use the proceeds to pay down debt. We monetized
the majority of our remaining cell towers and we were able to return value to shareholders in the form of an accelerated
share repurchase of $5 billion. We have returned more than $13.5 billion to shareholders during the year, including
dividends.
As we disclosed in September, our Board of Directors approved a 2.7% dividend increase, which raises our annualized
dividend to $2.26 per share. This was the ninth consecutive year that our Board approved a dividend increase, affirming
their confidence in the strength of our future cash flows.
We remain committed to returning to our pre-Vodafone transaction credit rating profile in the 2018 to 2019 timeframe.
So overall, a strong balanced 2015 which provides operating momentum and lays the foundation for the future.
Now, let's get into fourth quarter and full year performance in more detail, starting with our consolidated results on
slide five. Total operating revenue in the fourth quarter was $34.3 billion, an increase of 3.2%, including revenues from
AOL. We are pleased with AOL's performance in the fourth quarter which does have some seasonality from
advertisers.
For the full year, we added $4.5 billion to our top line, representing growth of 3.6%. Excluding AOL, which was not
part of Verizon a year ago, our top line growth was 0.5% for the fourth quarter. Excluding both AOL and prior period
revenues from the public sector business we sold in 2014, the comparable full year revenue growth rate was 2.6%. This
was below our revenue guidance due to lower wireless phone activations, primarily upgrades, and a less-than-projected
take rate on our device installment payment program in the fourth quarter.
Historically, our consolidated revenues have been primarily driven by growth in both customers and consumption in
Wireless and Fios. The change in the wireless commercial model from an equipment subsidy model to a device
installment payment model increases the revenue sensitivity to wireless equipment volumes. We continue to manage
through the transition to the device installment model.
We remain committed to our Verizon Lean Six Sigma processes on improving the customer experience while
increasing our overall operating and capital efficiencies. The focus on increasing efficiencies has enabled us to sustain a
strong earnings profile as we manage through the revenue transformation in the Wireless and Wireline segments.
Consolidated adjusted EBITDA totaled $46.6 billion in 2015, an increase of 7.7%. And our adjusted EBITDA margin
for the full year was 35.4%, which expanded 130 basis points from 2014.
Let's turn now to cash flows and the balance sheet on slide six. In 2015, cash flows from operations totaled $38.9
billion. This total included just under $2.4 billion of proceeds related to tower monetization transaction, which is
non-recurring. Free cash flow for the year, excluding the tower proceeds, totaled $18.8 billion.
We have been successful in selling selected device installment receivables in the private securitization market to
finance the device payment program and manage working capital. In the fourth quarter, we continued to sell device
installment receivables and received about $2.7 billion in cash proceeds. For the full year 2015, we sold a total of $9.4
billion of device installment receivables resulting in total net cash proceeds of $5.9 billion at year-end. We expect to
continue to sell these receivables in 2016.
Given the success of the device payment program, high credit quality of our customer base and retention history, we
are exploring further diversification of funding sources. Our capital spending was consistent with our guidance of
around $17.5 billion to $18 billion for the year. In total, capital expenditures were $5.2 billion in the fourth quarter and
$17.8 billion for the full year, up 3.4% from 2014. Our balance sheet is strong and enables the financial flexibility to
grow the business. We ended the year with $110.2 billion of gross debt, net debt of $105.7 billion, and a ratio of net

debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.3 times.
Now, let's move into a review of the segments starting with Wireless on slide seven. In the Wireless business, revenue
growth, profitability and cash flows are driven by our high quality retail postpaid customer base. Total Wireless
operating revenues grew 1.2% in the quarter to $23.7 billion. For the full year, operating revenues totaled $91.7 billion,
representing growth of 4.6%. Service revenue of $17.2 billion declined 5.6% for the quarter and declined 3.1% for the
full year.
Equipment revenue increased to $5.4 billion, up 28% from the fourth quarter, and grew 54.4% for the full year. Service
revenue plus installment billings increased 1.4% in the fourth quarter and 2% for the full year. We expect that service
revenue growth will continue to be pressured as more of the customer base moves to unsubsidized service pricing, and
that equipment revenues will grow as the activation rate for device payment plans increases.
The percentage of phone activations on installment plans increased to 67% in the fourth quarter compared with about
58% in the third quarter and about 25% in the fourth quarter of last year. The fourth quarter take rate accelerated but
was below our expectation of 70%, which contributed to equipment revenue growth that was lower than expected. We
expect the first quarter take rate for device installment to be above 70%. During the quarter, 7.6 million phones were
activated on device installment payment plans. We have about 25 million device installment phone connections in total,
representing approximately 29% of our postpaid phone base. Overall, more than 40% of our postpaid phone customers
are on an unsubsidized service pricing.
In terms of profitability, we generated $9.1 billion of EBITDA in the quarter, an increase of 18.9%, and approximately
$39 billion for the full year, an increase of 10.6%. Our EBITDA service margin increased to 52.9%, up from 42% for
the fourth quarter. The more meaningful measurement is EBITDA as a percentage of total Wireless revenue, which
expanded to 38.4%, up from 32.6% in the prior year. For the full year, the EBITDA service margin increased to 55.3%,
up from 48.5%, and our EBITDA margin on total Wireless revenue was 42.5%, up from 40.2% in 2014.
Now let's turn to slide eight and take a closer look at Wireless connections growth. We ended the year with 112.1
million total retail connections, excluding wholesale or Internet-of-Things connections. Our industry-leading postpaid
connections base grew 4.4% to 106.5 million, and our prepaid connections totaled 5.6 million. Postpaid gross additions
improved sequentially to 4.6 million for the fourth quarter and to 16.4 million for the full year. Our disciplined focus on
customer retention resulted in improved postpaid churn of 0.96% in the quarter compared with 1.14% a year ago, an
improvement of 18 basis points.
We are very focused on improving the customer experience starting with the network, simplified pricing, and better
execution in our distribution channels. We are seeing lower customer service call-in rates, which is an indication of
improved customer satisfaction. Our retail postpaid net additions of 1.5 million were high-quality, with a sequential
improvement in the number of 4G smartphone and total phone net adds. We added 906,000 new 4G smartphones in the
quarter, which were partially offset by a net decline in 3G smartphones, resulting in 713,000 net new smartphones.
Total postpaid phone net adds totaled 449,000, which included a net decline of basic phones. Tablet net adds totaled
960,000. Net prepaid devices declined by 157,000. Full year net adds of 4.5 million included 3.3 million 4G
smartphones and 3.5 million 4G tablets. The offset to these additions were net declines in basic phones, 3G
smartphones, and non-tablet Internet devices.
Let's now take a look at 4G device activations and upgrades on slide nine. Total postpaid device activations totaled 13.4
million in the quarter and 46.6 million for the full year. Similar to prior quarters, about 84% of these activations were
phones, with tablets accounting for the majority of the other device activations. We ended the year with 73 million
smartphones in total, and our smartphone penetration increased to 84% of total phones.
4G devices now comprise more than 79% of our retail postpaid connections base. Growth in 4G device adoption is
driving increased data and video usage. Approximately 90% of our total data traffic is on the LTE network, and overall
traffic on LTE has increased by approximately 60% over the prior year. About 8.4% of our retail postpaid base
upgraded to a new device in the fourth quarter, which is up sequentially, but down from just under 10% in the fourth
quarter of 2014.

Wireless capital spending totaled $3.3 billion in the quarter and $11.7 billion for the full year, up 11.5% from a year
ago. We continue to invest in our 4G LTE network to provide the industry's highest reliability, and position ourselves
to capture the efficiencies and capabilities of new technologies. We are expanding capacity through a number of
optimization techniques, effectively managing our spectrum, and further successfully densifying urban markets.
National studies recognize Verizon as the overall 4G LTE network performance leader, leading in categories of overall
performance, network reliability, network speed, data performance and call performance. These are the performance
metrics that matter to the customer.
Improving the cost structure of our Wireless segment is a priority. In the fourth quarter, we restructured our Wireless
organization to improve our ability to address the changing needs of our customers faster and more efficiently. We will
continue work on our operating model on an ongoing basis and are confident that we can improve efficiencies as we
have done in the past.
Let's move next to our Wireline segment starting with a review of our consumer and mass markets revenue
performance on slide 10. In the consumer business, Fios remains the driver of revenue growth and now represents
80.4% of consumer revenue. In the fourth quarter, consumer revenue grew 2.6% and for the full year grew 3.5%. Mass
markets revenue grew 1.5% in the fourth quarter and 2.4% for the full year. Small business, which is included in mass
markets, experienced declines of 5.6% in the quarter and 4.6% for the full year.
The change in the consumer revenue growth trajectory continues as customers right size their existing bundles and core
voice services decline. The demand for Fios broadband only is also increasing, while we are continuing to see a decline
in linear video demand. Customers value having a choice in selecting linear video packages. We had another quarter
with Custom TV representing about one-third of our Fios video sales. In the fourth quarter, Fios total revenue grew
6.8% with consumer Fios revenue growing at 6.6%. This growth was driven primarily by broadband subscriber growth
and increased penetration of Quantum.
The increasing importance of the Internet is evident as customers are requesting higher data speeds. At the end of the
quarter, more than 70% of our consumer Fios Internet customers subscribed to data speeds of 50 megabits per second
or higher, and we have shifted our introductory offers to 50 megabits. We are also seeing an increasing number of
customers opting for higher speeds. As I highlighted earlier, Fios Internet subscriber growth remained strong in the
fourth quarter. In broadband, we added 99,000 net Fios customers for the quarter and 418,000 for the year, and now
have a total of 7 million Fios Internet subscribers, representing 41.8% penetration. Overall, net broadband subscribers
increased by 5,000 in the quarter.
In linear video, we are seeing slowing of market demand. We added 20,000 net customers in the quarter and 178,000
for the year, and now have a total of 5.8 million Fios video subscribers, which represents 35.3% penetration. We are
working closely with Frontier on the sale of our Wireline properties in Florida, Texas and California, and expect to
close the transaction at the end of the first quarter of 2016.
Let's turn to slide 11 and cover Enterprise and Wholesale, as well as the Wireline segment in total. In the Enterprise
space, secular and economic challenges remain, but we are seeing stabilization on a constant currency basis. In the
fourth quarter, Global Enterprise revenue declined 3.3% and on a constant currency basis was down about 2.1%. For
the full year, Global Enterprise revenue declined 5.2% and on a constant currency basis was down about 3.5%.
In our Global Wholesale business, revenues declined 0.2% in the fourth quarter and 3.4% for the full year. While this
quarter improved due to seasonal impacts, we remain cautious on the Wholesale business and believe that a 4% to 5%
decline is more indicative on the underlying trend for the full year 2016.
Total operating revenues for the entire Wireline segment improved to a decline of 0.9% in the quarter and down 1.8%
for the full year. The segment EBITDA margin was 24.2% for the quarter and 23.5% for the year, up 30 basis points for
the quarter and the year. As we have consistently stated, we are very focused on margins and improving the
profitability of the Wireline segment. We are committed to reducing our cost structure while maintaining strong
customer satisfaction. We have achieved savings from restructuring our network and service provisioning, and are
seeing improvements in productivity. We continue to reengineer our work processes to improve efficiency and reduce

costs with some of the future savings depending on timing and the outcome of our current labor negotiations.
As we close on the Frontier sale, we are confident that we will offset the stranded costs at a consolidated level, and we
will report more details post transaction.
Capital spending in Wireline was $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter and totaled $5 billion for the year, down 12.2%,
which is consistent with our strategy to reduce our capital spending in the Wireline segment.
Let's move next to slide 12 for an overview of our 3-Tier Strategy. During 2015, we delivered strong results and further
demonstrated our ability to compete effectively in a dynamic competitive environment as we work through the
transition of our Wireless base from a subsidized equipment model to a device installment payment model, and ramped
up new business models to generate incremental revenue growth into the future.
Total revenue grew at 2.6% on a comparable basis and we delivered adjusted EBITDA margin of 35.4% for the year.
For 2015, adjusted earnings per share of $3.99 continued to grow at a double-digit rate even if you exclude the
depreciation and amortization benefits we realized from the Frontier transaction. Cash flows from operations increased
about 19.1% for the year excluding tower proceeds, and free cash flow totaled $18.8 billion. We delivered more than
$13.5 billion of value to our shareholders in the form of an accelerated share repurchase and dividends.
As I discussed in my opening, entering 2016, we are confident in our 3-Tier Strategy. We are executing and delivering
strong results today through our operating model by growing and serving our customers while driving cost and capital
efficiencies. We are focused on building on our network strength and laying the foundation for global platforms and
applications and content that appeal to all market demographics, especially the millennials. We refreshed our brand
image around the Better Matters campaign to increase awareness of our differentiated strategy around the overall
customer experience and to appeal to growing markets.
At the network connectivity layer, we are investing in our 4G LTE network to provide the industry's highest reliability
and position ourselves to capture the efficiencies and capabilities of its new features. We are expanding capacity
through a number of optimization techniques, effectively managing our spectrum and further successfully densifying
urban markets. We opportunistically purchased spectrum during the year to enhance our capacity and position us for
the future. As we have done throughout our history, we evaluate spectrum opportunities in a disciplined manner,
including the upcoming auction, secondary markets and future spectrum bands that can be made available.
Leadership in 5G technology is another strategy to extend our premier network position. We are working with key
partners to ensure the aggressive pace of innovation, standards development, and appropriate requirements for next
generation of this wireless technology. We will begin pilots in several locations throughout the year.
Our networks enable us to grow our business through new ecosystems in video and the Internet of Things at the
connectivity, platform and solution layers. We are targeting the millennial opportunity in wireless video beyond
connectivity. The acquisition of AOL and Millennial Media during the year added strong capabilities, both global ad
tech platforms and content to complement our digital formatting and content distribution assets.
AOL is scaling its consumer and advertiser base globally and it is positioned very well to take advantage of the strong
secular growth trends in mobile and video as we saw in the fourth quarter. We will look to further enhance our media
asset capabilities. AOL's global capabilities and partnerships are instrumental to our overall long-term global digital
media strategy which includes premium content, distribution and advertising platforms across all screens.
We believe there is a significant opportunity in using the programmatic platform with the data from the wireless
customer base to connect consumers and advertisers in a very targeted and scaled way with relevant and engaging ad
experiences while protecting individual privacy. The go90 application that we launched in 2015 is one element of this
broader video strategy that will allow us to capture and aggregate audience, deliver mobile-first content and generate
incremental revenue via advertising. As the application which uses our video platform evolves and gains attention, you
can expect new and exciting content, features and functionality like the NBA content we added this past quarter.
We are encouraged by the use of go90 not only on the Verizon network, but off of the Verizon network as well. During
2016, we expect to share more results around both the go90 application and our video platform.

Earlier this week, we launched FreeBee Data, a new sponsored data service. With FreeBee Data, Verizon Wireless
subscribers can enjoy content on their mobile devices free of data charges, and it helps businesses drive engagement
and revenue by providing a powerful platform for sponsoring mobile content.
As we have been discussing over the past two quarters, we are offering Custom TV for linear customers to provide
more video choice. We will look to continue to refresh our Fios TV offerings to take advantage of the secular trend of
video bundles with options and more choices to address the increasing over-the-top video trend.
We are taking a leadership position in the Internet of Things. With our experience in networks, devices, platforms and
applications, we have created an ecosystem that will foster innovation and scale globally above the connectivity layer
to enable incremental growth. Our network leadership positions us to capitalize on these new opportunities that require
both a ubiquitous mobile experience and the capabilities of platforms above the connectivity layer.
We are focused on the telematics and transportation vertical and launched our direct-to-consumer product hum in the
third quarter. We also announced our connected city strategy beginning with Savannah and introduced a suite of
developer tools, ThingSpace, to accelerate innovative applications to come to market. At the recent Consumer
Electronics Show, the pipeline for mobile Internet of Things capabilities was very prominent. New revenue streams
from the Internet of Things are growing, with revenues of approximately $200 million in the quarter and about $690
million for the full year, a year-over-year increase of 18%.
Let's move next to slide 13 for our 2016 priorities. Our strategy and priorities remain consistent for 2016. We will
concentrate on growing our quality customer base in both Wireless and Fios, and build upon customer loyalty by
providing the best overall customer experience. We remain focused on network leadership and developing new
ecosystems in video and the Internet of Things by leveraging our ubiquitous network in the United States and scaling
our platforms globally. We are also committed to returning value to our shareholders and maintaining a strong balance
sheet in addition to returning to our pre-Vodafone transaction credit rating profile by the 2018-2019 timeframe.
As previously stated, Verizon expects full year 2016 adjusted earnings to plateau at a level comparable to our strong
full year 2015 adjusted earnings due to the device installment payment model transition, completion of the Frontier
transaction and the ramping of new business models in video and Internet of Things. Additionally, we are targeting the
following for 2016: a consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin consistent with our full year 2015 performance;
consolidated capital spending between $17.2 billion and $17.7 billion, this includes capital spending of approximately
$150 million for the properties sold to Frontier; and a minimum pension funding requirement of approximately $550

<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: Carlos, we could – if David is not there, then we can just move on and pick David up
next.
Operator
Thank you. One moment, sir.
<Q - David William Barden>: Can you hear me now?
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: Yeah. Go ahead, Dave.
<Q - David William Barden>: There you go. Thanks. So thanks for taking my questions. Fran, just as a housekeeping
item, with respect to the notion of a "plateau", could you kind of band that for people? Are you trying to put a plus or
minus 1% or 2% around the $3.99? Are you trying to say $3.99 or better for 2016? Just so the Street can kind of get a
sense as to where the real kind of midpoint there is.
And then second, obviously, we had an extension in bonus tax depreciation last year. It's been something you've been
benefiting from. Could you kind of scope the size of the benefit you're going to get this year?
And if I could, just one last one. You've talked about how cord shaving has been important for the new customers
coming into the Fios space. Could you talk about the – if at all, you're seeing some kind of transition in the existing
base to these skinnier bundles? Thanks.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: All right. Thanks, David. So on earnings per share, though, we started this back I think
midyear in 2015 when Lowell when I started to talk about the plateau and the level comparable to 2015 adjusted
earnings. And the way to think about this is we ended 2015 at $3.99. There's $0.13 of depreciation benefit because of
the Frontier assets being held for sale. So that really is a level set of $3.86.
When we talk about plateauing, we're referring to the $3.99. So when you think about this, you're going from $3.86
from a jump-off point to $3.99. So the way I think about it is we're actually growing earnings in low-single-digits from
2015 to 2016 when you make that one-time adjustment. So we will grow through the benefit of the depreciation this
year.
Some of the reasons for that, as I said on the last quarterly call, some of this is just math moving the wireless
transformation from the subsidy model to the device payment model. And of course, the ramping of our new
businesses, which I've been very clear in the beginning, these are like start-up businesses. And as most start-up
businesses, you have very large losses in the beginning until you can grow the customer bases and start to generate the
profitability.
Moving into the bonus depreciation, yes, we will get a substantial benefit next year, but I want to be clear that you
should not anticipate that our cash tax payments will decrease in 2016. They will actually increase even with this
benefit. And the piece of that is, is because the profitability from a pre-tax income perspective will continue to increase
and we're also still eating through the reversal of prior year bonus depreciations.
So from a cash tax perspective, you should expect our cash tax percentage to continue to increase closer to our effective
tax rate. Now not to the extent of the 35% to 36% guidance that I gave you, but it certainly will move from the low
20%s we realized in 2015 to the upper 20%s in 2016.
On the cord shaving piece, as we said in our prepared remarks, we are starting to see more and more customers coming
into Fios on a broadband-only basis, so just a single play strictly with broadband. As far as our current base goes, we
see a little bit of trending but not much. Most customers are depleting the voice side of the product and keeping the
broadband and video side of the product at this point. So, David, hopefully that answers your question. Let's move to
the next one.

<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: Carlos, ready for next question.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question will be coming from Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your
question.
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Thanks very much. Good morning, Fran. You touched briefly on the auction in your
commentary. I know in the past, you had made some of your interest contingent on some of the rules which we have
now. Maybe you could just think about how we should be thinking about sizing your potential participation, what you
need here.
And there's been a lot of stories about potential asset sales over the months most recently about data centers. Perhaps
you could just talk about your philosophy now that you've done the towers, you're doing the Frontier asset. Or should
we expect or are you considering doing other significant asset sales over the coming year or two? Thanks.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Okay. Thanks, Simon. So, on the auction, let's just – I'll keep this one short on the
incentive auction because of a lot of rules around what I can and can't say at this point. But we will participate in the
auction and I'll leave it at that.
But thinking about spectrum, overall, I think we have to think about the 600 megahertz, which I've talked about
previously and how that fits to our portfolio. We think ahead to 5G. As we said, we'll be at the forefront and we are
currently at the forefront globally talking about standards. We will be the first company to roll 5G out in the United
States and we're currently preparing for those field trials.
The other thing I would say about 5G is we would hope that the FCC moves quickly to adopt the rules to facilitate 5G
deployment. And think about 5G, it may not just be about mobility; it may be about other [ph] U cases (40:48), not just
about mobility.
And then when we think about the unlicensed opportunity, if you studied Consumer Electronics Show these past two
weeks, there were multiple manufacturers who were running side-by-side comparisons of unlicensed, if you will, LTE
or unlicensed spectrum utilized by an LTE carrier right next to Wi-Fi and it absolutely shows no interference, which is
some of the rhetoric out there. And it actually showed that the comparability is, it improves the Wi-Fi performance by
having the managed unlicensed within the LTE carrier.
So again, this just goes to continuing to work with the FCC and having them see through the release and usage of
unlicensed for the LTE carriers. And then, of course, we will continue to utilize the secondary market as we do
quarter-in, quarter-out utilizing swaps which we just completed this past quarter. We're working on another swap that
we'll complete in the first quarter. And also, minimal buys in the marketplace with smaller holders. So that's how we
think about the whole spectrum asset perspective.
On the sale of assets, as Lowell and I have continually stated, we will always look for opportunities. The data centers is
an exploratory exercise to see if the asset is more valuable inside or outside the portfolio. I view that asset similar to the
way we view towers. Is there a way to monetize this asset that contributes value to our shareholders and gives us the
capability to move that capital into higher returning assets for Verizon?
There's no decision that has been made. This is an exploratory. And as we explore, if the numbers come out like it did
on towers, then we'll execute on a transaction. If it doesn't, then we won't. So at this point, again, we will always look at
opportunities to monetize the portfolio to the benefit of our shareholders. Thank you, Simon.
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of John Hodulik from UBS. Your line is now open, sir.
<Q - John Christopher Hodulik>: Okay. Thanks. Fran, I think the churn below 1% was obviously a bright spot for
the quarter. Is that a level that you think you can maintain as you look out into 2016 given the competitive
environment? And then you mentioned some continued pressure on the service revenues looking out. Can you talk a
little bit about the components driving that and when you expect to see an inflection in that metric? Thanks.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Sure. Thanks, John. So on the churn rate, if you recall, when we sat here a year ago and we
entered 2015, we said that concentration of 2015 will be to protect our customer base. And that's exactly what we
executed on throughout 2015, and the execution of that will continue in 2016. The focus will be customer satisfaction
and satisfying our customer base so they stay with us.
And I think that's proven through our very low churn rate this fourth quarter even with the rhetoric from some outsiders
about how they're stealing customers. The churn rate does not reflect that and port outs are down year-over-year. So we
are doing what we said we would do around the loyalty, customer satisfaction comes in here, around our simplicity, and
being simple with customers so they understand what they're getting, and this goes to our loyalty base.
On the service revenue side, I guess the thing I would say on this is, again, this is really to math. Math of shifting from
the subsidy model with higher service revenue to a device payment model where you get a break in service revenue,
but you pay full price for the handset model. As we said, we are through 40% of our customers, we're slightly higher
than 40%, who are now on that new pricing. So you've already seen the impact of that. As I said the last call, we
believe the inflection point will happen at 50%, which we believe we will obtain mid-year.
Coming out of the fourth quarter, though, we did see a slowdown in the take rate of installment sale, but we do believe
that that take rate will accelerate back up above 70% for the fourth quarter. And we're going to announce some
differences here, the shortcoming that will drive some of that behavior towards that.
As you know, we continue to allow our current base customers who upgrade to select whether they take device
payment or subsidy, and what saw in the fourth quarter was we had a higher percentage of our base stay on the subsidy
model, which caused pressure on the P&L of Wireless because of the subsidy take.
So having said that, John, I think that as we go through the year, we'll be able to give you more clarity here. But the
other thing I would ask you to take a look at is the IARPA metric, which if you look at third quarter, it went up by
0.2%, and in the fourth quarter went up 0.9%. So you're already starting to see some of the underlining metrics starting
to absorb some of the repricing. So, I'll leave it at that for 2016, but I'll come back to you as we break through the 50%.
<Q - John Christopher Hodulik>: Great. Thanks, Fran.
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: Next question, Carlos?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Phil Cusick from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your
question.
<Q - Philip A. Cusick>: Hey, guys, thanks. So, Fran, first just following up on John's question. With the current asset
mix, and not just in 2016 but beyond, is this still a business that can grow well above GDP, and how far do you think
above? And second, on Custom TV, you've said in the past that you're sort of pushing towards your minimums on some
of your contracts. How should we think about that potentially impacting Custom TV? Or do you think you could
reopen some of those contracts to let that percent go higher? Thanks.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Okay. Thanks, Phil. So, the answer to your question is, yes, absolutely. And I think we
have to go back to and start at the beginning on the whole top line growth story. So first and foremost, I think the

foundation is our network, our strategy and densification, the use of fiber. Fiber is going to be critical with the
densification, Dark Fiber. 92% of our cell sites are already fiber enabled, the other 8% are microwave, which probably
won't get fiber. So when you look at it, almost 100% of our cell sites are fiber enabled. And every small cell, 100% of
every small cell we deployed is fiber backed.
So this is in preparation of some of the future products and services that we are looking at in conjunction with both
what Marni has under IoT, go90, but also for 5G. If you look at customer satisfaction, this goes to a big component of
the low churn and how we start to increase the value to the customers so that they are willing to pay us more for
increased value. The quality base also goes to this.
So when you look at Wireless, they grew 1.2% here in the fourth quarter. If you look at volume overall, year-over-year,
gross adds and upgrades were down by 1.9 million. So if you just do the backwards math on that, that's in excess of $1
billion of revenue that wasn't there this year that was there last year. So when you look at it, the foundation of Verizon
Wireless is still very strong, and we believe that we can continue to grow the Verizon Wireless revenue streams. On
Wireline, Fios is still the foundation, it's now 80% of the overall Wireline revenue. When you look at what we're doing,
broadband, the pervasiveness of broadband, no one can match our symmetry on the up and downloads. So that's
something that we have against our competition.
We are preparing for the over-the-top model. Custom TV is one of those things that I've said, yes, it has a limited life,
but you're going to see us refresh Custom TV and continue to what consumers want, which is what they – they want
choice. They don't want to have to pay for bundles that they never use. And then, of course, stability of the Enterprise
business also adds to this. Then you jump into our growth engines.
If you look at AOL, AOL this quarter increased $300 million in revenue sequentially from the third quarter. It goes to
the strength of the advertising model under AOL, which is why we bought them. Now some of that is seasonal, but we
believe that they will continue to have strong growth into 2016.
go90, which is still in its beginning stages, and I know we have seen some external reports on the number of downloads
in excess of 2 million, but the key to us is not the downloads, the key is viewership, and it's around content. And we
will continue to add content that is favorable to all generations of population. Obviously, we have a lot of content there
for millennials, but sports and music attain to a lot more than just millennials. So we're attacking all viewership with
this product, and we'll have more to say about that probably midyear.
Internet of Things. If you walked around CES, it's all about the digital mobile world. And we are in best position to
capitalize on that with our smart cities, telematics, with the launch of hum. We started that in the fourth quarter and
we've already seen that there are certain stores in the United States that can't keep the product within Verizon Wireless.
They're continually selling out of the product, and this is a recurring revenue stream. If you think about ThingSpace,
this is really the adjunct to the Consumer Electronics Show where we've opened up our platform. We now have over
4,200 developers working on that platform, and that's just since October 29 of this year. So yes, it was a transition year
in 2015, it will be a transition year in 2016. But I am confident that with the strategies that we are taking that we will
absolutely be a GDP growth company post-2016.
On Custom TV, we talked about that. We will refresh that here in the short term to be in compliance with the
contractual arrangements that we need be in compliance with. So thanks, Phil.
<Q - Philip A. Cusick>: Is there a hearing that needs to happen at some point this year or a trial?
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Are you relating to ESPN?
<Q - Philip A. Cusick>: Yeah.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Look, this will go its course. I mean, they're a great partner of ours. We'll continue to work
with them, and I'm not going to speak to the actual lawsuit.

<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: Next question, Carlos, please?
Operator
Thank you. The next question will be coming from Mike McCormack from Jefferies. Please go ahead with your
question.
<Q - Michael L. McCormack>: Hey, guys. Thanks. Fran, maybe just a quick follow-up on the IARPA question. How
fast do you think equipment revenue starts to ramp up here? I guess just thinking about the percentage of those
customers making payments versus those that are on non-subsidized plans, is that gap – there's probably some retention
built into that, but I assume that gap can close over time. Just your thoughts around that. And then just a quick other
question regarding towers. We've heard a couple of your competitors sort of downplaying future tower needs and trying
to bypass some of that cost. Just trying to get a sense where you think as far as your needs for tower goes.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Okay. Thanks. So on the IARPA, keep in mind, only 29% of our customers currently,
today, are on a device payment plan. So they're actually taking the installment plan and paying us full price for the
equipment. But 40% of our customers who fulfilled their subsidy contract have moved over to that pricing, so they're
getting the discount. So we're absorbing that. And as I've said, once you get to that 50%, you should see that inflection
point start to occur. And you're already starting to see some of that in the IARPA-type metric. So it's hard for me to
forecast exactly what will happen here, but the forecast that I have is at 50%, you start to see an inflection point, and
we'll talk more about that as we go through the quarters.
As far as towers go, look, I mean, we continue to build macro towers but at a much lower rate than historically. Our
focus is really around small cells, diversified antenna systems, in-building. But keep in mind that each of those small
cells, in-building and antenna systems all get fiber back to a main macro cell. So the macro cells still have an important
role in how you deliver traffic into those small cells. So as far as building and creating new towers, that's at a much
slower rate, but the importance of the tower is still there.
<Q - Michael L. McCormack>: Great. Thanks, Fran.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Sure.
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: Carlos, next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. The next question will be coming from Brett Feldman from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<Q - Brett Joseph Feldman>: Thanks for taking the question. And, Fran, you had noted how churn and upgrades, they
were all lower year-on-year. And it seems that across the sector, activity levels have been lighter than we might have
thought, whether it's churn or gross adds or upgrades. Why do you think that is? Do you think that this is a temporary
factor or do you think it's the new normal? Or really, I guess the question is, what do you think is going to happen in
2016?
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Okay. Thanks, Brett. So, look, I mean, 2014 was a unique year. You had a very different
form factor come out from Apple, which drove a lot of traffic to that iconic device. You continue to have innovation
from Samsung and LG, but we didn't have that huge change in the handset this year that we saw a year ago. So that, I
think, affected some of the upgrade model. But when you look at it, we still did about 1.5 million more upgrades in the
fourth quarter than we did in the third quarter. So the volume of upgrade still increased, it just wasn't what it was a year
ago. And if you remember, I said coming into this back – way back in the second quarter, I said I did not anticipate that
the fourth quarter this year would be in a similar volume to the fourth quarter of last year. But if you go back to the
previous years, I think you'll see similar lower volume years, and then you have iconic devices come out, and then it
stimulates some usage case there. So for 2016, it's too early to tell yet, but I would think that we'll see similar trends

that we did in 2015.
<Q - Brett Joseph Feldman>: Are you seeing any evidence that as customers move to installment plans, they actually
keep their devices longer?
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Well, for our base, it's too early to tell because the first generation of them are just starting
to mature. So until I get some real factual data on that, it's hard for me to answer. My own personal opinion here is that
if you look at history, a third of your customer base upgrades every year. I don't see that changing regardless of what
plan the customer is on.
<Q - Brett Joseph Feldman>: Great. Thanks for taking the question.
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: Carlos, next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. The next question will be coming from Mike Rollins from Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Michael I. Rollins>: Hi. Thanks for the opportunity. Just two questions, if I could. First, Fran, if you could just
talk about what Verizon was able to accomplish on cost-cutting in 2015 and how investors should think about that
relative size in 2016. And second, as you look across your different business segments, are you seeing any changes in
the macroeconomic backdrop or a risk of a recession? Thanks.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Okay. Thanks, Mike. So on the cost-cutting, look, I think the last three years to four years,
we've talked about this and we're an extremely disciplined corporation as far as costs go. With the launch of our
Verizon Lean Six Sigma program three years ago, that continues to maintain momentum. We took out almost 30
million calls, down from a year ago. So there's a lot of progress being made on self-serve. There's a lot of progress
being made within our logistics system. I mean, this year alone, we generated working capital benefits from how we
handle our phone inventory.
So you saw the Wireless restructure this year was the first restructure we had, really, since the inception of Verizon
Wireless. So as we go into 2016, you saw us take that severance charge, and I would tell you, most of that severance
charge was related to head count that is already completed in the fourth quarter. So entering into 2016, we continue on
the path that we were on. We will continue to look at customer satisfaction, more self-serve options that reduce the
amount of calls that we have to take from customers. So there's still a lot of work to be done around our cost structure.
And if you look at Wireline, as we came into this year, Lowell and I said we would improve the profitability of
Wireline. That came from all the cost reductions that John and his team achieved. So we will continue on that path and
I feel good about that.
As far as overall economics, I'm not really seeing much of anything in the consumer spaces that we drive. I look at
what everybody else looks at, and we'll have to wait to see what 2016 comes out, but I'm certainly not going to predict
any negativism there.
<Q - Michael I. Rollins>: Thank you.
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: Carlos, next question?

Thank you. The next question will be coming from Craig Moffett from MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.
<Q - Craig Eder Moffett>: Hi. Good morning, guys. Two questions if I might. First, on go90, can you update us a
little bit on what the early results are and what learnings you have had from go90? And just given your comments about
the roughly flat year-over-year EPS and the impact that go90 might have on that, I think a lot of us have concluded that

there is likely to be something significantly bigger coming this year with respect to marketing and content. Can you at
least give us a timeline for when we might see those kinds of developments on go90?
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Sure. Thanks, Craig. So when I think about the whole portfolio of go90, Verizon Digital
Media Services and AOL, obviously, we just launched all these products, so there is a startup. It was the first fourth
quarter that we advertised these types of launches. You're going to see that continue through the four quarters of 2016,
which was not there in 2015. So there will be pressure from these startup companies.
Our learnings on go90 are very simple. We're looking at how many times individuals revisit the platform in one day
and we're starting to see some positives there, where people will come in multiple times during the day. And that's
important because that's what's viable to the advertising community. So the whole basis here is we have to ramp
viewership. I will tell you internally, we have surpassed what we thought we would have at this point in time. We have
set higher targets for 2016 because we needed to build the viewership in a much quicker fashion.
I think what you're seeing here from AOL is a very strong fourth quarter. Now there is seasonality to that, but as I
mentioned, I am looking at – for them to grow substantially in 2016. And so I think when you put this together, I think
the top line will start to reflect some of the things that we're looking for, but it will create bottom line pressure. These
will not, especially go90, will not be a profitable product probably within a one-year to two-year horizon right now.
When we launched it, we said two years to three years, but that's probably out two years before that will become a
profit contributor to the enterprise. But it will certainly build on the top line perspective. But right now, we're focused
on viewership, not necessarily the profitability of the product.
So I'll stop there. As I said, we will come in with much more detail probably mid-year and start to give you some
viewership into exactly some of the results of go90 and AOL.
<Q - Craig Eder Moffett>: And, Fran, related to that question, if I could, on AOL, now that you've had AOL for a
while, there was some talk and I think you directly spoke to the possibility of a Yahoo! or something like that. Are
there other assets that now that you've had AOL for a while, you think makes sense to expand that part of your business
with?
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Well, look, I think we've been pretty open since we acquired AOL, as we said, that we
would continue to add to that portfolio. We acquired Millennial, which we talked about. So, yes, I mean there are
things that we continue to look at for fill-ins, if you will. The other one that you brought up, it's intriguing, but there's
really nothing to respond to at this point on that. So, look, we will continue to look at all of our options, as Lowell and I
said, we will continue to look at opportunities externally and look at opportunities internally. And if they make sense
for the shareholder, then we'll execute on those opportunities.
<Q - Craig Eder Moffett>: Okay. Thanks, Fran.
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: Okay, Carlos, time for one last question.
Operator
Thank you. Your last question will be coming from Amir Rozwadowski from Barclays. Please go ahead with your
question.
<Q - Amir Rozwadowski>: Thank you very much. Fran, you had mentioned that you continue to look to monetize
your handset receivables. I think in your prepared remarks, you had mentioned that you were looking at other
alternatives. Perhaps you might be able to elaborate. We've obviously seen your competitors look to other means and
funding strategies to support their businesses, so any thoughts on the potential options you are considering would be
most appreciated.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Sure. Thank you, Amir. So, just to refresh, we monetized our securitized $9.4 billion of
receivables. We received gross cash of $7.2 billion. We obviously paid off some of those securitizations, so about a
$5.9 billion net cash. So when you think about that, we absorbed about $3.5 billion within our working capital this year

from the switch to the device payment model.
I will tell you that we have been talking to the rating agencies about different types of financing, and I will probably
leave it at that at this point. But we will be looking at potential public markets, as well as private markets, but we will
stay with the securitization model as well. So we're just looking at very different alternatives to support the program
going forward because we do believe it will continue to grow in 2016, and more to say on that when we come to a
conclusion on that one, Amir.
<Q - Amir Rozwadowski>: And then if I may, just one follow-up. You folks seem to be taking the lead with
discussing a number of new bandwidth enhancing technologies, and you had alluded to this sort of on your prepared
remarks around 5G developments in unlicensed spectrum. How should we think about your ability to bolster the
carrier's capacity moving forward, utilizing these types of developments? And ultimately, do you believe there is a path
to improving your capacity without actually having to broadly expand your spectrum portfolio at this point?
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: The answer to the question is yes. If you look at some of the small cell technology and also
some of the technology that can be utilized at the cell site, I know there's a fancy name for it, but I'm not the engineer
here. But it gives you the capability to be able to tilt antennas and turn antennas to where the capacity is. So if you think
about football game Sundays and college games, we have the capability to utilize our current resources to increase
capacity without any spectrum capacity. So there is a number of technologies that are coming.
Obviously, when we launched 4G, we said it would be 5 times more efficient than 3G. 5G is too early, but my
suspicion is, is that we're going to see some similar benefits there from a capacity standpoint, which is one of the
benefits of 5G. So yes, I think that if you look at spectrum, we are in a very, very good spectrum holdings as we said
with all my other comments around spectrum and how we utilize unlicensed, along with what we bought in AWS and
the repositioning of what we currently have on 3G over to 4G. So utilizing all of these items, we feel that we are in
very, very good shape from a capacity standpoint.
<Q - Amir Rozwadowski>: Thank you very much for the incremental color.
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: Okay. Thank you for your questions.
Michael T. Stefanski
Before we end the call, I will just turn it back to Fran for a few more remarks.
Francis J. Shammo
Okay. Thanks, Mike. So, look, 2015 was a year of significant change at Verizon. And even with all that change, we
delivered a strong financial year, continued to invest in growing our customer base, invested in our networks,
developed and expanded new businesses, and returned value to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share
repurchase.
2016, we'll continue what we started in 2015. We will focus on execution and growth with our 3-Tier Strategy and
heritage. We will continue to build on a strong network and customer foundation. With our foundation, we will
compete effectively in this dynamic marketplace. We will bring new products and services to market and continue to be
the leader in the digital first mobile world. We look forward to maintaining our positive momentum to create value for
our customers and our shareholders, and I would like to thank you for joining Verizon today. Have a great day.
Operator
