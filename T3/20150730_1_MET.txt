MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the MetLife Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Release
Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer
session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to
historical information, statements in this call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal
securities laws, including statements relating to trends in the company's operations and financial results and the
business and the products of the company and its subsidiaries.
MetLife's actual results may differ materially from results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as result of
risks and uncertainties, including those described from time to time in MetLife's filings with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission, including in the Risk Factors section of those filings. MetLife specifically disclaims any
obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future
developments, or otherwise.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ed Spehar, Head of Investor Relations.

Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to MetLife's second quarter 2015 earnings call. We will be
discussing certain financial measures not based on generally accepted accounting principles, so-called non-GAAP
measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and related definitions to the most directly comparable GAAP
measures may be found on the Investor Relations portions of metlife.com, in our earnings release, and our quarterly
financial supplement. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP
measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it's not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment and
net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP
net income.
Now joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and
John Hele, Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. Also here with us today
to participate in the discussions are other members of management, including Bill Wheeler, President of Americas;
Steve Goulart, Chief Investment Officer; Michel Khalaf, President of EMEA; and Chris Townsend, President of Asia.
After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session. In fairness to all participants, please limit yourself to one
question and one follow-up.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve.
Steven Albert Kandarian
Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report strong results for the second quarter of 2015.
Operating earnings were $1.8 billion, up 11% from the second quarter of 2014 and operating earnings per share were
$1.56, a 12% increase over the prior-year period. Operating return on equity was 12.5% in the quarter and tangible
return on equity was 15.3%.
Second quarter results were negatively impacted by the strong dollar. Operating earnings grew 11% on a reported basis
and 16% on a constant currency basis. Favorable tax items, improvement in both investment and underwriting margins,
and growth in the business more than offset the negative impact from foreign currency translation. Investment margins
remain healthy in the quarter, with an average investment spread for U.S. product lines of 227 basis points versus 215
basis points in the prior-year period. This spread has been in the range of 210 to 240 basis points during the past few
years, which highlight the resilience of our investment margins despite a multi-year period of low interest rates.
Underwriting margins were also favorable in the quarter. After adjusting for notable items, this is the fourth
consecutive quarter that underwriting margins have improved versus the prior-year period. In the second quarter,
underwriting margins were better in Retail Life, Group Life, Group Non-Medical Health, and Property/Casualty.
Turning to regulatory matters, I will begin with a brief update on our appeal of the government's designation of
MetLife as a systemically important financial institution, or SIFI. Tomorrow, the Financial Stability Oversight Council
will file a brief opposing MetLife's motion for summary judgment and supporting its own position. On August 21,
MetLife will file a final reply brief. At this time, the judge has not informed us whether she'll be holding an oral
hearing and the timing of the final decision is difficult to predict.
With regard to capital rules, the passage of the Insurance Capital Standards Clarification Act late last year provided
flexibility for the Federal Reserve to develop rules appropriate for the business of insurance. The Federal Reserve is
working on the required standards, and I am hopeful that those deliberations will lead to a suitable proposal.
Developing an appropriate insurance capital standard in the United States is also important to informing the
development of global capital standards. While the timing for producing a domestic capital standard remains uncertain,
we believe global standards should not be finalized before a domestic standard is developed.
Upon completion, both standards should be tailored for the insurance business model. We are supportive of legislation
that has been introduced to encourage greater transparency and increased congressional oversight of U.S. participation
in the international standard-setting process.

Another policy issue MetLife is following closely is the proposed fiduciary rule from the Department of Labor. While
proponents argue the rule will help individuals save for retirement, we believe it will have the opposite effect by
reducing choice, increasing cost, and limiting access to financial education and investment advice. Wealthier investors
may not be significantly impacted by the rule because their assets generate sufficient fees to pay for investment advice.
However, assets of middle income investors are unlikely to generate fees sufficient to offset the higher cost of offering
advice under this rule. Consequently, those consumers do find it difficult, if not impossible, to receive face-to-face
investment advice.
The proposed rule is particularly problematic for individual annuities, which are the only products that provide
consumers with a variety of benefits, including guaranteed retirement income they can never outlive. The proposed rule
effectively makes it a conflict of interest to sell your own products. Without substantial modifications, the proposal
could force companies such as MetLife to choose between manufacturing individual annuities and distributing them. It
is unclear what public policy goal is served by making it more difficult for companies to provide guaranteed retirement
income to consumers.
MetLife submitted comments on the proposed rule to the Labor Department last week and the department will be
holding public hearings from August 10 through August 12. We are confident the policymakers can find a way to
protect the interest to consumers while still preserving access to much-needed retirement advice.
I would now like to comment on cash. As I said in MetLife's most recent Annual Report, we need to do a better job of
generating free cash flow, which is the most important metric in determining a company's ability to return capital to
shareholders. I am pleased that the ratio of free cash flow to operating earnings has been on a upward trend since 2012,
and we remain confident in our target of 45% to 55% for 2015 to 2017. Increasing the amount of cash generated by the
business is an enterprise-wide imperative at MetLife.
Our focus on cash is an extension of a strategy that we announced in May 2012, which centered on improving our
return on equity while also reducing our cost of equity capital. We have successfully repositioned our business to
achieve higher returns with lower risk and are now working diligently to make sure the products we sell strike the right
balance between returns and cash generation.
I have three observations I would like to share with you related to this initiative. First, we are conducting a granular
analysis of the cash and capital characteristics of our business. In each segment that we have examined, we have
identified opportunities for improvement. Second, our goal is not maximum free cash flow today as that would mean
foregoing attractive investment opportunities in the business. Our goal is to grow free cash flow over time. Third, while
we are working toward a business model that will produce compelling growth in free cash flow, we also have the
potential to optimize our balance sheet if MetLife's SIFI designation is overturned or the new capital requirements are
reasonable.
Finally, I want to recognize the contributions of Bill Wheeler to the success of MetLife. As most of you know, this is
the last earnings call for Bill, MetLife's President of the Americas region. As we announced in April, Bill is retiring
next month after 17 years with the company. I want to take this opportunity to thank Bill personally for all that he has
done to help MetLife and me over the years. Bill has contributed in numerous ways to MetLife's success.
As Treasurer, he played a critical role in taking MetLife public in 2000. As CFO, he helped guide the company safely
through the financial crisis. And as President of the Americas, he restructured the U.S. retail business and led our
acquisition of Provida.
When I joined MetLife as Chief Investment Officer in 2005, Bill did more than anyone else to help me learn the
insurance business, especially the liability side of the balance sheet. During my time as CEO, Bill has been a strong
partner in developing and executing on our strategic plan.
Bill, on behalf of our employees, our customers, and our shareholders, thank you for all that you've done to make
MetLife one of the greatest life insurance companies in the world.

In closing, MetLife had a strong quarter with double-digit operating EPS growth despite ongoing pressure from low
interest rates and a strong dollar. We continue to face regulatory uncertainty but remain hopeful that outcomes will be
manageable. Finally, we are focused on improving the cash flow characteristics of the business, an effort that we
believe is necessary to maximize shareholder value.
With that, I will turn the call over to John Hele to discuss our financial results in detail. John?
John C. R. Hele
Thank you, Steve, and good morning. Today, I'll cover our second quarter result, including a discussion of insurance
margin, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and
capital.
Operating earnings in the second quarter were $1.8 billion, up 11% from the prior-year period and up 16% on a
constant currency basis. Operating earnings per share were $1.56, up 12% from the prior-year period and 17% on a
constant currency basis. This quarter included one notable item in our Asia business. As discussed on our first quarter
earnings call, effective April 1, the Japanese corporate tax rate was reduced from 31% to 29%. As a result, we have
recorded a one-time tax benefit of $174 million in the second quarter. The operating earnings portion of the one-time
benefit was $61 million, or $0.05 per share. We estimate that the current year tax benefit from the rate reduction will be
approximately $24 million in 2015.
Adjusting for notable items in the current and prior-year periods, operating earnings were up 10% and 16% on a
constant currency basis. The key drivers of growth on a constant currency basis were favorable investment margins,
business growth, lower taxes, and underwriting improvement. Higher expenses were a partial offset to these favorable
items.
Turning to our bottom line results, second quarter net income was $1 billion, or $0.92 per share. Net income was $723
million less than operating earnings, primarily because of derivative losses. These losses were driven by higher interest
rates and weakening of the U.S. dollar against certain currencies.
The second quarter variance between operating earnings and net income includes asymmetrical and non-economic
accounting of $856 million after-tax. Net income adjusted for asymmetrical and non-economic accounting was above
operating earnings, primarily due to the portion of the one-time tax benefit in Japan not reflected in operating earnings.
Book value per share, excluding AOCI other than FCTA, was $50.73 as of June 30, up 4% year-over-year. Tangible
book value per share was $41.73 at June 30, up 8% year-over-year.
With respect to second quarter margins, we continue to see a good rebound in underwriting result, which were up
approximately $0.03 per share after adjusting for notable items in the prior-year quarter. Underwriting improvement
was primarily due to better mortality experienced in Retail Life, which returns to a normal level after adverse claims
experienced in the first quarter. Retail Life's interest-adjusted benefit ratio was 53.0%, within the expected range of
50% to 55%, unfavorable to the prior-year quarter of 55.2% after adjusting for a one-time benefit related to a disability
waiver reserve. Average net claims from large-based policies declined from an elevated level in the first quarter.
The Group Life mortality ratio was 86.1%, or toward the low end of the expected annual range of 85% to 90%. The
ratio is favorable to the prior-year quarter of 86.9% due to lower claims experienced across several product. The
Non-Medical Health interest-adjusted loss ratio was 80.5%, favorable to the prior-year quarter of 82.8% and within the
targeted 77% to 82%. Disability results improved year-over-year due to lower incidence and severity as well as higher
net closure.
In dental, as anticipated, we saw higher utilization following low utilization in the first quarter. We believe the low
utilization in the first quarter was a function of adverse winter weather.
In Property & Casualty, the combined ratio including catastrophes was 100.1% of retail and 96.0% in group. The
combined ratios, excluding catastrophes, were 80.2% in retail and 85.5% in group. Overall, P&C underwriting results

improved versus the prior year due to lower cat losses and more favorable prior-year development.
Turning to investment margins, the average of the four U.S. product spreads in our QFS was 227 basis points in the
quarter. Higher recurring net investment income benefited from a conversion of the securities accounting system for the
U.S. general account, and this contributed approximately 5 basis points to our product spread. Excluding this
adjustment, the simple average was 222 basis points, up 7 basis points year-over-year due to higher variable investment
income. Pre-tax variable investment income was $427 million, slightly above our 2015 quarterly guidance range of
$325 million to $425 million. After taxes and the impact of DAC, variable investment income was $278 million, up
$57 million versus the prior-year quarter due to good performance across asset classes.
Product spreads, excluding variable investment income in the accounting system conversion, were 182 basis points,
down 8 basis points versus the prior year quarter. Core yields declined as a result of the low interest rate environment.
Average new money yield continue to run roughly 100 basis points to 150 basis points below the average yield of the
assets rolling off the portfolio.
With regard to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 24.3%, unfavorable by 110 basis points to the prior-year
quarter of 23.2%. Approximately, half of this increase in the ratio was attributable to lower operating revenues from
single premium product. Sales of these products can fluctuate materially from quarter-to-quarter.
Expenses were elevated in the quarter due to higher costs within MetLife's employee benefits program and higher
regulatory costs. Expenses can be volatile for both of these categories. We would expect to see operating expense ratio
improvement in the second half of the year relative to the second quarter. Gross expense saves were $262 million in the
second quarter, and net saves were $194 million after adjusting for reinvestment of $33 million and one-time cost of
$35 million.
I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter. Retail operating earnings were at $690 million, up 2% versus
the prior-year quarter and up 6% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Growth in retail was driven by stable
underwriting and higher variable investment income. Life & Other reported operating earnings of $278 million, up 5%
versus the prior-year quarter and 16% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary drivers were
favorable underwriting primarily in life and higher variable investment income. Life & Other PFOs were $2.1 billion,
essentially flat year-over-year as growth in the open block was offset by runoff of the closed block.
Core Retail Life sales were up 4% year-over-year, driven primarily by an increase term life. Annuities reported
operating earnings of $412 million, essentially flat to the prior-year quarter. Higher variable investment income and
lower taxes were offset by lower core spreads, higher expenses, and a less favorable initial market impact. Variable
annuity sales were $1.9 billion in the quarter, up 16% year-over-year and sequentially.
We're seeing good traction with our new VA guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit rider, FlexChoice, which was
launched in February. We expect to see FlexChoice sales continue to grow in 2015 but at a less rapid pace than we had
expected. Also, sales of Single Premium Immediate Annuities are below our plan. As a result, we are lowering our
expectation for total Annuity sales growth in 2015 for more than 50% to more than 20%.
GVWB reported operating earnings of $231 million, up 11% versus the prior-year quarter and 9% after adjusting for
notable items in both periods. Growth in the quarter was driven by underwriting improvement and business growth.
GVWB PFOs were at $4.4 billion, up 2% year-over-year. Sales were down 13% year-over-year as we were seeing an
impact from an increase in competition, particularly dental. Sales of voluntary products increased 22% due to growth in
Accident & Health and Property & Casualty.
Corporate Benefit Funding reported operating earnings of $406 million, up 12% versus the prior-year quarter and 19%
after adjusting for excess variable income in the prior-year quarter. The key driver was an increase in investment
margin. CBF PFOs were $455 million, down 44% year-over-year due to lower pension closeout and structured
settlement annuity sales. On closeouts, we continue to see a good pipeline of small to midsized cases, and we wrote a
contract in July with over $500 million of premium.

Latin America reported operating earnings of $116 million, down 15% from the prior-year quarter but up 3% on a
constant currency basis. U.S. Direct, which included Latin America's results, had an operating loss of $20 million
versus $8 million in the prior-year quarter. The loss this quarter was higher than expected due to business strain from
strong sales, up 70%, and claims volatility in the quarter. We expect losses to moderate in the second half of the year.
Excluding U.S. Direct, Latin America operating earnings were up 13% on a constant currency basis, driven by business
growth, partially offset by less favorable market impact. Latin America PFOs were $1.1 billion, down 3% but up 13%
on a constant currency basis driven by business growth across the region. Total sales were down 40% on a constant
currency basis, primarily due to a large contract in Mexico in the second quarter of 2014. Excluding this contract, sales
were up 4% versus the prior-year quarter.
Turning to Asia. Operating earnings were $425 million, up 31% from the prior-year quarter and up 45% on a constant
currency basis, driven by lower taxes as a result of the Japan tax rate change and strong business growth across the
region. Asia PFOs were $2.2 billion, down 4% from the prior-year quarter but up 9% on a constant currency basis,
driven by strong growth across all key markets. Asia sales were up 1% on a constant currency basis due to growth in
Japan and continued growth in A&H sales across the region, offset by a decline in retirement sales.
EMEA operating earnings were $50 million, down 31% year-over-year and down 7% on a constant currency basis.
Adjusting for favorable tax items of $7 million in the prior-year quarter, operating earnings were up 6% on a constant
currency basis, driven by business growth, particularly in the Gulf and the UK. EMEA PFOs were $658 million, down
8% from the prior-year period but up 10% on a constant currency basis. Total EMEA sales increased 7% on a
constant-currency basis due to strong growth in employee benefits and A&H sales across the region.
I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately
$6.2 billion at June 30, which is up from $5.7 billion at March 31. This increase reflects subsidiary dividends, the
repayment of senior debt, and the payment of our quarterly dividend. We also refinanced our $1.5 billion Series B
preferred stock during the quarter. The lower dividend would generate approximately $19 million of savings on a
full-year basis during the first five-year fixed term of the security.
Turning to our capital position. We report U.S. RBC ratios annually, so we do not have an update for the second
quarter. For Japan, our solvency margin was 957% as of the first quarter of 2015, which is the latest public data. For
our U.S. insurance companies, preliminary second quarter statutory operating earnings and statutory net income were
approximately $900 million. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $28 billion as
of June 30, which was comparable to December 31.
In conclusion, MetLife had a strong second quarter. Investment margins remain healthy and underwriting improved
year-over-year for the fourth consecutive quarter. In addition, our cash and capital position remains strong, and we
continue to successfully execute on our strategy as we seek to maximize shareholder value.
And with that, I would turn it back to the operator for your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] One moment, please, for your first question. Your first question comes from the line
of Eric Berg from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Eric N. Berg>: Thanks very much. John, you have indicated that because of Met's status as what I believe is the
only listed New York-domiciled life insurer, so then the only listed large New York-domiciled life insurer, the other
big New York companies are mutuals of course. But you've accumulated substantial additional reserves above and
beyond what would have been the case if you were, say, a New Jersey company or domiciled in any other state. What's
the status of your efforts to, not to release, but what is the schedule under which you would release these reserves in
connection with the rising interest rates?

<A - John C. R. Hele>: As a New York company, and other NAIC companies, we do annual cash flow testing. And
these are typically done under the NAIC guidelines set by the actuaries of the company and the chief actuary of the
company signs off on how the reserves are tested. These are done every year based on the yields at the end of the year
and their shocks down from there based on typically prescribed rates. New York, through prescribed letters they send to
us each year, suggests more conservative reserves often that our actuaries would set on a normal basis, and this is some
of the additional reserves that we hold in New York.
Of course, as interest rates rise slowly over time, and we continue to do the cash flow testing, some of the reserves that
have been set up for lower interest rates would be released. But it depends each year on how New York suggests to us
to set our assumptions for those reserves, and it would be released over time. Because often, the reserve increases are
over a period of time or they could be immediate, so it depends on the type of testing that we are doing. So slowly over
time, the answer, is how we would expect that some of this would be released as interest rates rise.
<Q - Eric N. Berg>: One question for Steve to wrap up. Steve, you said publicly that, and I will use – I won't quote
you, I don't remember exactly what you said, but I think the spirit of what you said is that – I think you said at one of
the conferences where you gave a presentation that you're feeling better than you have been feeling about the tone
coming out of Washington and the general outlook for, that you are hopeful about, a reasonably positive outcome for
Met and others, with other systemically important financial institutions regarding capital requirements. What exactly is
happening? What's the basis for your optimism or increasing hope that we're going to get a favorable outcome here?
And am I characterizing your position, you're thinking correctly? Thank you.
<A - Steven Albert Kandarian>: Eric, we've been working closely with policymakers and regulators over the last
several years since Dodd-Frank was passed, and the nature of our conversations and the tone of our conversations
provide me more optimism than I had, let's say, three years or four years ago. But again, we try to be cautious in our
optimism because obviously, if we were to be too aggressive on capital management and the rules were
disadvantageous to us, we would not want to have to go to the marketplace and raise large amounts of equity to meet
rules that, again, we don't have yet in draft form.
So I am more optimistic. The conversations have developed over the years where I think there's a better understanding
of the insurance business model as compared to the banking model that regulators in Washington have historically been
involved with. But the optimism is tempered by caution in our side in terms of being certain that we are well capitalized
as these draft rules finally do come out at some point in the future.
<Q - Eric N. Berg>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger from KBW. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ryan J. Krueger>: Thanks. Good morning. Steve, on the last call, I think you said that you would evaluate
potential buyback again in the back half of this year. Can you give us an update on how you're thinking about that?
<A - Steven Albert Kandarian>: Sure, Ryan. If you recall, the second repurchase program that we've announced in
the last year or so was announced in December and began in January in terms of execution. When we put that plan in
place, we had an expectation that it would be completed by the fall of this year. As we had said, when we announce the
planned, we would be opportunistic buyers of our stock. And you may recall that in the first part of the year, our stock
dropped a fair amount and was below $50 a share for a period of time.
So that program was completed in three months, roughly, versus the time period we expected, which was really off into
the fall. So our view now is that we will look at this again later in the year, as you mentioned. We'll have a conversation
with our board in the fall, and we'll make some decisions at that point in time.
<Q - Ryan J. Krueger>: Okay. Thanks. And then a question for Bill on the Group business. It seems like growth has
decelerated a little bit. Can you talk about the dynamics there and your outlook for growth?

<A - William J. Wheeler>: Sure, Ryan. Well, I think there's a couple things going on. One is, in certain segments of
the market, especially, I think, the dental business, I think the competitive environment has gotten more challenging,
and I think that's – therefore, I think our wins on new businesses are lower than they otherwise might be.
Secondly, remember, we've been being pretty aggressive about renewals and new business in our disability area,
feeling that we needed to kind of catch up a little bit on our pricing. And I think that suppressed sales a little bit in
disability. You can certainly see it in the numbers. Our disability new sales are pretty low. Renewals are good in terms
of we're getting our price in renewals, but the new business we're getting is pretty low. So I think those two factors are
sort of causing the premium growth in the Group business to be a little lower than you might otherwise expect.
<Q - Ryan J. Krueger>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jamminder Singh Bhullar>: Hi. Good morning. The first question is just on interest rates. I think when you'd
given guidance on – or targets for the various businesses, you'd assume that then your treasury yield of around 2.8% by
the end of the year. So assuming if rates stay where they are through the next few months of the year, how much of a
downside is that – a risk is that to your targets? And are there things in the business that are going better than expected
that maybe might help offset some of the weakness?
And then also, I had a question on the hedge for Asia earnings. I think last time, you had mentioned that about
two-thirds of the 2015 income was hedged at a rate of ¥107 to the dollar. But I wanted to see if there's a change in that.
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Let me do the – this is John – let me do the Japan hedges first. We've actually increased our
hedges, so we're now 100%. And for 2015, the strike's at ¥111, and we've extended it out to 2016 is at ¥108, and then
2017 is at ¥122. So we've fully hedged all yen earning from Japan.
<Q - Jamminder Singh Bhullar>: Through 2017? Fully hedged through 2017, you said?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Oh, as we get further out, it may be between ¥85 to ¥100.
<Q - Jamminder Singh Bhullar>: Okay.
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Yes. And I'm sorry, your first question, you wanted interest rates -
<Q - Jamminder Singh Bhullar>: So just on interest rates, how much of a risk is the current level of rates if we stay
here through the end of the year versus your guidance or target that you'd assumed of 2.8%, how much of a risk is that
to your returns overall?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Well, we give some sensitivities in our 10-K that shows by segment how things move
compared to a stress down compared to what our plan is at, so I would point you towards that. Let me also point out,
it's not just the long end moving up. We are sensitive a bit to the short end because we do – we've had a very steep short
yield curve, and so we benefited over the last few years from better earnings in securities lending, and that's impacted
where we have asset-intensive businesses, in particular. But we've seen a benefit from that in CBF over the past few
years, maybe slightly higher earnings than people had thought, but that's because the short end of the curve was down.
So it really depends on what's going to happen here, but I'd point you back to the 10-K because there'll be some
sensitivity there for you to analyze.
<Q - Jamminder Singh Bhullar>: Okay. And lastly, Steve, you mentioned the DOL standards briefly, besides the
Annuity business, is there risk in other parts of the business because of at least what the preliminary standards look
like?

Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Thomas George Gallagher>: Good morning. John, your comment that you're now targeting variable annuity
growth of greater than 20% from the old guidance of greater than 50%, is that – what's driving that? Is that DOL
fiduciary standards related? Can you give some color there?
<A - William J. Wheeler>: Tom, it's Bill. I'll take that one. It doesn't have anything to do with the DOL. It really is
just the pace of adoption of the new product versus what we had assumed in our plan for this year. Remember, this is a
different type of rider, right? It's not just that we've tweaked the features a little bit. It's a withdrawal benefit versus a
GMIB, and so I think that's causing adoption to be a little slower than we had assumed, as producers get more
comfortable with the product.
We've seen this phenomenon before with our indexed annuity product called Shield. Sales were lower for a while than
we had originally thought, and now they're seeming to accelerate now that we've had the product out for a little over a
year. And we probably should have been a little smarter about how – the pace of adoption here. We do – and I think
John alluded to this – we do expect to see increasing sales of FlexChoice in the latter half of 2015.
<Q - Thomas George Gallagher>: Okay. And, Bill, just a follow up on that, related to DOL. So if the proposal does
get past without any, we'll call it, meaningful changes, how big of an impact do you see this being for the VA industry
overall from a sales standpoint? Is it a game changer? Do you see it being meaningful or manageable?
<A - William J. Wheeler>: It's hard to make that call. It's obviously going to be meaningful. A lot of it will ultimately
depend on what exemptions the DOL allows down the road. Remember, a lot of their rulemaking is really built on
exemptions to existing policies, and it's hard to know if this is, at the end of the day, more of a disclosure issue or if it's
– or how behavior's really going to change.
<Q - Thomas George Gallagher>: Okay. Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Seth Weiss from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - Seth M. Weiss>: Hi. Thank you. Good morning. Steve, I wanted to follow up on your comments on cash flow
and capital. You commented on granular analysis of improving capital characteristics in certain segments. Could you
give a little bit more color on some of the specific areas for improvement that you have already identified?
<A - Steven Albert Kandarian>: Seth, we're still in the early stages of the analysis. What we'll be doing as company
is looking at various parts of the business and then making some decisions and trade-offs, meaning some parts of the
business we'll try to accelerate, other parts of the business we'll have to redesign some products to make it more
efficient from a cash perspective. So these – the work that we're doing really is interactive between all parts of the
company, and we're not yet at the point where we've made final decisions about any one part of our business.
So it would be premature for me at this point to say what we'll be doing in terms of specific products and essentially
signal something before we really have completed our analysis. Other companies have engaged in this type of analysis
before, in particular, European companies. It was a multiyear process that they went through. We're trying to accelerate
that process, kind of learning from others before us have done to shorten the timeframe, but it's not something that gets
done in one quarter or two quarters.

<Q - Seth M. Weiss>: Okay. Thank you. And then on comments in terms of if SIFI either is overturned or rules come
in less onerous than feared, you commented on maximizing the balance sheet. Just curious if this just specifically
means more share repurchases as we all think about it or if there are other tools in terms of maximizing the balance
sheet beyond simply share repurchase, increase dividends.
<A - Steven Albert Kandarian>: We look at share repurchases, we look at dividends, we look at acquisitions is all
valid uses of any excess capital that we hold, and at the point in time when we have greater clarity about the final
decision on our judicial appeal and the capital rules for non-bank SIFIs, we'll look at the landscape at that point in time
and make a decision about where we utilize our capital.
<Q - Seth M. Weiss>: Okay. So this is utilization of capital, not really the structure of the balance sheet?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Hi, Seth. This is John. It may also be how we think about our balance sheet. We have been,
over the past few years, essentially deleveraging. We've had less debt/equity ratios, and that's been improving each and
every period. And the question will be if we were free of the SIFI, what is the best balance sheet; and that could include
debt, it could include preferreds, I mean, we'll have to rethink all that. We've been conservative so far, so we have
maximum flexibility, depending upon what the SIFI rules are, because there could be Tier 2. It could be more complex.
It might be different. So that we've been deliberately being a little underlevered compared to some of our targets so that
we have this flexibility.
But when we're out of this, one way or the other, we will optimize our balance sheet for the best returns for the
shareholder with a conservative – for our safety, for all of our customers.
<Q - Seth M. Weiss>: Great. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bass from Citigroup. Please go ahead.
<Q - Erik J. Bass>: Hi. Thank you. Can you talk a little bit more about the sales trends in Latin America? And it looks
like you've been adjusting for the Mexico group case, growth has slowed a bit there, then maybe also put into context
just how much the U.S. Direct business is contributing to sales?
<A - William J. Wheeler>: Yeah, sure. Erik, it's Bill. I'd hate to just look at any one quarter out of context in Latin
America and say, gee, it looks like things are slowing down. I don't really think that's the case. For instance, the sales
were a little suppressed this quarter relative to what we would normally expect our sales growth is. But if you look
underneath, what you'll see is our Mexican Afore, which is the private pension system in Mexico, is sales are much
lower there. There have been certain sales practice changes which make switching between accounts much less
prevalent [indiscernible] (44:45) providers.
And so sales – gross sales, I would say, are much lower, but at the same time, retention rates are higher. Maybe a better
indicator of sort of what's really going on in Latin America is just PFOs. At constant rate, PFO growth this quarter was
13%, and that's right where we would expect it to be. So, there's – things will move up and down in Latin America over
time, but I would say the growth trend is still in place.
<Q - Erik J. Bass>: Got it. And then on the Direct side, I mean, I realize that's probably still small piece of sales now,
but if you can talk about how that's trending, I think you said that the level of kind of investment spending will go
down in the second half of the year and then obviously off the variable costs as sales come through.
<A - William J. Wheeler>: Yes. So Direct is – Direct's a startup. It's still, I'd say, this is – I would call this a
transitional quarter in that we had some small reserve adjustments, they got – they had a couple of bad homeowners
claims. We do sell auto and homeowners direct through that channel. And we clearly had some growth strain, because
year-over-year premium growth or sales growth was 70%, which obviously I don't think we're going to continue to
grow at that rate. But we are growing this business.

We think that in the second half of the year, there will still be operating losses, but they will be much less than what we
reported in the second quarter. The other thing I'd say is this business is just – the model is coming together in that
we're seeing our mortality experience begin to improve, our retention rates are beginning to improve. So I think the
trends are all in the right direction.

Your next question comes from the line of John Nadel from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
<Q - John M. Nadel>: Good morning, and thanks for taking the question. Maybe, Bill, just a follow-up on the
response to an earlier question about increasing competitive pressure in the group insurance side. I think you mentioned
certain segments. Fair to assume that you're sort of talking about the large-case market given that's where I think Met's
prevalence is or is there more to add there?
<A - William J. Wheeler>: Yeah. Well, I think I talked about the dental business. Dental business actually mid – well,
what we would call mid-case. I think the rest of the industry calls that large-case, but we're talking between 1,000 and
5,000 lives.
<Q - John M. Nadel>: Okay.
<A - William J. Wheeler>: We're seeing – just a little context here, John. Met's the largest for-profit dental
insurer-provider in the United States, so we're the market share leader. People come at us from time to time. We're
currently seeing that in the mid-market. We tend to just be very disciplined about this. Dental margins are generally
pretty thin to begin with. So we'll let that business go and it'll probably come back around to us in a year or two.
<Q - John M. Nadel>: Got it. And then bigger picture, on the group insurance side, you guys are the largest
non-medical insurer in the U.S. I think by just about any metric. I'm curious what opportunities you believe may
develop given the ongoing consolidation that we're seeing amongst the largest medical insurers in the U.S. Are you
seeing any ramifications from that currently in the market? And I guess over the next couple of years as this all figures
its way out, do you think it will result in any strategic opportunities for Met, including the potential to acquire
non-medical operations from these medical providers?
<A - William J. Wheeler>: Well, most of these big medical carriers do sell life, disability, and dental.
<Q - John M. Nadel>: Yeah.
<A - William J. Wheeler>: And it's a bit of a – it's obviously not their main focus. So, the logic has always been
maybe they'll – as they continue to get more focused on the medical side of the benefits equation that they'll potentially
divest. We haven't really seen much of that happen, though that's always been the theory. So I guess the potential is
always there that there might be some strategic opportunities, but I think we're just going to have to wait and see.
<Q - John M. Nadel>: Okay. So nothing yet. And then in terms of sort of the immediate response in the market, is
there anything really coming up as a result of this?
<A - William J. Wheeler>: No. Other than I think the intermediaries are all very distracted right now dealing with all
the consolidation, both in health insurance and in commercial line.
<Q - John M. Nadel>: Got it. Thank you. And then just a real quick one for you, Steve. given Bill's retirement next
month, I was wondering if you could update us on what kind of management structure you expect to have in place over
the Americas.
<A - Steven Albert Kandarian>: John, we haven't made any final decisions on that.

Your next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: Thank you. I was wondering if you could give us your thoughts on potentially reinsuring out
guaranteed living benefits on the variable annuity portfolio given what we've seen in terms of trends in the marketplace
among some other major annuity writers.
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Hi, Jay. It's John. So, yeah, up to now, the deals that have been done have been on WBs not on
IBs, so much of our in-force – and we had been selling till recently our IBs. We look and evaluate these. I think they
share 50% of the risk to the reinsurer on this, and of course, we're always evaluating the cost benefit of all these ideas.
We haven't done a transaction as of yet.
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: Okay. And then a separate issue for you, John. How should we think about the share count for the
full year? So if you make a simplifying assumption that there's no more share buybacks for the remainder of 2015,
given the exercise or issuance of stock-based compensation, where would you see share count kind of ending out for
the year on a fully-diluted basis?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Well, I think you go back over past years and look at the issuance of share count and the
timing of that by quarter to see how the larger amounts are exercised and are issued for our employee benefit programs.
And of course, individual exercising is hard to predict, if that makes a material difference; usually doesn't. And then
we've got any buyback activity which, again, Steve's mentioned would be reevaluated and looked at and discussed with
the board this fall. But you look back to historical patterns. I don't have it at the top my head, but you can see it
year-by-year.
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: It's typically weighted towards 4Q, right?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: You'd have to go look. I don't think so. I think it'd be more in the first half of the year when we
do our big awards, but again, you just go back and check. You can see it quarter-by-quarter.
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: Will do. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Yarn Kina from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Yaron J. Kinar>: Good morning. Steve, you had mentioned the – I was looking at free cash flow optimization.
And I guess considering the fact that we've seen a lot of appetite coming in from overseas insurers for U.S. businesses,
would you consider selling U.S. businesses if you deemed them not free cash flow-friendly or not free cash
flow-oriented?
<A - Steven Albert Kandarian>: So, again, Yaron, we haven't made any firm decisions, but everything is on the table
in terms of how this analysis comes out. Certain things we'll want to do more of, some things we'll do less of, some
businesses we'll have redesign their products, and we don't rule out selling businesses.
<Q - Yaron J. Kinar>: Okay. And then you had mentioned that dental utilization was a bit high in the second quarter,
just catching up on weather in the first quarter. I think that last year we saw a similar pattern but that also [audio gap]
(53:31) where utilization was still a little bit high. Do you see that being the case this year again?
<A - Steven Albert Kandarian>: Yaron, I'm not sure if it will or not. It is looks very similar to the experience we had
last year where, of course, we had two bad winters in a row. I will say this: dental utilization, if you look at the first six
months, is right on plan. And so my expectation is that the third quarter will probably moderate, but you can get
surprised here a little bit.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Kovac from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael E. Kovac>: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just wondering on the – going back to Department of
Labor fiduciary standards, if the rule is sort of passed in a way that it looks today, what sort of impacts would you
expect in the way that you compensate producers for variable annuities that you're selling? And then also on that, can
you give us a sense of the percent of variable annuities that you sell in retirement versus non-retirement?
<A - William J. Wheeler>: Sure. I think what you meant in your second question is how much of your variable
annuities you sell on qualified plans. It's all retirement, right?
<Q - Michael E. Kovac>: That's right.
<A - William J. Wheeler>: But it's – about 70% of our VAs today are sold through qualified assets. And so it's an
issue for us. Today, we have already changed our compensation policies a couple of years ago to, I would say, equalize
comp between proprietary and non-proprietary annuities for our producers. So that's kind of a bridge we've already
crossed.
That said, we might still have to make other compensation adjustment to our producers based on how the DOL rule
comes out. But I think we feel like we've already climbed partway up that hill.
<Q - Michael E. Kovac>: Great. Thanks. And then John mentioned conversion of a securities accounting system
contributed about I think 5 basis points was the number. Can you describe in a little more detail what's going on there
and sort of if there's any continuation from that going forward?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Hi. Yeah, this is John. Yes, we converted over to a new accounting system for our investment
portfolio, and we did it for the U.S. portfolio this past quarter. You can imagine with the size of our U.S. portfolio, a
small little rounding and slight difference impacts in amortization can have an impact. The impact we mentioned this
quarter is a one-time event.
<Q - Michael E. Kovac>: Great. Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Sean Dargan from Macquarie. Please go ahead.
<Q - Sean Dargan>: Yeah, thanks. Good morning. I just want to come back to the DOL proposal one more time. And
I'm just wondering what the proposal, if enacted, as proposed would do to lapsation rates in variable annuities? And
where I'm going with this is that perhaps contract holders are not turned into new contracts when the penalty period
expires as often. Is that something that you're concerned about?
<A - William J. Wheeler>: Well, we probably have mixed feelings about that, Sean. Obviously, we like – as a general
rule, we like low lapse rates. There is some of the in-force where the guarantees are relatively high, and some of our
competitors from time to time have actually tried to buy out that business with policyholders. We have not done that,
by the way.
A little bit of it will depend I think in terms of the macroeconomic factors. If interest rates go up, we feel a lot better
about our GMIB in force and I would think, in general, we would then think lower lapse rates would be a pretty clear
net positive for the annuity business for Met. So I don't think that's going to be a big driver. I don't think that will end
up being much of an issue.

Your next question comes from the line of Humphrey Lee from Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead.
<Q - Humphrey Hung Fai Lee>: Thanks. Good morning. Just a question about the spread compression that we see in
Annuities, the kind of base spread kind of came down around 27 basis point and my understanding is that's in part
because of some of the interest rate potentially rolled off in the quarter. How should we think about the rolling off
schedule of your interest rate hedges? And with this kind of 20-basis-point impact that we see in the second quarter,
would that be ongoing thing? In a sense, how were those kind of interest rate hedges contracts were staggered kind of
throughout the – over the next several years?
<A - William J. Wheeler>: Humphrey, I apologize. I'm not sure I got all of your question, but I think I got the gist of
it. So, yes, there was a investment margin decline in the Annuity business this quarter and, yes, it was driven by the
maturity of a particular interest rate floor.
Met had, well over a decade ago or roughly a decade ago, had invested a lot of interest rate floors for just the kind of
scenario that we've gone through. Those are starting to mature now and therefore, because interest rates are still low,
our margins are starting to decline as they lapse. So we had a decent-sized one that was supporting the Annuity
business lapse this quarter – or mature this quarter. And so that investment margin that we lost there is permanent,
right? It's not going to come back.
And these things will continue to mature over the next number of years. So depending on what happen to interest rates,
that will obviously could have an impact on our interest margins in other part of the company.
<Q - Humphrey Hung Fai Lee>: So you had clearly reached [audio gap] (01:00:34) maturity in this quarter but – so it
doesn't [audio gap] (01:00:41) is going to be kind of every quarter, we'll see a 20-basis-point impact but more like
depending on the schedule. And then in that case, can you maybe give us a sense of how – kind of like when will you
see maybe another big one that will be maturing?
<A - William J. Wheeler>: I don't remember when the next one comes. We note there's not another one coming up
this year, for instance. There's not going to be any more maturities of floors coming up this year, I think. I can't quite
recall when the next ones coming up.
<Q - Humphrey Hung Fai Lee>: Okay. Thanks. And then just one quick follow-up on John's comments earlier about
high expenses in the quarter related to regulatory expenses. Can you give us a sense of how much was that in the
quarter?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Well, as I said, about half of the higher ratio was due to lower PFOs and single premium sales
and other half was to due to expenses.
<Q - Humphrey Hung Fai Lee>: In terms of that expenses, what portion is related to regulatory-related expenses
versus other things?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: There were some pieces within that and they were sort of all split between three different
items.
<Q - Humphrey Hung Fai Lee>: Okay. Thanks.
