Leo P. Denault
Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone.
By any measure, this was a solid quarter. Strong growth in our core business, absent any impact of taxes or weather,
was coupled with significant accomplishment. We spent the first half of 2016 working to execute on our strategy and
the results we are reporting today are a reflection of that work. We've made progress towards meeting our objective of
steady predictable growth at the Utility, while reducing our EWC footprint. We delivered solid results through the first
half of the year. Our Utility, Parent & Other adjusted earnings increased 35% this quarter versus last year and are in
line with our growth expectations for our core business. Most importantly, we continue to set up the business to achieve
our longer-term targets.
Our extensive 2016 to-do list on slide three is a roadmap of the execution of our strategy, and it's a good way to
illustrate some of what we've accomplished. At the Utility, we received a favorable ALJ recommendation for the St.
Charles Power Station. The result of the Entergy Louisiana request for proposal was announced with the self-build
alternative and one long-term power purchase agreement selected. The self-build alternative was also selected in the
Entergy Texas request for proposal. Entergy New Orleans filed for approval for a new gas-fired combustion turbine.
Entergy Mississippi received a revenue increased under its first formula rate plan filing with forward-looking features.
Entergy Louisiana made its 2015 test year formula rate plan filing. Entergy Arkansas made its first forward test year
formula rate plan filing. Entergy Texas received approval on its transmission cost recovery factor rider. We received a
Confirmatory Action Letter from the NRC for ANO, and the letter is consistent with our expectation. And we saw over
7% industrial growth versus last year.
At EWC, we entered into negotiations for the sale of our FitzPatrick Nuclear Plant. Finally, we've met with many of
you on our Analyst Day in June where we highlighted our progress towards effectively shifting our investment profile
to a pure-play utility.
We're achieving this shift by continuing to invest in the Utility for the benefit of our customers while maintaining
reasonable rates. One of these investments is the St. Charles Power Station project, which received a favorable
recommendation from the Administrative Law Judge in July. We expect the certification decision from the LPSC in
August. We are encouraged with the ALJ's recommendation that the project serves the public convenience and
necessity; it is in the public interest. The ALJ further recommends that Entergy Louisiana's decision to commence
construction is prudent, and the selection of the project is consistent with the terms of the LPSC's market-based
mechanism order.
We also continue to make progress for our plants for a CCGT in Texas. In April, the RFP process resulted in the
selection of the self-build alternative, and in the third quarter, we will begin the necessary filings for regulatory
approval.
We are on a similar path in Louisiana with the RFP process also resulted in the selection of the self-build alternative,
and we expect to make the necessary regulatory filings in the third quarter. That same RFP results in the selection of a
long-term power purchase agreement for an existing CCGT resource, and we also plan to seek approval of the PPA
from the LPSC.
Entergy New Orleans has filed an application with the New Orleans City Council seeking approval to build New
Orleans' Power Station, the natural gas-fired combustion turbine plant at the existing Michoud site. This request
follows the early June deactivations of our 1960's era of Michoud units 2 and 3. These units are a prime example of the
aging infrastructure in our service territory. The decision to deactivate these units was based on economics,
maintenance and operational considerations. The new plant will provide a long-term local resource that can meet the
city's particular resource needs at the lowest reasonable cost to customers. We've requested the City Council approval
by January 31, 2017. If approved as requested, the new plant is expected to be placed in service in the second half of
2019.

These investments will provide more cost-effective, reliable and efficient generating resources for our customers. By
building these plants, we will reduce the average age of our fleet and improve the heat rate in key areas of our system.
For example, by 2025, in the WOTAB region, we will have reduced the age of our fleet by approximately 19 years.
Also in the Amite South region, we will have reduced the age of our fleet by 18 years. And with new units operating at
heat rates of less than 7,000, the efficiency of our fossil generation portfolio will be improved by roughly 800 BTUs per
TWH fleet-wide by 2025. Additionally, the new CCGT units will, on average, produce 41% fewer carbon dioxide
emissions than our legacy gas units.
In addition to addressing our aging infrastructure, we also need to control fuel volatility in our customer's builds. Our
nuclear assets are critical to this objective, as they provide valuable fuel diversity to our Utility fleet. The low volatility
of nuclear fuel price effectively acts as a hedge against the high volatility of natural gas prices. Beyond fuel diversity,
our nuclear assets also provide other significant benefits. As large-scale virtually emissions-free resources, these assets
minimize our environmental footprint, run at high-capacity factors and provide stable base load generation.
Nuclear generation also offers a host of economic benefits and contributes to the financial health of the communities, in
which these assets sit, including thousands of good-paying jobs, tax benefits to local state and federal governments and
billions of dollars in economic output. Investing in the long-term sustainability of our existing nuclear assets to
preserve these benefits for our four stakeholders is an important part of our Utility strategy. We've drafted the
framework for our nuclear sustainability plan that will preserve these benefits and that framework is now under
external peer review. We're working on firming up the cost estimates and steps for implementation. We are currently
on track with our commitment to provide you with more specifics at EEI this November.
We also have a path forward at Arkansas Nuclear One. The NRC issued its Confirmatory Action Letter shortly after
our Analyst Day and adopted our proposed comprehensive recovery plan. The letter confirmed that the plan we
developed will lead us to sustained performance improvement. We will work diligently to complete the agreed upon
actions listed in the letter to the satisfaction of the NRC. We believe we will be able to demonstrate to the NRC our
ability to exit Column IV as early as late 2017. However, our goal is not to simply exit Column IV, but to return to
sustained operational excellence and to be considered one of the industry's strongest performers.
We're rounding other generation portfolio with renewable and energy initiatives I talked about last quarter. Entergy
New Orleans, solar generation project with battery storage technology was placed in service in June. Entergy
Arkansas's power purchase agreement will support construction. We have an 81 megawatt solar energy generating
facility, which is expected to be completed in 2018. Entergy Mississippi's three new solar installations are online and
capable of generating 500 kWh. And we have three renewable requests for proposals outstanding at Entergy Arkansas,
Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans.
In the Arkansas and New Orleans RFPs, bidders will have an opportunity to provide acquisition proposals. The New
Orleans proposal also includes a self-build option. Proposals are due in August for the Arkansas and Louisiana RFPs
and in October, for the New Orleans' RFP. Final selections will be made in December of 2016, February of 2017 and
April of 2017 for Louisiana, Arkansas and New Orleans, respectively.
In addition to our generation supply plan, we're also executing on our transmission investment plan. In Arkansas, we
placed in service a new 23 mile, 230 kV line and completed a new 500 kV substation to serve Big River Steel. These
two projects represent over $100 million of investment.
In Mississippi, we completed a new distribution substation and kicked off two new projects for another new substation
and 115 kV line additions and upgrades. These new projects are expected to be in service in 2017, and total nearly $75
million of investment. And in Texas, we placed three major projects in service between May and July, which totaled
roughly $140 million in investment.
These are just a few examples of major transmission projects that facilitate improved system reliability, compliance
with NERC standards, enhanced economic development or reduced transmission congestion. And all of these factors
can ultimately contribute to a lower cost of service for our customers.

At Analyst Day, we focused on investing in new technology to migrate towards a flexible, reliable and innovative
integrated energy network. We're beginning the first phases of this process with advanced meters that change the way
we manage our distribution system, reducing operating costs and providing savings for customers. Since Analyst Day,
we finalized our vendor and technology partners and have initiated the design phase of our project. Regulatory filings
are expected to begin in September, with the first filing to be made before the Louisiana Public Service Commission.
Filings in other jurisdictions will follow.
Advanced metering is a foundational technology that supports other technologies to reduce costs and provide customers
greater control and options over their energy usage. We've initiated a grid engineering study to assess the best path
forward, incorporating these technologies in an integrated energy network for each of the operating companies. We will
provide more information in due course.
These investments in technology infrastructure deliver the same benefits as our more traditional investments in
generation and transmission, namely a more efficient electric system with enhanced electric reliability and reduced
environmental footprint and reduced cost to serve our customers.
Over the past couple of years, we've improved our regulatory constructs to give us the ability to make investments that
support economic development, create jobs, improve reliability in our systems and reduce our environmental impact.
With many of those constructs now in place, we've moved into a rhythm of filing annual formula rate plans.
Entergy Mississippi received an order approving a revenue increase for its first FRP filing with forward-looking
features, and rate adjustments were implemented at the end of June. Entergy Louisiana made its 2015 test year FRP
filing at the end of May. And last month, Entergy Arkansas made its first FRP filing with a forward test year. And at
Entergy Texas, we've been working on the implementation of the transmission cost recovery factor. We received
approval on this rider in late June and recovery of transmission spend through this rider will relate back to April 14th.
I'll take a moment now to talk briefly about EWC, starting with an update on Pilgrim, which is currently preparing for
its NRC inspection. Many of the same team members who put together the comprehensive recovery plan for ANO are
working on the plan for Pilgrim. We expect to be ready for the NRC to conduct its inspection this fall with the
Confirmatory Action Letter potentially to be issued in the spring.
And finally, in mid-July, we announced that we are in discussions with Exelon on the sale of our FitzPatrick Nuclear
Plant. The opportunity to change the future FitzPatrick has a significant positive impact on our employees and the
surrounding communities, and we're willing to consider any viable option to keeping the plant open. In that spirit, we
applaud the New York PSC's decision to adopt the Clean Energy Standard Program. It is a critical component of a
potential transaction. We are reviewing the order to confirm it addresses the issues we'd hoped, but at this point, we are
very encouraged.
As negotiations for a sale continue, we continue to proceed along two parallel paths, preparing for the plant's
permanent shutdown and decommissioning under the current plan while also preparing for a possible refueling and
continued operation in the event of the sale. We are hopeful that negotiations can be completed this month. Regardless
of the outcome, our focus continues to be on the safe and reliable operation of the plant for as long as it continues to
operate. We will also do our best to support our employees in the community throughout this transition, whether that
leads to a sale to a new owner or the safe shutdown and decommissioning of the plant.
I'd like to thank our hundreds of employees at FitzPatrick who continue to do their best work every day to run the plant
safely and reliably amid the uncertainty of the plant's future and the additional burden of preparing for two possible
paths forward. They continued to show a first-rate level of professionalism, dedication and hard work throughout this
time of transition.
From what I've said so far you can see that we've accomplished a lot to achieve our objectives, and our employees
continue to do so by meeting our obligations to the communities we serve. These communities are home to both our
customers and our employees who, along with our owners, represent our four key stakeholders. Only by serving all
four of our stakeholders are we truly successful. In just the last few weeks, we've received recognition from three
different organizations for a civic-minded approach to doing business.

First, I'm proud to say that Entergy Corporation was recently named to the Civic 50, an initiative of Points of Light,
honoring the 50 most community-minded companies in the nation. Being named to the Civic 50 acknowledges the
number of ways our employees power life for all of our stakeholders. Our team members not only provide reliable and
affordable electric power and gas to customers, but also actively support strategic initiatives that support improved
educational and employment opportunities, boost economic development and protect the environment.
We've also been awarded the Pro Patria Award from the Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve Louisiana
Committee for promoting supportive work environments for members of the National Guard and Reserve. And finally,
our legal department was recently named – a recipient of 2016 Pro Bono Partner Award from the Pro Bono Institute.
This national award recognizes innovative team approaches to pro bono work involving in-house legal departments.
In a partnership with the Louisiana Civil Justice Center and the Orleans Parish Civil District Court, our lawyers helped
to establish and staffed the Self-Help Resource Center. We are pleased that with the assistance of our law department,
the Self-Help Resource Center has to date been able to serve more than 10,000 vulnerable citizens who otherwise
would not have access to legal assistance.
Each of these awards shows that we view our company as part of a broader community. In its recent study conducted
by Market Strategies International, Entergy was designated a Most Trusted Brand in 2016, ranking first among electric
utilities. Our employees work hard every day to earn the trust of our customers in our broader communities.
I'd also like to acknowledge the nearly 3,200 workers who helped with our recent storm restoration efforts. Severe
storms, lightning and high winds left 170,000 customers in Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi without power,
roughly 800 of our own Entergy employees partnered with 2,500 linemen, vegetation workers and support personnel
from 15 states. Power was restored to more than 90% of affected customers in less than three days. Times like these are
when our people truly shine. These and other actions we take every day are the way that we power life.
In summary, this was a very solid quarter. Our financial results with our adjusted Utility, Parent and Other earnings
increasing 35% versus last year and our accomplishments toward implementing our investment plan to benefit
customers and our continued strategic actions at EWC provide a clear path toward our objectives. Our results for the
first half of 2016 have demonstrated our ability to continue to execute on our strategy. And so with our objectives and
strategy firmly in place, we'll continue down this path to pursue steady predictable growth of the Utility while reducing
the EWC footprint. For the second half of 2016, we look forward to continuing to deliver solid results for each of our
four stakeholders.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Drew.
Andrew S. Marsh
Thank you, Leo. Good morning, everyone.
I'll start with the key takeaways on slide four. Quickly pointing to the top right corner for our core business, Utility,
Parent & Other adjusted earnings for the quarter came in strong, 35% above last year and in line with what we
expected. As you may recall, our adjusted view removes special items, weather and tax effects. Our full year view of
Utility, Parent & Other adjusted earnings remains on target with our original guidance. Looking at the bottom left
corner, EWC operational results were essentially flat after normalizing income taxes.
Turning to details beginning on slide five, the blue bars show our consolidated operational earnings, which were $3.11
per share in the current period. This compares to $0.83 a year ago. This quarter's results were higher than last year due
to a few factors, most significant of which was income taxes, which increased earnings about $2 per share net of
customers sharing. While these tax items are beneficial, and we previously discussed their potential, they were not
included in our original guidance due to their uncertainty.
In the current period, as reported results included special items related to EWC nuclear plants that we've identified to
close. These special items include a portion of the proceeds we received during the quarter for DOE litigation as we

talked about at Analyst Day in June, as well as severance and retention costs and capital spending, which were
expensed because the plants are impaired. Operational earnings per share for Utility, Parent & Other increased $0.92
quarter-over-quarter, shown on slide six.
Looking at the orange bars, on an adjusted view, excluding the effects of weather and income tax items, Utility, Parent
& Other results increased $0.31. This growth reflects rate actions to recover productive investment that benefit
customers and improves returns. Specific drivers include the Union Power Station acquisition and Entergy Arkansas
rate case. Also contributing to the earnings increase was non-fuel O&M expense, which declined on lower fossil
spending and decreased compensation and benefits expense.
Utility, Parent & Other increased and as reported income included $0.68 for income taxes, net of approximately $0.06
for additional customer sharing reflected in that revenue. During the quarter, we resolved tax matters within the 2010,
2011 audit. As a result, we recognized tax items totaling approximately $135 million. Though these tax items come
about for other business purposes, they are important to us because they provide real benefits. For example, tax sharing
has reduced customer bills more than $300 million over the past 14 years.
Turning to EWC second quarter results, summarized on slide seven, operational earnings were $1.34 in the current
quarter, compared to a slight loss a year ago. A $238 million reduction in income tax expense from the tax collection
accounted for virtually all of EWC's earnings this quarter. Excluding this item, EWC's earnings would have been $0.01,
slightly higher than last year. Effects from 2015 impairments and lower non-fuel O&M expense were largely offset by
lower prices and volume for EWC's nuclear fleet.
Slide eight shows operating cash flow this quarter of $719 million, slightly lower than the same quarter in 2015. Our
2016 earnings guidance is summarized on slide nine. As you can see, we are affirming our original guidance for Utility,
Parent & Other adjusted EPS of $4.20 to $4.50, with expectations still around the middle of the guidance range. As we
mentioned at Analyst Day, we've improved incremental nuclear spending for this year. We expect to mitigate those
costs with a number of items across the business. This is reflected in our affirmation of 2016 guidance today.
We're also updating our consolidated Entergy operational guidance range of $6.60 to $7.40 with the $7 per share
midpoint. This update is due largely to the income tax items recorded in the second quarter. Absent those tax items, and
consistent with our previous discussions, we'd expect to be around the bottom of the original guidance range due
primarily to unfavorable weather, the extended outage of Indian Point 2, and lower market prices.
To be clear, we do not expect additional significant income taxes for the remainder of this year. I'll also note that while
industrial sales growth has been strong at 6.7% for the first half of the year, we expect it to taper off in the second half
of 2016, particularly from our biggest segment, refiners, as they ran very well in the third and fourth quarters of last
year, and they're expected to have a number of maintenance outages this fall. In addition, you may recall that high
product inventory levels and a strong dollar contributed to a temporary negative industrial growth in the second quarter
of last year.
Similar macro factors and supply/demand rebalancing in oil markets may present challenges for U.S. refiners in the
fall. As a reminder, fixed demand charges represent about 50% of our industrial revenue and, to the extent we see
volatility in sales from existing large industrial customers, the revenue impact should be small. Beyond the fall, we
continue to see new and expanding customer growth for the next few years.
Moving to the longer-term view, Slide 10 shows our adjusted Utility, Parent & Other outlook for 2017 through 2019,
which is unchanged. I'll reiterate that our current outlook reflects pension discount rate assumptions from earlier in the
year, which were 4.75% at 2017, 5% in 2018 and 5.25% in 2019. As a point of reference, our recent forward test year
FRP filing for Entergy Arkansas assumed a 4.25% pension discount rate in 2017. If you looked at the market today,
that rate would be closer to 4% or perhaps even lower.
Also, 2017, 2018 and 2019 do not currently include the effects of the Nuclear Sustainability Plan or expected
mitigations in rate treatment. As Leo said, investing in the long-term sustainability of our existing nuclear assets to
preserve the benefit of nuclear for our stakeholders is an important part of Utility strategy. We are working to identify
the cost mitigations, but to the extent we are not completely successful, by the time we get to 2019, we will have gone

through a rate proceeding in each of the affected jurisdictions, and we believe that these prudently incurred costs and
expected mitigations should be reflected in rates. As such, our long-term earnings plan, 2019 and beyond, should not be
significantly affected by the Nuclear Sustainability Plan.
As we committed at Analyst Day, we will provide a full update, including all of these items at EEI later this year. Slide
11 provides EWC's EBITDA outlook assuming market prices as of the end of the quarter. Our current estimates reflect
market prices as of June 30. And as you know, prices have come down a bit since then.
Before I close, I'd like to highlight two items. Last week, Moody's Investor Services changed Entergy Mississippi's
rating outlook to positive from stable. Moody's specifically noted EMI successful implementation of its formula rate
plan with forward-looking features. Moody's views the FRP as a significant credit positive since it provide a
dependable and clear framework for timely operating cost recovery.
Also during the quarter, we completed several re-financings, issuing $840 million of operating company debt at an
average coupon of 3.1%. The majority of the issuances were economic re-financings, which replaced about $660
million of debt with an average rate of 6.1%, creating annual interest savings of about $20 million pre-tax. These
interest savings will help offset the effect of the potentially lower-than-planned pension discount rate.
As Leo mentioned, results through the first half of the year have been solid and in line with our growth expectations for
our core Utility, Parent & Other business. That said, we know we still have work to do to achieve our longer-term
aspirations, and we will continue to work toward that end. And now, the Entergy team is available to answer questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. You may
begin.
<Q - Shahriar Pourreza>: Hey. Good morning, guys.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning, Shar.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Good morning, Shar.
<Q - Shahriar Pourreza>: So, this may be a little bit semantics, but I thought at the Analyst Day you highlighted that
expectations for 2016 should sort of be at the midpoint to top-end of expectations when you're accounting for the tax
benefits, especially when you think about today's results and relatively warm July, you still expect to come in sort of at
the midpoint. So is there something that's coming in weaker than you expected since the Analyst Day?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: This is Drew, Shar. I think at Analyst Day, we tried to guide towards the bottom end of our
original guidance range absent the taxes. And I think if you add the tax back, you'll find that – or I guess if you take it
out of the new guidance range, you'll find we're kind of back down at the bottom of our original guidance range is
where we've been talking about for a little bit of time now.
With the taxes, I think at Analyst Day, we tried to say that there were a number of things in the hopper that could take
us to the top of the range or potentially even over the range, which is, I think the way we described it. But I think that's
– outside of those things, I think we're still about in the same area that we were describing at Analyst Day.
<Q - Shahriar Pourreza>: Okay. Got it. Super helpful. And then just lastly on the sustainability plan, it's great that
you have a schedule – you sort of have a framework there and you're on schedule to provide kind of numbers at EEI,
but since there's a framework there, is there anything that you can just provide directionally or sort of are the
expectations still within the hundreds of millions of cost that you discussed at the Analyst Day briefly?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Yeah, Shar, this is Leo. We're not really going to give any more detail about that. As I
mentioned, we've got a framework. We've really got the outline of the plan really well in hand. Chris and his team have

been working it. It passed their peer review check as he had mentioned in his outline at our Analyst Day, and we're on
track to be able to provide you the numbers as well as what we think the impact is going to be based on our mitigation
strategies and regulatory recovery, et cetera.

Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. You may begin.
<Q - Michael Lapides>: Hey, guys. Want to dive a little further into the nuclear sustainability program, and the only
reason why I ask is, when we talk to other companies, a lot of other companies – and in fact, the Nuclear Energy
Institute at its annual briefing, spent a lot of time on this as well talking about being able to take costs out of the nuclear
business, meaning to keep the reliability levels elevated in the 90%, 91% range, but to be able to reduce cost, and that
seems to be an industry-wide effort. It seems your disclosure over the last six to nine months is actually in the opposite
direction in terms of the cost structure. Can you just talk a little bit about what makes Entergy different than the rest of,
effectively, the U.S. nuclear industry in that regard? Do you view this as a temporary issue? Do you view this as a
multi-year, three to five, five to seven-year issue? And what got you to this point relative to where it seems like the
industry trade group is talking about?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Yeah, Michael, I'll just briefly – again, I'm not going to get into the sustainability plan until
we're ready to give you the details of it, and that will be later in the year at EEI. And we are participating with the
industry in all of those analyses of the nuclear promise, et cetera. And so, all of that will be part of our thinking when
we look at the plan but with the situation we have with a couple of units in Column IV, our operations haven't been up
to our expectations, and so we're working to make sure that we put in place a plan that sustains the ability for us, as I
mentioned in my prepared remarks, to once again be considered one of the top performers in the industry. And that's
really what we're trying to get to is move from where we are to top performer, but we are also obviously participating
with all the industry-wide efforts, nuclear promise as you mentioned, and other things as well.
<Q - Michael Lapides>: Got it. Do you view this as more capital intensive, or is this more kind of operating cost
intensive?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Michael, as we said at Analyst Day, it will be some of both, but again, I'm going to defer
giving any details until we get to November.
<Q - Michael Lapides>: Got it. Okay. Last thing, can you just – I want to make sure, Drew, I understood your
comments when kind of going through some of the puts and takes on multi-year guidance. Pension, a headwind, I think
that's a headwind for everybody in the industry that doesn't have a pension tracker, the nuclear sustainability program a
headwind, the tailwinds offsetting these are obviously your above average expected demand growth levels and the
move to more formula rate plans and kind of more formulaic revenue increase programs. Anything I'm leaving out in
those three or four items, kind of puts and takes?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: I think we are aggressively looking for ways to offset some of these costs with the other
things in the business. I mentioned interest rates helping offset some of the pension costs, right. That's a bit of a
double-edged sword, but we are looking high and low within the business to find other offsets. And there's little bits
and pieces here and there that are going to help us out. Insurances is helping us out a little bit this year and we think it
will help us some going forward. There are other O&M areas that we're looking at. Depreciation's been a bit helpful
this year. So, I think there's just a number of things that are out there that we're trying to turn over every rock right now
to make sure we mitigate as much of the expected headwinds as you're describing them as possible. And that's our
objective, to make sure that we get to a point in the fall where we can update you and try to maintain those same

And then, as I mentioned, and you were alluding to, we do have rate actions over the next few years planned that we

Thank you. Our next question is from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. You may begin.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Good morning.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning, Jonathan.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Just a quick one. Can you remind us what the sort of critical timelines are on the
FitzPatrick decision, the shut versus sale? And maybe if there is – is there a third path now that you have the CEC,
which is stay open and not sell?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Well, let me just get to the last one. I don't know that there's a stay open and not sell option
necessarily but the other two are certainly what we're working for. The last thing we need to do is create a third path for
people have to start working down, but Bill, why don't you go ahead and talk about where we sit.
<A - William M. Mohl>: Sure. So, Jonathan, obviously, yesterday's order was a step in the right direction as it related
to the CES and putting a value on the ZECs in New York. So between now and the end of the month, we need to be
able to successfully negotiate a deal with Exelon, so a commercial arrangement, and then there obviously are a number
of regulatory approvals that will have to take place in order to have assurances that the transaction will move forward,
largely those our state-driven. If in the event that all those regulatory approvals are met, then we would proceed down
the path with Exelon and then the plant would be refueled in January.
If we're unable to reach commercial agreements with Exelon, or we're not able to achieve those regulatory approvals,
we will begin the regular decommissioning process and stay on the same path that we have previously been on. But as
Leo pointed out, there are no plans to continue to run the plant under Entergy ownership as we've made a commitment
to reduce the size of the EWC footprint and that would not be consistent with that strategy.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: So, the January refuel, hoping to reach an agreement by the end of August, that you
need some approvals in the interim, is there a date sort of somewhere in the middle there by which you really need
those approvals that's sooner than January?
<A - William M. Mohl>: Yeah, Jonathan, that's something that's still in flux right now, so we're working through that
and I really can't comment on the details.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Okay, great. Thank you for the extra color. And then secondly, can I ask on the EWC?
You said this was a tax election. Can you give a little more color as to what you've elected and what that cash impact is
versus what it's meant for earnings?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Well, Jonathan, it's a restructuring for tax purposes and it builds off of work that we've done
over the past 15 years in the tax area. And it's going to be part of the 2016 audit cycle, but based on private letter
rulings that we received in the past, legal opinions that we received, audit settlements that we've made, we believe that
this is the appropriate way to go about accounting for the restructuring that we have, and we'll work through that with
the IRS over the next few years.

<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: And can you comment on the cash timing?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: The cash timing, as you know, we have low-cash taxes right now, and we would expect to
keep those. We've talked about a 10% kind of targeted cash tax rate, I'd say from here on out. But from here on through
our current forecasting period, we would expect that to be about the same.

Thank you. Our next question is from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. You may begin.
<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning, Stephen.
<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: I wanted to talk about the power demand outlook for residential and commercial that
we've been seeing some fairly low numbers there, some negative numbers. In your view, what are some of the drivers,
both negative and positive that you're looking at that could cause either surprise to the upside or the downside? What
sort of the prospects for this change to be more supportive, more positive? Any big drivers that you see, or is it really
hard to extrapolate just from a couple of quarters?
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: Stephen, this is Theo. I think your last comment probably fits. And it is tough to
extrapolate from just the last couple of quarters. I mean, clearly, as we've talked about on other calls, as other utilities
also – we see the effects of energy efficiency, both at the state level and through different federal guidelines having
impacts. And we feel like usage per customer starting – it's been on a decline again, I think consistent with what we've
seen with the industry. We've started to see some flattening out relative to that. And I think also you have the
microeconomic impacts from a demand perspective. And I think as you go forward, the macroeconomic impacts clearly
would be the first that you'd point to in terms of positives as you could change that.
If you look through our region and you look at our gross state product forecast, we saw kind of a downward trend over
the past year or so. We see that starting to pick back up. And clearly if that does materialize, you could see some
positive impacts as it relates to that but we'll continue to see impacts around energy efficiency as we go forward. And
as we get further through the year, especially the third quarter, because it's one of our largest quarters from a sales
perspective, I think we'll have a better perspective and point of view around what we think the longer term trend will
take us.
<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: Okay, understood. And then wanted to shift to Indian Point and just check on the status
on the New York PUC investigation into the automatic shut down there. Would it be possible to get an update in terms
of where that stands and what the next steps are in that investigation?
<A - William M. Mohl>: Yes, Stephen, this is Bill. That investigation continues, really have nothing new to report.
We have fully cooperated with the state but I'm not aware of any specific milestones associated with that investigation.
<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: Understood. Thank you very much.

<Q - Steve Fleishman>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning, Steve.
<Q - Steve Fleishman>: Hi, Leo. Just at a high level, any thought process on how the New York ruling might affect
your views on Indian Point? And maybe way out of the box, any thought on chances that something like this could
happen in Massachusetts with Pilgrim?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Well, certainly, there's no push for something like this in Massachusetts at the moment. As far
as it relates to what's going on with Indian Point, as we understand it, the way the proposal has shifted, it went from
excluding Indian Point to potentially including it. Meet certain criteria within the next couple of years, so we view that
as positive. We don't think that clean air should be discriminatory about where it shows up in the state. So certainly,
that could, down the road, cut off the bad tales as it might be in terms of pricing related to Indian Point, given the
criteria that the plant be financially challenged, et cetera, to qualify for the program. But other than that, it's really too
early to say what it might mean for Indian Point. And again, there's really no push for something similar in
Massachusetts that I'm aware of.
<Q - Steve Fleishman>: One other question with this rule. My recollection is that you guys actually challenged a
contract with the Dunkirk plant in New York that might argue have some similarities to this rule. So I'm curious how
you differentiate the legal support for this rule versus that Dunkirk plant?
<A - William M. Mohl>: Steve, in general, we think it's different because this order actually places a value on the
attribute associated with zero emissions generation as opposed to more of a contact for differences that was associated
with Dunkirk litigation.
<Q - Steve Fleishman>: Okay. And then another question just on the kind of – Leo, you laid out a lot of the different
programs you're doing. Could you just remind kind of any of the things that you're talking about that may not already
be in your current capital plans supporting the growth for 2019?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Yes, Steve. There's certainly not everything that we would likely identify associated with the
integrated energy network. There is probably more out there associated with that. I think we referenced toward the
backend or beyond the time horizon we've been talking at Analyst Day. We mentioned the $6 billion to $8 billion
number at that point in time, but that, obviously, goes out beyond the period we're talking here now. Also in the world
of gas price volatility, et cetera, well, there's nothing in there for anything we might do to hedge that volatility if we
were to include investments and the like, and the potential for where we come out in some of the renewable RFPs, et
cetera.
So when you get to the back-end and certainly beyond it, there's a significant amount of other things that we're
investigating that could be part of the capital program, in addition to what we need. And, again, as we've mentioned
before, we've got a pretty solid generation and transmission capital program. And we're doing that from a position, as
we've mentioned before, being short generation across the system. And we would continue to anticipate that, that we
would be short across the system as we go forward, and these capital investments create a significant amount of
benefits to our customers. And as it relates to reduced congestion, lower production cost, lower emissions, you name it,
particularly given the age of our fleet, these things are really, really beneficial to our customers.
<Q - Steve Fleishman>: Great. One last quick one on the pension discount rate. My recollection from the Analyst Day
is that was a – 50 basis point move is like a $0.14 a share sensitivity. Is that still correct? Do I have it right?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: I think our rule of thumb is $0.06 for every 25 basis points for Entergy overall. And so it's, I
guess, $0.12 for 50 basis points. And then about three-quarters of that is Utility. The other quarter is EWC.
<Q - Steve Fleishman>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Thank you.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Thank you, Steve.

Thank you. Our next question is from Praful Mehta with Citi.
<Q - Praful Mehta>: Hi, guys. I have a quick question again on FitzPatrick. In terms of how we should think about the
sales price, given the price of what the nuclear credit is pretty clear and for eight years, how are you kind of looking at
what is the adequate consideration you should be getting from Exelon for the sale? Is it the value, the NPV of those
cash flows? Is there something else? Is there another threshold you're looking at in terms of the recovery of additional
cost? Any kind of benchmarks we should be thinking about there?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Well, Praful, as you might guess right now, that's between us and Exelon. And I appreciate the
question. There's just no way I can comment.
<Q - Praful Mehta>: All right. Fair enough. Okay. So, I guess on the tax impact that you had at EWC, I just wanted to
understand, is there any reason why it's not excluded like from a one-time versus an operating earnings basis? Is there
something we should be thinking about that item, the $1.33? Why it's not excluded from a one-time operating income
perspective?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Well, I mean, we pointed out and tried to make it very clear where the number is and what
the impact is, but taxes are something that we work on every day just like every other line item in the income statement.
So we consider taxes to be an operational item. Now having said that, particularly in Utility where we are targeting
steady predictable growth, we want to make sure it's very clear where the taxes are falling out. So we provide an
adjusted number for you. But we do think taxes are part of operational earnings and we would never call them out as a
special item.
<Q - Praful Mehta>: Got you. All right. And then finally just quickly on Indian Point, in terms of asset life today as
we think about valuing Indian Point, is there any different view today you have given what's happening in New York in
terms of how you would view the asset life of Indian Point?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Well, Praful, we've always viewed that we're on a path towards relicensing of the plant. I think
with what we've seen in New York, I would mention that what the CES does, if that goes through as planned, is it
certainly provides a backstop for – against lower prices while – during the course of the program. So it's not really
necessarily what the life of it issue is as much as maybe probability distribution of prices that it would receive.
<Q - Praful Mehta>: Fair enough. Thank you, guys.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. You may begin.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Hey, good morning.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Good morning.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning, Julien.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: So perhaps to follow up on the last series of questions, if you will, for Indian Point, is
there a potential here to eventually transact? Does this, call it, backstop against lower prices, make it more of a
transactable asset or what do you see as the strategic fit of Indian Point given the added visibility or certainty provided
potentially here?

<A - Leo P. Denault>: From a strategic standpoint, Julien, we're still – as I mentioned in my remarks and we
mentioned at Analyst Day and we've been mentioning for several years now, our view is that the businesses should be
separate. And we've been proceeding down that path for the last several years. The only thing that changes from time to
time is the methodology we would use. So, for example, we look at New England and something like Vermont Yankee,
for example, separation came about because prices didn't support the economics of the plant, and we were forced into
shutting it down. To the extent that something becomes transactable as part of that separation, certainly that's a
preferable route as it was with the Rhode Island State Energy Center when we sold that and if we're successful to be
able to sell FitzPatrick.
So I'll say it again, it does impact, I would guess, the probability distribution of prices it might receive. We still believe
that we're going to get the plant relicensed, so that we'd indicate a long life of the plant. And then the other aspect it has
always been part of transacting, which was part of the spin was regulatory approvals that we would require to get
something done. All those are the same. We're just incrementally changing the dynamic as we proceed down the
relicensing path to be successful or if something like this occurs where, again, it changes the downside price risk.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Got it. And just to be clear about this, the sustenance CapEx that's contemplated or
that you're preparing for EEI, does the development in New York change that at all, either with respect to FitzPatrick
and refueling and/or Indian Point, to be clear?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Those would be part of the mix when we look at what we're going to do, but again, we're going
to save that more detail until we get there.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Got it. All right. Thank you. Congrats.

Thank you. And our last question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates, you may begin.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Good morning.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Good morning, Paul.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning, Paul.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: I just want to sort of follow up a little bit on Jonathan Arnold's question. I wasn't completely
clear on what was the driver of the tax benefit at EWC? Was there a revaluation of some sort or recognition of the
liability? Just what is it that triggered this tax benefit?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: It ultimately ends up being a stop up in basis for some of our nuclear assets and liabilities
that are sitting at EWC, Paul.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: A step-up in tax basis?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Yes.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: And that's driven by what?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: It's driven by the restructuring in the transaction. They get recognized through the
transaction. It's recognized through the election. I think from a tax perspective, it's deemed to be transferred when you
make that – the election that we're talking about.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. So it's associated with FitzPatrick, is that...
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: I don't think we've said where it's associated.
