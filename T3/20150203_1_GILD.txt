MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Gilead Sciences fourth quarter 2014 earnings
conference call. My name is Jamie and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, all participate are in a
listen-only mode. And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the call over to Patrick O'Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Patrick O'Brien
Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone. As you will have seen, we issued a press release earlier this afternoon
and our earnings results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2014. The press release along with detailed slides is
available on the Investor Relations section of our website.

Speaking on the call today will be John Martin, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Paul Carter, our Executive
Vice President of Commercial Operations; and Robin Washington, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial
Officer. Also in the room with us for Q&A are John Milligan, President Chief Operating Officer; and Norbert
Bischofberger, Executive Vice President of Research and Development.
Before we begin our formal remarks, let me remind you that we'll be making forward-looking statements including
plans and expectations with respect to our product candidates, estimates for the number of HCV patients we believe the
U.S. medical system will treat in 2015, estimates of the blended rebate percentage for government and private payers in
our HCV franchise, and financial projections, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks, and uncertainties that are
beyond our control and could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these
risks can be found in our latest SEC disclosure documents and the recent press release.
In addition, Gilead does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.
We will also be using non-GAAP financial measures to help you understand underlying business performance. The
GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in our press release as well as on our website.
I will now turn the call over to John Martin.
John C. Martin, Ph.D.
Thank you, Patrick, and thank you all for joining us today. I will mention a few highlights of the past quarter and then
make brief remarks about the year ahead before turning the call over to Paul.
2014 was marked by the launch of our first oncology product, Zydelig; our second Hepatitis C product, Harvoni,
regulatory filings for the next generation HIV medicine, E/C/F/TAF; and a doubling of product revenues relative to
2013. We are entering 2015 with financial strength, a portfolio of 19 marketed products that address significant unmet
medical needs and a pipeline from which we expected number of milestones and data readouts during the coming year.
Regarding HCV, since launch of Sovaldi in December 2013 and Harvoni in October 2014, more than 170,000
individuals around the world have been treated with a sofosbuvir regimen. Harvoni has become the most widely used
Hepatitis C regimen since its approval in October 2014 and prescription data at year-end indicate that for each Sovaldi
patient, three patients started therapy with Harvoni.
Gilead continues to investigate the use of Harvoni in different patient groups, including non-Genotype 1 infected
patients, in HIV co-infections and in patients with advanced liver disease. Data from these studies support the utility of
Harvoni in these patient populations and the results will be presented at upcoming scientific conferences.
In addition to sofosbuvir, we're exploring other potent pan-genotypic agents. A single tablet of sofosbuvir and GS-5816
is currently being evaluated in four Phase 3 studies and topline data from all these studies will be available in the third
quarter of this year. Moreover, we're exploring GS-9857, a pan-genotypic protease inhibitor in combination with
sofosbuvir and GS-5816 to potentially further reduce treatment duration from 8 weeks to 12 weeks to 4 weeks to 6
weeks.
Even though great progress has been made in the treatment of HCV worldwide only a fraction of the people infected,
the large majority of whom live in lower income and middle income countries, have been diagnosed and treated.
Progress is being made to expand access in less-developed countries. Data presented at the Paris Hepatitis Conference
last month showed that in Egypt, since initiation of a national program in October 2014, 738,000 patients have been
registered, 40,000 have been selected for treatment, and 15,000 have started Sovaldi therapy. Sovaldi has been
approved in India and marketing authorization applications have been filed in 12 additional emerging and developing
market countries.
In HIV, regulatory submissions for our first TAF containing product, the single tablet regimen of elvitegravir,
cobicistat, emtricitabine, and TAF, abbreviated E/C/F/TAF, have been submitted in the E.U. and the U.S. The
application was validated in the E.U. and in the U.S. it will undergo standard review with an anticipated FDA action

date of November 5. The E/C/F/TAF NDA was one of our largest HIV submissions and included data from two large
Phase 3 studies in treatment naïve individuals; one study in which fully suppressed patients were switched to
E/C/F/TAF; a study in renal impaired patients; and a study in adolescents. Detailed data from these studies will be
presented at an upcoming scientific conference this quarter.
Our agreement with Janssen R&D Ireland was expanded to include the development of a single tablet regimen of
rilpivirine, emtricitabine and TAF. In addition, we are pursuing the development of a fixed dose combination of
emtricitabine and TAF. We expect to file for approval of both products before the end of the year.
Progress also continues in oncology and inflammation. In the year since John McHutchison's role was expanded, he has
recruited Philippe Bishop to lead oncology/hematology and also John Sundy to head up the inflammation, respiratory
therapeutic area. A number of additional hires have been made to strengthen these teams.
Our oncology pipeline is expanding. We recently entered an exclusive license agreement with ONO Pharmaceuticals
for the development and commercialization of what is now called GS-4059, a BTK inhibitor for B-cell malignancies
and other diseases. With this agreement, Gilead now has compounds targeting four signaling pathways associated with
B-cell malignancies: PI3K delta, Syk, JAK and BTK. The use of this BTK inhibitor will be studied in combination with
Gilead's other kinase inhibitors with the goal of achieving more pronounced and more durable response rates.
GS-5745, the anti-MMP9 antibody, is undergoing evaluation in ulcerative colitis and gastric and pancreatic cancer.
Based on promising safety and efficacy data, we anticipate moving the compound forward in clinical development for
ulcerative colitis and gastric cancer in 2015. In addition, Phase 2 studies are planned in Crohn's disease.
Simtuzumab, the anti-LOXL2 antibody, has been in evaluation for myelofibrosis, pancreatic cancer and colorectal
cancer. In these three indications, there was no evidence of efficacy, although simtuzumab was safe and well tolerated.
Simtuzumab is undergoing evaluation in NASH, PSC and IPF with the Phase 2 NASH and PSC clinical studies fully
enrolled and the Phase 2 IPF study approximately 80% enrolled.
Also for NASH, a ASK-1 inhibitor and FXR agonist will be advanced into clinical development. Rights to FXR
agonists were acquired through an agreement with Phenex that we announced in January. The ASK-1 inhibitor is
currently in a Phase 2 study for dietetic neuropathy and pulmonary arterial hypertension, and we will begin a Phase 2
study in NASH in the first half of this year.
Finally, the Board has approved a quarterly cash dividend program to commence in the second quarter this year and a
new $15 billion five-year repurchase program. Robin will provide more details on these items in a few minutes.
The year ahead is expected to be as busy as 2014, and all of us across the organization and in collaboration with our
many partners are working towards a shared goal of developing new treatments and providing access to Gilead's
medicines for patients in need. I am pleased with the progress we have made and look forward to updating you as the
year progresses.
I will now turn the call over to Paul Carter to provide a commercial ops update.
Paul R. Carter
Thanks, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Gilead achieved $7.2 billion of net product revenue in the fourth quarter
representing 137% year-over-year growth. Net product revenue for the quarter consisted of $5.5 billion U.S. sales, $1.4
billion of European sales, and more than $300 million sales from the rest of the world. The primary drivers of the
company's strong performance during the fourth quarter were the continued uptake of sofosbuvir containing HCV
regimens and the continued healthy demand in our HIV business.
I will start with some commentary around our HCV business. Hepatitis C revenue increased to $3.8 billion in the fourth
quarter; in the U.S., revenues were $3.2 billion, with $1.2 billion from Sovaldi and $2 billion from Harvoni. We
estimate that 43,000 patients started treatment on a sofosbuvir based regimen in the quarter with 31,000 of those
starting on Harvoni following its launch in October. To date approximately 140,000 patients have started HCV therapy

on a Gilead product in the United States.
Harvoni's launch in the U.S. is going well with filled prescriptions tracking above Sovaldi's at the same time point. The
base of treaters is expanding with more than 10,000 physicians now having prescribed a sofosbuvir based regimen,
about 1,100 of who began prescribing after launch of Harvoni. Indeed, seven out of ten HCV patients initiating
treatment in the fourth quarter started on Harvoni, the remainder on a Sovaldi containing regimen.
Across our franchise, about three-quarters of patients treated were Genotype 1, 16% were Genotype 2, 7% were
Genotype 3, and 3% were other genotypes. As in prior quarters, we saw prescriptions written for all stages of fibrosis,
although after the launch of Harvoni, we saw payer restrictions increasingly in place across all patient types and
especially for those with lower fibrosis scores.
As expected, there was a net inventory build in our HCV business in the fourth quarter following the launch of
Harvoni. This was partly offset by a decrease in Sovaldi inventory, and we believe that in total, HCV inventory ended
the year at the higher end of the normal range necessary to support demand. As we've seen in years past, we think that
inventory could draw down in the first quarter and then track more normally with demand through the rest of 2015.
In the fourth quarter, price volume negotiations for Sovaldi were finalized with a number of countries, including
France, Italy, and Spain and the product is now being sold in the majority of countries in Europe. Overall, Sovaldi
contributed more than $1.5 billion to European sales during 2014. Harvoni was approved in the E.U. in November, and
the product is now available in Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Germany. In France and the UK, it is available under
early access programs.
Across the E.U., 32,000 individuals have started treatment with our Gilead HCV regimen. Approximately 26,000 of
those are in the E.U. big five countries, and of these, 4,000 have initiated treatment with Harvoni. We are in the process
of securing reimbursement for Harvoni across numerous countries in the E.U. and we expect this to be completed at
least as quickly as we experienced for Sovaldi.
We expect both sofosbuvir-based therapies to continue to perform strongly in 2015, and we are confident in the
differentiated clinical profile of our products. Harvoni offers an unparalleled combination of efficacy, safety and
regimen simplicity for Hepatitis C Genotype 1 patients including treatment naïve and treatment experienced patients
and patients with and without cirrhosis.
Our new arrangements with the majority of national pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, will ensure that Gilead
drugs are readily available for patients within these systems. We anticipate far fewer restrictions on reimbursement and
that updated professional guidelines will likely open up treatment to many more individuals. This should reduce
hurdles and the time it takes the medical staff to navigate the reimbursement process, particularly for patients with
earlier stage disease.
There has been, as you are all aware, a substantial amount of public discussion about the payer landscape. As a
company, we believe that treatment decisions are best made by doctors and their patients. We will, however, continue
taking the steps necessary to ensure as many patients as possible have access to our best-in-class Hepatitis C
treatments.
We expect our 2015 gross to net adjustments for our HCV products in the United States to be approximately 46% or a
little more than double of that where we ended 2014, which was around 22%. This increase is a result of the recent and
ongoing round of negotiations with payers and PBMs and includes a shift towards a higher proportion of public payers
and higher prescribing of Harvoni amongst those payers with rebates for payers such as Medicaid and the VA
exceeding 50%.
Again, these higher levels of rebates are tied directly to opening up access and streamlining the process of starting a
patient on therapy. Overall, with these new arrangements in place, we are confident that a substantially higher number
patients will be treated in the United States in 2015. We think that there is capacity to treat at least 250,000 patients
across all genotypes.

Before I move on, I wanted to mention that we are well prepared for launch of Sovaldi and Harvoni in Japan in
anticipation of their respective approval during 2015. As you know, a significant number of patients are suffering from
HCV in Japan, and the country has one of the highest rates of liver cancer of any industrialized country.
Moving on to HIV, in 2014, Gilead continued its commercial and clinical success. In the U.S., our HIV business
generated $1.9 billion of revenue in the fourth quarter and $6.3 billion for the full year. While underlying demand was
strong, HIV inventories ended the quarter at the high end of the inventory management agreement range. Full year
growth of 17% was driven by our Truvada-based single tablet regimens Complera and Stribild. In particular, volumes
of Stribild doubled year-over-year and the product passed through $1 billion in revenue in 2014. More than 80% of new
patients initiated therapy on a Gilead product with nearly 70% on one of our Truvada-based single tablet regimens.
Stribild remains the number one most prescribed in treatment naïve patients, Complera number two and each of the top
five regimens across treated patients included the Gilead Truvada backbone.
In Europe, our HIV business generated $3.2 billion sales for the year with Eviplera and Stribild more than doubling
versus 2013. Eviplera remained the most prescribed regimen for treatment naïve patients and our very latest
information shows that Stribild, in fact, has moved up from fourth to second position. As reminder, the data shown in
the slides we provide via our website reflect a one-quarter lag. Eviplera and Stribild also remain the most prescribed
regimen for switch patients.
I also wanted to mention the approval of two new fixed dose combinations that combine Gilead's cobicistat or boosting
agent with protease inhibitors. Cobicistat is, of course, part of Stribild and a component of E/C/F/TAF. Bristol-Myers
Squibb announced approval last week of Evotaz, a once daily pill combining atazanavir with cobicistat and Johnson &
Johnson announced approval of Prezcobix, a combination of darunavir and cobicistat. FDA approved both products for
use in combination with other antivirals for the treatment of HIV in adults. We're very pleased to expand the use of
cobicistat with these new options for patients.
With regard to our cardiovascular portfolio, Ranexa and Letairis together represented more than $1.1 billion of revenue
during 2014. We submitted a supplemental NDA with the data from the Letairis AMBITION study in December and
anticipate inclusion of these data in the U.S. label during 2015.
In summary, I am very pleased with the efforts of our team and our results in 2014 and excited about the progress we
will make in 2015 across Gilead's areas of therapeutic focus.
And with that, I'll now turn it over to Robin.
Robin L. Washington
Thank you, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. For the first time, we have announced the initiation of a quarterly
dividend of $0.43 per share that will begin in the second quarter of 2015, subject to a declaration by our board of
directors. The quarterly dividend is equivalent to $1.72 per share on an annual basis and approximates an annual yield
of 1.6% based on yesterday's closing stock price.
Also, the Board of Directors authorized a new $15 billion, five-year share repurchase program which we will initiate in
2015 on completion of our currently authorized $5 billion program. The initiation of a dividend and our increased level
of share repurchases underscore our belief in the strength of our future cash flow.
Consistent with prior communications, we also believe our future cash flow will provide us with adequate financial
flexibility to support our pipeline growth and any future M&A opportunities or collaboration that we might consider.
Turning to the financial results, total revenues were $24.9 billion for the year, up 122% year-over-year and $7.3 billion
for the fourth quarter, up 21% sequentially. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $8.09 per share for the year. Net product sales
for the year were $24.5 billion, ahead of our 2014 revised guidance. Our product sales of 2014 excluding HCV
products were $12.1 billion, an increase of 13% compared to the prior year driven by continued uptake of our HIV
single tablet regimen across geographies.

During 2014, Complera, Eviplera, and Stribild product sales each exceeded the $1 billion mark for the first time. Our
HCV product sales were $12.4 billion for 2014 and $3.8 billion for the fourth quarter, an increase of 36% sequentially,
driven by continued launches of Sovaldi across geographies and the launch uptake of Harvoni following U.S. and
European approvals during the fourth quarter.
Turning to expenses for the full year 2014, non-GAAP R&D expenses were $2.6 billion, up 33% compared to the prior
year, and reflecting the continued progression of our product pipeline in particular, in oncology and liver disease, and
support of geographic expansion as well as one-time items such as our collaboration with ONO Pharmaceuticals and
the purchase of an FDA priority review voucher during the fourth quarter. After these one-time items, R&D expenses
would've been within our guidance range.
Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $2.8 billion, up 77% compared to the prior year, driven by the commercial launch of
our HCV and oncology products, and, as discussed last quarter, an increase in the Branded Prescription Drug Fee of
$481 million for the full year resulting from the issuance of final regulations by the IRS, which required manufacturers
to recognize an additional year of expense in 2014.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter decreased to 17.3%, primarily due to the extension of the
federal research tax credit in the fourth quarter, reducing the full year 2014 non-GAAP effective tax rate to 17.9%.
We generated $12.8 billion in cash from operations for the full year 2014. During the fourth quarter, we raised $4
billion in debt financing for general corporate purposes including share repurchases, repayment of debt, and working
capital needs. We also repaid $1 billion in previously outstanding debt during the fourth quarter.
We utilized $5.3 billion in cash to repurchase 59 million shares at an average price of $90.29 per share in 2014. In the
fourth quarter, we utilized $2 billion of the May 2014 $5 billion share repurchase plan.
Finally, I would like to cover our full-year 2015 non-GAAP financial guidance, summarized on slide 56 in the earnings
presentation available on our corporate website. We expect product sales to be in the range of $26 billion to $27 billion,
an increase of 6% to 10% over 2014.
Our guidance for product revenues is subject to a number of uncertainties, including the continuation of a challenging
macroeconomic environment in Europe, inclusive of the potential adoption of additional pricing measures to reduce
HCV spending; the potential for continued volatility in foreign currency exchange rates; inaccuracy in our HCV patient
estimates; an increase in discounts, chargebacks, and rebates, due to the ongoing commercial payer contract
negotiations; and a larger-than-anticipated shift in payer mix to more highly discounted payer segments such as PHS,
FSS, Medicaid, and the VA and the commercial launches of Sovaldi and Harvoni in Japan.
Our non-GAAP product gross margin is expected to be in the range of 87% to 90%. We expect our non-GAAP R&D
expenses to be in the range of $3 billion to $3.3 billion as we continue to invest in our product pipeline. We expect our
non-GAAP SG&A expenses to be in the range of $3 billion to $3.3 billion, which assumes the continued build-out and
expansion of our commercial infrastructure in Europe and Asia to support Sovaldi and Harvoni.
For the full year, our non-GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 18% to 20%. This excludes any
impact from the 2015 federal R&D tax credit, which, if extended this year, would lower our overall effective tax rate.
We anticipate the full year diluted EPS impact of acquisition related restructuring and stock-based compensation
expenses to be in the range of $0.82 to $0.87 per share.
In closing, we are pleased with our 2014 results and our ability to provide additional clarity around our capital
allocation strategy. We look forward to the opportunities ahead in 2015.
We would now like to open the call for questions. Operator?

[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Geoffrey Porges from Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Geoffrey Craig Porges>: Thank you very much and congratulations on the remarkable progress this year. I have
many items to ask questions about, but first could you just quickly give us a comment on your intentions with the
dividend? Is this something that we should expect you to continue to grow in the future or is it sort of static as it is?
And secondly, is your guidance assuming 250,000 patients treated at a greater than 40% gross to net? Or is assuming
something different to that? Thanks very much.
<A - Robin L. Washington>: Hi, Geoff. It's Robin. I will answer the first part of the question and I'll turn the second
part over to Paul. It is our intention to grow the dividend over time, but I would say at the moment, we still view share
repurchases as a component that will be the larger percentage of our share return strategy. It will be larger than
dividends for the foreseeable future.
<Q - Geoffrey Craig Porges>: Thanks very much.
<A - Paul R. Carter>: Yeah, Geoff, I mean in terms of our guidance, we have still some variables ahead of us here,
but mainly the number of patients that are coming through. We believe that the system has the capacity to treat, as I
said in my script, in excess of 250,000 patients. And the agreements that we have entered into are designed to open up
access, and we're confident that we're going to see a large increase in the number of patients across the U.S. So, yes,
our guidance does consider the patient numbers that we think plus the gross-to-net that we just described.
<Q - Geoffrey Craig Porges>: Thanks very much. I'll get back in queue.
Operator
The next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Barclays.
<Q - Geoffrey C. Meacham>: Good afternoon, guys. Big congrats on the quarter as well as dividend policy and
buybacks. So just wanted to know what you guys have learned from the field in Hep C in the U.S. and in Europe that
supports a market that's different from older stats, and the stats that we've seen out there are pretty tired and are maybe
decades-old.
And then how does this speak to the sustainability of patient in-flows? And I guess for that part of the question, maybe
consider the volume increases that you may expect to see for the next several year from the launch? Thanks.
<A - John F. Milligan, Ph.D.>: Geoff, this is John Milligan. Just to be clear, you said the stats are getting a little tired.
Are you meaning about the number of patients who are available for treatment?
<Q - Geoffrey C. Meacham>: Correct. Yes. Some of the prevalence and the incidence stats, I think, are pretty dated. I
know you guys have them updated on one of your slides, but I wanted to kind of get your view from the field, John,
and maybe some of the sources of some of the stats that you guys have collated.
<A - John F. Milligan, Ph.D.>: Thanks for clarifying that. So it's pretty clear, based on our field based research and
the comments from the doctors, that there are a lot of people continuing to seek therapy who were denied therapy and it
was getting pretty difficult through the last part of last year for patients even as high as F3 scores to get through
treatment.
So we believe, based on this and trying to triangulate with the numbers that are in the public domain, that there's a very
considerable number of patients who will seek therapy for 2015, thus the number that we are, the numbers that we are
talking about in terms of the potential patients who could seek care.
Looking beyond that, we still feel that a number that's pretty strong is the 1.6 million people who are currently
diagnosed and have been under care at least at some point in the past and we see there's great opportunity for Gilead in

future years to drive those patients into care, and so there are a number of programs that we'll be embarking upon this
year, educational campaigns with things like primary care not with the intent of them treating, but with referring and
identifying the disease all the way through advertising campaigns set in 2016, 2017, and 2018 and beyond a good
number of years beyond that, we'll continue to drive those patients into care.
I think additionally, as these therapies have gotten both more affordable for the system and better because of the
simplicity of use, we will see those other patients, that roughly 3 million to 4 million people who are out there, the
additional 2 plus million who are out there above the 1.6 million will also have an opportunity to seek care. We do see
a great opportunity to drive those patients.
So we do see this as a long-term sustainable business based on what we've seen to date, despite the rapid influx that we
saw in 2014 and the continued influx that we anticipate in 2015.
<Q - Geoffrey C. Meacham>: Same situation, John, in Europe?
<A - John F. Milligan, Ph.D.>: In Europe, the situation is actually quite sustainable I think for a number of years.
What we're seeing are commitments from the public sectors to treat a certain number of patients and in most of those
cases, it's a considerably higher number of patients than have historically been treated. But when we look at the
denominator, the total number of patients who could be treated, this is something that plays out roughly 10 to 15 years
or in the case of some of the high prevalence countries like Italy, even beyond that. So we do think it is quite a
sustainable market through Europe.

The next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum from ISI.
<Q - Mark Schoenebaum>: Hey, guys, thanks a lot for taking the question. Just a clarification on Geoff Porges'
question I'm still not sure you answered. If you did, I apologize. But within your guidance, rather than capacity in the
system, what actually is your patient estimate. AbbVie, of course, on their call mentioned they thought 175K, roughly,
to 215K U.S. G1 patients would be treated, would actually be treated in 2015. I was wondering if you would be willing
to tell us what you're actually – how many patients you are actually assuming will be treated?
And then what was your government-to-private mix in 2014 and what do you expect it to be in 2015? Thanks.
<A - John F. Milligan, Ph.D.>: So, Mark, let's just start with the first part of that question in terms of what our
guidance provides and so there isn't a specific patient number that I'm going to give to you. What we have in there is a
range of different prices depending on the mix of private to public, and there are a range of different discounts offered
across all those areas. There's a range of market share assumptions that we've put in there, and then, of course, there is a
range of patient numbers in there. And I thought the AbbVie, sort of, general range of patients was a reasonable one.
We think there could be capacity to go up, as Paul said, up to 250,000, but our assumption, on total patient numbers
isn't actually 250,000, it's less than that.
So it's fair to say that there's a range of things that will come into play, and that will determine how we do on a
quarterly and then a yearly basis as we hit that different mix of patients across those segments.
Your second question was about last year, and about 70% of our patients last year came from the private sector.
<Q - Mark Schoenebaum>: And this year?
<A - John F. Milligan, Ph.D.>: This year, we're not actually sure because there's a number of – so I can't tell you that
number, because there's too many factors in flux right now, including the different contracts that we and AbbVie are
competing for in the Medicaid sector. We do anticipate that these contracts will get signed earlier than they have
historically, in fact, some are being signed now.

And so you will see a sort of – historically you think about Gilead, it starts very private with our launches, and then it
eventually becomes just sort of a steady-state with the public and private mix. We'll get to that mix much more quickly
this year because of the acceleration of the negotiations. And so we should have a better handle on that as we get into
Q2, but I don't know exactly where it's going to shake out right now because there are so many contracts in flux right
now.

The next question comes from Matt Roden from UBS.
<Q - Matthew M. Roden>: Great. Thanks very much for taking my question and congrats for amazing progress this
past year. And also, thanks for the increased clarity on the gross to net, that's obviously been a major issue for people.
You obviously felt confident enough about that number to disclose it, but you mentioned contracting is one of the
uncertainties reflected in your guidance, the range of payer mix, et cetera. So how confident are you that you can hold
that level, for this year, and then what would you expect when additional entrants come to market next year and in
years to come? Thanks.
<A - Paul R. Carter>: So, Matt, we think that as of today, and some of these negotiations are ongoing, that about 60%
of the covered lives across the U.S. have now been negotiated and signed off. And of that 60%, Gilead, we think has
access or patients have access around 80% of those, of that 60% will have access to Harvoni. The rest of the 40% is
still in play, but I can say for the 60% part of covered lives that we are very confident that the terms that have been
negotiated will last through the rest of this year, and as I already said, those terms have been designed to increase
access. So we do expect to see a significant number of patients increasing through those PBMs and payers compared to
2014.
<Q - Matthew M. Roden>: Okay. And for the coming years, when there's additional entrants to the market?
<A - Paul R. Carter>: Well, I think the real-life data, first of all, on our product is going to be a key piece here, and I
should say I would like to emphasize that in our negotiations already with payers, most of those payers have really
taken into consideration the highly differentiated product that we offer compared to competition and have made a full
assessment of that. So I think we have to wait until we see the profile, the real world profile of our existing competition
and of course the data with the future competitors before we start.
We're very, very confident in Harvoni with its one pill, once a day and the ability to treat perhaps 50% of GT-1 patients
in the U.S. with just eight weeks with no need for ribavirin issues, no need for drug-drug interaction issues with
ritonavir, and for most classes of patients absolutely fine to take Harvoni, unlike our competitor. So I think time will
tell a little bit before we can see what happens.

The next question comes from Michael Yee from RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Michael J. Yee>: Great. Thanks. One question is, you were talking about government versus non-government or
commercial versus non-commercial. In the patients treated in 2015, what do think that breakout is between those two
buckets: 30, 35, or 65; closer to 50/50? How should we think about those two buckets which obviously have different
rebates...?
<A - Paul R. Carter>: Yeah, I mean as John said, in 2014, the proportion of private to public was about 70/30. We
expect that during 2015, it might be a little bit more public, but I suspect it will be more in that type of proportion.

<Q - Michael J. Yee>: How does that differ in Europe? Because we're thinking about a one-payer system, but there's
obviously competition, and should we be thinking about similar negotiations where they're thinking about exclusives,
or we should be thinking about equal parity and they're offering both the drugs, just so we understand that is the stuff
that come across the tape over the course of your negotiations and countries getting deals?
<A - Paul R. Carter>: Yeah, we have negotiated for Sovaldi with most of the countries in Europe, and these have not
been on an exclusive basis, but the nature of the arrangements are tied directly to increasing access to patients. So we
have volume type incentives to try and encourage a much higher number of patients treated going forward than has
ever been seen in the past. So I think our competition will be doing similar kinds of arrangements, but again, we're
very, very confident in the clinical profile of our drug. And we hope that we'll be very successful in Europe as we have
been so far.

The next question comes from Brian Abrahams from Wells Fargo.
<Q - Brian C. Abrahams>: Thanks for taking my questions, and thanks again for all the clarity on Hep C metrics. Just
curious, of the plans that allow access to both Harvoni and the competitive drug, Viekira, what proportion of patients
are you seeing go onto Harvoni? And do you have any sense yet of the relative use of the 8-week or 12-week Harvoni
regimen? Thanks.
<A - John F. Milligan, Ph.D.>: I'd say it's just too early. The launch of the Viekira Pak is less than a month old so we
don't really have any good data to suggest how our competition is faring versus how we're faring. So it's too early to
say in terms of how these parity deals are working out for either of us, and many of these things have just been put in
place, so it's very early days so please be patient with us.
You have mentioned also what is the 8-week versus 12-week. It's our – it was our expectation and our continued
expectation that in the initial launch of Harvoni, far more patients will go on the 12-week than the 8-week because they
would be more severely ill patients and that, in fact, is what we've seen. It's a very small percentage of patients, perhaps
as few as 20% of patients going on the 8 weeks versus the 12 weeks. We will, we do anticipate that that will increase
over time as restrictions go down and as less severely ill patients come on board, and those patients could benefit from
the 8-week therapy.

The next question comes from Yaron Werber from Citigroup.
<Q - Yaron B. Werber>: Great. Thanks for taking my question. If you don't mind, I just have a follow up and a new
question. If I sort of listen to what you're saying, and I'm sort of backing into the commercial discounts, I'm still getting
about sort of 40% range, assuming just a slight year-over-year increase in the component of public over private. Am I
sort of in the right ballpark?
And then secondly, when you look at Europe, Europe grew about 10% year-over-year, I'm sorry, quarter-over-quarter.
How fast should we think about volume increasing in Europe now that you have reimbursement? Thanks.
<A - Paul R. Carter>: Yaron, sorry. Yeah, let me just talk about the European piece, and I'll hand back to John. So the
European part, we're seeing most of these agreements have only really been finalized in the last quarter of 2014, so I
would say, I would characterize Europe as really just beginning access to the majority of patients.

Now what we have tried to do, though, is with each of our agreements is work with the governments to assess their
budgetary constraints, the prevalence of patients in the country, and then try to come to an arrangement which, as John
alluded to earlier, probably is kind of a longer-term approach to addressing their HCV challenge, so a kind of lower
proportion of the total diagnosed patients will be treated each year, but we do think there's going to be a significant
increase in patients treated across Europe and we're starting to see the first signs of that as we exit 2014.
<A - John F. Milligan, Ph.D.>: And, Yaron, we're just not going to be able to give you any greater confirmation of
any specific discount. I just want to remind you of a couple of things. This is a blended discount that is across both
Sovaldi and Harvoni and includes both public and private. And I want to remind you, as Paul said, in a lot of these
private negotiations, these were related to certain relaxation of restrictions so that if more patients could get access, and
so that was factored into this as well. But other than that, I can't give any more color on what the exact specific discount
would be.

The next question comes from in Ian Somaiya from Nomura Securities.
<Q - M. Ian Somaiya>: Thanks for taking my question. Just trying to get a better handle on how we should model the
cost of cure. I know you mentioned that the duration of treatment of therapy is roughly 20% 8-weeks, 80%, I guess,
12-weeks. How should we think about that going forward, and given the more moderate pace of patients being treated
in Europe, how will that differ relative to the U.S.?
<A - John F. Milligan, Ph.D.>: So, I mean, Ian, I think we've given you all the things that you need to model this.
We've give you the specific gross to net. We've talked a little bit about where this 8-week versus 12-week can come
out. We think it could grow to close to half of U.S. patients. I can't tell you how that's going to play out during the
course of this year as some doctors still prefer 12-weeks and we don't know what the percentage of patients with
different underlying fibrosis scores would be that would preclude them from the 8-weeks.
So it's as challenging for us as it is for you. But I think we've given you as many details as we can to build out a model
to get to where we are in our guidance as well.

The next question comes from Phil Nadeau with Cowen & Co.
<Q - Phil M. Nadeau>: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just a couple of follow-ups. First on the gross
to net that seems to be taking everyone by surprise. Do you qualitatively discuss whether this gross to net is about
where you thought it would eventually get to, or because of the things that you're doing to open up access, is the gross
to net a bit bigger than you would have anticipated?
And secondly, in Europe, it sounds like you have a lot of information on budgets and whatnot. Can you give us a sense
of over time what proportion of your HCV revenues in any given year do you think will come out of Europe? Thank
you.
<A - John F. Milligan, Ph.D.>: Phil, I'm trying to think about how to answer this question about what my expectations
were. It was my expectation that over time, prices in this field would go down based on two things: one would be
increased competition, and the other would be decreasing time of therapy, and both of those things are occurring, and
so I guess my expectation is that it came down a little bit more than we thought. But at the end of the day, we felt that it
would come down to a level of about this for the treatment of HCV, and so I think we're at about where we thought we
would be in this area.
<A - Paul R. Carter>: On the Europe part, I think it was just proportionately where we were going to head. I think
over time, we will see Europe as a bigger proportion relative to the U.S. and that's partly because of the time lag on the

regulatory process and agreeing pricing and really kind of Europe getting into the swing. But I would caveat that by
just kind of repeating that there are these budget – clear budget caps across European countries, which will slow things
down there.
So I think that probably our HCV business will be proportionately the same to the U.S. as it is in HIV over time when
we kind of get to that steady-state. And just to emphasize again, we do see Europe as having a long sort of time tail to
it. So we should see our business continue to grow there for many years.

The next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas from Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. And I promise not to ask the one about gross to
net. I'm just trying to think about the discounts I think are ahead of what the Street was thinking as a blended rate, and
we know that other competitors are coming on the market. How aggressive, how low can we go? Can you give us any
comfort that these gross to net can't erode significantly over the next year or two?
And then a question on the volume side. If I'm looking at what you're saying, like the 250,000 range you've mentioned
before as being a really great year. How high, how much do you think the system can handle? Is 250,000 like what
these payers have said that they actually can handle so that they will control volumes to keep it that way? Or do you
think eventually we could go higher and they would be willing to go higher if prices remained relatively stable?
Thanks.
<A - John F. Milligan, Ph.D.>: Well, Robyn, on the first part. As I look at our products and I look at the future
competition that we're going to have and I look at our emerging, really remarkable profile of Harvoni, it's proving to be
useful on a far greater range of patients than we thought. I look at our next-generation opportunities and I think we have
by far the most competitive portfolio out there, and that gives me great confidence that we will be able to continue to
have good product pricing throughout our segments, so I'm not at all concerned about future competition that people
seem to be concerned about. I think it's a very – this is a very strong category for us with our profile. So I think this first
decrease in gross to net's getting everybody to about where they want to be for the industry and for the patients as well.
I've already forgotten the second question. Sorry, Paul. Do you remember what it was?
<A - Paul R. Carter>: I can't remember.
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Isn't the – it's the volume. So you've mentioned like 250,000 being a good year. And like,
the question is, can the system handle more at the same price, like over time? Or would they keep it in that range,
managing it by fibrosis score, do you think that that's what they could handle over time?
<A - John F. Milligan, Ph.D.>: So right now, I – that number is not a number that's being managed. Paul had
mentioned some things in Europe where there are caps. This is not a specific number that a managed care is working
towards, this is our estimation of what the capacity of the system would be and an estimation of what we think the
patient inflows could be for 2015.
The capacity of the system will depend on, quite frankly, on how well these products perform, how many patients are
cured, and how many of the restrictions are really taken away for the physician and the patient to get on therapy, and
there are commitments that we've seen to remove those restrictions. We have – we will have to wait to see how that
plays out or to whether those restrictions will cap it at a certain level or not in the future. I don't know beyond 2015
what our expectation is yet because I have to see how things perform in 2015, so it's pretty difficult for us to predict.
<A - Paul R. Carter>: Yeah, I would add that...

The next question comes from Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan.
<Q - Cory W. Kasimov>: Hey. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I'll get off the HCV market dynamic
questions for a minute and go back to the dividend. So I don't think many people were expecting you to start paying
one just yet. I'm curious if anything changed with your thinking on this front, and does this imply anything about the
acquisition opportunities that you currently see in this market? Thanks.
<A - Robin L. Washington>: Hey, Cory, not at all. This is Robin and maybe John will chime in as well. But no,
really, the timing of our dividend really reflected the confidence that we have in our business and our robust balance
sheet, as well as just the strength of our future cash flows as we look at it. And again as we've said all along, there are
multiple vehicles that we can use to return free cash flow. This gives us a disciplined approach of having a portion of it
regular and something that people can count on or bake into their models, and the rest will allow us to be flexible. But
also as I mentioned, it doesn't in any way prevent us from investing in our business, our pipeline or M&A. I think
between our free cash flows as well as our access to borrowing capacity, we don't feel constrained in any way by
issuing a dividend.

The next question comes from Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Matthew K. Harrison>: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask specifically about access
restrictions. We saw in the Express Scripts release where they talked about specifically lowering the fibrosis status. We
haven't seen that out of a lot of the releases that have gone for a Gilead product. Can you just maybe specifically state,
what sort of access restrictions have you gained with the discount, and what do you see as sort of the ability of patients
to access? Are we talking all the way up to F0, or are we talking only F1 or, just help categorize that a little bit?
Thanks.
<A - Paul R. Carter>: Yeah, Matt, we've, as I've said negotiated with the aim of increasing access, and we've
submitted during those negotiations what I'd describe as a kind of bid matrix in order to secure those agreements, and
those bid matrices encourage wider access based on fibrosis scores, amongst other things.
So the agreements we've assigned, and I'm not going to go into any specific ones, do go as far as opening up to F0, but
if that – if actions don't meet words, then those rebates wouldn't be given. So that's kind of how we're looking at it, and
I can confirm that in some agreements we've got full access signed up in terms of fibrosis scores.
<Q - Matthew K. Harrison>: And maybe just a follow up, the 46% gross-net you talked about, what kind of access on
that matrix are you assuming?
<A - Paul R. Carter>: Well, we can't go into any detail on that, Matt. As John said earlier, it's a whole mix, of product
mix, of payer mix, of timing and it's a calculation we've done, but I wouldn't want to equate that to any kind of access
criteria.

<Q - Howard Liang>: Thanks very much. Maybe I'll ask an R&D question. Could your 3 – HCV regimen, the 9857,
Sovaldi and 5816, could the four-week and six-week data be available earlier than second half of 2015 since it was
started in the fourth quarter? And could you start a Phase 3 this year?
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger, Ph.D.>: So Howard, this is Norbert. Thanks for asking a non-gross to net,
non-capital allocation question. I greatly appreciate it.
So yes, we were looking at the three drug combinations, pan-genotypic and we are currently looking at four weeks, six
weeks, cirrhotics, non-cirrhotics, treatment experienced, treatment naïve. You should see some of those data at EASL
in April in Vienna, and based on the emerging data, and it's really just emerging, we will then make a decision to go
into Phase 3. And that could happen sometime in the second half of this year, yes.

The next question comes from Brian Skorney from Robert W. Baird.
<Q - Brian P. Skorney>: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Two real quick ones; just on the 250,000 patient
number that you've been talking about for this year, if we look back last year, at IMS and Symphony Health data, NRx
was actually a really good surrogates for the numbers you've been giving us for new patients. But if I look back at like
the last couple of weeks of total NRx's, it would indicate that it's annualizing to actually see somewhere around 300,000
patients in 2015, and that's – it looks still on a pretty early growth curve trajectory, and that's assuming that Viekira is
not being underreported, which AbbVie at least says that it is. So I guess where's the disconnect there? Are what we're
seeing in IMS data not actually a reflection of what you're seeing in terms of new patients coming on anymore?
<A - John F. Milligan, Ph.D.>: Well, Brian, you're putting a lot of faith in a couple of data points, and so that would
be my big concern there is that you're taking two points and drawing a line out to the future, and there is a lot more
variability than that since we are just getting into the early part of a launch. So we'll continue to monitor, as will you,
and come up with some better idea of what the long-term sustainable rate of patients inflow is for the year.
<Q - Brian P. Skorney>: All right. And if I could just ask on Sovaldi can you give us any indication in terms of the
breakout of usage over the last couple of months say? Are we still seeing Genotype 1 new patients or has this kind of
become now a non-Genotype 1 market here?
<A - Paul R. Carter>: Brian, there are a few Genotype 1. I would say that Sovaldi, according to the latest research we
have, which is mainly around quarter four, would say that about 30% of Sovaldi users in Genotype 1. But we would
imagine that would disappear fairly quickly during quarter one and quarter two.

<Q - Ying Huang>: Hey. Thanks for taking my questions as well, and I really appreciate all the transparency and the
clarity around gross to net.
First question: how should we think about European pricing because we know that Sovaldi is priced at about 20% to
40% discount from the WAP pricing for U.S. pricing. Should we think about Harvoni pricing in Europe at that range of
discount on top of the 46% gross to net already?
And the second question is exactly in terms of the patients taking Harvoni today, what is the percentage of patients that
are F0 to F2, and how much more relaxation do you think you will get from the payers if you already have a significant
amount of patients who are early-stage? Thank you.
<A - Paul R. Carter>: Congratulations for three questions, I think, you got in there.
The European prices, we're not going to go into any detail of any of our arrangements there between countries. What I
can say is that we have public prices, list prices in several of the countries which are in the public domain. Most of
those are underpinned by the positive endorsement that NICE gave in the U.K., which shows Sovaldi to be highly
cost-effective at that price. We do have, and I've alluded to this, some rebate arrangements in place which encourage
significant increase of volumes in those countries, and I think that's all I can really say about the European
arrangements.
<A - John F. Milligan, Ph.D.>: F0 to F2?
<A - Paul R. Carter>: F0 to F2. We don't have very good data on this. What we do have data on is the intention to
prescribe rather than the prescriptions that are actually filled, so I can say F0 to F2, the intention to prescribe, as defined
by prescriptions written in the U.S. is actually around – surprisingly high, around 50%. We believe that the actual
prescriptions filled for those fibrosis types is significantly lower, historically, because of all these restrictions that were
put in place. So we would anticipate that that number would increase during the first couple of quarters this year in line
with the arrangements we've signed up.
<Q - Ying Huang>: Thank you.

The next question comes from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Terence C. Flynn>: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just wondering if you guys have thought about a target
payout ratio with respect to buybacks and dividends over time?
And then, second question is just regarding, you gave us some pretty detailed data on U.S. capacity, but what about
E.U. capacity? Any color there long-term? Thanks.
<A - Robin L. Washington>: Hi, Terence. I'll start with the first part. We don't really want to set a target. Again, as I
mentioned earlier, our focus will still be primarily share repurchases for shareholder returns, and that the level and
aggressiveness with which we do them will really be based on how we feel about our valuation.
If you look over the past several years, we've returned about – a little over 50% of our free cash flow, and based on our
valuation, I mean that's an area that we're comfortable with, but we reserve the right to ratchet that down over time. I
think particularly as you think about a dividend for the second half, you'd expect us to lower share repurchases a bit.
<A - Paul R. Carter>: And the European capacity, I mean, I said in my script that so far, up until the end of 2014, with
just Sovaldi really in the E.U., we treated, we think around 32,000 patients last year.
Now we've only really signed up several of the governments on Sovaldi towards the end of last year, and we're moving
fast with Harvoni and we would anticipate Harvoni being a far more attractive product because of its simplicity and all
the other very clear benefits it has. So it's hard to say, but I think that we've got a substantial number of patients in
Europe that could and should be treated. It will depend somewhat on the budget caps, as I've already alluded to, how

strictly those are enforced, but I think we have a large and healthy growing and sustainable market in Europe for many
years.
<Q - Terence C. Flynn>: Can you give us directionally versus the U.S. the 250,000, the same magnitude, lower,
higher?
<A - Paul R. Carter>: I think it's just a really hard question to answer. I'm sorry. I can't answer that. But I think that if
you thought of a number north of 100,000, that would kind of seem logical.
<Q - Terence C. Flynn>: Okay. Thank you.

The next question comes from Thomas Wei from Jefferies.
<Q - Thomas A. Wei>: Thanks. Just wanted to ask about the waterfall plot for Hep C and the bar that's missing on the
diagnosed patients that are under the care of a physician?
And then also wanted to ask about simtuzumab. I thought I heard you say no activity in myelofibrosis. I thought you
were looking at bone marrow biopsies there, and does that mean you did not see any effect, like any anti-fibrotic affect?
And what do you think of that in terms of NASH? Thanks.
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger, Ph.D.>: Yeah, so, Thomas, it's Norbert. I'll answer the last question first quickly. So
we're looking at it in myelofibrosis, pancreatic and colorectal cancer, in all of those three indications, there was no
activity, and you are right in myelofibrosis, we looked at histology at the endpoint. In the other two indications it was
PFS. But I would like to point out that it's – myelofibrosis is biologically different from liver and pulmonary fibrosis,
and I do not think you can extrapolate to those two diseases. So we still have hope and somewhat confidence that it's
different and we'll see. It's in Phase 2 for NASH, for PSC and for IPF.
<A - John F. Milligan, Ph.D.>: And, Thomas, your first question was about the missing bar on the waterfall, and we
just didn't have any confidence in what number to put in for patients who are under care. We're confident in the 1.6
million people who have been diagnosed. We do recognize that a number of those have sought care directly from that
bar, if you will, and many have been cured over the course of this year, and sort of bypassed that middle part of the
waterfall. And because it's such a fast-moving field and because our data is a quarter in arrears, we felt it was no longer
representative and so we stopped using the graph altogether last quarter but brought back the diagnosed bar and the
overall bar because we are more confident that those two numbers are reasonably accurate. We just can't tell you who is
in the care right now, because it's moving so quickly.

And, Mr. O'Brien, we have time for one more question. Our final question comes from Josh Schimmer from Piper
Jaffray.
<Q - Joshua E. Schimmer>: Hi. Thanks for fitting me in. Just given that you have experienced rapid acceleration and
then deceleration in earnings growth. Is it a priority to find a more stable, sustainable pace of EPS growth? If so, when
do you think you'll move on to a more stable trajectory, and do you believe that over the long term you can continue to
deliver double-digit earnings growth despite some of the mid- and long-term headwinds? Thanks.
<A - John F. Milligan, Ph.D.>: Josh, there is a lot of pronouncements in there. We've certainly made great progress
over the last year. I think we continue to make great progress and have a very reasonable, stable base of business. But
as always, we're going to invest in Norbert's pipeline and continuing to bring products out.
We have some really interesting things going on, as we announced today, the MMP9 antibody is moving ahead because
it shows activity in two different kinds of very interesting long-term diseases. And we'll continue to invest in products

So I feel we have, as Robin says, a capability financially to buy back shares, to pay dividends and to invest heavily in
the pipeline for the future. I frankly never felt like the company has been in better shape in terms of our stable base of
business and our way forward. So we'll continue to focus on that.
<Q - Joshua E. Schimmer>: Okay, thanks.
