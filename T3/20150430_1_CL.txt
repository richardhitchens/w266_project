Bina H. Thompson
Thank you, Danny, and good morning, everybody. And welcome to our first quarter 2015 earnings conference call.
With me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate
Controller; and Elaine Paik, Treasure.
We're pleased with how this year has started out, with solid organic sales growth and encouraging gross margin
improvement. Despite the major currency headwinds we have been facing, our business is on track. And as Ian said in
this morning's press release, our anticipated full year earnings per share decline reflects a double digit increase on a
currency-neutral basis, of course excluding restructuring charges. And as you'll hear in more detail shortly, we've made
very good market share progress across categories and divisions. This is the result of ongoing innovation around the
world, supported by a healthy level of advertising. And while our reported advertising was down absolutely versus the
year-ago quarter, the 10.6% level as a percent to sales is up meaningfully from the fourth quarter of 2014 level of 9.7%
and compares to a level in last year's first quarter of 11.1%, the highest for last year. And as we've said on many
occasions, it's the combination of this reported advertising and our very impactful in-store activities which drives
volume and market share growth.
And our efforts in the area of efficiency continue to pay off, with our funding-the-growth initiatives off to a very good
start. In fact, it's the strongest first quarter we've had in that area in some time. In addition, our Global Growth and
Efficiency Program is on track and delivering the savings we had projected. And as referenced in the press release, our
balance sheet is strong. Working capital levels are below last year.
So let's turn to the divisions, starting with North America. Our North American business continues to grow. As
mentioned in the press release, our year-to-date market share is up in toothpaste and manual toothbrushes. In addition,
it's up in mouthwash, body wash, liquid hand soap, and fabric conditioner. In the toothpaste whitening category, the
February launch of Colgate Optic White Platinum Express White has added incremental share. Our year-to-date share
for whitening is 5.8%, which grew to 6.8% in March. Part of our successful integrated marketing campaign included
the use of YouTube beauty experts to engage our millennial consumer.
Another 2015 toothpaste innovation is Colgate Enamel Health Multi-Protection toothpaste, which includes premium
packaging. In the body wash category, our year-to-date share is up over a full point, to almost 10%. Our February
launches of both Irish Spring Signature For Men and Softsoap Fresh & Glow have contributed to these results. And our
liquid hand soap share is at 31.4% year-to-date, with the most recent share at 33.1%, largely driven by the Softsoap
Fragrant Foaming Collection.
We're also very pleased with our Tom's of Maine business, which is growing very strongly. Innovation as well as
increased distribution have played a role. We're getting good traction with our recent launch of a line of baby products.
Our in-store execution has been excellent, including a very impactful Earth Day event. And you'll hear about more new
products later in the year.
So let's turn then to Europe/South Pacific. Momentum is strong across this division and market shares are growing. Our
strong organic volume growth of 5.5% is the highest in almost five years. Our year-to-date market share is up in
toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, liquid hand soap, shower gel, and fabric conditioner. Our year-to-date toothpaste
share is at 36.4%, up 40 basis points, with the most recent reading at 37%.
Toothpaste innovation this quarter includes [ph] Colgate Total Daily Repair. (6:06) This new product helps reverse
early damage for better oral health. It's an every day, multi-benefit toothpaste, with proactive repair benefits and is
priced at a premium to the base business. In the whitening category, we're launching Colgate Max White For Men with
powerful stain removal for whiter teeth. And more toothpaste innovation is planned for the second half of this year. Our

manual toothbrush share is up two full points to 26.9% on a year-to-date basis, with the most recent share at 27.2%.
And innovative products, such as Colgate 360° and Colgate Slim Soft toothbrushes, supported by excellent in-store
execution, have helped drive these results.
The UK and Australia had particularly good performance, with year-to-date toothbrush share up 660 basis points and
240 basis points, respectively, clearly strengthening already robust leadership positions.
In the Personal Care category, we're also launching a new men's variant, [ph] Palmolive Men Fresh Care. (7:10) This is
a three-in-one product which combines a face, body, and hair wash in one convenient package. We told you last quarter
about a new line under the Sanex brand, Sanex Advanced. This has had excellent trade acceptance and in-store
implementation. We expect that share results should follow soon.
Our year-to-date fabric conditioner share is up 80 basis points to 27.4%, with the most recent period at 27.7%. This was
helped by the launch of Soupline Paradise Sensations, which brings new trends to the fabric conditioner category with
its powerful bundle impact and sophisticated fragrances. The pipeline of product moving forward is strong, with the
re-launch of Soupline Perfect Glide and Magic Moments, offering easy ironing and superior long-lasting fragrance. The
new premium look with outstanding on-shelf impact and a high-performing formula commands a premium price.
Turning then to Latin America, organic sales growth was strong in this region, despite a strong year-ago comparison.
And, as elsewhere, premium innovation has helped drive results. Our regional toothpaste share is up 150 basis points to
77.7% on a year-to-date basis, with good gains in many countries. In Brazil, we're up 40 basis points year-over-year to
71.7%, while our nearest competitor has seen sequential declines in the last three bimonthly share periods.
In Mexico, we're up 110 basis points to 80.6%, and this despite continued promotional pressure from some of our
competitors. In manual toothbrushes, premium offerings such as Colgate 360° and Colgate Slim Soft, have contributed
to share growth in many countries. In Mexico, our leadership share increased 80 basis points to 43.1% on a year-to-date
basis, widening the gap between our nearest competitor to 150 basis points.
In Colombia, our year-to-date share increased 30 basis points to 46.7%. In bar soap, the year has started strong, with
the division holding market leadership at 30.7%. Both equities, Palmolive and Protex, continue to be the number one
and two brands across Latin America. And we achieved record high shares in Mexico, Colombia, and Guatemala.
Our market-leading fabric conditioner business in Mexico expanded its market share by 50 basis points to 47.2% on a
year-to-date basis. Newly-launched Suavitel Aroma Intense achieved a 1.4% share in the direct trade in the first
quarter. And a new smaller-based business size helped compete with low-priced local competitors in the Bodega retail
environment.
Innovation in Latin America continues this quarter across categories. To build on our success in the whitening
category, we are launching Luminous White Advanced toothpaste in Brazil. This is Colgate's most advanced whitening
toothpaste, which intensifies the white of your teeth three shades whiter. Its unique formula contains the same
ingredient dentists use, and you can feel it working while you brush. As a companion product, we will offer Colgate
360° Luminous White toothbrush with stain-erasing cups and a two-times whitening action.
In the mid-tier segment and as a companion to our Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection plus Neutrazucar toothpaste,
we are relaunching Colgate [ph] Zig Zag Maximum Cavity Protection (10:46) toothbrush. The product has
multi-angled bristles and a flexible neck, which help with plaque removal. And in the Personal Care category, we've
just launched a new line under the Protex brand, [ph] Protex Complete 12 (11:01) body wash, hand wash and bar soap,
providing long-lasting antibacterial protection.
Turning then to Asia, as you've seen, organic sales performance in this region was somewhat muted this quarter. But
going forward, we have a full pipeline of new products to reignite growth. In India, our toothpaste share is up 30 basis
points to 54.6% on a year-to-date basis, fueled by the launch of Colgate Active Salt and [ph] Colgate Max Fresh.
(11:26) In the Philippines, our toothpaste share increased 120 basis points to 60.9%, with the most recent read of
61.2%. Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection toothpaste has achieved almost a 3% share of that market.

Our manual toothbrush shares increased in five of 10 countries around the region, with our divisional year-to-date share
at 29.9%, down modestly from the year-ago period, but still the market-leading position. And we continue to grow our
mouthwash business. Our regional share is up 30 basis points to 24% on a year-to-date basis. In India, Colgate Plax
Active Salt and Colgate Plax Visible White helped drive our market share up 100 basis points to 18.2%. While in the
Philippines, Colgate Plax Jasmine Tea was the major driver of a 220 basis point increase to 26.8%, with the most recent
read at 27.9%.
And in the second quarter, the innovation continues. In toothpaste, we will launch Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Repair
and Prevent, which repairs the sensitive areas of teeth and, with regular use, provides lasting protection to prevent
sensitivity from returning. In the base sensitivity line comes [ph] Colgate Sensitive with Sensifoam (12:44) to reach all
areas of the teeth. For the Thai market, we are launching [ph] Colgate Salt Charcoal (12:51). And, as you know,
charcoal is an attractive ingredient to consumers in this region, based on local insights. In manual toothbrushes, we've
just introduced [ph] Colgate Slim Soft Gold Charcoal toothbrush with less than 0.01 millimeter slim tip (13:00)
antibacterial bristles for deep, but gentle, cleaning. And we are extending charcoal to the value portion of our
toothbrush business with [ph] Colgate Zigzag Charcoal (13:15) toothbrush.
In Personal Care in Thailand, we will launch a line of soap, body wash and hand soap. Protex Omega 3 body wash with
omega-3 essential oil and which washes away 99.9% of bacteria, while keeping your skin feeling moisturized. Also in
that market, we will introduce Protex Intimate Care feminine wash, the bundle now selling in Brazil.
Turning to Africa/Eurasia, organic sales in this region were strong, building on the momentum we saw as we exited
2014, and innovation has driven these good results across categories. Our regional toothpaste share is up 90 basis points
year-to-date to 33.7%, with market share increases in virtually every country. Our share: in Russia, was up 160 basis
points; in South Africa, 120 basis points; and in Turkey, 130 basis points. Similarly, our toothbrush share increased
everywhere with the exception of East-West Africa. Shares in Russia, South Africa, and Turkey increased 170 basis
points, 90 basis points, and 50 basis points, respectively.
Our bar soap share was also up across the region, up 290 basis points year-to-date. In South Africa, our share increased
180 basis points to 32.4%, thanks to the new products we told you about in previous quarters, Protex Men and Protex
African Therapy.
And more innovation is planned for this quarter. In toothpaste, we will be launching [ph] Colgate Optic White Whiten
and Restore. (14:50) The formula, with an active mineral complex and fresh mint flavor, provides one shade whiter
teeth in one week, while helping to restore enamel strength. And the consumer can have the confidence of always being
able to look her best without compromising the health of her mouth.
In Russia, following on the success of our Altai Herbs bundle, we'll be introducing Colgate Plax Forte Oak Bark & Fir
mouthwash. Oak bark and fir are attractive ingredients to consumers in this part of the world, based on local insights.
And in the shower gel category, we are adding a new variant to our successful Palmolive Spa Gourmet (sic) [Palmolive
Gourmet Spa] (15:31) line, [ph] Mint Shake, (15:32) with an uplifting mint fragrance and rich creamy formula infused
with natural mint extracts that leave your skin feeling pampered. To build on our success in bar soaps, we're launching
[ph] Protex Complete 12, (15:41) similar to the bundle launching across Latin America.
And Hill's; Hill's solid organic sales growth was a good balance between volume and price, both here and overseas. In
addition, it's encouraging that gross profit margin is up year-over-year. As you may recall, we indicated this would
indeed happen, despite initial costs associated with reformulation of new and existing products. And we're pleased that
in the U.S. market, retail consumption in the large-format retailers is up nicely. Among the drivers are our premium
Hill's Science Diet offerings, which have been supported in-store with impactful displays and are growing faster than
the rest of the Hill's Science Diet line.
This quarter, we've begun a 10-week turnaround campaign to support Hill's Science Diet Perfect Weight. The objective
here is to educate consumers about pet weight loss, creating awareness and buzz around the product to drive trial.
Consumer engagement activities will be both in-store and online. Hill's Ideal Balance also continues to perform well.
Hill's Ideal Balance Crafted was launched in the first quarter. This new sub line, with its premium positioning, offers

authentic ingredients prepared with care. A full support campaign has included new product kits and feeding trials,
along with online ratings and reviews.
The packaging and messaging relaunch of our Hill's Prescription Diet line is off to a good start. Here in the U.S., it's
received excellent feedback from the profession. The packaging is seen as being more consumer-friendly, with
increased and clearer descriptives and this is now rolling out across Europe.
So in summary, we're very pleased with the way 2015 has started out. The momentum we saw as we exited 2014 has
continued in many regions of the world. Our new product pipeline is full across all categories, and our ongoing savings
programs, as well as our Global Growth and Efficiency Program, are providing funds to support that robust innovation.
As we implement our Global Growth and Efficiency Program, our people are becoming even more focused on winning
on the ground each and every day. We look forward to sharing our progress with you as we go forward through the
year.
And now, Danny, I'd like to open it up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Nik H. Modi>: Yeah, good morning, everyone.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Good morning, Nik.
<Q - Nik H. Modi>: Ian, I was hoping you could just provide us the quick gross margin bridge and then the broader
question is from a competitive standpoint, just curious if you could just give us the state of the union on what you're
seeing in some of the key markets in terms of some of the competitive activity. Are you seeing a scale-back in some
promotional spend, especially some of those markets where one of your competitors has really been making a push
over the last two to three years?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Okay, Nik, happy to do the gross profit walk-through. So if you take our first quarter, the first
quarter of 2014, the gross margin was 58.6%. We pick up a positive benefit of pricing at one percentage point. Between
funding-the-growth and a very modest contribution from restructuring, we pick up another 170 basis points, and as
Bina said in her remarks, you can see that that places us with a far quicker start on our funding-the-growth in 2015 than
we had prior year, because of the intense focus we have put there.
Material prices were a headwind of 230 basis points. And that was almost wholly transaction impact. There's another
10 basis points of Other, and that gets you to the current year gross profit of 58.9%. We were very pleased with the 30
basis points improvement we had in the first quarter. Indeed, many external views saw our gross profit coming down
because of that foreign exchange transaction impact. And we like to think that the balance we are finding between
pricing, between funding-the-growth, between global growth and efficiency driving our innovation and meeting
competitive marketplace needs is allowing us to grow the top-line, while, at the same time, increasing our gross margin.
And as we said on the last call, and it remains true for this year, we expect our gross margin to continue to build across
the year. And we still plan to expand that gross margin on the year between 50 and 100 basis points. So I think that
captures the gross margin approach and thinking from our side.
In terms of the marketplaces, I wouldn't say we have seen anything holistically different. We see, in pockets, increased
promotional activity. We see, in other pockets, increased couponing activity. And we see in other locations, frankly, an
easing in the promotional environment.
We do see quite a lot of pull-back from our principal competitors in media advertising across the first quarter of the
year. And I would say our reaction to it is as our reaction has always been, we balance between driving trial for our

innovation and meeting promotional needs when they are there, but, at the same time, growing and growing our gross
margin. And that continues to be our view of the external environment promotionally for the balance of the year.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Dara Mohsenian. Please go ahead.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Morning.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hey, Dara.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: So, Ian, pricing decelerated sequentially on a year-over-year basis in Q1 versus Q4, and
I'm just trying to get a sense of what drove that. Are you seeing a more competitive manufacturer environment in terms
of promotion, as you just talked about? Is it more related to consumer demand elasticity? I guess I would've expected it
to build, given greater FX. And then, can you talk a little bit about plans in the balance of the year to cover any
additional FX pressure? Thanks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yeah, no, we were actually quite pleased with the pricing in the first quarter. You're right, as
always. You're balancing your speed of response with what is there in the marketplace and the consumer. We do expect
our pricing to build across the year. As you correctly say, we use pricing, along with other vehicles, to offset that
transaction impact of foreign exchange, but I return to the point that I think we're working very hard to maintain that
right balance so we can invest to grow market share and drive the top-line, while increasing our gross margin. And we
feel we started the year in a good place with that 30 margin point expansion, knowing that pricing takes a little bit of
time to catch up with the foreign exchange impact. So more pricing across the balance of the year and reiterating the
plan to expand our gross margin again across the balance of the year to increase by 50 to 100 basis points for the full
year.
Operator
We'll take our next question from John Faucher with JPMorgan.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Thank you. A little bit of a follow-up on Dara's question, Ian, which is more about the
mechanics of pricing, especially when you have this much volatility, and so I guess how do we look at sort of the
timeframe that it takes to react to some of this emerging market currency volatility in the transactional FX? Is it
something where the pricing goes in relatively quickly or do you sort of have to wait for things to stabilize as we look
at sort of how to balance, again, some of the wild movements in the currency and whether or not if you price for
transactional and then the currency moves in your favor, there's an additional spread that works in your favor? Thanks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yes. In some situations where the marketplace change is significant and dire, we, along with
others, tend to take significant pricing steps very quickly. Russia would be a very clear example. In others, we are more
balanced in doing it. If I broaden the discussion a little bit and you think about selling price increases, in fact, our
selling price increases in the quarter were between 4% and 5%. Then, with some of the activity we have at the store
level, we spent some of that back, so you end up with the net pricing number, which is what you see at 2.4%. And on
balance between the two, still grew gross profit by 30 basis points and kept advertising at a healthy level of 10.6%.
So that's what we tend to be juggling with as we balance gross pricing with how we execute in the marketplace. And
our responsiveness will be as the market dictates, and our balance between the gross and the effective pricing will
reflect also marketplace needs. But, again, that balance will see our gross margin expand as the year unfolds by 50 to
100 basis points, which sees us with our traditional advertising up absolutely and as a percent to sales on the year.

From Citi Research, we have Wendy Nicholson. Please go ahead.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: Hi.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hi, Wendy.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: How are you? My question was on Hill's. And it looks to me that the operating margin is
kind of back to close to an all-time high level, which is awesome. But over the last few years, it seems like when
margin has crept up, then you soon thereafter lose share. And there has kind of been a trade-off. And I'm wondering,
number one, if you can comment on that and whether there's been more structural change so that we really should think
that a 27%-plus operating margin is sustainable for Hill's, combined with an outlook for top-line growth. And also, as
the Hill's business sort of expands, I know you've entered some new markets, like Eastern Europe and Latin America, I
assume you're not opening up manufacturing yet in those places. So is there a risk that there is more transactional cost
to the business as currencies move and you don't have local manufacturing for that business specifically? Thanks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yes. The Hill's consumption is very strong. And I think all of these are a balance between the
value the consumer believes that they are paying for and the gross margin that that delivers. So Bina went through
much of the innovation that we can, so far, talk about on the Hill's business, thus far, this year, and a large part of that is
accretive from a gross margin point of view. So we're creating innovation that is margin accretive that the consumer is
attracted to.
So you will remember when we went through the process of turning Hill's around, we said one of the key strategic
things we wanted to do was to make the innovation flow in Hill's sustainable, not episodic, and we have that now. So,
yes, we do believe, and it was part of our plan when we made the investment in gross margin, that we would return to
historical levels.
Now, from a local country expansion point of view, we're not in any new markets compared to the emerging markets
that we had already been in, like Russia, like Brazil, like Mexico, those types of marketplace. And indeed, we do have a
transaction burden because we don't make Hill's products in Russia, for example, but all of that is based into our
business plan. We make the same pricing adjustments to address the transaction impact on Hill's as we do for the
Colgate business. And maybe strategically down the road one day, if we were to invest in capacity, of course, that
would give us further margin improvement on those businesses.
The other comment I would make is we are finding with Hill's and our engagement with the Hill's consumer, that the
emotional connection is so rich that you can engage with that consumer through digital vehicles almost entirely,
because they will spend extraordinary time finding out information and they will spend extraordinary time with Hill's
representatives to take care of their pet.
So with that business in particular, we're building a very efficient model of targeting and reaching the consumer, given
the emotional investment they have in the category, the brand, and, of course, their pet. So long story short, we think
it's sustainable.

<Q - Jason M. English>: Thank you for the question. I'm looking at Asia, Africa/Eurasia combined, so what you used
to report as Greater Asia and Africa, and the organic sales growth blended of 2.1% is the weakest we've seen since the
third quarter of 2014. And it looks like it's really coming on softness in Asia. I noticed in the press release, you

referenced volume declines in China. And I think last quarter, you said the de-stock was behind you. So I was hoping
you could just drill a little bit deeper into what's happening in the Asia segment, why price sort of rolled negative, why
volume is still relatively soft, and, more specifically, what's happening in China?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yep. Fair question, Jason, and, obviously, your math is correct. And indeed, the country that bears
comment is China. And so let me make a few remarks around China, because that really is the country, the geography,
to discuss.
I think the first thing to say is that you will remember we were one of the first to recognize that trade de-stocking was
occurring in the second quarter last year. And we said that de-stocking process would be completed by the end of 2014
and that trade inventories would be back to balance. And that has happened. The inventory de-stocking is completed in
China.
If you look at our consumption in China, which is to say the consumers' purchases of our products, our quarter one
consumption was up a healthy mid-single digits, in line with the marketplace. Our January, February market share was
up meaningfully from the fourth quarter of 2014 when the de-stocking ended. And, indeed, our local sales in China for
the first quarter were up behind that strong consumption meaningfully fourth quarter to first quarter.
Now, the comparison with the first quarter of 2014 is down, due to the comparison with what was our highest quarter in
2014, which, again, you will remember was the quarter before the down-stocking occurred. So what I'm saying is our
consumption is leading our sales back up. Our market share and that consumption predict continued growth in sales.
And I think, most importantly, the second quarter in China is off to a brisk start. So consumption is good, and that
future growth for that business will continue to build.

We have Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Olivia Tong>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hi, Olivia.
<Q - Olivia Tong>: Hi, how are you?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: I'm terrific.
<Q - Olivia Tong>: Wonderful. First question is just on pricing in North America, it was up for the first time in
probably about two years. So is the couponing starting to lap? Is competition improving? And then also, specifically on
pricing in Brazil, are you planning to raise prices? And I ask in the context of Brazil volume having declined in the
March quarter. And then, finally, on the organic sales outlook for the full year, with the first quarter sort of at the low
end of your longer-term outlook in the sort of 4% to 7% range, can you just talk through that a little bit? Thanks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yeah. Well, in the U.S., obviously, we were pleased with the pricing pick-up in the first quarter.
And, yes, I would say there has been some modulation in the promotion activity. And indeed, you will remember the
first quarter for us last year was the quarter in which we had launched many, many of our new products and, of course,
the couponing behind the trial for those new products would've been in the first quarter of 2014. So there is a timing
aspect to that as well.
We have indeed taken pricing in Brazil, but I would comment on Brazil that it is a different story to China. And that the
marketplace economic activity and, indeed, our categories, worsened since the last time we spoke in January. I don't
think that's new news to everyone.
It has been widely reported. Pleasingly, as Bina said, our market share approaching 72% is up year-on-year. In fact,
when I was down there two weeks ago, the General Manager said with great pride that it was the highest market share
in 19 years, but who's looking? And so our shares continue to be strong, i.e., we are growing faster than the market

growth. And as you would imagine, given our experience in Latin America, we're doing a very, shall we say, attentive
job of managing our cost structure, but I think it's fair to say that we should expect and, indeed, we are planning for a
slower Brazil marketplace for the balance of this year. Now, the organic growth outcome, I think you can do your own
math. We provided a range of 4% to 7% because of the choppiness and volatility in our world. And to put that in
comparison, that 4% is up against the highest quarter of last year at 6.5%. So the compares ease a little bit as we go
forward. And if the China growth returns the way we expect it to, it will clearly move us up that range. So we're still
comfortable with the 4% to 7% range, and we'll see how it unfolds quarter-by-quarter.

And we'll take Steve Powers from UBS. Please go ahead, sir.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hey, Steve.
<Q - Steve R. Powers>: Great. Hi, Ian, thanks. Hey, so I think previously – this is a little bit of housekeeping maybe,
but I think you had called out FX as a 7%, 7.5% headwind to the top-line for the year a few months ago and a 10%
headwind on the bottom-line from a translation standpoint. And I apologize if I missed it. But could you call out
specifically how that is evolved as you see it? Because I'm wondering if the effect of two to four point reduction in
all-in EPS is 100% FX versus other factors on the margin like Brazil, which you mentioned? And if I could squeeze in
a related follow-up, on FX, what would trigger a move to the SIMADI rate in Venezuela for you? And how
incrementally impactful would you expect that to be on a pro forma 12-month basis, because it feels like is essentially a
matter of time before that needs to happen?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yeah. Well, to take the second point, which is housekeeping, you will find that broken out in our
Q. So we actually provide the calculation where they're a requirement that we do that, which is to say what would the
impact on the business be if we were required to go to the SIMADI rate. The foreign exchange impact on the year is
around 10%, more or less. It is more on the bottom-line, as it was in the first quarter. I think top to bottom was [ph]
10%, 14% (39:02) on the first quarter. So it's about a 10% impact on the year. There are no other factors affecting our
guidance other than, and I stress, the translation impact of foreign exchange, because as you know well, we seek to
cover the transaction impact, because that is what leads to operating results.

And we'll take Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.

<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hey, Bill.
<Q - William G. Schmitz>: Hey.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: I got the name right.
<Q - William G. Schmitz>: Nice. Thank you. Can you talk about the growth opportunity in Home Care and Personal
Care? Only because like Oral Care is sort of indisputable, given your market shares, but it seems like in those
categories there's a lot more local competition, commodities are rolling over. I look at some of the data. I'm not sure
that the syndicated data is great, but you look at Home Care Venezuela, it looks like the business in bolivars was up
sort of 50% year-over-year in 2014 versus 2013. So I'm just wondering what you think of the outlook there to have that
to continue to grow and then maybe as an opportunity because people are exiting the markets? Maybe I'm looking at it
the wrong way, and since you guys are the last guys standing maybe, it's better than I would have otherwise thought?
So any thoughts would be appreciated.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yes. Well, I don't like being categorized as the last guy standing. And Venezuela is a unique case.
I don't know what data you're seeing, Bill, but our Home Care business is not a focus for us in Venezuela. And, indeed,

material availability is modest in that business.
I think, as you heard Bina talk, we're quite pleased with our Home Care and our Personal Care business. Yes, there are
more competitors in personal care than we find in oral care, but if you take Personal Care against the company,
Personal Care organic grew around 3% in the first quarter, quite healthy growth. And more competitors means the
marketplace is more fragmented. And therefore, you can garner progress, because there are simply more players in the
space. And I think some of the examples Bina quoted are very good examples of where we are doing precisely that in
emerging markets as well as developed markets. So, no, we still think there is opportunity for growth in those
categories and we're going after it.

We'll take Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Hey, guys.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hey, good morning, Ali.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Hey, Ian, so just a quick clarification, I just missed something and then to the core question here, I
apologize. So you said FX would be at 10% impact on the bottom- line.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: No, on the top-line.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Oh, on the top-line. Okay, okay, fine, fine. Sorry, I missed that. Okay. If you go to kind of the
pricing and dig down a little bit further in kind of two buckets, one is Asia at negative 1%, and then Europe, a negative
4.5%, how do you think that goes going forward? So do you think that kind of negative pressure will continue on those
marketplaces where it's going down? And then on where the pricing has been driving your overall pricing, so Latin
America and Africa/Eurasia, both in kind of 7.5%, 8% range, both of those, as you comment, are driven by highly
inflationary areas. So Venezuela, as an example, in Latin America, call it 50% or 60% inflation, it's 3% of your
business; overall, 10% of [ph] Lat (42:46) region. Africa/Eurasia, Russia obviously the driver there, or one of the
potential drivers there; and there, too, what do you think the sustainability is of that? And if you were to pull out
Venezuela and Russia in those pricings, what would it be; sustainably both of them negative, so the bad stuff and then
potentially the good stuff on pricing? Thanks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Wow. Where to start? If we take pricing overall, and you may have missed the response we gave
a little bit earlier, we continue to believe we have pricing power. And therefore, the gross pricing we have been able to
take is around 4.5%. And we have reinvested some of that in the trade spending activity to grow market share, which,
along with the traditional advertising we have invested, has continued to be productive. We are growing market shares
broadly, and we are seeing our gross margin expand.
We think in terms of the pricing in Africa/Eurasia and Latin America, that that is sustainable. We are not, again, going
to talk about Venezuela specifically, other than to say when we got pricing in the fourth quarter of last year, so did
many of our competitors. And regardless of what the inflation is in a country, in Venezuela's case, pricing is controlled
by the government. So we don't have the flexibility to follow the inflation with self-directed pricing in Venezuela. So
Venezuela is all roll-over in 2015.
I would also say that we have very broad-based pricing increases across all of Latin America. You forgot Hill's, where I
think we've got a very good balance between effective pricing and volume growth on that business and beginning to see
the gross margin build back nicely, which was clearly one of our objectives.
The U.S., North America, pricing possibility, that will always be a bit choppy, given the timing of couponing behind
new products and the fact that couponing goes into price. And I think there will continue to be pricing pressure in
Europe, but our expectation is that it will ease over the balance of the year compared to the first quarter level. Now in
Asia, specific to China, we made some corrective pricing actions on a couple of our businesses, which are now baked
in for the full year. I think that was responding to all the questions you asked, Ali, at least I hope so.

And we'll take our next question from Caroline Levy with CLSA. Please go ahead.
<Q - Caroline S. Levy>: Thanks very much. And forgive me if you've touched on this. There's a lot of stuff here, but
advertising growth for the full year, do you expect the actual recorded number to be up in local currency and in dollars,
would be the first thing? And then, just on China, there's been a move to premiumization in many categories and
toothpaste is one of them. The local toothpaste, I think, is a premium product. Are you doing anything? I know your
Darlie brand is very successful, but within the Colgate brand, are you doing things to premiumize and try to take
advantage of that?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yeah, yeah we are. I mean, on the advertising side, when we look at advertising spending for the
year, we see, on a ratio basis, an increase year-on-year. In local currency terms, it will certainly be up. It will certainly
be up. From a China point of view, you're absolutely right. There is a fair degree of premiumizaton going on in China.
And we, indeed, are taking advantage of that. When you put China in a longer context, over the last eight years, we
have built our China business from about a 29% share to a market-leading 33%, 34% share, 34% share January,
February this year. If you look at our principal multinational competitor, they have gone from 25% down to under 15%.
And the other multinational competitor has gone down from mid-teens to high single digits. And that premium local
brand you mentioned is what is taking up the slack. So we are continuing to hold market position quite nicely and,
indeed, we are adopting a premiumization strategy.

And we'll take our next question from Bill Chappell with Suntrust.
<Q - William B. Chappell>: Good morning. Thank you.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hey, Bill.
<Q - William B. Chappell>: Ian, you alluded to kind of the pull-back in marketing from the competition earlier. And
there has been some talk about your largest competitor meaningfully pulling back on media spend over the next few
months or few quarters. How do you look at that? Is that an opportunity to keep the foot on the pedal or is there just too
much marketing and advertising out there, maybe everybody can benefit a little bit?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: I would say when we think about our – I am now talking the traditional advertising media, I
would say that our focus is more on what is necessary to reach, engage, and convince our consumers to stay with our
brands from an emotional point of view and to try our innovation. That's the purpose. And that dictates a certain reach
and frequency for your traditional media. These days, it also requires a mix between the traditional and the digital and
other ways of connecting with people. If some of these pull-backs continue to be as we have seen them, maybe it does
create a little bit more of a rational opportunity in some markets, but we'll track that for a while before we make any
significant changes.

<Q - Joseph Nicholas Altobello>: Exactly. Two quick questions on SG&A, I guess, first, in terms of overhead, a little
surprised it was up this quarter. Was that all FX driven? And then secondly, if you can remind us what you're expecting
in terms of total restructuring savings this year. Thanks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yeah, you're right on the overhead, Joe. In fact, total dollar expenses were down. So the reason
the ratio is up is a combination of timing and dollar-denominated expenses against a weakening foreign
exchange-driven top-line. As to your second point, I think we have in our K, I think we're talking [ph] $65 million to
$75 million (50:28) after-tax for the year. Sorry, that was the restructuring.

about the advertising spend.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Harp away. Harp away.
<Q - Eddy J. Hargreaves>: But, Ian, you answered the last person who asked you this in terms of ratios, but I think
what you were saying implies that you think that worldwide advertising investment will be up for the full year in
absolute terms, just is down 10% to $430 million in the quarter. If that's right, I'm slightly surprised because it implies
quite a step-up in the next three quarters, given your overall sort of commentary about the media environment. Perhaps
you could square the circle, somewhat.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Maybe I misspoke, but let me answer the first one first and then you can ask the second one.
<Q - Eddy J. Hargreaves>: Right.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: So we don't lose the point. It'll be up in local currency, on a currency-neutral basis. And it'll be up
on a ratio basis. The dollars will be broadly in line, maybe modestly down year-on-year.
<Q - Eddy J. Hargreaves>: Okay.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: And your second question?
<Q - Eddy J. Hargreaves>: Okay, yeah, thanks for that. And the other one was there's been some sort of comment
earlier on in the questioning about the North American pricing looking a bit better. You obviously said that it tends to
be choppy. But if we look at the overall organic performance top-line of North America, it looks as weak as it's been
for quite a few quarters, sort of looking back across the spreadsheet, as it were. Perhaps you could sort of give some
sense of how you see the North American consumer environment generally, given potential of oil price-based benefits
to consumers, that type of thing. Are you fairly confident that the environment will look better in H2 than H1, for
example?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: You know, who knows? I mean, the first quarter economic numbers were just revised down. I
think there is an underlying confidence that the U.S. economy is on the turn, but I think it's a slow turn. Frankly, our

And we'll take our next question from Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research.
<Q - Javier Escalante>: Hello, everyone.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hey, Javier.
<Q - Javier Escalante>: My question actually has to do with Brazil. We heard from your competitors, L'Oréal,
Unilever, that category growth was flat in terms of volume, but your volumes are actually down, and then you are
telling us that you're gaining share. So then the question is, is it that the calculation has to do because people are trading
down within Colgate's portfolio and that's why you are getting negative volumes? Or is that the end of the day, you are
over-represented in channels that are losing market share, say, large-format retailers, and that's how we reconcile the
fact they you have strong shares but actually your volumes are negative, which your competitors are not posting
negative volumes? Thank you.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: I guess all these countries have to be a balance between volume and price, given the transaction
impact of the foreign exchange. So in Brazil, we took pricing, and we took pricing against volume, to your point, to
establish the pricing in the marketplace. At the same time, because of the economic decline, several of the categories
did go negative in volume terms, so not all the categories were positive from a volume point of view.
The other thing one has to say, and I spent three days down there not so long ago, is there is quite a bit of short-term
disruption in the marketplace. The economy slows down. You have the various scandals unfolding day-after-day.
Interest rates go up. And what happens is the indirect retailers take a step back and wait to see how everything is going
to settle out. So there is an added element, I would say, of short-term hesitation in terms of the way the market would
normally line up. But as I said earlier, our focus is going to be on growing market share, controlling our costs,
expanding gross margin and weathering what we believe will be a slower Brazil environment for the balance of this
year.

And we'll move on to our next question from Mark Astrachan with Stifel.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hey, Mark.
<Q - Mark S. Astrachan>: Hey, Ian. Good morning, everyone. So, two questions, one, just wanted to get an update on
the Tom's of Maine expansion, any sort of thoughts thus far, bigger opportunity, smaller opportunity than maybe you
had thought originally. And then housekeeping, is there any impact on cash uses, CapEx, share repo, dividends, etc.
from FX?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: The Tom's business is doing very well. The first quarter organic growth was up double-digits. We
have, as you know, an extremely strong position in oral care, toothpaste, in the United States, over a 50% market share
in the channels that are unique to Tom's. And that's why, as Bina said, we have taken the opportunity, now that we have
consolidated our position in toothpaste to extend the Tom's name into the baby skin health space, which we think will
be a big opportunity for Tom's going forward. As I have said before, this is not a marketing-accelerated business. You
have to win consumers one at a time and be patient. But once they are Tom's consumers, they're Tom's consumers
forever. And they almost pledge allegiance to the brand, which we may have them do one day.
In terms of cash usage, no major change in CapEx or repurchase, no major change.
