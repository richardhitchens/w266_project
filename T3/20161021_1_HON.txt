David M. Cote
Good morning, everyone.
As we previewed during our update call two weeks ago, for the third quarter we reported earnings per share of $1.60 or
$1.67 excluding the $0.07 we deployed to restructuring. We expect to return to double-digit EPS growth in the fourth
quarter, which yields our full-year EPS growth target of 8% to 9% that we communicated on of October 7.
Q3 was a quarter of important changes in many areas that position the company for better performance next year. These
include the split of the former Automation and Control Solutions segment, ACS, the acquisition of Intelligrated, the
sale of our Government Services business, HTSI [Honeywell Technology Solutions Inc.], and the spin of Resins and
Chemicals. Combined with nearly $250 million in restructuring actions, these changes are lasting improvements to the
portfolio that yield benefits beginning in the fourth quarter and into 2017, when we expect year-over-year benefits
exceeding $175 million from the restructuring actions alone.
In the fourth quarter, we'll lap the impact of our U.S. Postal Service project in Productivity Solutions, the UOP return to
growth, and expect the continued ramp of our Solstice low global warming product sales. Darius [Adamczyk] and Tom
will provide more details about 2017 during our annual outlook call in December, where we have a favorable setup, the
fourth quarter momentum continues, our long-cycle businesses are improving, and our inflections start to kick in.
It remains a slow growth environment, but we've continued to invest heavily in the business in capital projects, research
and development, hiring salespeople, winning content on new aerospace platforms, improving our growth profile
through strategic M&A and divestitures, and executing on restructuring projects to improve our fixed cost position.
With all the work we've done to improve the growth profile, our continued emphasis on the Honeywell Operating
System, and our performance culture, we are well positioned for long-term growth and are committed to creating
long-term shareholder value.
On October 7, we communicated all the changes or moving parts that occurred in the quarter. In our attempt to lend
transparency to all the moving parts, we lost sight of the importance of conveying our confidence in our future in the
fourth quarter 2017 and beyond. For that miscommunication, I take full responsibility.
Last week, we released a number of charts explaining why we were confident in our future. We've included several of
those charts in this morning's package because we wanted to explain a bit behind each of them. We've continued to
invest heavily, seed planting if you will, and the returns will be there. We've outperformed historically and will
continue to do so. We largely discussed third quarter a couple weeks ago, so much of today's presentation focuses on
the future and why we think Honeywell is an exciting place for you to be.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Tom.
Thomas A. Szlosek
Thanks, Dave, and good morning. I'm now on slide three with a quick recap of our third quarter results.
Reported sales of $9.8 billion increased 2%, primarily reflecting the impact of acquisitions. On a core organic basis,
sales were down 3%. Our growth was led by Process Solutions, Transportation Systems, and Home and Building
Technologies, but was more than offset by softness in business jets, Defense & Space, Productivity Solutions, and
UOP. The softness in UOP has moderated throughout the year to the extent that in the fourth quarter, we expect high
single-digit sales growth in that business.
The decline in segment margins in the quarter reflects the impact of OEM incentives, M&A integration costs, and the
lower volumes, partially offset by benefits from previously funded restructuring.
Earnings per share were up 4% to $1.67 excluding the restructuring charge deployed from the retroactive portion of the
stock compensation accounting change. The individual restructuring projects in the third quarter have an average
payback of about two years and provide attractive accretion in both 2017 and 2018.

Free cash flow in the quarter was $1.3 billion. That's 103% conversion on net income. We continued to put substantial
capital to work for our shareowners. Our CapEx reinvestment ratio was 150% this quarter. And we bought back
approximately $1.9 billion worth of Honeywell shares through the end of the third quarter.
Let me move on to slide four to discuss the segment performance. In Aero, the sales decline is consistent with what we
previewed. The negative 6% headline number reflects the softness we described in our business jet OEM revenues and
in Defense & Space, but also to a larger degree the increase in OEM incentives. I'll discuss the incentives more later.
But in the third quarter, the year-over-year increase in OEM incentives drove 4% of the minus 6% decline in the top
line growth for Aerospace. Excluding the impact of OEM incentives, the Commercial Aviation OEM business was
down 8%, with the business jet softness being partially offset by steady growth in air transport.
Our Commercial Aftermarket business was up 1% on a core organic basis. We're seeing continued repair and overhaul
demand within air transport. But the softness in the business jet market is impacting the aftermarket, and we've seen
fewer engine repair and overhaul events as a result.
Defense & Space was down 6% on a core organic basis, driven by program completions in U.S. space and international
defense and lower volumes for commercial helicopters, primarily related to oil and gas. While disappointing, we are
encouraged by the double-digit increase in Defense & Space year-to-date orders and backlog although, as you can
appreciate, much of that activity is longer-term in nature, extending into 2017 and beyond.
Transportation System sales increased 3% organically in the quarter, driven by new program launches in light vehicles
gas segment, where we saw growth of nearly 20%.
Aerospace segment margins were down, reflecting the increase in OEM incentives and lower volumes.
In Home and Building Technologies, sales were up 5% on a core organic basis, driven by growth in both products and
distribution businesses. The products business grew 1% organically thanks to more than 15% growth in China and
strength in the Americas Environmental and Energy Solutions business. The distribution business was up 8%
organically in the quarter, driven by continued strength in the global distribution business and energy and services
contracts within Building Solutions. The segment margin rate declines excluding the impact of M&A were primarily
due to the mix of products versus distribution revenues this quarter.
In Performance Materials and Technologies, sales were down 3% on a core organic basis, driven by UOP, partially
offset by strong global mega-project conversion in Process Solutions, which was up 3% organically. UOP sales were
down 10% on a core organic basis, driven primarily by declines in gas processing and licensing and partially offset by
higher catalyst shipments. Notably, UOP's backlog was up 15% at the quarter end. Demand for our catalysts continue
to be strong, driven by reloads as a result of increased refinery turnarounds.
Advanced material sales were down 2% on a core organic basis, as demand for our Solstice line of low global warming
materials within fluorine products continues to be strong, partially offsetting the significant market pricing headwinds
within resins and chemicals. These resins and chemicals headwinds are obviously now behind us as a result of the
AdvanSix spin.
EMT segment margin was up 80 basis points to 21.6%, driven by strong productivity and cost controls, higher catalyst
shipments, and the favorable impact of acquisition integrations.
Finally, in Safety and Productivity Solutions, sales were down 8% on a core organic basis. The Safety business was
down 3%, primarily due to softness in the general Personal Protective Equipment business and lower demand for retail
products. The Productivity Solutions business was down 12% on a core organic basis due to a tough comparison with
the third quarter of 2015 and continued channel headwinds in Productivity Solutions. We will not face the U.S. Postal
Service headwind next quarter, as we've said. Segment margin was down 90 basis points excluding M&A to 15.2%,
primarily reflecting the lower volumes.
Slide five shows our path to the fourth quarter EPS of $1.74 to $1.78. It's very consistent with what we have previously
articulated a couple weeks ago. We expect UOP to grow at high single digits on a core organic basis, driving significant

sequential quarter-to-quarter EPS improvement. Catalyst sales are expected to be up about 20% in the quarter, and
licensing and equipment sales will be up about 15%. Additionally, in Process Solutions, we expect to see the normal
fourth quarter pickup in our short-cycle products and services businesses.
We continue to closely monitor the oil and gas market, but all in all our outlook has improved. We expect a 2% to 3%
improvement from Safety and Productivity Solutions and $0.03 to $0.04 from restructuring. I spoke earlier about the
rapid paybacks we expect on the restructuring we funded in the third quarter. All in, we have a funded pool of more
than $400 million in restructuring projects.
All other is a $0.05 to $0.06 headwind, reflecting the removal of Resins and Chemicals and the Government Services
business from the portfolio, the normal one-time M&A costs on Intelligrated, and an expected lower number of option
exercises, resulting in lower income tax benefits. This works to a Q4 earnings range of $1.74 to $1.78 per share. That's
a 10% to 13% increase from the same period in 2015.
Let's turn to slide six to provide some further color on our fourth quarter outlook. We expect that sales declines in
Aerospace will continue into the fourth quarter, particularly in business jets and Defense & Space. We expect our total
commercial OEM business to be down nearly 20%, with growth in air transport and regional more than offset by
declines in business and general aviation. In our aftermarket business, repair and overhaul will moderate slightly on
lower events and lower aircraft utilization, while growth in spares should be steady, primarily due to the new JetWave
installations and channel and customer demand. The backlog in Defense & Space, as I said, is improving as we head
into the fourth quarter, but we still expect the business to be down in the mid-single-digit range on lower volumes
globally.
And finally, in Transportation Systems, we see continued global gas turbo penetration offset by slower diesel
penetration, which will drive flat to slightly higher core organic sales in the quarter.
In HBT, we expect organic growth in the low single-digit range in both the products and distribution businesses. But
reported growth is much higher, reflecting the Elster Smart Energy business, where we have significant rollouts in the
UK and expected strength in the Americas gas business.
On the product side, sales in the Environmental and Energy Solutions business will continue to improve, driven by new
product introductions in the Americas and strong double-digit growth in China and India.
In the distribution segment, which consists of the global distribution business and Building Solutions, we expect strong
backlog conversion, specifically in our energy business. And in EMEA and China, our global distribution business will
grow at a slower rate due to very tough comps from the fourth quarter of 2015, when this business grew nearly 12%.
Market expansion will be driven mostly by productivity net of inflation, the benefits of restructuring, higher volumes,
and commercial excellence, offset slightly by the impact of the Elster acquisition.
In PMT, we see a return to growth in UOP, driven by continued strong orders. Orders were up 9% in the third quarter,
particularly in the catalyst business. We also see some traction on the equipment side. Our orders over the past three
months were over $700 million, and we're expecting a similar amount in the fourth quarter.
Importantly, we see oil prices stabilizing in the $50 range. Generally, activity is picking up across the globe, including
in China, and some projects that had been delayed or stalled are now resuming. Our year-to-date book-to-bill is 1.1 and
was closer to 1.3 in the third quarter. And our win rates across all lines of business in UOP are strong. UOP should
grow by high single digits in the fourth quarter as a result.
In Process Solutions, sales will be down in the mid-single-digit range on lower mega-project sales growth. However,
this should improve in 2017 as we replenish the backlog on anticipated healthy project orders in the fourth quarter.
Finally, in Advanced Materials, core organic sales growth will be north of 10%, driven by Solstice, which will grow
considerably this quarter, and from higher volumes in specialty products across all lines of business. The significant
increase in segment margin will be driven by the higher catalyst shipment content, the volume growth in fluorine
products from Solstice, and the favorable margin impact from the spinoff of AdvanSix.

In Safety and Productivity Solutions, we're finally past the headwinds associated with the U.S. Postal Service
deployment. And as a result, we expect the business will be flat to slightly down in the fourth quarter, which represents
a nearly 800 basis point improvement sequentially. This is also supported by a slightly easier setup in industrial safety,
driven by prior-year oil and gas related declines. We should see things improve overall from here, especially with the
addition of Intelligrated which we continue to be very excited about. We've taken aggressive cost actions to address the
slowdown in the third quarter. The should provide additional runway for margin expansion in the fourth quarter and
into 2017.
With more than 1.9 billion share repurchases this year, our share count will be approximately 1% lower in the fourth
quarter. And finally, as a result of last quarter's adoption of the stock compensation accounting standard, we now
expect that our tax rate will be approximately 25% in the fourth quarter and about 24.5% for the full year.
Let's turn to slide seven to discuss our expected full-year segment margin. On a reported basis, we expect be down
approximately 70 basis points, but this belies the significant operational improvement we expect to deliver,
approximately 80 basis points. We continue to realize volume leverage in our growth segments and work with our
suppliers to drive down material costs. Additionally, by deploying the Honeywell Operating System and our
restructuring capacity, we continue to reduce our fixed costs throughout the enterprise, including in our plants and our
administrative functions. These are permanent improvements in our cost structure that will drive significant margin
expansion as growth more fully permeates the portfolio.
Offsetting this operational goodness are the upfront effects of investments we're making to improve the future. You'll
recall that we are completing the first year of our nine recent acquisitions. This first year is heavily burdened by costs
for inventory accounting, amortization of intangibles, deal costs, and integration costs. This will be an approximate 50
basis points headwind this year. OEM incentives are a 60-basis-point headwind. I have a later slide on what these OEM
incentives mean for our future growth. But given the conservative accounting we deploy in this area, we're
experiencing a $0.25 EPS headwind in 2016 that will not repeat.
Finally, the foreign currency movement from 2015, principally the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, has driven
approximately 40 basis points of margin rate headwind. Based on our hedging positions, we expect this to turn to a
similar sized benefit in 2017.
So as you can see, we expect to end the year with segment margin at 18.1%, but are well positioned for 2017, as the
favorable operational impacts from the Honeywell Operating System continue and the impact from the other factors
recedes or flips around.
I'm now on slide eight. We're reaffirming our full-year EPS growth target of 8% to 9%, or $6.60 to $6.64 excluding the
anticipated fourth quarter pension mark-to-market adjustment of about $1.5 billion. This is based on current discount
rates and asset return assumptions as of September 30 and is driven primarily by the decline in interest rates. The sales
and segment margin guidance you see here is consistent with the preview from October 7. With a lower than
anticipated net income, principally in Aerospace, we now expect that free cash flow will be between $4.2 billion and
$4.3 billion for the full year.
Slide nine summarizes the end market dynamics that we anticipate in 2017 versus what we are experiencing this year.
First, in Homes and Buildings, we'll continue to see steady growth, driven by new product introductions, connected
offerings, and the expansion of our installed base. Next, the dynamics we described for Commercial Aviation will
continue in 2017, including declines in business jet market, steady performance in air transport driven by program
ramp-ups, including on the A350 platform, and a reasonably stable aftermarket. What will change in Commercial
Aviation is that the massive 2016 headwinds from OEM incentives will become a modest tailwind.
We expect the declines in Defense & Space will moderate a bit in 2017, but we anticipate that demand in our
Commercial Helicopter and Domestic Space businesses will continue to be slow. We'll no longer have the impact from
our Government Services businesses following the sale of HTSI. And in addition, our long-cycle backlogs are
improving, as I noted earlier. More than three-quarters of our expected fourth quarter sales are firm, which is above
where we were at this point heading into the third quarter.

To moderate the effects of the overall declines in Aerospace, we've made significant improvements to our cost structure
while investing for growth, including in sales head count, research and development, and in new products like JetWave.
We anticipate stronger performance in our businesses that serve the industrial and workers end market. We'll no longer
have the U.S. Postal Service comp, and Intelligrated will contribute to growth. We also expect our Safety sales will
improve over the course of the year.
The vehicles market will continue to be strong, with increasing global penetration of turbos and growth in light vehicle
gas applications. We also expect modest improvements on the commercial vehicle side in 2017. And on a global basis,
we expect turbo penetration to be approximately 40%.
Lastly, Advanced Materials will be a strong contributor, highlighted by more than 25% growth in our Solstice product.
Solstice is meeting or exceeding all expectations and is expected to be about a $1 billion business for us by 2020.
Let me turn to slide 10 for a preview of 2017. We've not finalized our 2017 planning. And as Dave said, Darius and I
will provide a full update in December upon the completion of the process. We expect a continued slow growth
environment, but also believe that the inflections we've mentioned are still intact to enable us to grow faster than the
markets we serve. With that said, we're taking a conservative approach to the planning framework, specifically relative
to business jets, Defense & Space, and commercial helicopters. While we're targeting double-digit EPS growth, we're
not counting on a recovery in these specific end markets to achieve that. We continue to work on the things we can
control, and we see the result of this in the forecasted 45 to 75 basis points improvement in the margins on low
single-digit core organic sales growth.
Still, we're constantly pressed on why we feel confident in our ability to deliver in 2017, so let's spend a few minutes
explaining the rationale underlying our outlook. Let me move to slide 11. First off, we've continued to deploy large
amounts of shareowner capital. We've increased our dividend 15% in each of the last two years. And including the $0.5
billion of value created through the spinoff of AdvanSix, that's nearly $2.4 billion of dividends alone in 2016. And
we're committed to further growing the dividend faster than our rate of earnings growth.
On share repurchase, we've been very active in 2016 and have already matched our total repurchases for all of last year.
You'll recall that it takes about $1 billion of repurchases each year to keep our share count flat, and we've been doing
twice that amount.
M&A activity has significantly accelerated over the last 18 months. For the past few quarters, we've been dealing with
the incremental acquisition and amortization costs from these deals. And as that begins to roll off, the contribution from
this M&A will really be felt. And the M&A benefits do not even take into account the sales and commercial synergies
we expect from combining sales forces, leveraging Honeywell's channels and high-growth regions, and from general
commercial excellence that we drive in our own businesses. Needless to say, we expect M&A will be a significant
value driver in 2017 and for many years to come.
Slide 12 recaps the deals we've completed. Each of these businesses participates in an attractive fast-growing market
where they are perceived as leaders in their space. They're accretive to Honeywell's growth rates. We believe there's a
big opportunity for us to expand a number of these businesses into high-growth regions, given the Honeywell presence,
leadership teams, and infrastructure already in place. Many of these businesses also have a strong technology and
software component, and that will drive superior growth and improving gross and segment margins. I also don't want to
lose the point that we continue to find strong new talent through our acquisition that makes the combined companies
better and further drives our software and technology initiatives.
Let me turn to slide 13. We've talked extensively about OEM incentives. What you need to remember is, one, they're
investments that have gotten us on a number of attractive new business jet and air transport platforms that build upon
our already strong installed base. Two, we expense these incentives to our P&L as they're incurred, a more conservative
treatment than most of our peers. Three, there's a very clear visibility to the incentives. They're negotiated years in
advance, and any accelerated recognition of the cost does not change the aggregate cost, only the timing of the
recognition, as you saw in the third quarter. And lastly, 2016 is our peak for these investments. They're still significant,
but they begin to decline in 2017, as you can see on the chart. We're excited about the extensions to our Aerospace

franchise that these investments are enabling.
You can see on slide 14 some of the other investments that we've made to grow our business. We've talked extensively
over the past few years about our capital expenditures. We have been investing at about 1.6 times depreciation for the
last several years. The returns on the incremental investments like Solstice are phenomenal, twice that of any M&A
deal we could do. And while they do temporarily dilute free cash flow, the investments are essential to our growth.
We're nearing completion of this investment cycle, after which we expect the reinvestment rate to normalize between
1.0 and 1.2 times depreciation.
We also continue to invest in research and development at a rate that's approximately 7.5% of sales, including R&D,
that's customer funded. Our R&D is fueling the next generation of Honeywell products, including our software
offerings.
And to ensure we have enough feet on the street to win in our end markets, we're also investing heavily in our sales
force. You may think of this as a short-term investment, but it's not. A salesperson really isn't productive enough in his
first year on the job, so we have to ensure we have enough sales employees in place today to support tomorrow's
business. The same applies in our high-growth regions, where our head count has grown nearly 14% in the last three
years, and we have funded more than $260 million of restructuring so far this year.
Slide 15 has more detail about capital investments in Performance Materials and Technologies. These projects add
capacity to our highly profitable businesses like Solstice within fluorine products and catalysts within UOP. They
deliver returns in the 30% to 40% range, and we expect more than $1 billion in sales in Solstice revenues per year by
2020. After that, and this is timely, we'll see additional demand generated by the Kigali amendment to the Montréal
Protocol, which was just agreed to this week. In UOP, we continue to add catalyst capacity in the U.S. and abroad to
support our large installed base in both refining and petrochemical segments.
On slide 16, we profile another breakthrough technology that we're investing in, connected aircraft. Our vision is to
create a fast, seamless online experience for passengers, pilots, and operations staff on the ground. To supplement our
core product, we've invested in M&A in this space with EMS, Aviaso, Satcom1, and COM DEV, and those
investments are beginning to pay off. With COM DEV's content on 95% of commercial satellites, we have insight into
the networks and services that are going to be needed for connectivity now and in the future. EMS and Satcom1
provide us with antenna, modem, and router technology, which is helping us to optimize the way data travels through
the aerospace ecosystem, providing our customers with incremental value versus the competition.
Lastly, Aviaso provides the software and data analytics necessary to serve airlines, and we have recent wins with
Etihad Airways, Finnair, and Lufthansa Cargo to support this. With all these capabilities, we are now able to supply an
aircraft with a big data pipe, JetWave, that is 1,000 times faster and costs 20 times less per [ph] mega weight (27:14)
than the previous systems. No one has the solution that we do with JetWave. Combined with our legacy expertise
around avionics, mechanical equipment, and services, we're positioned to win in the emerging $7 billion connected
aircraft space. As you heard Tim [Mahoney] say, we anticipate that the connected aircraft business will be larger than
$1 billion for us by 2020.
Let's turn to slide 17 to talk about another great position in a good industry, turbochargers. As you've heard us say
before, we're in the golden age of turbos. Turbocharger adoption continues to be driven by regulations around fuel
economy and emissions. To comply, automakers are downsizing engines. But to preserve engine performance, they
look to our technology, which provides 30% more torque, 25% greater fuel efficiency, and 20% lower carbon dioxide
emissions.
In the graph on the right, you can see that these factors are driving incredible growth in penetration. Today, more than
one-third of all vehicles have a turbocharger, and by 2020 we anticipate roughly half of all vehicles will have one on
board. And every year when we look at our data, our long-term forecast for turbo penetration improves. This is a
fantastic growth story for us both in the short term and long term, particularly as adoption of our light vehicle gas
applications continues to ramp up. We continue to win more than 40% of the OEM platform competitions globally.

Slide 18 highlights another aspect of why we're still well positioned for the future, our software capability. We've been
developing software for a long time, much longer than the industrial Internet of Things became popular. More than half
of our 23,000 engineers globally are developing software. More than 75% of our HOS Gold breakthrough goals are
software related. While our expertise has traditionally been in software that is embedded within our products, we also
have about $1 billion of highly profitable standalone software revenue, and that number is expected to grow
significantly over the next five years.
The engineers are building on our strong industrial heritage to blend physical products with software. Last year
Honeywell became the first and only large Western company to announce that it is 100% compatible with Capability
Maturity Model Integration at CMMI Level 5 across all global operations and in every business. This is a big deal. It
means we can develop products faster and at a lower cost than many of our competitors. We also continue to make
investments in our engineering base to ensure we have the best pool of talent driving the software growth at Honeywell.
Let me turn to slide 19 and talk about high-growth regions, which represent about 40% of the world GDP and
collectively are growing north of 4%. When you compare that to the other 60% of the world, which is growing at less
than 2%, it's clearly essential that we are there, and we need to be local if we're going to be successful in HGRs. We
saw these trends early and made the right investments to ensure that we get in on our fair share of growth.
Since 2003, we've increased our census in high-growth regions by 220%. Our presence is impressive, 140 offices, 70
manufacturing facilities, and over 58,000 employees. And thanks to our investments, Honeywell's business in
high-growth regions has grown at a 12% CAGR. Today, HGRs represent about a quarter of our overall sales growth.
We expect that number will continue to grow.
Slide 20 conveys the attractive trends and dynamics for the markets in which we participate. Flight hours are growing
and passengers are demanding an on-the-ground experience when it comes to connectivity. Our Aerospace business is
leading the way with JetWave. Turbo penetration is increasing. We have the global scale and industry-leading
technology that is being adopted by automakers around the world. When it comes to the Internet of Things, we have
over 11,000 engineers working on valuable software solutions that are helping our customers optimize their operations.
In high-growth regions, we're addressing demand in the world's fastest growing economies through innovative local
products and solutions.
In PMT, we've invested for growth through capital expansions. It's too early to call a recovery, but we are seeing signs
that the bottom may have been reached in oil and gas, including month-over-month improvement in rig counts and
drilled but uncompleted wells and a stabilizing oil price. We have a broad catalyst portfolio that allows us to capture a
large percentage of upcoming catalyst reloads in areas where we participate. We also have leading modular gas
processing and technology for midstream gas applications and strong positions in refining and petrochemicals.
We've also invested in capacity for Solstice, which is being rapidly adopted by automotive and building customers
throughout the world to meet the demand for low global warming products as HFCs are phased out. And nearly half of
Honeywell's current portfolio is dedicated to energy efficiency.
The future is bright for Honeywell. The people and technologies we have and the investments we have made are tied to
favorable trends in fast-growing industries. All this is going to drive future growth.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Dave.
David M. Cote
So to summarize, we've made the right investments. We've taken the right portfolio actions, and we have
industry-leading products and services in the right markets.
The future will be quite good for us. We continue to invest heavily to drive positions on winning platforms in
aerospace, in research and development to bring new breakthrough products and technologies to market, in salespeople
and repositioning, and in capacity expansions in highly profitable businesses, including UOP and fluorine products.

We'll see the benefits of this next year, 2018, and many years to come. You'll hear Darius and Tom talk a lot more
about this in the outlook call that we'll have in mid-December.
So with that, let me turn it over to Mark for Q&A.
Mark Macaluso
Hey, operator, can we go to our first question?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Scott Davis with Barclays.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Hi. Good morning, guys.
<A - David M. Cote>: Hey, Scott.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: You've had a few weeks now. We've had three weeks in October, and UOP is a pretty lumpy
business. Your confidence seems to be really high that that comes back in 4Q. Is that based on what you've actually
started to see in October, or it's just a function of the backlog there, so it should start to get released?
<A - David M. Cote>: This is mostly orders that are already there and that the guys have actually been doing a fair
amount of the production already to be able to ship into the fourth quarter. So we have a high level of confidence on
UOP. Tom, anything you want to...
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: No, the visibility to the installed base is pretty good. Much of the business is reload
activity, and we're tied at the hip with the customers.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Again, let me ask it a different way. I've covered you guys long enough to know that this stuff
gets – if something is pushed from December 20 to January 3, it wouldn't surprise me in UOP because that's just the
nature of the business. So I know you've got the orders, but your confidence in actually seeing it in 4Q versus 1Q 2017,
based on what you've seen in October, has that changed? That's what I'm trying to ask. I didn't ask it very well.
<A - David M. Cote>: No.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: No, meaning confidence is better?
<A - David M. Cote>: No, no, no, we're in the same place we were. We feel good about it. I suppose there's always
that chance that it can happen, but the lumpiness is not so much moving from that we missed a shipment as it is that
when the shipments are going to occur, and they're already planned. They've already got the orders. They're already
producing. We don't see any issues there.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay. I was just trying to get my arms around that because that's tough for us to model.
My only other question is the PMT capacity investments you've made. When you roll that stuff out and you start
producing in 2017, do you make a margin on that right away, or do you have to hit a certain level of capacity utilization
before you really start to make a margin on that?
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: There are typical startup costs, but it's a disciplined startup process, Scott. So of course, in
the first few months you're not running at full optimization, but it isn't very long after that that you do achieve the
impacts of the volume that are coming through.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay, so you're not losing money out of the gate per se. You can actually start making money
day one. But obviously, that margin ramps up when your utilization goes higher. Is that – am I...

<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: That's the expectation, yes.

<A - David M. Cote>: Thanks, Scott.
Operator
And we'll go next to Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Hey, guys. Good morning.
<A - David M. Cote>: Hey, Steve.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Funny we're talking about slippage on this call. You guys have done a pretty good job
over time of calling annual guidance over the last 10 years, so it's an interesting question. But when it comes to
Aerospace, you're exiting the year at a pretty negative trend line on organic. Is there something about the comps next
year that gives you confidence that you can hold Aero close to the flat line organic? I'm just thinking about the
direction of that business definitely suggested it should be down next year organically, just the early read on that.
<A - David M. Cote>: Let me put this in the context of total 2017 because I'm assuming that question will come up
also. We're going to plan sales conservatively based on what we're seeing this quarter, and that will include Aero being
on the more negative side when we think about business jets and commercial helicopters. So we want to make sure that
we are consistent with what we're seeing and that we're not Pollyanna-ish in any way with our sales planning. HTSI and
R&C will also be coming – the Government Services business and the Resins and Chemicals business will also be
coming out, so we'll have had three quarters of those businesses being in in 2016. They'll be out in 2017.
We also have a number of pluses. So we'll have the impact of restructuring. The Aero incentives begin to decline.
We've got the impact of all the acquisitions that we did, and you understand the first-year hit we normally take from
there. Interest expense should be a positive. UOP, SPS, Solstice, those should all be positives. And we're going to put
all this together and have a much more in-depth discussion in December after we've had a chance to go through all the
AOP planning, and Darius and Tom are going to take the lead on that. And that's why we feel comfortable in saying
that even in this slower macro and we think more difficult Aero side on biz jets and on commercial helos in particular
that we feel comfortable with the statements we've made about 2017.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: And is that...
<A - David M. Cote>: [indiscernible] (39:00), Steve, but hopefully that helps.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: No, it helps a lot and that's still embedded in the – and thanks for the follow-up, by the
way, allowing me to ask a follow-up -- and you think that's embedded in the low single-digit guidance that you're
giving? You can still grow the company even with Aero down?
<A - David M. Cote>: Yes.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Okay, and then one last question for you. When it comes to buyback and capital
allocation decisions, who's steering the ship right now? Is that collaborative with Darius? Who's making the call on
perhaps doing a bigger buyback? The stock obviously took a hit. Your presentation on Mad Money suggested it was
overdone. So who's making the call on the buyback at this stage?
<A - David M. Cote>: Well, consistent with our policy over the last 15 years, I try to make all of these decisions with
no input from anybody.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Only Dave is laughing.

<A - David M. Cote>: Of course it's collaborative. We make no decisions here without trying to get input from
everybody and making sure that everybody weighs in. So, yes, as you might imagine, we have a lot of discussion about
it. And from time to time, we let Darius out of that closet that I talked about in the last call, so we get his input on
things. It's obviously collaborative. Darius is involved. Tom is. We discuss it with the board. It's not a surprise to
anyone except maybe externally when we do announce it because we want to be thoughtful in what we do.
And the way we've always tried to run the company, not just on buyback but any decision, is that we want all the input,
all the opinions, conflicting, agreeing, whatever they are, so that at the end of the day we make the best decisions. I've
always felt like we get measured on the quality of our decisions, not on whether somebody was right or wrong from the
beginning, and that's how we handle the buyback decisions also.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Okay, thanks a lot.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: I was going to add one element to that, Steve. We're obviously subject to the blackout
periods in trading of our stock, and so that comes into play from a timing perspective. But as we've referenced in the
past, we do have some programmed 10b5-1 types of plans in place that do a modest amount of activity based on certain
levels of trading in the stock.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Yeah, that's right. You're not going to make some big splashy headline. Thanks.
<A - David M. Cote>: Thanks, Steve.
Operator
And we'll go next to Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Thanks; good morning.
<A - David M. Cote>: Hi, Nigel.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: I do want to echo the comments from Steve. It's amazing how quickly a decade of execution gets lost
in the noise, and the transparency provided around this second half miss I think is well appreciated, so I just want to say
that.
So Aerospace -- the near-term outlook is pretty ugly. Biz jets -- we all know how bad that is right now. But when do
you see the crossover point between biz jet moderating, the declines moderating, and then the ATR OE starting to pick
up? Is that a second half 2017 event, or do you think that it's earlier than that?
<A - David M. Cote>: I'd say the ATR side has actually performed fine, and we're going to continue to see things like
A350 pick up, so that's going to be a benefit to us. The biz jet side and commercial helos I would suspect are going to
continue to be a market drag for us next year. So when we put all that together, Aerospace is still going to be an
important performer for us overall. You saw a fair amount of the restructuring also occur there, and we think it's going
to be a good performer for us in the long term. But 2017 is still going to be a little bit tougher overall I think when you
put all that together.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Is it too early to have confidence in growth, or is it too touch-and-go to make that call?
<A - David M. Cote>: Are you talking about growth of the business overall?
<Q - Nigel Coe>: For 2017, yes.
<A - David M. Cote>: For 2017, we want to go through the AOP planning to make sure that we understand all the
pieces. But at this point, I think we're probably going to plan this more conservatively than less. So I'd say overall,
probably lower sales next year than this year will be the way that we'll plan for it, but we really haven't gone through all
our planning process yet.

<Q - Nigel Coe>: Understood. And as a follow-on, the $1 billion forecast of Solstice in 2020 is obviously a big
number. Can you just remind us where is the backlog right now for Solstice? What is the current revenue base? And
how do you think the Rwanda Agreement -- how do you think that expands the scope for Solstice?
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Yeah, so just rough order of magnitude, we'll probably have $400 million or so business
currently, and that continues to grow nicely, as we've said. It's more right now mobile air conditioning, which is a
brand-new segment for us. But as we continue to progress through it, we get into buildings and blowing agents and
other things, so it becomes a broader application for us.
As far as the new regulation, it remains to be seen how that agreement will impact us. But our forecasts are not
dependent upon anything that happened this past week. We do see it as potential opportunity, but we need to sort
through and fully understand those impacts post-2020.
<A - David M. Cote>: I would say, though, Nigel, it's clearly a good development, and the world's focus on low global
warming potential products makes a difference. If you take a look at the HFCs that our product replaces, HFCs are over
1,300 times worse than a single molecule of CO2. If you take a look at HFOs, our invention, it's actually 0.8 a molecule
of CO2, so like 1,500 times better than what you would see from HFCs. So it's a significant new product. There's a
recognition that HFCs do have a big impact, negative impact on global warming potential. And Solstice, our HFO, is
just a tremendous solution for it. And the faster it gets adapted, the more quickly governments will actually be working
to stem the tide of global warming. So we think it's going to be quite important.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay, great, fellows. Thanks very much.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Andrew Burris Obin>: Yes, good morning.
<A - David M. Cote>: Hi.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Hi, Andrew.
<Q - Andrew Burris Obin>: I missed the preview call because I assumed nothing bad was going to happen, so I was
out of the office, so I'm going to have a follow-up question on that.
<A - David M. Cote>: You were right.
<Q - Andrew Burris Obin>: Just on these incremental Aero incentives, my understanding is that these are in fact tied
to faster shipments to customers than previously agreed. And if that's the case, what's the impact on revenue and profit
for Aero in 2017 from taking higher incentives in 2016?
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Andrew, let me clarify that. The incentives become due and are recorded and recognized in
our financials when the milestones that govern that incentive are reached. The milestones are generally development or
performance-related milestones. They vary by customer. So for example, if you hit the first test flight or entry into
service or other types of engineering milestones, those could trigger an incentive being owed and due and it's
recognized in our financials. When you look at 2016, our P&L has been significantly burdened to the tune of $0.25, as I
said earlier, of EPS by incremental OEM incentives. Next year – this is the peak year, and it starts to tail off next year.
We get a modest tailwind, and then it really accelerates into 2018 and 2019...
<A - David M. Cote>: The tailwind.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: ...in terms of the tailwind, yes.
<Q - Andrew Burris Obin>: But I just want to understand accounting relationship. Do incentives – because my
understanding is that higher incentives do relay on hitting milestones earlier, as you say, does translate ultimately into

faster shipments to the customers. Is that the right way of thinking about it? Is there a connection?
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: It's not a direct connection because the incentives for us are largely based on the
development process and bringing the aircraft to production. And so while you might incrementally get to faster
production, you still have to have orders, you still have to have selling, and those cycle times generally are unaffected
by – our incentives are generally unaffected by those activities.
<Q - Andrew Burris Obin>: Okay, and just a follow-up question.
<A - David M. Cote>: Andrew, I should add. These are good investments for us to be making. We expense everything
as incurred. We don't put it on the balance sheet. So we take our hits as they're occurring, unlike others who put it on
the balance sheet and you see it over time. So for us, while it's painful in the short term, it sure as heck helps where
you're going in the long term. And these were decisions that we made several years ago to make sure that we were on
the right platforms with the right kinds of products and services going forward. So this is pretty smart money. It's
painful in the short term but it's smart money and positions us extremely well for the future.
<Q - Andrew Burris Obin>: Got you, and just a follow-up question on the connection between global airline
passenger and traffic and your commercial aviation aftermarket. You guys were up 1%, my understanding that global
passenger traffic was up mid-single digits. Is there a reason for the disconnect? Is there destocking, deferred
maintenance, or anything else driving the difference? Thank you.
<A - David M. Cote>: This is one that's always interesting when you look at aftermarket versus flight hours because
while flight hours develop pretty consistently over time, and they tend to go up 3% or 4% a year even in a bad time,
they'll go down for a single year and then pop back up again. So that trend is always relatively smooth. The aftermarket
stream associated with it, though, bounces around in sometimes crazy directions. If you recall the recession, for
example, where flight hours were down 3% or 4%, aftermarket was down something like 20% or 30% in that same
year. So the long-term trend is generally consistent with what those flight hours are. In the short term, it can bounce
around quite a bit, so being able to explain the difference between, say, 3% and 1% is easily within the realm of typical
variability.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: The other thing I'd add to that, Andrew, is that you've got a combination of both air
transport and business jets in that 1%. We talked a little bit about the slowdown on the business jet R&O activity. I was
going through the slides and that has contributed to this.
<Q - Andrew Burris Obin>: Thank you so much. Hopefully, we'll go back to non-eventful and good hunt quarters.
Thanks a lot, guys.
<A - David M. Cote>: Yes, it will.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Steven Winoker from Bernstein.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Thanks and good morning, all. I appreciate the patience and color through all the
questions. It's really very helpful and some parts very entertaining also. Listen, I just want to first follow up the earlier
comments on UOP and fourth quarter confidence. And the question specifically, if you look at the incremental – you've
got this 20% growth and whatnot orders on the catalyst side. Where are the incremental catalyst volumes going to? So
if you think about refining versus PET chem for that part of the growth, is there any impact at all from first wave Gulf
Coast crackers that have been delayed?
<A - David M. Cote>: Wow, that's a level of specificity, Steve. I have to say we'll have to get back to you on that one.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay. But in terms of – I think just so you know in advance that this is an investor
discussion based on just concerns about that visibility, even in those end markets for other companies, so that's where
that comes from. That would be helpful.

The second one, Dave, you'll love this, I think, just hope you're sitting on this one. It's like a bad relationship where one
bad thing happens and then all of a sudden everything else comes out. So in a lot of investor discussions I've been
certainly defending Honeywell's growth in Aerospace and margins versus the margins in Aerospace over time. The
assertion is that Honeywell somehow been has trading off growth for margin expansion when you look at specific
platform wins, and as you say in slide 13, large wins on the right platforms to accelerate growth. I'd like to give you an
opportunity to maybe address that directly to a lot of investors out there who are concerned about this from a
higher-level perspective.
<A - David M. Cote>: Yes, it's one I always wonder. So what data are they looking at when it comes to – I assume this
is a market share question, Steve.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Mostly, yes.
<A - David M. Cote>: Because if you look at the data, it actually looks very good for us. And to your point, we are
selective on the platforms that we pick. I've always been shocked at the investor reception when one of our competitors
says that they've won 32 of the last 25 competitions. And when you say geez, now they're winning over 100% of all the
competitions out there, how is that possible? And I think you're getting a little carried away with what do they count
and what do they not count.
If you take a look at our avionics performance, it's quite good, and there's future stuff that we'll end up talking about at
some point. If you take a look at the concessions that we're paying right now, for example, that you would look at that
and say that yielded a bunch of good platforms also. When you look at the amount of R&D that we spend in Aerospace,
I don't know what the heck they're pointing to when they say – it's one thing to be able to say some of this stuff. It's a
little different when you actually have to back it up, and I just have a tough time seeing it. I don't know where they're
getting it from.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay, all right. And then finally on the capital deployment front, you guys have repeated
the window or envelope that you have to work with over a few years as something on the order of $25 billion. But
there's always a big difference between what you could spend and what you will spend and when and how, obviously.
So as you look at the market now and you look at the discussions you're having with a huge pipeline that [ph] Ann
(55:42) and the company and everybody have developed, what's your level of optimism again in the types of M&A
activity that investors should be prepared for?
<A - David M. Cote>: It's always tough to predict, as we've said before, and we're going to continue to do both
divestitures and acquisitions in a way that causes us to improve the overall growth profile of the company. The
problem, of course, is you can't predict them. You can't say okay, it's $2 billion a year, $5 billion a year. It's going to be
zero one year, $6 billion another. You just don't know. So we have to take our opportunities as they arise, and we'll
continue to do that. We do have a good balance sheet. We like having that. We think that gives us the opportunity to be
smart when it comes time to doing a deal or when it comes time to having the capability to repurchase, and we'll
continue to be opportunistic on both.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay, all right, and I guess maybe just one last follow-up there. In terms of software-y
solutions stuff versus consolidating products, is everything on the table, or directing more one way?
<A - David M. Cote>: Are you saying from an acquisition perspective, Steve?
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Yes, yes.
<A - David M. Cote>: The nice thing about having so many opportunities and so many places for us to go, all the stuff
you talked about is interesting, whether it's technology, software, stuff that does a better job of connecting the
digital-physical world. So there are a lot of places for us to run here. It's really a question of what's available and is the
price right. We're still always going to be very conscious that price makes a difference. If you pay for a strategy
because the strategy is right, what ends up happening is the seller is the one who made all the money on the strategy,
not you. So we're going to continue to be thoughtful about how do we do that.

And we'll go next to Howard Rubel with Jefferies.
<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: Thank you. I'm not going to ask an Aerospace question. I think I know that market pretty
well. Instead, I'd like to talk about...
<A - David M. Cote>: Wow, I was prepared, Howard. I was prepared for that and for someday for them to actually
pronounce your last name correctly.
<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: You've taken the words out of my mouth. But I'm going to try on restructuring for a
moment because you talk about it as being a permanent change to the way in which you're going to be able to compete
and run the business. Can you give us some of the nuts and bolts behind this? Because it's a very large number and
probably is very meaningful to several of the businesses.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: You can start, Howard, with Aerospace. You know that over the course of the year because
of the volumes as well as driving HOS, we've deployed a fair amount of restructuring to that business, and a lot of that
is pretty quick turnaround kinds of paybacks. When we did the disaggregation of ACS, we also went through a
significant management spans and layers exercise. So what we tried to do was limit and reduce the number of layers
that we had from the top boss down to the lowest level person in the organization. We've also tried to increase the span
of control for each of our managers. So that also took up a bunch of the capacity that we spent in the third quarter.
And I'd say thirdly, in our supply chain, we continue to have lots of opportunities, whether it's continued integration of
acquisitions that we've done or just addressing legacy sites. We've found opportunities and still have more ahead of us
to invest in restructuring and attractive payback projects. So it's a combination of the reorganizations that we've done as
well as the continual addressing of our ISC, our supply chain.
And then the third thing I'd say is the acquisitions that we've done to achieve the cost synergies that we talk about, we
do have to apply restructuring. And again, those do deliver anywhere between 6% and 8% cost synergies on the
acquisitions. A bunch of that comes from just leveraging our sourcing agreements, but some of it is from restructuring
as well. And so those are the three principal areas. And as a result, you're seeing that 2017 tailwind from the pool of
funded projects that we have, as I said.
<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: And then the follow-up question is on software. As you are able to transition away from
selling a product but instead selling upgrades and, I'll call it, enhancements or increased applications, can you, Dave,
provide us with some – I mean, to some degree, that provides some substantial margin headwind – or opportunity
rather – or tailwind rather, margin tailwind going forward. Could you provide some context of how you've been able to
see that and what I'd call give us some hard examples because it could be quite compelling?
<A - David M. Cote>: I'm sorry, Howard. I'm not sure I followed that one. Hard examples of what exactly?
<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: For example, in avionics, instead of having to sell a box, you sell a software upgrade, and
so the software costs you a minimal amount of money and yet it enhances the value of the aircraft.
<A - David M. Cote>: Got it.
<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: Okay.
<A - David M. Cote>: I understand. And yes, you're correct. And of course, we expense all our R&D as we go along.
We don't put any of that on the balance sheet either. So we take the hits for the R&D, which can be substantial if you're

trying to develop software. But once you do and you start selling the software packages and the upgrades, so whether
it's weather radar or runway incursion or excursion possibilities, the JetWave, as you start to get into that, it is
substantial. The margin rates are significantly better.
<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: That applies not just to Aero, though. It applies, I would think, to elements of Home and
Building or Process Control. And I was just hoping maybe you can provide us with a sense of where you are today and
where you might be in three to five years in terms of just the intensity of the business change.
<A - David M. Cote>: I wouldn't put any numbers on it at this point, but your concept is absolutely correct. That is
definitely, let's say, the direction of the company and it's why we focus as much as we do on software, and I think puts
us in position for a very good future for the entire company. And we've got a bigger advantage here than anybody else
with almost half of our engineers focused on software today. It puts us in a much better position.

And we'll go next to Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.
<Q - Jeffrey Todd Sprague>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
<A - David M. Cote>: Hey, Jeff.
<Q - Jeffrey Todd Sprague>: Hey, good morning. I just want to get my head around restructuring for 2017, not
benefits of what you've already accomplished, but new actions. I think on the slide, if I interpret it correctly, you're
saying the tax rate benefit from the share accounting change will be restructured away. I'm wondering if we should
expect the same for any pension benefits that flow through on service costs. And are those the two main toggles that
would actually define what your restructuring would be next year, or is there some other expected gains or other
things? Anything you could frame there would be helpful.
<A - David M. Cote>: The way I would think about it, Jeff, is you've probably noticed that over a long period of time
we do a lot of restructuring. If we've got some kind of unusual gain, we usually use it to restructure. We take a lot
through operations generally every quarter. And it's one of those things where we want to constantly be investing, and
we're not going to run out of ideas. So I wouldn't want to go into too much detail until we've had a chance to go through
all our AOP planning. But I would be surprised if next year we didn't also have additional restructuring ideas as we
went along and that we'll find a way to fund them.
<Q - Jeffrey Todd Sprague>: [ph] So you (1:05:16) say it's a meaningfully not lower number though than 2016?
<A - David M. Cote>: In 2016, of course, we had a big boost as we figured out how to do the additional restructuring
in the third quarter. I wouldn't anticipate that we do something that big again next year, but you never know. As you
know, I never say never on any of this stuff. But the whole idea of how do you just constantly have a good pipeline of
ideas and find a way to fund the really good ones so that you do the seed planting for the future, that's something we're
going to continue doing.
<Q - Jeffrey Todd Sprague>: And just back to the OEM incentives maybe one more time, obviously the accounting is
very conservative. Just wonder if you could give us a little thought though on the return metrics as you think about
making the investments, right? Obviously, the ultimate success or failure of the investment is going to depend on the
commercial success of the airplane and units sold and all that. But what kind of return thresholds do you use when you
think about these investments, and what kind of cushion versus weighted average cost of capital or whatever metric you
use to decide if you pull the trigger on this sort of stuff?

<A - David M. Cote>: I guess there are a couple of things that we end up looking at. I won't put a specific number on
the return because I just don't think that's a good thing to say in public out there, but this has to be a high return project,
the same sort of thing that we look at for any internal investment because that's what it is. And that's why we pay so
much attention to what platform is it and what do we really think is going to happen.
We don't just take say an external look or the customers' look at what do they think it's going to be. We really go
through this ourselves to say what do we really think is possible here and how do we make sure that this is going to
generate a good return for the company. I'd say our guys do a pretty good job of this so that we pick the right platforms.
And when you see the concessions that we are paying, it's been so that we could do that. So these are going to be high
return, very good IRR projects and platforms that we're on. We're pretty confident of that based on what we've done
and what we see.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Jeff, the way I think of it is we have a very disciplined process when it comes to
considering whether we compete for a new platform that's a potential opportunity for us. It's as disciplined as an M&A
process, so we consider all of the investments. These incentives are one aspect of that. There's a lot of engineering time
and project management time that also goes into the outflows or the investments that you're making. And then of
course, you consider all the future revenues and the models and so forth. So it's as disciplined as M&A. And as Dave
said, we have internal returns that we look to as the hurdles, and we'll go ahead with the ones that do meet those
attractive hurdle rates.
<A - David M. Cote>: And for what it's worth, Jeff, we're very conscious of the time value of money.
<Q - Jeffrey Todd Sprague>: Okay; great. I appreciate it. Thank you.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Thanks, Jeff.
<A - David M. Cote>: Thanks, Jeff.

And we'll go next to Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Joseph Ritchie>: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
<A - David M. Cote>: Hey, Joe.
<Q - Joseph Ritchie>: Hey. So my first question is on slide seven, when you take a look at your margin bridge for next
year and you see all the headwinds that are basically going away, it's about 150 basis points. You're doing a bunch of
restructuring this year. You think growth is going to get better next year. And yet where the planning for next year is 45
to 75 basis points, it seems really conservative. Just what am I missing here?
<A - David M. Cote>: I would say we think we've provided a lot of color commentary on 2017 at this point, more than
we normally ever would. And I would just say stay tuned for the December outlook call. We'll go through a lot more
detail then with Darius and Tom to be able to explain what do we see and why. And we're going to be very conscious
of having gotten burned on the macro environment this year. And as conservative as I thought we were being in the
beginning, we weren't conservative enough. So we're going to want to make sure that as we pull together a plan for
2017 that it's one that never ends up with the kind of sales surprise that we ended up taking this year.
<Q - Joseph Ritchie>: No, that's fair, Dave, and definitely good to be conservative into next year. Maybe what my one
follow-up is really just on the M&A that you've done. Tom, I think you had mentioned on the prior call that the growth
was running at about high single digits, and I think the accretion was coming in towards the higher end of your range.
I'm just wondering. How much of the deal-related costs, the inventory step-up, how much of those costs go away next
year? And then are we still running at those same growth and EPS rates for this year?

<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: First, if you look at the deals that we've integrated this year, most of them were closed in
the fourth quarter or the first quarter, and yes, you had a lot of startup costs, particularly the first three quarters of this
year. Intelligrated, which we closed in late August, will add to those one-time startups. But net-net, when you consider
amortization and inventory accounting and the other things, the year-over-year impact will be favorable on those deals.
But the more important thing is that the operations and the cost synergies that we get typically start to ramp in the
second half of the first year into the second year, and that's where you start to see the margin rate improvement. So
we'll go through the details in December, but this should be a nice contributor to what we have for 2017.
<Q - Joseph Ritchie>: Okay; fair enough. Thanks, guys.
Operator
And we'll take our last question from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.
<Q - Christopher Glynn>: Wow; thanks. I'll give my two up front. Dave, has your – hey, Dave -- had a question on
your sales employee census data up 10%. Didn't look like it grew much in 2015 despite higher M&A, so the increase
looks like a big organic component. I'm just wondering where the raw head count is and where it's especially ROI
sensitive.
And then my second question would be probably a follow-on to Joe's. If you could, quantify what the purchase
accounting burden is in 2016 in terms of EPS.
<A - David M. Cote>: On the first one on salespeople, a lot of those have been deployed to what we refer to as
high-growth regions. And the reason for highlighting it, of course, is that when you hire salespeople, there's training
and familiarization that has to go on, so they're not immediately productive. It's the sort of thing that shows up in the
future. It's difficult to quantify at this point what that's worth to us say next year and the year after, but it's another
investment where we take the expense up front because of course you've got to pay them while the sales numbers they
deliver aren't quite enough to pay for themselves in those first years. So this is a good thing for us to be doing, a good
way for us to expand our high-growth region presence. But it's the sort of thing that's another investment for the future
for us.
On the restructuring side, I know we've shared some data – not restructuring.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Purchase accounting.
<A - David M. Cote>: Purchase accounting. But, Tom, I don't know that I want to go through much more than what
we've already disclosed here.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: I think we keep it at an overall contribution. For 2016, M&A we guided at $0.05 to $0.15
of overall contribution to EPS, and that is an all-in number that takes into account all of those one-time costs as well as
the pure operations. In 2017, you can expect that to be a bigger number as a result of a lot of those costs going away. So
you can calibrate it when we provide that in December.
<Q - Christopher Glynn>: All right, see you in December.
<A - David M. Cote>: All right. Thanks, Chris.

Yes, thank you. On October 7, we went out of our way to be transparent. With our focus on transparency, I lost sight of
how important it was to also convey our confidence in the future. Hopefully, our confidence in that future came across
today. So we look forward to sharing more with you in our December outlook call. Thank you.
