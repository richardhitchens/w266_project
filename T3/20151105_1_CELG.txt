As a reminder, during today's call we will be making forward-looking statements regarding our financial outlook in
addition to regulatory and product development plans. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may
cause actual results to differ from those forecasted. A description of these risks can be found in our most recent 10-Q
on file with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date, and we undertake no duty to update or revise
them.
Reconciliations of the adjusted financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available as part of the
earnings release.
I would now like to turn the call over to Bob.
Robert J. Hugin
Thank you, Patrick, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. As noted in Patrick's introduction, Scott
Smith is not with us this morning due to his mother's death. Our thoughts and prayers are with him and his family.
I appreciate the opportunity to review our progress with you today. The third quarter was very strong for Celgene both
operationally and strategically, continuing our outstanding year-to-date performance. Our teams are driving robust sales
growth, securing important regulatory and reimbursement approvals, and significantly advancing our pipeline.
Revenue growth of 18% and adjusted EPS growth of 27% evidence the meaningful momentum we have in our
businesses. We're delivering these results in spite of foreign exchange headwinds, seasonal buying patterns, and the
dilutive impact of recent business development activities. The significant advances in our clinical programs and the
important transactions completed during this quarter bode extremely well for our future. In a few minutes, the rest of
the team will review the results of the quarter and our outlook for the remainder of the year.
Every year at this time, we conduct an in-depth strategic planning review. I thought it would be useful for me to spend
a few minutes summarizing this review. We have a clear, focused, and aligned mission and vision, which is to discover,
develop, and deliver transformational therapies to patients with unmet medical needs. Our review has revalidated our
strategy of building value-added franchises, fueled by internal programs and innovative collaborations which drive
near-term and long-term opportunities for significant growth.
In addition to affirming our mission, vision, and strategy, we have rigorously reviewed our operating strategies and
performance. Our global operating model continues to deliver tremendous value and provides the foundation for
sustained high growth. Though we'll continue to refine our global organizations, which commercialize our products in
more than 70 countries, our investments are virtually completed.
We've also reviewed our financial strategies to ensure that our resources are allocated optimally for investments in
internal programs, business development opportunities, and assertive management of our capital structure. We are
committed to being vigilant stewards of our financial assets.
A significant focus of this process was to ensure that the key drivers of our 2020 and longer-term growth targets are in
place. Our recent comprehensive review of current programs and near-term pipeline has strengthened our conviction
and our ability to deliver on the 2020 targets. You'll hear about a number of the drivers that fuel our optimism on our
2020 outlook from Jackie, Terrie, and Mark.
As we look out beyond 2020, we are incredibly excited about the future we are building for Celgene. Our organic
pipeline and strategic collaborations are laying an impressive foundation for the development of disruptive
paradigm-changing therapies.
By the end of next year, we expect to initiate over 50 new clinical trials, doubling the number of our Phase III
registration studies, and advancing between 10 and 15 new compounds to the clinic. This acceleration of our pipeline
fueled by organic growth and the positive results achieved through numerous collaborations and acquisitions, including
the 20 we have completed year to date, offers us the potential for more than 30 new compound approvals over the next
10 years. We look forward to providing more clarity on the extraordinary potential of our pipeline over the coming

months.
This review of our strategic positioning, operating performance, and pipeline potential highlights the exceptional
near-term, mid-term, and long-term promise of our programs. We're incredibly energized by the opportunity to turn this
enormous promise into reality for patients. The state of Celgene is strong, and our future is exceptionally bright.
Thank you. Let me now turn the call over to Peter.
Peter N. Kellogg
Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everyone.
Q3 was another excellent quarter at the top line and the bottom line, and it completes a rather active first nine months
of the year. We are building upon this solid foundation of operational performance by making strategic investments in
critical areas of research and further strengthening our internal pipeline through business development.
Since the beginning of this year, we have entered into strategic immuno-oncology collaborations with AstraZeneca and
Juno in addition to broadening our footprint in the IBD space with the completion of the Receptos acquisition. These
programs combined with our internal pipeline represent exciting next-generation growth drivers that are expected to
meaningfully contribute to growth beyond 2020. We are able to make these investments for the future given our current
operating momentum and the strength of our balance sheet.
So let's turn to the operating performance. As you see in our third quarter results, total net product sales grew 18% to
approximately $2.3 billion. The growth was driven by exceptional performances from REVLIMID,
POMALYST/IMNOVID, and OTEZLA. Jackie and Terrie will provide more color on the underlying market dynamics
for these products later on the call.
Strong demand for our key products is driving volume growth, which accounted for 16 percentage points of our 18%
net product sales growth. In other words, volume growth drove nearly 90% of our revenue performance. There was also
a negative 1.5% ForEx impact of approximately $30 million. Based on the year-to-date trends, we are fine-tuning our
full-year sales guidance. We now expect REVLIMID net sales of approximately $5.8 billion and net ABRAXANE
sales of $950 million to $1 billion.
Third quarter adjusted earnings per share was $1.23, a 27% increase over prior year, reflecting continued acceleration
in growth as we deliver a leveraged P&L. You may notice that we reported a GAAP earnings loss of $0.04 per share,
which is largely due to the accounting-related charges in our Q3 transactions for Juno, Receptos, and Nurix. A full
reconciliation between our adjusted and our GAAP earnings is provided in our earnings press release.
Moving to the P&L, in the third quarter our P&L dynamics were great. As we indicated in our last earnings call, our
top line momentum is indeed creating natural leverage on the SG&A line. And gross margin was favorably impacted
by product mix, as REVLIMID, POMALYST/IMNOVID, and OTEZLA combined for a larger percentage of total
sales. These P&L shifts improved our adjusted operating margin by 250 basis points to 54.5%. We achieved this
improvement while consolidating about a month's worth of Receptos' operations within our financial results.
Looking forward to our expectations for the full-year P&L, we continue to expect the full-year adjusted operating
margin to be approximately 52%. As our pipeline grows, we anticipate R&D to grow in Q4 and in 2016, driven by
increased clinical trial activity, especially as we initiate the Phase III trials for GED-0301, a broad clinical program for
durvalumab across a range of hematologic malignancies, and the Phase III trials for ozanimod in both MS and UC.
In addition, we will see collaboration-related expenses such as milestone payments for the initiation of Phase III
programs for luspatercept, AG-221, and potentially for some other rapidly developing programs. Finally, the Receptos
operations will be in our organization fully each quarter going forward.
Now regarding taxes, a more favorable mix of U.S. versus international pre-tax income in addition to the impact of the
Receptos operating expenses and interest expense from the debt offering drove a decrease in the Q3 effective tax rate.

For the full year, we now expect the effective tax rate to be in the neighborhood of 15% to 15.5%.
Adjusted operating income was the primary driver of our bottom line results, accounting for $0.24 per share of the
year-over-year increase. The benefit from a lower effective tax rate and diluted share count was largely offset by the
increased interest expense associated with the $8 billion debt offering in early August.
Since Q3 represented a partial quarter for the new debt, the impact for a full quarter and for full-year 2016 will be
larger. Accordingly, for your thinking about 2016 modeling, we expect total interest expense will be between $480
million and $500 million.
We ended the quarter with approximately $7.5 billion in cash and marketable securities. Now throughout the course of
this year, we have already repurchased approximately $2.8 billion of Celgene shares and have $4.3 billion remaining
under our authorized stock repurchase program.
To round out our financial performance, we conservatively assess return on invested capital using reported
GAAP-based income both with and without cash in the capital base. So short term, our trailing 12-month metrics
reflects the impacts of the Juno, AstraZeneca, and Receptos strategic transactions on our GAAP income. Longer term,
we believe these investments, however, clearly create the opportunity for meaningful shareholder value creation.
In summary, the operating momentum during the first nine months puts us on track for a strong finish to the year and
provides a solid footing as we enter 2016 and, most importantly, work towards our 2020 financial targets.
We are excited about the progress within our pipeline, both internal programs that are advancing and the new programs
that we added to business development, which together further strengthen our future beyond 2020.
Thank you. Now I would like to turn the call over to my colleague, Jackie.
Jacqualyn A. Fouse
Thank you, Peter. Good morning all.
We're very pleased with our hematology/oncology 12% product sales growth this quarter or 14% excluding the impact
of negative foreign exchange. For our three key brands, REVLIMID, POMALYST/IMNOVID, and ABRAXANE
combined, Q3 growth was even higher at 16% excluding foreign exchange. Our growth continues to be mainly driven
by higher volumes coming from strong market share and duration trends.
For hematology, the global launch of REVLIMID in newly-diagnosed myeloma has been highly successful, and we'll
look at some metrics around that in just a moment. At the same time, our teams around the world continue their strong
execution with the ongoing geographic expansion of POMALYST/IMNOVID. That expansion is just beginning and
the product has a long, strong growth trajectory ahead of it. For oncology, our team is driving solid year-over-year
growth for ABRAXANE. And the product continues its international expansion, led by ongoing launches in pancreas
and lung.
In support of our mid and long-term growth objectives, we have further advanced our pipeline via internal projects as
well as collaboration programs. Luspatercept is now moving into Phase III in both MDS and beta-thalassemia. AG-221
is moving into Phase III in relapsed refractory AML. Our five Phase III REVLIMID trials in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
continue to advance. And we are very pleased with our recent approval for VIDAZA in AML in the EU. Finally, the
development program for durvalumab is moving forward with speed across multiple indications in hematology, and the
closing of the deal with Juno adds complementary access to our existing pipeline.
REVLIMID's performance is outstanding, and sales growth for the quarter was 14% excluding the impact of foreign
exchange. With this performance, we are raising our full-year guidance to $5.8 billion from the previous range of $5.6
billion to $5.7 billion. Volume growth is very strong, especially in the EU as we make our way through reimbursement
negotiations related to newly-diagnosed myeloma. With those, we are seeing modest price reductions in line with our
internal expectations.

International Q3 growth was all the more impressive given that we had no sales in Russia during this quarter after
tender revenues there in Q2, when we had our first sales via the federal tender process. Excluding Russia, international
sequential growth was plus 5% and year over year about 11%, or 16% excluding foreign exchange. It's early days for
us in the Russian tender process. And in the future we expect Russian tender sales to occur in the second and fourth
quarters each year, thereby somewhat affecting the pattern of our overall quarterly revenues.
Both share and duration trends are positive on the heels of extremely successful newly-diagnosed myeloma launches in
both the U.S. and EU. In the U.S. we achieved record daily total Rx's in Q3 and have seen a steady upward trend in
daily total Rx's throughout this year. We have gained approximately nine share points of new patient first-line share in
the U.S. in the past year and are now over 60%. This is driving all-time highs in the total number of unique patients
treated as well as strong duration trends, and we have gained about one month of average duration versus one year ago.
In the EU, we are seeing very strong early launch metrics in countries like Germany, Austria, and the Nordics, with
outstanding share uptake in first-line myeloma. At the same time, we maintain leadership in second-line and stable
share in third-line. In Germany, we have already reached over 20% first-line share in the non-stem cell transplant
setting. We just received reimbursement approval in Spain in September and are now launching there, and we still have
three major markets to come between now and Q2 of next year, so our large trajectory will continue to be strong.
Looking to the future for REVLIMID, we expect newly-diagnosed myeloma approvals before year end in both Japan
and Australia. We anticipate important triplet data presentations at ASH that will further support the backbone position
of REVLIMID in the treatment of myeloma and the treat-to-progression paradigm. And we will see our NHL program
advancing, with a data readout anticipated from the REMARC diffuse large B-cell first-line maintenance trial in early
2017.
POMALYST/IMNOVID grew globally 41% excluding foreign exchange, fueled by excellent volume growth coming
from increasing duration across all major geographies and growing shares across Europe and Japan, with highly
successful execution on our launches in those markets. In Europe, we just received our last major country
reimbursement approval for Italy in September. And in Japan, we've had rapid uptake for POMALYST with third-line
share already exceeding 20% in just a few months. The success with the POMALYST launch in Japan is setting us up
well for the coming newly-diagnosed myeloma launch for REVLIMID. Ongoing launch momentum as well as
emerging data on pomalidomide triplet regimens, where duration of treatment effects are increasing, are expected to
continue to support strong growth.
ABRAXANE's growth in international markets is excellent, driven by the ongoing launches of pancreas and lung. U.S.
Q3 sales reflect sequential customer buying patterns that we have now seen for the past couple of years as well as a
highly competitive environment, particularly in lung, as the PD-1 inhibitors are showing rapid share uptake in this
indication. In the U.S., the combination of ABRAXANE and gemcitabine has become a standard of care for first-line
de novo metastatic pancreatic cancer, and we expect this evolution in Europe as well.
Given where we are with ABRAXANE sales at this point in the year, we are refining our full-year guidance of the
product, and now believe it will come in between $950 million and $1 billion. This represents a year-over-year increase
at the midpoint of 15%. We see ABRAXANE's future role in immuno-oncology combinations as very bright. Ongoing
non-small-cell lung cancer and triple-negative breast cancer trials are enrolling well, and we expect to see Phase I data
updates for breast at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December.
Phase III data readouts for ABRAXANE in immuno-oncology combinations could start in 2017. In addition, our
adjuvant pancreas and ABOUND lung trials are also enrolling well, and we look forward to the potential for expanded
label indications in these cancers over time. Finally, we expect updated data from the GeparSepto trial to be presented
at San Antonio Breast, and we are exploring regulatory options for label expansions based on the results of this trial.
We're looking forward to the upcoming ASH meeting in December and yet another year of strong presence by Celgene.
The depth and breadth of our abstract submission continue to impress, and we have over 120 submissions this year
across a wider variety of compounds than ever.

We are particularly excited about key data presentations from the SWOG S0777 trial, including the RVD triplet, and a
variety of Phase III trials that will highlight novel combinations with REVLIMID included in a number of triplet
regiments. We'll also see data for luspatercept, AG-221, AG-120, and Acetylon's ACY-1215 compound.
There's a growing body of evidence to support REVLIMID's clear backbone position in triplet regimens for the
treatment of multiple myeloma, and the data is impressive. We're encouraged by the data coming out for REVLIMID in
novel triplet combinations in relapsed refractory myeloma. And we have results, the first results, and you may have
seen that the ASH abstracts are now out. We're especially excited to see the first triplet data readout in the
newly-diagnosed setting with the RVD/RD results from the SWOG S0777 newly-diagnosed trial, where PFS for the
RVD arm reached 43 months and for the RD arm 31 months. This is the first triplet data readout in this setting, and the
data is impressive. The PFS results are unprecedented. Furthermore, OS has shown a positive trend with a hazard ratio
of 0.666. We believe these results demonstrate a compelling benefit for patients with myeloma, and we believe they
have the potential to significantly impact the myeloma landscape.
Let me close by saying I'm very pleased with the performance of all three of our major brands. Across our myeloma
portfolio, share and duration trends are globally positive, and we're in a great position as we move in the 2016 with
strong momentum. ABRAXANE's position is solid, and the outlook bright for its place in the emerging
immuno-oncology landscape.
We have a number of key catalysts coming over the next 12 to 24 months. These include: REVLIMID and
POMALYST/IMNOVID triplet data; readouts from REVLIMID Phase III NHL trial starting in 2017; ABRAXANE
combination immuno-oncology trials advancing, with late-stage data possible starting in 2017; significant progress on
our collaboration projects, including those with Agios, Acceleron, and AstraZeneca/MedImmune. We expect to have a
more diversified portfolio of indications starting by 2018 and new products starting by 2019, thus setting us up to meet
or exceed our 2020 revenue targets. We look forward to seeing you at ASH.
Thank you very much, and let me now turn the call over to Terrie.
Terrie Curran
Thank you, Jackie, and good morning, everyone.
In quarter three, we continued to build strong momentum within the I&I franchise. In fact, we see acceleration in the
U.S of both prescriptions and revenues which are ahead of our expectations. Strong results were delivered across all of
the launch leading indicators. We're expanding our geographic footprint, with pleasing uptake in the early launch
markets within Europe.
Now looking to Asia-Pacific, a positive registration study in Japan sees us progressing to file in the first half of 2016.
In addition, key aspects of our registration program for GED-0301 are advancing, and the Phase III trial for ozanimod
in ulcerative colitis and relapsing multiple sclerosis are ahead of schedule.
OTEZLA has delivered robust revenue of $135 million in quarter three, and launches are now underway in Canada,
Germany, and multiple other European markets. The release of new long-term data from LIBERATE and ACTIVE
studies continue to enhance both the efficacy and safety profile of OTEZLA for psoriasis and PsA patients.
Now focusing on the U.S. market dynamics, OTEZLA is significantly outperforming other category launch analogues
with a further uptick in growth this past quarter. The DTC TV programming has had a significant impact on brand
awareness, driving increased traffic to Error! Not a valid link..com and a twofold increase in patient requests for
OTEZLA. OTEZLA continues to lead the PsA and psoriasis markets in new-to-brand share, and as such is rapidly
gaining share in the total market.
OTEZLA is not only taking share from biologics, but is also expanding the market, with over 85% of patients being
biologic-naive. We're also pleased to see OTEZLA patients have similar consistency to those on biologics, and rates are
well ahead of patients treated with oral DMARDs.

So to conclude, demand, revenue, and all other launch indicators are ahead of our expectations, and we anticipate
continued strong growth ahead.
I'd now like to turn the call over to Mark Kreston.
Mark Kreston
Great, thank you very much, Terrie, and good morning to everyone on the call.
So you can see that it's really an exciting time for the I&I franchise, and we're also excited about the strong revenue
growth behind OTEZLA. In addition to our strong revenue performance, we do remain very focused on operational
excellence and advancing our exciting pipeline, so let me begin with an update on our GED program.
We're pleased to announce that we have now initiated the first of two pivotal Phase III trials, CD-002. As previously
communicated, this study is a 52-week treat-through design, with the primary endpoint of CDAI [Crohn's Disease
Activity Index] remission at week four. Other endpoints included the proportion of patients achieving mucosal healing
at weeks 12 and 52, CDAI remission and steroid-free remission at week 52, and importantly, key patient reported
outcomes on stool frequency and abdominal pain at week four, week 12, and week 52.
Our second pivotal trial, CD-003, will initiate in a staggered parallel fashion early next year. Completion timing is
similar to that of CD-002.
The endoscopy study, CD-001, is actively enrolling, and we expect to complete enrollment by year end. As a reminder,
this study has an off-drug observation period up to 52 weeks. We remain on track for data disclosure at a major medical
meeting in 2017.
And then finally, we also plan to initiate the proof-of-concept trial in ulcerative colitis by the end of this year for
GED-0301.
Transitioning to Receptos and ozanimod, now that we've closed the transaction to acquire Receptos, we've been
working very closely with the dedicated and talented people of Receptos. We continue to rapidly advance the
development of ozanimod in both multiple sclerosis and ulcerative colitis. So as many of you may know, the Phase III
RADIANCE trial in MS completed enrollment earlier this year. We are very pleased to announce that the SUNBEAM
study has completed enrollment well ahead of schedule. Both trials are now fully accrued, and we remain very pleased
with our progress in advancing the entire MS program through development and toward registration and
commercialization.
In ulcerative colitis, the 32-week maintenance results were presented this past month at both ACG [American College
of Gastroenterology] in Hawaii and UEGW [United European Gastroenterology Week] in Barcelona. The data showed
that longer-term treatment with ozanimod is associated with sustained and improving efficacy along with a consistent
and favorable safety profile. I think it's worth noting that both of these were featured oral presentations at the opening
plenary sessions, underscoring the importance of and the interest in these data.
The Phase III registration trial in ulcerative colitis, named TRUE NORTH, already has patient enrollment and
randomization underway. And finally, the Phase II trial in Crohn's disease, STEPSTONE, has also been initiated. So
you can see that we're very pleased with the progress being made to date and also the highly collaborative and
productive efforts between the two organizations.
So in summary, we're very pleased with the strong revenue trajectory for OTEZLA and our results to date for the I&I
franchise. We remain highly focused on operational excellence and execution of our strategy going forward. We remain
committed to further accelerating the strong U.S. launch performance for OTEZLA, while also driving successful
launches throughout Europe, Japan, and beyond.
In IBD, we are aggressively advancing the development of GED, ozanimod, as well as OTEZLA in ulcerative colitis.
And our ambition is to create an industry-leading portfolio of highly differentiated novel oral compounds. These are

very exciting times for Celgene I&I, with strong operating momentum going into 2016 and beyond.
And with that, I will now turn the call over to Mark Alles.
Mark J. Alles
Thanks very much, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Before we open the call for questions, I'm glad to share with you
my perspective on another excellent quarter.
At Celgene, everything we do begins with bold pursuits in science and an unwavering commitment to patients. Our
company is unified by our mission to improve and extend the lives of patients around the world. We are successfully
executing on our strategic plan to achieve this mission. Our teams are delivering strong operating results, keeping us on
track to achieve our robust top line and bottom line outlook for the full year.
Outstanding execution by our commercial teams is driving improvements in key performance metrics, including the
market access position for our brands. The significant competitive advantage we have established in the myeloma
market continues to expand. In the short term, patients and our business will benefit from the global approvals that we
are achieving for REVLIMID in newly-diagnosed myeloma and the expected U.S. and European approvals for multiple
novel agents combined with REVLIMID for patients with relapsed and refractory disease.
Longer term, these clinical and regulatory successes put us in an advantageous position to rapidly develop our next
generation of therapies for myeloma, including durvalumab, CAR T-cell therapy, the selective HDAC inhibitor
ACY-1215, and two new immunomodulatory agents that are advancing into the clinic.
For many patients with solid tumors, the T-cell checkpoint inhibitors and other therapies that currently define the
immuno-oncology field have been nothing short of transformative. While the enthusiasm for these products and the
science is justified, important questions about patient selection and how to develop the most synergistic or
complementary treatments are constantly emerging.
Our partnerships with AstraZeneca, Juno, OncoMed, and others have and will create multiple research strategies to
explore and advance next-generation immuno-oncology therapies. By building on the anchoring position we have
developed for ABRAXANE in combination with anti-PD-1 and PD-L1 antibodies and addressing all aspects of the
anti-tumor immune response in oncology and hematology, we intend to develop a much stronger leadership position in
this important therapeutic category.
In many respects, the myeloid diseases MDS and AML provide the biologic and scientific proving ground for our
dedicated research teams focused on epigenetics, immuno-oncology, and protein homeostasis. In epigenetics, CC-486
is in late-stage trials for MDS and AML. Related to protein homeostasis, CC-122 is moving into Phase I and Phase II
studies in hematology. And beyond our marketed immunomodulatory drug REVLIMID in low-risk deletion 5q-minus
MDS, we intend to fully explore the clinical potential of durvalumab in a variety of combinations and lines of therapy
for patients with MDS or AML.
As Terrie nicely described, OTEZLA is gaining excellent momentum in the United States. Following the approval of
country-based reimbursement agreements, we expect similar adoption trends in Europe and other major markets. We
have built an outstanding team and the global capabilities to optimize the potential of OTEZLA in psoriasis and
psoriatic arthritis. This investment continues to be validated and should provide substantial operating leverage for our
next wave of I&I products.
With the advancement of GED-0301 into pivotal registration trials in Crohn's disease and late-stage trials for ozanimod
in ulcerative colitis and multiple sclerosis, we are well-positioned with one of the most promising late-stage pipelines
for severe inflammatory diseases.
Longer term, we are confident that our strategy to create and resource a highly unique and comprehensive network of
scientists, collaborators, and academic partners will advance bold science, identify new therapies, accelerate
development timelines, and add to our high-growth profile. With our partners, we have a shared commitment to

identify novel mechanisms of action, new targets, biomarkers, and new molecules leading to highly effective treatments
for the right patients.
Let me close by briefly addressing the important debate about pricing. We appreciate that the total cost of healthcare
presents a constant challenge to virtually every country, provider, payer, and patient population in the world. But we
also believe that therapies providing real value, measured in differentiated clinical outcomes, will continue to be
recognized. These are the products that will earn strong market positions and that will be reimbursed for the value they
bring to patients, especially patients with the greatest unmet and underserved medical needs. We are completely
committed to discovering, developing, and commercializing the most innovative products with the greatest therapeutic
value so that all stakeholders can benefit.
Thanks very much.

There's one additional point I'd like to cover. Today it was announced that Perry Karsen is retiring at the end of the
year. Perry has been a valued member of our senior leadership team and one of my most trusted colleagues. He's held
numerous positions at Celgene, most recently leading our Cellular Therapy organization. I've thoroughly enjoyed
working closely with Perry for over 11 years. I'm deeply grateful for Perry's many contributions to Celgene, his
dedication to our company, and his tremendous passion for the patients we serve. We all wish Perry well in his
retirement, and I would personally like to thank him for his service and friendship.
Operator, let's now please open the call to questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Yee of RBC Capital Markets.
Your line is now open.
<Q - Michael J. Yee>: Hey, thanks. Good morning, thanks for the question. I have an IO-based question for Jackie or
Mark, and that is two parts. One is you did this huge deal with AstraZeneca on MEDI4736 in myeloma. That could be a
huge drug, but we're not going to see data for a while. Is there anything that we could be seeing at ASH there to give us
confidence that a PD-1 works well in myeloma and why you did that deal?
And then my second part of the IO question is ABRAXANE has been weak again. You made some comments about
PD-1 impacting sales. Are you also losing sales because people are just going into clinical trials? What's going on
there, and how should we be thinking about ABRAXANE as a driver given the changes in IO [ph] drugs on (36:08)
cancer? Thanks.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Hi, Michael. Thanks for the questions. Let me give them a shot; and if Mark or anybody
else want to jump in, please. So with respect to the AZ deal, I think the abstracts are breaking out this morning. We
didn't have access to all the data either, so we're looking at them the same as you guys are. The two that I would
highlight in the IO space are the REVLIMID-pembro [pembrolizumab] combination and the pom
[pomalidomide]-pembro combination. I believe in those abstracts you're going to see overall response rates in the
REVLIMID trial of 76%. And in the pom-pembro trial, about 50% with the three near CRs in the pom trial too, very
good partial responses and six partial responses, and the four VGPRs in the REVLIMID-pembro trial and nine PRs.
So just in terms of proof of concept, you see that data. You can see the rationale for the combination of IMiDs with
checkpoint inhibitors in myeloma. Our AZ-Medi deal is a hematology-wide deal, so we have six trials that either are in
the process of being initiated or will initiate next year across all indications, including myeloma. We will be running
combination trials, and we'll start most likely with our existing assets of REVLIMID and POMALYST. And we have

the ability to look at other novel agents that we have coming through the pipeline and potentially jump quickly with
those novel-novel combinations. So I would think the basic rationale is highly compelling. And with AZ having a
PD-L1, we think that these combinations may confer some advantages if this plays out. So strong rationale for the deal,
obviously.
Quickly with respect to ABRAXANE, in the U.S. particularly, let me just emphasize that the launch trajectory outside
the U.S. and what we see ongoing outside the U.S. coming off of a modest base that we'll have quite strong
international growth for ABRAXANE as it becomes standard of care with gem [gemcitabine] in pancreas and takes its
place outside the U.S. In the U.S., it's a very competitive environment, most particularly with the first wave of IO
therapies in the lung indication especially and those single-agent therapies. We think that we've seen a big impact from
that first wave.
Now we're all still waiting for the combination data in the IO space to mature, but we are very optimistic about what we
are seeing in the early data for the combinations. You've seen a little bit of that in lung, and we expect to continue to
see updates there with the trials being run by a variety of companies. And we're optimistic about the potential in breast
as well, and you've seen some ongoing developments there. We think we'll see some data updates at San Antonio. So it
is a highly competitive environment at the moment. We're holding our own with ABRAXANE in the U.S., but we have
some good reasons to believe that the future of the product in these IO combinations is going to be very, very bright.
<Q - Michael J. Yee>: Okay. Thanks, Jackie.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams of Jefferies. Your line is now open.
<Q - Brian Abrahams>: Hi, thanks so much for taking my question. As the myeloma paradigm evolves, you
mentioned the increasing evidence for benefits of triplet combinations. We'll obviously potentially see the CD-38s
enter the market. I'm wondering your thoughts on the impacts to share and pricing dynamics for REVLIMID and POM
going forward. Thanks.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Thanks for the question, Brian. I think we're in a great position because we have a very
large and growing body of clinical data behind both REVLIMID and POMALYST. So these are well-known drugs to
physicians, and their benefit has clearly been demonstrated in multiple, multiple clinical trials with this huge growing
body of evidence behind them. Now as we start to see the triplet regimens read out both in relapsed refractory and with
the first one in newly-diagnosed coming from the SWOG trial that you see in the ASH abstracts, we think there's
significant support for treat-to-progression with these regimens and for clear benefit from those.
Given the mechanism of action of these drugs, they're highly combinable with a number of other agents, whether it's
potentially CD-38, the checkpoint inhibitors. As we've spoken about in others, we think we're well-positioned with our
portfolio of assets to deliver strong combinations there. We think that the market could play out with a little bit more
segmentation of some of the different patient segments as we take these novel therapies forward and seeing in what
patient segments they work the best. And what you see is the IMiDs being backbone of therapy regardless of what the
combination is.
With respect to just the cost issue, we feel with the portfolio of assets that we have that we are quite well-positioned.
Again, with REVLIMID and POMALYST in particular with that body of clinical data behind them to support them in
their position in the marketplace, we think that as others come along, our value proposition is pretty well-established.
When you think about the SWOG trial and have a look at that data and that RVD triplet performance in that setting,
and then think about the loss of exclusivity date for VELCADE as this plays out, we've got the potential to see some
triplet regimens that have significant benefit for patients and will have quite a good value proposition probably that
plays out. And then the novel-novel therapies will take their place based on the value proposition that they offer for the
patient segments that they are serving.
<Q - Brian Abrahams>: Thanks, Jackie.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.
<Q - Eric Thomas Schmidt>: Maybe just a follow-up comment on the SWOG S0777 trial for Jackie. In terms of the
data from a triple-combo regimen that's as strong as this, what kind of, I don't know, thumbnail sketch in terms of
commercial potential could you give for us? I know that there's already a fair bit of use of these triple combinations in
the front-line setting. But what sort of impact could this have?
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: I think what I would highlight first is, though, since the dissemination of the MM-020 trial
results, we have seen continued movement in favor of treat-to-progression as the philosophy adopted by physicians.
There's still up to 30% of patients in the U.S. that are not on maintenance therapy. So we think that that's probably the
first way to think about this, is continued support for growing duration of treatment and even more physicians moving
to that treat-to-progression paradigm.
And then some of the other things that we spoke about with respect to that particular triplet playing out within the
landscape is what looks to be a triplet that has very good results for patients. And at some point as things evolve, the
cost of that combination could represent quite a good value proposition. We think longer term that's something to keep
in mind as well.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
<Q - Cory W. Kasimov>: Hey, good morning, thanks for taking the question. I'm just wondering if there's anything
you can say on the current duration therapy for OTEZLA and how that's evolved from earlier on in the launch.
And then quickly just on the strategic side of things, it wasn't talked about today. But I wanted to ask you about your
recent board appointment of Dr. Julia Haller. I'm just curious if this has any read-through to an emerging interest in
ophthalmology, or is there simply other broader strategic intent behind her addition? Thanks a lot.
<A - Terrie Curran>: The persistence of OTEZLA we're really encouraged about. After the first month, once patients
are acclimated to treatment and deal with access challenges, subsequent treatment is quite good and durable.
Persistence today is similar to other biologics, and actually superior to [ph] oral demand (45:05). We're actually seeing
over time responses are increasing, and so persistence remains very, very strong.
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: And just a comment on Dr. Haller, just an incredibly well-respected and experienced clinician
and leader in the whole healthcare field. So I wouldn't read anything into any therapeutic focus. But to bring another
person of quality on the board that really has such expertise and experience in a broad range of healthcare issues and
development of new compounds et cetera, it was just a great opportunity of somebody to bring that kind of expertise to
the board. So we're very excited. I think we continue to be opportunistic on where we go, but I wouldn't read anything
to the specific addition of her to the board. But we're very excited and glad that she's joined our board.
<Q - Cory W. Kasimov>: Okay, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
<Q - Mark Schoenebaum>: Hey, guys, thanks a lot for taking the questions; as usual, great P&L management, Peter
and Jackie. I have a couple questions. The first, I just wanted to get your reaction to the more detailed data presented by
Biogen and Mitsubishi on their S1P1. They believe that their molecule is differentiated from the one you acquired from

Receptos in that it doesn't need dose titration at all, and I was wondering if you had perspective on that data that were
publicly presented.
And then just a question I ask every few years, as Jackie knows, but I feel that it's due. And that is that year to date, you
guys have spent $1.34 billion on upfront R&D costs which have not been recorded in your non-GAAP R&D line. Your
non-GAAP R&D expenses have been $1.4 billion. So now we've reached a point where about half of your cash flow
out of the company for "R&D" is sort of off-P&L. Is this the right run rate we should be modeling going forward? And
maybe just given all the scrutiny around accounting across the industry right now, maybe just another opportunity for
Jackie or Peter to explain why you do this. And you've been very transparent about it. If you need to figure it out, it's on
slide 29. But maybe just help us think about a run rate going forward and explain to us again your rationale for doing
this. Thanks so much.
<A - Mark Kreston>: All right, great. So, Mark, it's Mark Kreston. Thanks very much for the question on Mitsubishi
and our perspective on the data. So I think what's important is a reminder that, as we've gone through the process of
evaluating Receptos over a two-year period, we had a chance look very deeply, very comprehensively at the full
landscape of S1P therapies, and there are a number. Mitsubishi was clearly one of them, but there's Serono and
Actelion. So we felt really very comfortable and very confident when we looked at all the data, at the combination of
what we saw. And obviously in diligence, we have been privy to additional data that's not yet public. But we feel very
good about the profile, about the differentiation. And listen, it makes good sense. I think we said publicly that Biogen
doing that deal, for them that's important. But for us, we really stand by having the right profile.
The other comment I would make, as a reminder though, is that we're also well advanced in Phase III. So there's also a
timing component to this program. So we believe that between the data we see and the differentiation we believe in the
timing that we've placed our investment in the right place.
<A - Peter N. Kellogg>: And, Mark, this is Peter. I'll take your second question. And so we are very excited about the
future and the potential of having a pipeline that can really set us up for long-term growth. There's no question that we
made some meaningful investments this year in the transactions with AstraZeneca, Juno, Receptos. We've spent a lot of
time year to date talking about them. We feel very excited about what that means.
And in many ways, if you think about it, AstraZeneca and Juno, those are really foundational step-in opportunities for
immuno-oncology. And in many ways, we're working with a couple of companies that have done tremendous work so
far, have developed great portfolios, and we wanted to in a sense buy into those transactions. And so I think the way
we've positioned them is very appropriate.
As you know, I know we've talked about this in the past. Really when we do some of these in-licensing and
collaborative relationships, there's a combination of reimbursing the other party for the great work they've done and in a
sense buying into the portfolio they've developed at that point. And then once that transaction is done going forward,
we're partners, and we run a lot of those activities through our P&L, whether it be through milestones or the types of
trials that Jackie has talked about that we're going to be doing with durvalumab. And so in many ways, we view it as up
front we're buying in, and that's very acquisition-like in the way that we treat it. And then once we have that
relationship, it's part of our operation. Depending how it's particularly structured, we then run those charges and
milestones and so forth through our P&L.
I think there's no question that going forward we may not see this kind of a bolus of spending as much. Clearly we
seize the opportunity, as Bob has talked about many times, if we see the right opportunities. It's really a question of the
quality and the opportunity that we see. There's no question that immuno-oncology, that space has just opened up
tremendously, and we want to be part of it. We are partnering with many different players with our existing assets. But
we also wanted to play a role in hematology, leading the charge there, as Jackie talked about. And obviously, Juno is
great, great future technology. So in many ways, I'm not sure that we'll see this kind of a trend over every quarter. I
highlighted on the Q2 call that Q2 was exceptional. But on the other hand, we will pick the right opportunity, but I
think 2015 should be marked as really the year we did a tremendous step-in into the immuno-oncology space.

<Q - Mark Schoenebaum>: And if I'm reading the press release right, your guidance implies zero of this in the 4Q. Is
that correct, Peter? And I'll drop off, thanks a lot.
<A - Peter N. Kellogg>: Zero of this in the 4Q. So I guess you're asking will there be more deal flow?
<Q - Mark Schoenebaum>: You're already at, if I'm reading the press release right, this $1.34 billion you've spent
year to date is basically what you guided for, for the full year, this off-income statement R&D spending.
<A - Peter N. Kellogg>: Oh, yes, so it's hard. In many ways we don't really quite guide exactly future transactions and
so forth, so it's awfully hard for us to say. But I think look, as we've highlighted in the comments today, we're digesting
a lot of things. Actually, we're just thrilled to have this going. AstraZeneca clinical development plan is in great shape,
as Jackie talked about. As Mark commented, Receptos is accruing trials in MS ahead of schedule. It's going extremely
well. But certainly, everybody is hands-on and very busy. If another opportunity came up, we might be interested in it.
But at this point, we're really fully deployed.

me, thought, good job.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Roden of UBS. Your line is now open.
<Q - Matthew Roden>: Great, thanks for having me on the call and congrats to Perry on a great run at Celgene. I'm
interested in your comments on the recent strategic review and that you have strength and conviction that you can hit
your 2020 targets. So it sounds like maybe your view on the 2020 targets might be evolving. Just wanted to see if that's
true. And if so, would the new year be a natural time to either update those 2020 numbers, or perhaps would there be an
indication to actually roll it forward to 2021 to keep a five-year view out there?
And then also related to your intro comments, you mentioned that the infrastructure investments that you've made are
practically complete. So should we be looking for meaningful SG&A leverage over the next few years as you continue
to grow revenues on top of that infrastructure? Thanks very much.
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: Thanks, Matt. It's Bob, and others will add in, in a moment. I think just on the infrastructure
commentary, you know what, I think that we think about the leverage that we've achieved in our organization over the
last couple years has been very significant, and Peter and Jackie have continually commented on that. I think we do still
have room for that opportunity to bring other products through there. So operationally we're in a great position. It
differentiates us from others who want to bring new products to market. And so we think just strategically that those
investments were incredibly important and incredibly valuable to our long-term growth and position us extremely well.
And I think financially, Peter can add some comments. He already did add some comments on it.
In terms of 2020, any of the targets that we set for ourselves in terms of what we see the potential of our portfolio to
achieve, we always are re-examining it as new data and information comes out. When we did the deals in terms of
inflammatory bowel disease, we in fact raised fairly significantly the revenue outlook for 2020. I don't want to commit
to what we'll do or not do at other conferences that come up. But as we see information that we believe we have an
advantaged perspective in a material way, we always look to be as transparent as we can and give that kind of
information to let you draw your own conclusions about what you think about the opportunities that we have.
We feel very good about 2020. From a bottoms-up approach, we've looked at it. We've looked at it strategically from
external opportunities and challenges. And so we continue to evolve it. We'll continue to examine it. And if there are
any types of material changes to it, we'd update you on that.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: And if I – hi, Matt – can just jump in and highlight a couple of things particularly that are
not included in the current base case model for the hematology/oncology franchise, and there are some other lesser

things as well. But the two I want to highlight, the opportunity for ABRAXANE in immuno-oncology combinations
has not been captured in that base case forecast, and the opportunity for things to come out of the
AstraZeneca/MedImmune collaboration has not yet been captured in that forecast. And you can say okay, the latter one
is a little bit farther out.
We will at ASH try to give as appropriate a bit more visibility to all of our programs, our development programs. And
particularly, we will spend some time at the investor event on the AstraZeneca/MedImmune program and what that
clinical development program looks like. I'll give you little bit more detail for that and what we think the timelines on
some of these things could be. As you know, in our base case assumptions, we always assume standard regulatory
approvals, and there are some opportunities for potentially acceleration. So we will walk people through that.
<Q - Matthew Roden>: Thanks very much.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
<Q - Samir Siddhanti>: Hi, this is Samir on for Terence. Thanks for taking the question. For ABRAXANE, given
your updated 2015 guidance, can you comment on your confidence level in your 2017 guidance and what needs to
happen to achieve it? Thanks so much.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Thanks for the question. So if we go back to the time of the acquisition, I think we had a
range in our forecast for this year of $1 billion to $1.25 billion, and the number for 2017 is $1.5 billion to $2 billion.
This year we are going to be just under the lower end of that range. Many years ago when we did that, it actually held
up pretty well for quite a while. I don't think we had a full appreciation for the impact of the checkpoint inhibitor class
coming to market. Now where we see that, we think we're in a great position and holding our own, particularly in the
U.S. We'll have good growth outside the U.S.
It's very possible that when we get to 2017 and when we think about our 2020 targets that we have a different mix of
revenues. We're highly confident in the forecast that we have overall for the hematology/oncology franchise, and the
mix between hematology and oncology could be a little bit different.
Again, we have not factored anything into the model for the opportunity associated with ABRAXANE use in
combination in the IO regimens. The early data in lung we feel is quite encouraging and are anxious to see that play
out. And we're cautiously optimistic or somewhat optimistic, I guess I would say. We just haven't seen enough yet to
make a definitive statement about it. But about those combination therapies, the potential in breast, particularly in the
triple-negative setting, and none of that's in the model yet because we think it's too early to call, though we could start
seeing that data and even usage potentially in 2017.
So again, mix a little bit different, overall heme/onc, highly confident in our ability to hit our forecast in 2017 and 2020
and, fingers crossed, potentially exceed them.
Operator
And our next question comes from the line of Ying Huang of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
<Q - Ying Huang>: Hi, good morning, thanks for taking my questions. To the extent that you can answer the question
because I know many investors really are wondering what your latest thought would be for the REVLIMID Natco
settlement potentially with Allergan, especially now that Pfizer and Allergan are in the play here. Also, we know the
fact that the end of the discovery phase has been pushed back again to January of 2016.
And then secondly, maybe this is for Jackie. Now that you have secured reimbursement for REVLIMID in front-line
myeloma in two countries in Europe, can you talk about the pricing trends there in Europe, and then whether you're
seeing any impact from generic VELCADE in Europe or not? Thanks.

<A - Peter N. Kellogg>: Yes, thanks for pointing out that discovery has been extended on the Natco REVLIMID
litigation. There really isn't anything that I can add to what's already been discussed. But as anything new comes up,
we'll certainly keep you informed.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Hi, Ying, it's Jackie. Thanks for the question on Europe. So we have been – we are very
happy with where we've gotten to with the reimbursement negotiations. I just would highlight one more time, I think
everybody knows this, but this is a staggered process. So when we think about a launch of a product in Europe, we
have early access markets, and Germany is a big one. The other ones are relatively small. And then you go through the
process, and so you're not really in full-blown launch trajectory mode until you get all those major countries. So we're
still early days in newly-diagnosed in Europe, but it's going extremely well.
What we're seeing so far this year if we look at the year to date, overall outside the U.S. price impact on REVLIMID,
it's around 2% to 3%, again, for the nine months year to date, so I think you need to look at these on a full-year – on a
year-to-date basis. And if we look at overall, the price impact in the international environment has been about 3.5%, so
we get a little bit of price impact on some of the other products as well, including POMALYST/IMNOVID, after it's
been in the market for a little while. In Europe, the numbers are maybe slightly higher, 0.5 percentage point, so around
a 4% price decline across the portfolio in Europe. We had factored that order of magnitude of price decline into our
forecast. So we feel like we're right where we want to be.
With the clinical data, we're seeing extremely good share uptake in the front-line setting. And as we showed you in the
slide presentation, we're holding share in the second-line and third-line settings as well. So I would say your question
on the VELCADE generic impact, not seeing too much at this point in time. And again, we're very encouraged by the
emerging triplet regimen data and the way we think this myeloma landscape is going to play out across the globe.
<Q - Ying Huang>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham of Barclays. Your line is now open.
<Q - Geoffrey Meacham>: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I've got a couple. So OTEZLA,
obviously you guys have stepped up commercial investments to raise awareness. But when would you expect to see
this decelerate a little bit? In other words, when would you expect to see a little bit more P&L leverage from OTEZLA,
particularly in the U.S.?
And then on REV in newly diagnosed myeloma, when you look at the big five in Europe and even Japan for next year,
how much of an impact do you think the budgeting process over there will have, or is that really not as much of a factor
just given the relatively low share that REVLIMID currently has in newly-diagnosed? Thanks.
<A - Peter N. Kellogg>: Geoff, let me start. This is Peter, and I'll turn it over to Terrie for some comments. So when
we talk about SG&A leverage, really a lot of times we're talking about more about building out the infrastructure
around the world and then driving great volume and revenue through that infrastructure, and our global teams have
done a fantastic job building out with great capability. And then as we roll out other products, they handle it
beautifully.
Really at this point, we've got tremendous leverage in the heme/onc franchise. The I&I franchise is building in Europe
but they're getting some leverage as well because we coordinate a lot of that team effort. When we have an opportunity
like OTEZLA, though, obviously we're just building our position to market. So I'll turn it over to Terrie, but I think
that's not necessarily yet an opportunity or a thought that we would have for leverage really because we're really seizing
an enormous opportunity. Terrie?
<A - Terrie Curran>: I think we're still early in the launch. But for this early, we really are saying that all of our early
metrics are strong, whether you look at share of new patients which is over 35%, our overall share. Our requests for
OTEZLA, it's very strong. Some of the investments that we're making are really driving demand and laying a solid

foundation for a blockbuster product in the future.
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: And, Geoff, it's Bob. Just being involved in some of the investment decisions about it, there is
a strong return on investment thesis that underpins all of the investments that we're making and the fact that we've
accelerated some of these only because we actually believe it's returning a very attractive investment to us. So I think
we're actually ahead of the kind of return that we had hoped to get out of the franchise, and the investments that we're
doing are just accelerating that return. So we feel very good about where we're investing and the returns on those
investments.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Just on the other question that you had around governmental budgeting processes, I think
it's what was related to in the big five countries in Europe and also in Japan, how we see that in 2016. We still have –
actually, I think there's going to be limited impact from that. I think we know pretty much what the ranges would be for
outcomes in the reimbursement negotiations in the big five countries that we still have remaining in Europe. We
already have Germany. REVLIMID was in the market before [ph] AMNOS (1:04:53). We don't have to go through any
pricing review in Germany. We've got the Spanish approval that we just got, so we've started launching the product in
Spain in October. And we still have France and Italy and the UK to come over the next two or three quarters, and we're
well underway with those discussions.
The value proposition for REVLIMID continues to get stronger and stronger as more data comes out of any of these
trials that we're seeing for the drug. So we feel quite good about that and don't think there's anything specific in a given
budgeting process that would impact us more than we've already built in.
From a Japan standpoint, 2016 is the every two-year review period, and we would already have taken something into
consideration for that in our forecast for 2016 as a potential for a price decline, so that would be built into our numbers
already. For the last couple of cycles we have not gotten any price decline, but we'll also be thinking about coming
forward with the newly-diagnosed launch in Japan and what that dynamic will be around that as well, and we've built
anything around those negotiations into our forecast when you eventually see our 2016 numbers.
<Q - Geoffrey Meacham>: Got you. Okay, thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mara Goldstein of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.
<Q - Mara Goldstein>: Thanks very much, a question on ABRAXANE. Do you think you could at least share
qualitatively if not quantitatively the split on ABRAXANE between non-small-cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer
and breast, and where you see those growth rates at?
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: I don't know that we want to go into that degree of granularity.
<Q - Mara Goldstein>: You can't blame a girl for trying.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: No, I don't blame you at all. I'll let Patrick opine on that a little bit. Let me just say from a
dynamic standpoint, though, as you've seen, in that impact patient population group, we've reached 50% share in
pancreas in the U.S. And so the AG regimen is definitely a standard of care for pancreas. So once you get to that point,
obviously, you have limited impact from further share gains and things like that. So we'll still have good growth. The
growth outside the U.S. is very, very good. The one other thing...
<Q - Mara Goldstein>: Across all the indications?
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Across all indications, yes.
<Q - Mara Goldstein>: Okay.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Maybe more – it's stronger in pancreas. We're early days of the lung launch, so from a
modest base you're going to see strong growth rates in lung. As that ramps up, it will take some time because we have

to go through reimbursement there as well. With pancreas, we only have one major EU country left to go, and that's
France. We have it in the other four though. We're dealing with the same things that everybody else is in the UK with
that situation. And breast is cranking along relatively well outside of the U.S. But again, the growth is going to be good
from a modest base.
In the U.S., I think the team is doing extremely well. We've seen impact particularly in lung with the share uptake for
nivo [nivolumab] and others, but we also have seen some impact in the other usage of the product outside of those three
indications where you've had some other products come to market in ovarian, for example, and we would have seen
usage of ABRAXANE go down in some of those other indications.
We are quite excited also about the potential opportunity with our adjuvant pancreas trial that we have going on that's
enrolling extremely well; and the ABOUND program across lung, where we should have some data in 2017 starting to
come out of that ABOUND program. So lots of great things going on for ABRAXANE. We're in a little bit of a tough
competitive environment for the moment, particularly in lung in the U.S., but we're holding our own.
<Q - Mara Goldstein>: Okay, and if I could just ask a different question, and that is on the cellular therapy, not
because of Perry's retirement, but since it's topical today. Can you talk about what the strategy is for that and whether
that gets visibly bigger inside the company versus outside, and how it lives and exists in the current R&D strategy?
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: Thanks for the question. I think it's appropriate, especially with Perry's impending retirement.
I think we remain incredibly optimistic about the future for cellular therapy, but we have to prove it. And so we're
focused in clinical trials in diabetic foot ulcers, and we're looking at other areas where we think there are legitimate
opportunities for us. But it has to be proven. So it continues to be an area of focus for us, but we're certainly not going
to be increasing our percentage of investment there until we see some clear controlled data supporting it. But it doesn't
change our view that over time we're going to see that as an important component in a wide range of therapeutic areas.
<Q - Mara Goldstein>: Okay, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Newman of Canaccord. Your line is now open.
<Q - John Newman>: Hi, thanks a lot for taking my question. I have a two-part question, if I could. The first is what
are you seeing in terms of the compliance on OTEZLA? Is that within the expectations that you had when you launched
the product of generally around 40% to 50% in an investigative scenario?
And then the second questions is on pricing. My question is do you see within the industry a desire for a path forward
to address the fact that companies are limited in the assistance that they can give to Medicare patients in terms of the
co-pay? Thank you.
<A - Terrie Curran>: On the first question regarding compliance, now that we've been in the market for some time,
we have a significant database that we can look at to look to see how patients are complying and persisting with
therapy. What we're seeing playing out is that the compound is being very well tolerated, that the incidence of GI in the
first couple of weeks is very low, and that we're having more than 75% of patients comply with therapy at the
12-month point, so very positive.
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: And just on the pricing issue, the copayment issue, and as you – those are all incredibly
important issues, and there's clear differentiation between market segments as to what type of activities are permitted
and what are not, so there are generally quite clear guidelines.
I do think across segments that patients who have a financial need are well supported, and I think that we've got to do a
better job as an industry to ensure that they understand the opportunities that are afforded to them in terms of getting
access to medicine and support for copayments. So I think there has been tremendous improvement in terms of patient
access from a copayment point of view. And we live with the limitations of one segment versus another, but I think
overall, it's not as bad as it could be.

I do think we have to recognize that we've got some structural issues as a society we've got to face here; that some of
the specialty tiers and copayments and coinsurance are really discriminatory against people who suffer from serious
diseases. And we've seen some improvement in the AIDS tiering of specialty pharmaceuticals, and there are lots of
initiatives about oncology patients being discriminated against because of the structure of specialty tiers, et cetera. Lots
of issues we've got to deal with, including step edits that we see programs that require patients to go through products
that might not be the best for them before they can get the best therapies. There are activities on the state level dealing
with that.
So this whole issue, both structurally the industry needs to be more aggressive in supporting the kind of progressive
policies that ensure access to innovative therapies for patients, and we must do a much better job of articulating the
logic and the rationale behind our investments in innovative therapies, the benefits of that, and the risks that are taken if
we don't encourage the kind of investments that need it and access to patients for those innovative therapies. We've got
a lot of work to do. I think the headlines are a little bit worse than the underlying substance, but that's no reason that we
should take anything but be incredibly serious about what needs to be done both from a perception point of view and
substantively fundamentally.
<A - Patrick E. Flanigan III>: Operator, I think we have time for one more question.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Skorney of Robert Baird. Your line is now open.
<Q - Brian P. Skorney>: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I appreciate you fitting me in.
Scott, we've talked a little before about the plans with CC-292, and I just wonder. Coming off of some recent
conferences and MS data, particularly around ocrelizumab, just your thoughts on the role of B-cell targeting in MS, and
if you think there's any potential to move CC-292 into development in MS given this evolving thought process for MS
treatment.
<A - Mark Kreston>: Thanks for the question. Maybe just as a reminder, the current program on CC-292 is a BTK
inhibitor. It's in rheumatoid arthritis. That's the initial proof of concept. That's the area where – but we are obviously
looking expansively in other autoimmune indications. But right now, the lead has clearly been for proof of concept in
the rheumatoid arthritis space.
<Q - Brian P. Skorney>: Okay, thanks.
Peter N. Kellogg
Thank you for the questions. This is Peter. I'll just make some final comments. We're very proud with our work year to
date here at Celgene, very excited about what we've set up for our future. Operationally, you've seen today that our top
line is strong. It's been volume-driven. It is great market share performance across a number of different fronts, and
we've really coordinated the P&L to provide good leverage while still making very, very important investments today
and going forward in R&D.
Strategically, I think we all have to see that we've made a lot of moves during 2015 and more to come. We now have a
tremendous pipeline of assets to drive. As Bob said in his opening comments, we're shifting a lot of programs now into
Phase III. 2016 is going to be a tremendously exciting year as all those programs get rolling. And those are both the
deals that we have done and we've brought in assets from the outside, but also our own organic pipeline. Either things
that have come from our own research engine or from our collaboration partners are all moving ahead and creating a lot
of excitement. So we're looking forward to seeing you all at ASH. We're looking forward to seeing you as we go
through the end of the year and finalize our view for next year. And we will have more to talk about that I think is very
exciting for the future. So thank you very much.
