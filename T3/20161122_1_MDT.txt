MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Medtronic's Second Quarter Earnings
Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise, and after the speakers' remarks,
there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.
I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Weispfenning. Please go ahead.
Ryan Weispfenning
Great. Thank you, Crystal. Good morning, and welcome to Medtronic's second quarter conference call and webcast.
During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic
Chief Financial Officer, will provide comments on the results for our fiscal year 2017 second quarter, which ended on
October 28, 2016. After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions.
First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and
a revenue-by-division summary. We also issued an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our
performance and outlook. You should note that many of the statements made during this call may be considered
forward-looking statements and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking
statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our
periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC. And we do not undertake to update any forward-looking

statements.
In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on our website
investorrelations.medtronic.com. Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are
in comparison to the second quarter fiscal year 2016, and all year-over-year growth rates and ranges are given on a
constant currency basis, which adjusts for the effect of foreign currency. Other than as noted, our EPS growth and
guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be recorded as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during
fiscal year. These adjustment details can be found in the reconciliation tables included with our earnings press release.
With that, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak.
Omar?
Omar S. Ishrak
Good morning, and thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone for joining us. This morning, we reported second
quarter revenue of $7.3 billion, representing growth of 3%. Q2 non-GAAP operating profit grew 9%, and non-GAAP
diluted earnings per share were $1.12 growing at 15% and representing EPS leverage of 1,120 basis points.
Q2 revenue was disappointing and did not meet our expectations. We faced issues that affected our growth, including
slower than expected revenue as we await new product introductions. Despite this revenue shortfall, we produced
strong improvement in operating margins and double digit earnings per share growth. While some of the challenges
that had an impact on revenue in Q2 could persist over the coming quarters, we remain confident in our ability to
deliver mid-single-digit revenue growth and double digit EPS growth, not only in our current fiscal year, but on a
sustained basis into the future.
Now, normally, the diversity of our revenue base overcomes any quarterly challenges. However, there were enough
unexpected and unrelated issues in Q2 to collectively affect our revenue and each of our growth vectors. Our new
therapies growth vector, which contributed approximately 195 basis points to our total company growth, not only just
fell below our goal of 200 basis points to 250 basis points but was well below our trend and expectations with the
largest impacts from CVG and Diabetes.
In CVG, revenue growth was 3%, below our targeted high end of the mid-single-digit range and meaningfully below
what we believe this business should be able to sustain. In our CRHF division, strong growth contributions from
Diagnostics, Atrial Fibrillation and our recently acquired HeartWare LVAD business were offset by weakness in our
core cardiac rhythm implantables business, which declined in the low-single digits.
While we continue to take share the U.S. HSD market, the market itself declined in the mid-single digits, driven by
high-single-digit market declines in High Power device replacements. In the U.K., our implantables revenue declined in
the mid-teens as the National Health Service is changing its procurement model to limit bulk purchases, causing a
temporary disruption to normal buying patterns of the local trust. We expect these pressures in CRHF to continue
through the fiscal year.
Our CSH division was affected by transient market share losses due to the timing of new product cycles. For example,
in the fast-growing TAVR market, we lacked, until recently, a large-size version of our Evolut R platform. And in
drug-eluting stents, our new Resolute Onyx DES is not yet available in the U.S. and Japan, driving declines in those
markets to competitive DES products. However, at the end of this quarter, we did receive FDA approval for Evolut R
XL, which we expect to drive U.S. growth in the back half of our fiscal year. In addition, we expect the introduction of
Evolut PRO and Resolute Onyx in the U.S. around fiscal year end and Resolute Onyx in Japan in FY 2018.
In our APV division, solid mid-single-digit growth was driven by our IN.PACT Admiral drug-coated balloon, which
continues to lead the market and drive mid-20s growth. We expect this momentum to continue in the second half of our
fiscal year.

Within our Diabetes group, we were pleased with the earlier than expected FDA approval of the MiniMed 670G, which
not only represents revolutionary technology toward a long-awaited, closed-loop insulin pump system but also have
been received with strong enthusiasm amongst the diabetes community. However, the earlier than expected approval
has created a bigger than expected gap between product approval and shipment. As a result, we created a Priority
Access Program for the MiniMed 630G, which offers upgrade priority to the MiniMed 670G when launched. We are
seeing strong demand for this program primarily from early adopters. We do expect the majority of customers to wait
to purchase the MiniMed 670G, once it launches in the spring of 2017.
In addition to this dynamic, which is driving lower than expected pump and consumable sales, a portion of our
MiniMed 630G revenue is now deferred until receipt of the upgrade. Going forward, we expect some improved
revenue growth for the remainder of this fiscal year. And we expect Diabetes to ultimately return to double-digit
growth, once the MiniMed 670G is fully on the market next fiscal year.
Our Minimally Invasive Therapies group grew 4% in Q2, consistent with our goal of mid-single digit revenue growth,
primarily driven by our Open-to-MIS growth driver, including strong product sales by recently launched Valleylab
FT10 energy platform and continued performance of our endo stapling specialty reloads.
Surgical Solutions came in slightly below our expectations, primarily driven by the impact of competitive reprocessing
of our advanced energy vessel sealing disposables in the U.S. We are confident in our ongoing strategies and new
product launches that are designed to address this headwind.
Looking ahead, MITG expects to launch more than 50 new products in the second half of the fiscal year to drive
growth, including a new powered stapling platform called Signia and new vessel sealing enhancements. This pipeline
gives us confidence that MITG can continue to grow in the mid-single-digits in the back half of the fiscal year.
Next, our Restorative Therapies Group grew 3% this quarter. And our spine division continued to show improvement.
Overall, Spine growth was 1%, our strongest growth in seven quarters, as we gained global spine share. Our U.S. Spine
business grew 3%, driven by continued adoption of INFUSE, and strong adoption of our Speed-to-Scale launches and
surgical synergy strategy, resulting in share gains along with sales of our navigation and imaging equipment in
neurosurgery.
RTG did suffer from a voluntary recall of certain neurovascular products, which affected revenue. Some of these
products will remain off the market in certain geographies for a period of time, but the most substantial impact of the
recall is behind us, as we bought back existing distributor inventory in Q2.
Across all of our groups, our product pipeline remains robust. We have important new growth catalysts that we expect
to lead to improve second half growth. Some of these products have already been launched, and others are coming to
the market in the coming months. We are confident we can drive sustainable growth of our new therapies growth vector
and expect to be well within our 200 basis point to 350 basis point goal in the back half of the year and over the longer
term.
Next, let's turn to emerging markets, which grew 10% and contributed approximately 120 basis points to our total
company growth, slightly below our goal of 150 basis points to 200 basis points. The primary driver was a shortfall in
the Middle East, where our revenue declined in the mid-single digits as governments are dealing with an increased
deficit affected by declining oil prices.
In Saudi Arabia, the largest market in the region, and where we have a strong market leadership position, our overall
business declined by approximately 40%, mostly impacted our CRHF, Surgical Solutions and Spine divisions. We
expect continued pressure in the Middle East for the remainder of the year, but we also believe that the basic demand
for our critical life-saving therapies will eventually rebound strongly.
On the positive side, our businesses in South Asia, ASEAN, Eastern Europe and Latin America all grew in the
mid-teens or higher. China, our largest emerging market, grew 11%, with double-digit growth in MITG and Diabetes
and high-single-digit growth in CVG and RTG. In South Asia, of which India is the largest market, we grew again in
the low 20s, with strong growth coming from key tender wins in MITG. In ASEAN, growth was broad-based with

double-digit growth in Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines. In Eastern Europe, we grew over
20% in Russia as a result of strong momentum in CVG and MITG. Latin America also had strong double-digit growth
in Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Chile and Argentina, driven in part by new tender wins and continued channel
optimization efforts.
We expect current emerging market performance levels to be sustained in the back half of the year, and continue to
believe strongly that the penetration of existing therapies into emerging markets represents the single largest
opportunity in med tech over the long term.
Turning now to our third growth vector, services and solutions, which contributed 20 basis points to Medtronic growth.
While this overall result was below our goal of 40 basis points to 60 basis points, services and solutions continues to
achieve solid revenue growth, mostly from CVG-related offerings.
We expect to further improve our growth contribution as new models are created and expanded across all our regions.
We continue to see success in our hospital solutions business through which we provide expertise in creating
operational efficiency in both cath labs and operating rooms.
We're also continuing to grow our chronic care models, including Diabeter for type 1 diabetes and NOK for morbid
obesity by pursuing global expansion opportunities. And finally, we formally launched our orthopedic solutions
business earlier this month, a comprehensive program to help providers meet their CJR requirements in the U.S.
Before I turn the call over to Karen, let me reiterate that we are disappointed with our Q2 performance. That said, we
also believe that these headwind events were largely temporary in nature, and we remain confident in our ability to
deliver mid-single-digit revenue growth and double-digit EPS growth for the full year. What should not be lost in this
discussion is that despite revenue challenges this quarter, our organization delivered strong improvements in operating
margins, including improvements in our gross margin and SG&A, and met our goal of delivering double-digit EPS
growth.
Karen will now take you through a more detailed look at our second quarter financial results. Karen?
Karen L. Parkhill
Thank you, Omar. Our second quarter revenue of $7.345 billion increased 4% as reported, or 3% on a constant
currency basis. Foreign currency had a positive $50 million impact on second quarter revenue. And acquisitions and
divestitures contributed approximately 120 basis points net to revenue growth.
GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.80. Non-GAAP was $1.12. After adjusting for the $0.06 impact from foreign
currency, non-GAAP diluted EPS grew 15%. Strong operating performance helped offset the revenue shortfall in the
quarter. And the majority of the tax benefit during the quarter was offset by a worse than expected impact of foreign
exchange on earnings.
In addition to the $385 million adjustment for amortization expense, non-GAAP adjustments to earnings on an after-tax
basis were a $24 million charge for the HeartWare acquisition fair market value inventory step-up, and a $35 million
restructuring charge, and a $2 million charge for acquisition-related items, both stemming mostly from our continued
integration of Covidien, along with expenses related to our acquisition of HeartWare, offset by a net gain from the
adjustments of our contingent consideration on prior acquisitions.
Our operating margin for the quarter was 28.9% on a constant currency basis, representing a strong 150 basis point
year-over-year improvement. Efficiencies in both the gross margin and SG&A, largely a result of execution on our
Covidien synergies, drove the increase.
We remain on track to deliver $225 million to $250 million of synergy savings in the fiscal year, and expect to deliver
on our commitment of $850 million of savings by the end of the fiscal year 2018. Our efforts to realize the Covidien
synergies are also serving as enablers to other leveraged programs designed to deliver additional long-term margin
expansions.

Net other expense was $89 million compared to $57 million in the prior year, reflecting about $90 million in reduced
foreign exchange gains versus the prior year, primarily due to our hedging program, partially offset by a $48 million
reduction in the U.S. medical device tax. While we hedge the majority of our operating results in developed market
currency to reduce earnings volatility from foreign exchange, FX can create modest volatility to the P&L above the
operating margin line. In addition, a growing portion of our profits are unhedged, especially emerging market
currencies, which can create modest volatility throughout the P&L.
Looking ahead, we remain committed to our plans to generate 130 basis points to 210 basis points of improvement in
our operating margins this fiscal year. Below the operating profit line, net interest expense was $173 million. At the end
of the second quarter, we had $32.4 billion in debt and $11.3 billion in cash and investments, of which approximately
$6 billion was trapped.
Our non-GAAP nominal tax rate on a cash basis was 14.7%. This was an improvement to our forecast, and included
$42 million of operational net tax benefit, primarily related to the write-off of a deferred tax liability associated with the
prior impairment of an investment in a foreign subsidiary. While we have had tax benefits in both Q1 and Q2, we
continue to forecast a tax rate of approximately 17% for the second half of the fiscal year.
Free cash flow was $1.2 billion. We are deploying our capital strategically, consistently and with discipline, with a
focus on reinvestment, debt reduction and return to our shareholders. We paid $593 million in dividends and
repurchased a net $985 million of our ordinary shares in the second quarter. This represented a total payout ratio of
101% on non-GAAP net income and 142% on GAAP net income.
Keep in mind, our payout ratio is elevated as we not only return 50% of our annual free cash flow to shareholders, but
also execute on our commitment to return $5 billion through incremental share repurchases by the end of fiscal year
2018. At quarter end, we had remaining authorization to repurchase approximately 39 million shares. Second quarter
average daily shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1.393 billion shares.
Before turning the call back to Omar, let me conclude with our outlook. As Omar mentioned, we continue to expect to
deliver mid-single-digit revenue and double-digit EPS growth this fiscal year. And we expect our revenue growth to
improve from the disappointing growth this past quarter. However, given the issues we outlined in the second quarter,
some of which could persist in the near term, we now expect our full year revenue growth to be within the
mid-single-digit range on a constant currency, constant week basis as opposed to the upper half of that range signaled
previously.
Moving to the back half of the fiscal year, we expect revenue growth to also be in the mid-single-digit range on a
constant currency basis. With regard to our business groups, we continue to expect MITG to grow in the mid-single
digits. And we expect RTG to grow in the low end of the mid-single-digit range, ramping in the back half of the year.
While we expect improvement from the headwinds faced in CVG and Diabetes in the second quarter, we recognized
that until some of our important new products officially launched, revenue growth is likely to continue to be effective.
For that reason, in the back half of this fiscal year, we expect CVG to deliver mid-single digit and Diabetes to deliver
mid to high-single-digit revenue growth. Keep in mind that CVG had a strong finish to last fiscal year, so on an annual
comparison basis, we expect slightly slower growth in the fourth quarter. And because we do not expect the MiniMed
670G to be on the market until the end of this fiscal year, we expect growth in Diabetes to ramp through the back half,
with stronger growth in the fourth quarter than the third. We continue to expect Diabetes to ultimately reach
double-digit revenue growth, as signaled in the past, once the MiniMed 670G is fully on the market next fiscal year.
While the impacts from currency is fluid and therefore not something we predict, if current exchange rates, which
include €1.06 and ¥110, remain stable for the remainder of the fiscal year, we expect our full year revenue to be
negatively affected by approximately $20 million to $60 million, including an approximate $10 million to $30 million
negative impact in the third quarter.
With respect to earnings, we continue to expect double-digit EPS growth on a constant currency, constant week basis
for the full fiscal year. For the back half of the fiscal year, we expect non-GAAP diluted EPS growth to be in the 8% to

10% range on a constant currency basis, given slightly less than previously expected revenue, a more normal 17%
expected tax rate, and the loss of the year-over-year benefit from a lower medical device tax starting in December.
Taking into account the estimated $0.08 to $0.10 impact from the extra week in the first quarter last fiscal year, as well
as an estimated negative foreign currency impact to our full year EPS of $0.20 to $0.22 if current exchange rates
remain stable, this EPS growth implies full year non-GAAP diluted EPS of $4.55 to $4.60.
Lastly, we are modifying our free cash flow outlook methodology. Recall that last quarter, we were forecasting an
adjusted free cash flow of $6.5 billion to $7 billion for fiscal year 2017, a range that would exclude cash payments
related to non-GAAP items that might occur during the year. Going forward, we will include these items to more
closely align our free cash flow projection with the results we report each quarter. However, in light of the
unpredictability of the precise amount and timing of cash payments, we are expanding the range. Given this, along with
the revenue and net income expectations already discussed, we expect our free cash flow for the fiscal year to be in the
range of $5 billion to $6 billion.
Now, I will return the call back to Omar.
Omar S. Ishrak
Thanks, Karen. And we will open the lines for Q&A. But before we do, I wanted to reiterate what for me are the three
key points about our Q2 performance. First, we are disappointed in our revenue performance this quarter. The issues
that caused the shortfall are identifiable, and in many cases, temporary. As I mentioned, we have several new product
introductions in the back half of the year that we expect to drive our revenue growth back to our normal range.
Second, despite our revenue challenges, our organization delivered an operational discipline, including driving the
expected Covidien synergies, which led to strong operating margin improvement and double-digit EPS growth.
And third, looking ahead, we remain confident in our ability to deliver mid-single-digit revenue growth and
double-digit EPS growth, not only in our current fiscal year, but on a sustained basis in the future. And as always, we
remain focused in creating long-term dependable value for our shareholders.
We will now open the phone lines for Q&A. In addition to Karen, I've asked Mike Coyle, President of our Cardiac and
Vascular Group; Bryan Hanson, President of our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group; Geoff Martha, President of our
Restorative Therapies Group; and Hooman Hakami, President of our Diabetes Group to join us.
We want to try to get to as many people as possible, so please help us by limiting yourself to only one question, and if
necessary, a related follow up. If you have additional questions, please contact Ryan and our Investor Relations team
after the call.
Operator, first question, please?
Q&A
Operator
The first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Sure.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Omar, I think there's pieces of it that people understand and the comments ranging from the
Diabetes business, and just the impact on demand because of the timing of MiniMed 670G or Saudi Arabia having a
significant drop off, obviously, in demand. I think probably the best way to think about kind of the one question
investors are going to have today is on the U.S. business. And so, if we looked at U.S. growth corporate-wide on an

organic basis, it's basically flat this quarter. So, I'd love to hear just kind of the group's thoughts on the health of the
U.S. device market and what appears to be some slowdown at least reflected in your results and some other companies'
results over the last quarter.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Yeah, thanks, Mike. I think the primary driver for us though is the fact that the U.S. is more
sensitive to new product cadence. And we're big enough in the market that we flex the market up and down a little bit
ourselves. And as we launch new products in the U.S., I think we will benefit accordingly.
Like I mentioned earlier, in CVG, we just launched the Evolut R XL, which will contribute to U.S. growth in the
second half and also the introduction of the Evolut PRO and Resolute Onyx in the U.S. around the end of the fiscal
year.
You mentioned Diabetes. That's primarily a U.S. launch on the MiniMed 670G. So, that, we think, again, will have a
big impact on the market. And the slowdown in Diabetes was mostly in the U.S. again, which again impacted the
overall market.
In MITG we're launching over 50 new products in the second half to drive growth. And in RTG, our continued drive on
our Speed-to-Scale launches and so on, in addition to our sales and navigation and imaging should all help the U.S. So,
we think, this is a lot in our own control. And through successful execution of new product introductions, I think, we'll
make an impact.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: And, Omar, if I look at it, just to push back just a little bit, so it's always harder to tell just
on a quarter-to-quarter basis in some of the implantables businesses, such as CRM. If I look at Surgical Solutions, the
U.S. growth in Surgical Solutions, which is pretty good barometer for device market growth, was lighter this quarter.
So, maybe if you just want to kind of comment on that.
And then just a follow-up unrelated to the actual quarters. I know there are a lot of questions coming out of the
outcome of the U.S. election and the potential for corporate tax reforms. So, Karen I don't know if you have any
preliminary thoughts on the potential implications of tax reform in the U.S. on the company, both from a change in how
tax rates are ultimately calculated and to the access to cash. Thanks.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Well, there were a number of points there, Mike. First, from a Surgical Solutions perspective,
while it is a barometer in the overall market, there were greater activity than we usually have on reprocessing, and for
which we're addressing that through some new launches in the second half. So, we think that'll impact the market.
And again, like I said before, because we're so big in the market, it does move the overall market up and down,
depending on what we do. I really don't have any hard data to comment on the overall procedures that would really
worry me as a big factor. I think our own performance is the bigger thing here.
With respect to the other points, Mike, it's too early for me to comment on any changes and so on. I mean, in the end,
we go back to our universal healthcare needs, improving clinical outcomes, driving value-based healthcare, increasing
access. Irrespective of the government and irrespective of the country, for that matter, those are the priorities, and that's
what we stay focused on. I think, as long as any reform focuses on that, I think it'll be accepted and will be successful.
It's not easy, but it's one that we must collectively address.
With respect to the tax situation, again, I don't want to speculate in what may or may not happen here, but I just want to
reiterate that the reason we did the Covidien acquisition was operational. It was primarily driven by market synergies
and broadening of our business and the way in which we can drive healthcare forward.
At that time, that was the best structure, and we continue to believe that, that is the right way for us in getting access to
our cash, which we've deployed effectively. I'm just going to leave it at that. We'll see how things roll out, and we'll
kind of go from there. But like I've said many times before, we like to control the things that we can control and
execute those well. The rest will happen around us. And it's tough for me to speculate. Thanks, Mike.

Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.
<A - Karen L. Parkhill>: Good morning, David.
Operator
One moment.
<Q - David Ryan Lewis>: I'm sorry, can you hear me?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Sure. We can, David. Go ahead.
<Q - David Ryan Lewis>: Thank you. Sorry about that. So, I appreciate your comments about sort of the growth being
in your own control, and I think investors want to hear that. But I think it's sort of undeniable in this last quarter that
U.S. implanters saw 2 points of comp adjusted deceleration, so something happened in the U.S. And I think people
want to just understand how much visibility you have on sort of this back half improvement of about 100 basis points.
So, I guess, the question once again is you have a different pacing of months relative to your peers.
I mean, have you seen enough stability or improvement in the last couple of months to believe that whatever happened
in the U.S. market here in this quarter, it at least is stable now, and that's something you can sort of build upon with
your new products? I do still think there has to be some market effect here with these new products to get investors
comfortable that at least the market in your mind is stable to improving.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Yeah, that's a fair point, David. The only thing that we pointed out was the device
replacements, where we're certainly sore. But I'll let Mike comment on the CRM market, and I'll also let Bryan
comment briefly on the surgical market, because I think that's an important question that you're asking. So, Mike, go
ahead and just answer the question directly.
<A - Michael J. Coyle>: David, the bigger impact was in the High Power segment. In fact, the pacing market was
pretty much in line with what we were expecting. So, the High Power side of the equation, we saw a slightly lower
growth in initial implants, but we're now looking at high-single-digit declines in replacements for the market. And that's
something different than we had seen historically.
As we go forward, we think that we're in a particularly impacted area of CRT, and that, that will get better going
forward. But we also expect on the High Power side for standard ICD that there will be this replacement headwind
that's principally coming from the fact that there were lower device implants five, seven years ago when these devices
were being put in, in terms of initial trajectory. But an even more important impact is the lengthening life of these
devices because of improvements that we've made to the technology to extend their battery life. And that will be a bit
of a headwind for us going forward.
But what's going to work in our favor is pipeline. If you remember, from TCT, in the first half of the year across all of
our businesses within CVG, I think, we probably had four, five new product introductions in major geographies. That's
going to go up to – with our 25 in the back half, with some very important ones in the device implantables area,
including extending the 3T MRI, as we bring you the [ph] DES (32:54) to Japan, and a large number of other ones that
I mentioned at TCT and identified as being catalysts for us going forward. So, I think those are going to be things that
we can count on to help our share position, and hopefully, also help with market growth.

<A - Bryan C. Hanson>: Yeah. Obviously, we're pretty focused on the same thing. We look at a number of different
data points and hearing comments from folks like yourself in other businesses. And I hear some people say that things
are stable. I hear some people say it's down. I look internally first to try to get a sense, and I kind of hear mix the same
way. So, until I see something definitive, I feel like the procedures had stayed stable from quarter to quarter. And even
if I saw something in the quarter, unless I see a couple of quarters in a row, it's not really a solid data point there. So, I
haven't seen anything or feel like we should redirect on volume.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Okay.
<Q - David Ryan Lewis>: Okay.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Okay, David.
<Q - David Ryan Lewis>: And just maybe two quick follow-ups, Omar, maybe one for Hooman and one for Karen.
So, Hooman, just, I think we all understand the disruption in light of MiniMed 670G. But I think earlier on, a few
months ago, there was more enthusiasm around MiniMed 630G and the reward program, just sort of bridge that gap.
And I guess the question is, did something change in sort of your view about the receptivity of MiniMed 630G in the
transition or reward program? That's first question.
And for Karen, can you just update us where we are on the buyback program? I think the commentary was most of that
was going to get completed in the early part of the year. Have you basically exhausted that buyback, or what's
remaining for the remainder of the year? Thanks so much.
<A - Hooman C. Hakami>: Okay. David, with the MiniMed 630G, your question, specifically, look, what I would say
is once we had this product in the hands of our sales team and in front of physicians and patients, we actually saw good
momentum with the product. Maybe just to provide a reminder, this was approved in early August. And it takes a few
weeks to demo it, to get it in front of the sales team, to get it in front of physicians, and that makes August for us a
tough comparison.
Then when we get the MiniMed 670G approved, which was much earlier than expected, we implemented the Priority
Access Program, and we saw, as the commentary suggested, some good uptick with respect to that, but primarily from
early adopters. So, I think if you take a look at it on balance, I think the MiniMed 630G, once it was in the marketplace,
performed well.
I think our dynamic, which was purely U.S.-based, was the fact that in less than two months, we had two major product
approvals in the same geography. And there's operational transition that comes with this. And there's a degree of, I
would say, perhaps confusion and disruption to demand because of that, and that was really the biggest catalyst.
Now, going forward, we still remain very excited that the enthusiasm around the MiniMed 670G is great. So, we think
that, as the commentary suggested, we're going to ramp. But once this thing is full scale, we'll return to double-digit
growth.
<A - Karen L. Parkhill>: And, David, on the buyback comment, we have purchased $2.5 billion so far this year. We
continue to remain committed to repurchasing a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow, along with that incremental $5
billion repurchase that we expect to complete over a three-year timeframe from fiscal 2016 to 2018.
As you do know, we typically do front-end load our share buybacks, not only in the fiscal year, but even this $5 billion
incremental share buyback, we have tended to front load in that three-year timeframe. We still do have some
incremental buybacks to go in the second half, some of that related to our free cash flow, and some of that related to
continuing to repurchase the $5 billion, but we typically do front-end load.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Great. Thanks, David, for your question.
<Q - David Ryan Lewis>: Great. Thank you very much.
<A - Ryan Weispfenning>: Yes, thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.
<A - Karen L. Parkhill>: Good morning, Kristen.
<Q - Kristen Stewart>: Can you guys hear me?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Yes, Kristen. Go ahead. Kristen, I can't hear you anymore.
<Q - Kristen Stewart>: Can you hear me now?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Yes. Go ahead.
<Q - Kristen Stewart>: Oh, good, sorry. In light of these results, does this change your thoughts on maybe smaller
incremental tuck-in acquisitions? I know you seem pretty confident that these are more transient issues, but how are
you just thinking from more of an M&A perspective in the market?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: No, I think, to some degree, we've executed well on the M&A, both small as well as mid-size
tuck-in acquisitions. And they helped us actually this quarter in diversifying our revenue base, and giving us a
much-needed boost. I think our ability to execute those is pretty good, and I'm thinking about those the right way. As
I've said before, we're disciplined about our cash allocation. And we've done a lot this year, so we're watching it very
carefully. And the bar's a little high. But that's purely to do with our capital allocation, not to do with our execution of
any of these market dynamics. I think, in many ways, we continue to look at different opportunities.
<Q - Kristen Stewart>: Okay. I don't know how large the deferral is right now. Is there anything to quantify maybe on
the Diabetes side how large the deferral is or impacting that growth rate right now?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: I think it's tough to quantify that. That's a portion of the drop in our growth rate in Diabetes. I
think the delay in actual shipment is the bigger portion.
<Q - Kristen Stewart>: Okay.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: But the deferral is only a limited amount.
<Q - Kristen Stewart>: Okay. Perfect. Thanks very much.

<Q - Bob Hopkins>: Great. Good morning. So, thanks for taking the questions. I want to start out just – I think it
would be helpful if you guys could try to quantify the things that you're saying were temporary or kind of one-time in
nature for this fiscal second quarter. So, either in aggregate or broken down by the various things that you kind of
called out, like the neuro recall, diabetes, the tenders. Is there a way to kind of quantify that and the impact on revenue
growth for Q2?

<A - Karen L. Parkhill>: In general, I would say, Bob, that the headwind that we faced in the quarter caused us to
move from our typical mid-single-digit growth range to the 3%. And again, we don't think that, that is something that
will continue. We've guided in the back half to go back to the mid-single-digit range.
<Q - Bob Hopkins>: Okay. So, just as a broad comment, but no specific quantification. Okay. So, the other things I
wanted to just ask about real quickly was, Karen, one for you. Can you just give us a sense as to the free cash flow
guidance you're giving for 2017 on an apples-to-apples basis? Because I know you've changed in the way you're talking
about it. So, what was it at the beginning of the year? What is it now?
And then for Mike or Omar, I was wondering if you could just comment on the TAVR business? Now, both you and
Edwards have reported numbers that were a little bit below what the Street was forecasting. Can you just comment on
the state of the TAVR market? And also, on the state of the U.S. ICD market. I mean, things have really slowed down
there. What's the sustainable growth rate in your mind at this point? Thank you.
<A - Karen L. Parkhill>: Yeah.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Karen? Go ahead, first.
<A - Karen L. Parkhill>: On free cash flow, yes, we are changing our guidance to match what our actual free cash
flow is as opposed to before the one-time items that can impact the cash flow. So, our former guidance was $6.5 billion
to $7 billion adjusted, not including those one-time items. And going forward, as I said, we'll be trying to match what
our actual free cash flow is with $5 billion to $6 billion.
I don't have an actual apples to apples, because it's very difficult to predict those one-time items. But I would say that,
in general, the cash flow guidance has not changed substantially. It's just that going forward we'll be focused on trying
to focus on the actual, and that's based on feedback that we've gotten from several investors.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Mike, do you want to take the market question on Cardiology, yeah.
<A - Michael J. Coyle>: In terms of TAVR, the overall market grew around 30%. We obviously were in the high
teens. It's sort of the story of international versus U.S, right. In the U.S., we're waiting for the 34-millimeter to impact
the market. We expect to be able to then participate in the market growth that we're seeing, which we think is actually
quite strong for the U.S.
In terms of High Power, during the quarter, it looked like market growth was on the order of down mid digits. We
actually did a bit better than that because of share capture. And as I mentioned, we have a pretty robust set of new
products [indiscernible] (42:24) at TCT that we expect to help us grow faster than the market. Our models would tell us
things should moderate a bit relative to replacement cycle, but a bit. And I think we're still looking at a down market in
the low to mid-single digit.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic with UBS.
<Q - Matt Miksic>: Hey. Thanks for taking the question. So, I think we've covered a lot of the sort of top line issues in
the quarter. I wanted to, Omar, ask you about something that came out of the VEITHsymposium in your presentation
with the Aortic and Peripheral group there. Just on contracting, something you've commented on before, the amount of
sort of multiline contracting that you've seen taking up in the U.S. and something that was presented there, took that
maybe a step further into introducing this idea of a warrantee offer in exchange for commitments from clients. And
love if you could elaborate a little bit on that, and maybe if you see the application of that in other areas. And then I

have one follow up.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Well, I'm going to make a brief comment on this, and then I'll let Mike kind of comment a
little further on the specifics of the example that you just state. But the main overriding comment I would make is that
the example you state is truly an example of value-based healthcare. And value-based healthcare means that we become
a company who are paid for outcomes, as opposed to the product itself. And that's a long-term journey, but eventually,
we think that, that's the right thing for healthcare, that's the right thing for us. It'll make us a more efficient team in our
R&D, and we'll get rewarded for what we innovate, and healthcare will get the right value. And in the long-term,
outcomes and lower cost.
So, that model, you'll see us replicate in many other areas. And like I've described in the chronic care world, with the
Diabeter and with NOK, and we've talked a lot about our antibacterial sleeve, which also has same kind of model, so
you'll see a lot of these things from us, these value-based healthcare models. And that one example that you state is
only the beginning. I think our size helps us with a seat at the table to do these contracts, and so I think it'll give us a
differentiated advantage, not only because of our size, but because of our ability to innovate and link them to outcomes.
Mike any quick specifics on the particular examples again?
<A - Michael J. Coyle>: As we mentioned, we've been attempting to drive more of our revenue into multiline
contracts in order to increase stickiness of share versus new products coming into the market. And we're now – up to
38% of CVG revenue in the U.S. is tied up in multiline contracts. So, what you've specifically identified is a trend that
we're trying to basically take products where we have clearly demonstrated superior outcomes and then create
performance guarantees that allow us to then do what Omar said, become a value-based healthcare company. We've
done that extensively with the anti-infective envelope TYRX in the CRM business and what was being outlined by the
APV team there at VEITH was really using the strong clinical evidence around Endurant and Endurant IIS to basically
create performance guarantees to drive market share in that segment.
<Q - Matt Miksic>: That's helpful. And as a follow-up, just understanding the disappointing growth in the quarter for
a variety of reasons that you've talked about and has been discussed on the call. If you could maybe revisit the
long-term growth, this mid-single digit growth objective that you put out there, and what the components of that are.
Expecting an improvement in the back half, should this include – we expect this to include obviously the contribution
of HeartWare this year, incremental other acquisitions going forward. Any thoughts on just geography and where you
are with the growth vectors you've talked about? Just how do you get there, and what are the components of that? That
would be very helpful.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: First, let me point out that we haven't come off the mid-single-digit estimate for the year.
We're still seeing that. And this quarter is not one that we're happy with, like I've said, and it's not one that we want to
repeat. And so, we're completely confident in our ability to drive sustained mid-single-digit growth, and all our
strategies are aimed towards that. And those strategies cover our ability to produce new products across a variety of
market segments. Typically, that diversity would protect us. It just so happened this quarter that a collection of them all
happened together. In addition to that, we've got geographic diversity, which we're building, and that's our drive
towards emerging markets, where we've actually, even with the enormous impact in Saudi, still delivered closer at 10%
emerging market growth.
Short of our overall sort of basis point target of 150 basis points to 200 basis points, but one that we think will pick up
over time, and we want to get more to the middle of that target rather than the low end. And the services and solutions,
a longer-term effort, but again, another one which will give us sustained growth in the long-term.
So, we're deploying multiple strategies for sustained and consistent mid-single-digit growth, which employs addressing
new therapies, cadence of product innovation, different market segments within that, geographic diversification, a real
focus in emerging markets and creating this new services and solutions growth vector, along the lines that you
described earlier based on our value-based healthcare initiatives. So, again...
<Q - Matt Miksic>: And strategic investment? I'm sorry to interrupt, Omar, but in...

<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Sure.
<Q - Matt Miksic>: ...strategic investment also, part of that.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Yes.
<Q - Matt Miksic>: It's not one of your vectors per se, but I guess how would you think about that in terms of your
cost target?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Yes. Strategic investments would be – well, let's put it in two ways. First of all, tuck-in
acquisitions is part of our overall mid-single-digit sort of targeting. And recall that we're driving these tuck-in
acquisitions where we're balancing internal costs. So, we're not changing our – double-digit EPS growth guidance stays
the same while we do these acquisitions. So, we consider them, although acquisitions, we make internal trade-offs to
fund them. So, that's the way we think about those. Bigger strategic acquisitions they're always possible, like what
we've done in the past, but they have to drive our strategies. That's actually the strategic fit that we can satisfy and
quantify for ourselves before we go into that. So, that's the way we look at it.
<Q - Matt Miksic>: Very helpful color. Thank you.
<A - Ryan Weispfenning>: Thanks, Matt. We'll take the next question.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Larry Biegelsen>: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just starting off with the fiscal 2017
guidance. I think it would be helpful if you can talk a little bit about where you'd expect things to get better in the third
and fourth quarters versus the second quarter. So, you grew 3% constant currency this quarter. It sounds like you expect
that to improve in the third quarter. Is that correct? And can you talk a little bit about specifically what gets better? And
then on the EPS guidance, I know you don't provide quarterly guidance, but typically, I think the third quarter is about
$0.03 higher than the second quarter. Do you expect that to be the case this year?
<A - Karen L. Parkhill>: Yes.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Let me take the revenue question. We were pretty clear in the sense that there's a whole series
of new product launches that will come in the back half, all the way from TAVR towards the end of the fiscal year, the
Resolute Onyx. We've got 15 new product introductions in Surgical Solutions. We will address the reprocessing. And
most importantly, we've got the MiniMed 670G, which we'll launch toward the end of the fiscal year. And we expect a
ramp-up in growth as the next two quarters go by. So, we do think that a significant shift in our new product cadence
will give us enough growth to take us well within the single-digit range in the back half. And then also, we haven't
talked much about it, but the improvement in Spine and the RTG growth starts to move up to the mid-single-digit range
which wasn't before.
So, all of these are the main factors. To be clear, look, we'd stated that the device replacement market in ICDs will
continue to slow. We're not expecting that to turn around. We expect that the NHS and the buying patterns in the U.K.
to remain slow for the remainder of the year. We expect the Middle East to remain where it is. So, we're going to say
that those market trends will continue. The rest are all new product related, and our cadence will address it. I think
that's the breadth of it.
<A - Karen L. Parkhill>: And I would just add, because you're asking about quarterly gaining too. For CVG, in
particular, we do expect a little bit stronger growth rate in the third quarter than the fourth quarter, just given a very
strong finish at the end of the year for that business. And as I mentioned in RTG, because of the product introduction,
we do expect that to ramp up through the back half from the third to the fourth quarter. Same with Diabetes, a ramp-up
from the third to the fourth quarter. In terms of EPS, it's typically flat, so there's not a big difference that you had
mentioned in the third, fourth. And we don't typically give guidance.

<Q - Larry Biegelsen>: Understood. But just to be clear, do you expect to be in the mid-single-digit range in fiscal
Q3? And just lastly, given the result this quarter, how do you feel about the long-term operating margin goals that you
provided at the analyst meeting this past June? Thanks for taking my questions, guys.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: First, we expect to be in the mid-single digit in the back half and in the early part of Q3 as
well. I think we stated that. Look, I'll state again, we're not going to make a habit of missing the mid-single-digit goal
even in the quarter, and I'm extremely focused on that and one that we will address. So, our mid-single-digit goal is one
that certainly for the year is still valid and one that we expect to get back to in the second half of the year.
In terms of operating margin, I mean that is one of the positives of this quarter, that we did deliver strong operating
margin improvement, 150 basis points of constant currency improvement. We're on track. Our synergies are coming
up, our value capture programs are all delivering, our gross margins actually are in line with what we expect. So, we
are certainly still in sync with what we presented at the analyst conference in terms of operating margin enhancements.
And I think this quarter is a signal that we, in fact, can execute towards that. Now, we're going to do that in future
quarters, but that's the way we see it right now.
<Q - Larry Biegelsen>: Thank you.
<A - Karen L. Parkhill>: And we have talked about that operating leverage improving throughout the year. So, in the
first quarter, we had 100 basis point improvement; second quarter 150 basis points, and we expect it to continue to get a
little bit better from here.
<Q - Larry Biegelsen>: Thanks for taking the questions, guys.
<A - Ryan Weispfenning>: Thanks, Larry. Next question?
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Raj Denhoy with Jefferies.
<Q - Raj Denhoy>: Hi. Good morning. I wonder if I could ask a little bit about the idea of growth accelerating again
towards the back half. I know it's been covered quite a bit, but part of what potentially we're seeing though is that as
some of these product cycles wane and some of your competitors launch sort of responsive products, the question is
really, is what you're bringing enough to replace what is sort of waning? And is it really just a situation where perhaps
the better parts of some of these businesses may be behind you for a period of time?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: No, we don't think so. I think you've just got to look at the product cadence. I mean, if I take
Diabetes, for example, I mean, clearly that's a revolutionary new product which isn't in the market at all, and we think
the benefits of that are yet to come. I mean, that's a clear example of a breakthrough product line. And I think in both
CVG and MITG, and certainly in RTG, and all our product segments, I mean, these are strong products. Stuff that we're
doing in the transcatheter market are significant enhancements to what we've had before, and we expect traction on
those.
So, we think, our product pipeline is robust. We described that in the analyst meeting. We haven't come off any of that.
Our feeling about their impact is no less than what it was then. It just so happened that the timing of these launches,
coupled with some really severe market headwinds, all at the same time just kind of – there was a concurrence of these
events in one quarter. And we expect that sort of collection of circumstances not to repeat. And we think that the
robustness of our pipeline will come through, and we'll get the appropriate benefits. So, our excitement around new
products and our confidence has not been shaken at all as to their viability and what they can do to the market and to
patients.
<Q - Raj Denhoy>: Fair enough. And then maybe just one quick one on the new orthopedic offering, which you gave a
little more detail around. Perhaps you could just help us understand or frame the opportunity in terms of what you
expect from that? Because there are sort of two pieces to it, right, there's the consulting services, but then there's also

the unique aspect of bringing an orthopedic knee line to the market. And so, maybe could you just give us some
high-level thoughts on how you think that business will start to contribute over the next couple of years?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: I think I'm actually going to let Geoff kind of put some – why don't you go ahead, Geoff, some
color on that?
<A - Geoffrey S. Martha>: Yeah. Sure, Raj. We're, right now – obviously this is new for us. And we don't have a
scalable amount of the need to sell quite yet. So, the early interest that we're seeing is strong from surgeons that have
skin in the game, and we're seeing demand, that's for the knee.
And then for hospitals, there's a lot of interest around these risk-sharing partnerships, but it's new to them. And these
are complex agreements, so that's taking a little bit more time. But we're feeling bullish about this. But we haven't
provided any specific guidance yet, because it is so new, the concept, right, you've got these risk-bearing partnerships,
and that's really the centerpiece of the offering, and it's very difficult to forecast the speed of the ramp. And so, we
haven't provided any guidance.
I'll just tell you that we're still feeling – we're happy with the response we're getting, and we're still feeling positive
about it, both the risk-bearing partnership component, which is the centerpiece and then the underlying technologies,
the Aquamantys technology that we sell in our advanced energy business, as well as the new implants, the knee, and
down the road, the hip.
<Q - Raj Denhoy>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Ryan Weispfenning>: Thanks, Raj. We'll go to the next question, please.

Your next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen & Company.
<Q - Joshua Jennings>: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Omar, I was hoping you could help us
out thinking into calendar 2017, there's been some concerns, with Trump being elected and the start of an ACA repeal,
that volumes could suffer as there's either a transition or a formal repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Can you help us
think about that? And in the setting of the fiscal Q2 performance, the organic growth in the first half has been
challenged and was just – one of the levers you guys haven't pulled is pruning, post the Covidien acquisition. Any
thoughts there in terms of accelerating that process or that initiative?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Well, let me take those questions one at a time. First of all, with respect to the healthcare
policy, again, I don't want to speculate as to what's going to happen here. But what I do know, which I've stated
consistent in the past, is that a move towards value-based healthcare, a move towards a regime where the entire
healthcare market gets rewarded for producing better outcomes will not only lower costs, but that's the only way
forward. And it doesn't really matter which administration is in place or in which country you're in. That is a basic fact
grounded in logic, and I think a focus on that will prevail. And I think that will be important in any future policies that
are made. And there's an alignment of stakeholders pushing in that direction.
With respect to the...
<A - Karen L. Parkhill>: Pruning.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: ...to the pruning, look, we look at divestitures and acquisitions with the same lens. Does it fit
our strategy? Can we win in that marketplace? Can we do our financial metrics of returning 50% back to the
shareholders and growing mid-single digits and double-digit EPS growth? I mean, do those financial metrics – are they
in line with that acquisition or not, or divestiture, or not? And based on those factors we make decisions, and certainly,
we're looking at different areas of our business all the time. And you should expect to get periodic updates from us on
that score. Did I miss any point?

<Q - Joshua Jennings>: No.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: All right, thanks.
<Q - Joshua Jennings>: Thanks for that. I would like to just ask one for Karen. Just on looking out into next year, I
know it's impossible to predict currency moves, but if the currency rates were to remain constant here, can you help us
understand whether there would be a headwind or tailwind in terms of hedging gains or losses in fiscal 2018? And just
the reason I'm asking is, because we do have the medical device tax benefit rolling off next year starting in fiscal 2Q.
So, just wanted to get a sense of when the reported operating margin would more closely mirror the constant currency
operating margin performance. Thanks a lot.
<A - Karen L. Parkhill>: Yeah. No, happy to take that. What I mentioned is we certainly can't predict exchange rates,
but if they do remain stable, where they are today, and two of the biggest rates that we are exposed to are the euro and
the yen, so if they remain stable to about €1.06 and ¥110 for the remainder of the fiscal year, I mentioned we would
expect our revenue to be negatively impacted by approximately $20 million to $60 million. And this takes into account
our hedging program too. It's not just our natural exposure. And on an EPS basis, we would expect full year EPS to be
$0.20 to $0.22 impacted. And we will give guidance for FY 2018 when we typically do at a later date.
<A - Ryan Weispfenning>: Great. Thanks, Josh. Let's take one more question.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Okay.
<A - Ryan Weispfenning>: We got time for one more.

Your final question comes from the line of Chris Pasquale with Guggenheim.
<Q - Chris Pasquale>: Thanks. Thanks, guys, for squeezing me in. One for Mike and then a quick one for Karen.
Mike, your U.S. TAVR share is down about 10 points, by our math, over the past year. That's a pretty big shift. How
much of that do you think was the lack of a large [indiscernible] (01:03:17) product? And are you seeing, in just the
couple of weeks here since the approval, a noticeable pickup in those cases?
<A - Michael J. Coyle>: The vast majority of that share decline is in that segment. We estimate it represents about
25% to 30% of the overall market, and our shares there were substantially lower than the other three sides. And so, as
we bring that in, we would expect it would normalize those shares and grow above the market as we do.
<Q - Chris Pasquale>: Okay. And then, Karen, tax has been a pretty meaningful source of upside over the past couple
of quarters. You mentioned you expected to go back up to about 17% in the back half of the year. Just walk through
why that is. Why that shouldn't stay at the rates we've seen the last couple quarters?
<A - Karen L. Parkhill>: Yeah. It's very difficult to predict the one-time benefit that we would get in tax. They are
spotty, they tend to be large, they impacted us positively this quarter, but we can't count on them all the time. And so,
that's why we focus on our more normal 17% tax rate going forward.
<Q - Chris Pasquale>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - Ryan Weispfenning>: Thanks, Chris.
Omar S. Ishrak
Okay. So, with that, it's time to end the call. But before I finish, I have to repeat the three main points about this call
and about our performance and outlook. Like I said several times, we're not happy about the revenue performance this
quarter, but we do think that the reasons for the shortfall are identifiable, and in most cases temporary. And we expect
our new product introductions primarily to drive a recovery in the back half of the year and in longer term. Second,

look, we acknowledge the fact that our organization delivered an operational discipline and delivered strong operating
margin and double-digit EPS growth this quarter.
And finally, we remain confident in our overall strategy that we laid out in our analyst meeting. Mid-single-digit
revenue growth and double-digit EPS growth on a constant currency basis, not only this fiscal year, but sustained into
the future. And that is something that we're certainly not coming off.
Okay. So, with that, I'd like to thank you all for your interest and your questions. And on behalf of our entire
management team, also, thank you for your continued support and interest in Medtronic. And for those of you in the
U.S., I want to wish you and your families a very happy Thanksgiving. And we look forward to updating you on our
progress in our Q3 call, which we currently anticipate holding on Tuesday, February 21. Thank you.
