Good morning, everybody, and welcome to Union Pacific's third quarter earnings conference call. With me here today
in Omaha are Eric Butler, Chief Marketing Officer; Cameron Scott, Chief Operating Officer; and Rob Knight, Chief
Financial Officer.
This morning, Union Pacific is reporting net income of $1.1 billion for the third quarter of 2016. This equates to $1.36
per share, which compares to $1.50 in the third quarter of 2015. Total volume decreased 6% in the quarter compared to

2015. Carload volume declined in five of our six commodity groups, with coal and industrial products both down
double-digits. Agricultural product volumes were up a robust 11% this quarter versus 2015, as grain shipments finally
started to show some strength.
The quarterly operating ratio came in at 62.1%, which is up 1.8 percentage points from the record third quarter last year
but improved 3.1 percentage points from the second quarter of this year. Continued momentum from our productivity
initiatives, as well as positive core pricing, helped partially offset the decline in total carload volumes. While many of
the same volume challenges have continued throughout the year, we are keeping a laser focus on our six value tracks.
This strategy ensures we provide our customers with an excellent value proposition and service experience while
efficiently and safely managing our resources.
Our team will give you more of the details, starting with Eric.
Eric L. Butler
Thanks, Lance, and good morning. In the third quarter, our volume was down 6%, with near-record agricultural
products shipments more than offset by declines in each of the business groups. We generated core pricing gains of
1.5% in the quarter, reflecting the impacts of competitive markets in a weak economic environment, particularly in our
energy-related and international intermodal businesses. Despite these challenges, we continue to achieve solid,
reinvestable returns, even in these difficult markets, and we remain committed to achieving positive core pricing gains
that reflect our value proposition over the long term. The decline in volume and the 2% lower average revenue per car
drove a 7% reduction in freight revenue.
Let's take a closer look at the performance for each of our six business groups. Ag products revenue gained 6% on an
11% volume increase and a 4% decrease in average revenue per car. A robust U.S. grain supply and lower commodity
prices generated export strength and lifted grain volumes 27% in the quarter. Wheat exports rebounded in the second
half of the quarter, as adverse weather in South America caused significant losses, elevating demand for the higher
protein U.S. wheat. Grain products carloads advanced 5% in the quarter, primarily due to increased ethanol exports and
biodiesel shipments.
Food and refrigerated carloads were flat in the quarter, as strong demand for import beer offset softness in refrigerated
food shipments and import sugar. Automotive revenue was down 8% in the quarter, driven by a 2% decrease in volume
and a 6% reduction in average revenue per car. Finished vehicle shipments decreased 7% by sales and production
levels of passenger vehicles impacting key Union Pacific served plants and contract changes we referenced last quarter
that will continue to impact our volumes through the first part of 2017.
In total, finished vehicle sales in the quarter were at a seasonally averaged average rate of $17.5 million, up 2% from
the second quarter but down 2% from the 2015 third quarter. On the parts side, a continued focus on over-the-road
conversions drove a 5% increase in volume. Chemicals revenue was down 1% for the quarter on a 1% decrease in
volume and a 1% increase in average revenue per car. We continue to see headwinds on crude oil shipments, which
were down 48% due to lower crude oil prices, regional pricing differences, and available pipeline capacity.
Chemicals volume excluding crude oil shipments was up 2% in the quarter. Partially offsetting the declines in crude oil
were strength in other areas, including industrial chemicals, which was up 3% in the quarter. Coal revenue declined
19% for the quarter on a 14% decrease in volume and 6% decline in average revenue per car. Sequentially, however,
overall coal tonnage increased 40% from the second quarter of this year. Powder River Basin and Colorado/Utah
tonnage declined 17% and 16% respectively in the quarter, as increased demands from a warmer-than-average summer
was unable to offset high coal stockpiles. PRB coal inventory levels in September were 90 days, down 13 days from
June but still 27 days above the five-year average.
Industrial products revenue was down 13% on an 11% decline in volume and a 2% decrease in average revenue per car
during the quarter. Minerals volume was down 22% in the quarter, driven by a 26% decrease in frac sand car loadings,
impacted by lower crude oil prices and decreased drilling activity. Construction products volume was down 8% due to

weather-impacted construction activity in the South. A strong U.S. dollar, weak commodity pricing, and increased
imports pushed metal shipments down 13% year over year.
Intermodal revenue was down 9% on a 7% decline in volume and a 2% decrease in average revenue per car. Domestic
intermodal volume declined 2% in the quarter. Excluding headwinds from the previously discussed discontinuation of
Triple Crown's service, domestic was nearly flat. International volumes were down 11% in the quarter, as the industry
continued to face significant headwinds from weaker global trade activity, softer domestic sales, high retail inventories,
and the Hanjin bankruptcy.
To wrap up, let's take a look at our outlook. In ag products, we expect a healthy U.S. harvest and strong world demand
for U.S. grain to drive favorable export trends. Grain products will continue to be strong, driven by ethanol exports. In
food and refrigerated, we expect continued strength in beer imports.
Turning to autos, light vehicle sales are forecasted to finish 2016 at $17.4 million, down less than half a percent from
the 2015 record rate of $17.5 million. Although we expect sales incentives, low gasoline prices, and consumer
preference will continue to drive demand, we remain cautious with respect to auto sales sustaining at these levels. A
continued focus on over-the-road conversions will support growth auto parts growth.
Our chemicals franchise is expected to remain stable, with strength in LPG and industrial chemicals offset by declines
in crude oil. Coal volumes will continue to be impacted by natural gas prices, high inventory levels and export demand.
As always, weather conditions will be a key factor of demand. In industrial products, lower crude prices and reduced
drilling activity are expected to continue to challenge minerals volumes. We anticipate a softer year-end for metals, as
imports continue to impact domestic shipments and customers manage year-end inventories. We expect lumber to be
stronger in the fourth quarter as housing starts continue to expand.
Finally, in intermodal, our international volumes will continue to be adversely impacted by a strained ocean carrier
industry, offset partially by over-the-road highway conversions. In the face of a number of uncertainties in the
worldwide economy, our diverse franchise remains well-positioned for growth as the economy slowly improves. We
remain committed to strengthening our customer value proposition and driving new business opportunities.
With that, I'll turn it over to Cameron for an update on our operating performance.
Cameron A. Scott
Thanks, Eric, and good morning. Starting with our safety performance. Our year-to-date reportable personally injury
rate improved 16% versus 2015 to a record low 0.77%. Included in this was a record low number of severe injuries,
which have the greatest human and financial impact. Although we continue to make significant improvement, we won't
be satisfied until we reach our goal of zero incidents, getting every one of our employees home safely at the end of each
day.
With respect to rail equipment incidents or derailments, our year-to-date reportable rate of 3.13% improved 4% versus
last year. While we made only a slight improvement on the reportable rate, enhanced TE&Y training and continued
infrastructure investments helped significantly reduce the absolute number of incidents, including those that do not
meet the reportable threshold, to a record low. In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate increased 13% to 2.55.
We continue to focus on driving improvement by reinforcing public awareness through various channels, including
public safety campaigns and community partnerships.
Moving to network performance. While the California wildfires and flooding along various parts of our network
created some challenges during the quarter, our network proved resilient as we continued to achieve solid operating
performance. Effective use of our surge locomotive fleet and TE&Y workforce were critical to minimize the impact of
these network challenges. As reported to the AAR, velocity improved 2% when compared to the third quarter of 2015.
Terminal dwell also improved 2%. But the benefits of a fluid network were somewhat offset by productivity gains such
as longer train lengths and other network management initiatives.

Moving on to resources. As part of our ongoing business planning process, we continue to adjust resource levels to
account for volume changes and productivity gains. As a result, our total TE&Y workforce was down 14% when
compared to the same quarter last year but up 2% sequentially from the second quarter to efficiently handle the 8%
volume increase experienced since the end of June. We also continue to evaluate all other aspects of the business with
the goal of driving productivity throughout the organization.
This includes the rightsizing of our engineering and mechanical work force, which was down a combined 1,900
employees or 9% versus the third quarter of last year. Our active locomotive fleet was down 9% from the third quarter
of 2015 but up 2% sequentially to handle the increase in carloads. As you know, we've been planning for the
acquisition of 230 new locomotives this year. We now expect that number to be 200 locomotives this year, with the
delivery of 30 units delayed into 2017. This would add to the 70 units previously scheduled in 2017 for a total of 100
next year. We're adjusting our 2016 capital program down about $100 million to just under $3.6 billion, primarily
driven by this change in locomotive deliveries.
Turning to network productivity. While we remain focused on effectively balancing our resources, we also continue to
realize efficiency gains through several productivity initiatives. Train length is a significant productivity driver and a
primary focus area for us. During the quarter, our manifest and grain networks ran at all-time record train length levels,
while our automotive network set a third quarter record. Recrew rate, a cost incurred when the first crew has
insufficient time to complete the trip, is an indicative measure of the fluidity and productivity of our network. Our third
quarter recrew rate was 2.3%, a near 2 point improvement from 2015 and a third quarter record.
As we move forward, we expect our safety strategy will continue yielding positive results on our way to an
incident-free environment. And where growth opportunities arise, we'll leverage that growth to the bottom line through
increased utilization of existing assets while maintaining our intense focus on productivity and efficiency across the
network.
With that, I'll turn it over to Rob.
Robert M. Knight, Jr.
Thanks and good morning. Let's start with a recap of our third quarter results. Operating revenue was about $5.2 billion
in the quarter, down 7% versus last year. Lower volumes and lower fuel surcharges more than offset positive core
pricing achieved in the quarter. Operating expenses totaled just over $3.2 billion. Lower fuel costs, volume-related
reductions, and strong productivity improvements drove the 4% improvement compared to last year.
Operating income totaled almost $2 billion, an 11% decrease from last year. Below the line, other income totaled $29
million, roughly flat versus 2015. Interest expense of $184 million was up 17% compared to the previous year. The
increase was driven by additional debt issuance over the last 12 months as well as about $8 million for the fees
associated with our recent debt exchange transaction. This increase was partially offset by a lower effective interest
rate.
Income tax expense decreased about 14% to $674 million, driven primarily by lower pre-tax earnings. Net income
totaled just over $1.1 billion, down 13% versus 2015, while the outstanding share balance declined 4% as a result of
our continued share repurchase activity. These results combined to produce quarterly earnings of $1.36 per share.
Turning now to our top line. Freight revenue of $4.8 billion was down 7% versus last year, primarily driven by a 6%
decline in volumes. Fuel surcharge revenue totaled $173 million, down $141 million when compared to 2015 but up
$86 million from the second quarter of this year. All-in, we estimate the net impact of lower fuel prices was a $0.05
headwind to earnings in the third quarter versus last year.
The business mix impact on freight revenue in the third quarter was about flat, similar to what we experienced in the
second quarter. Year-over-year growth in agricultural product shipments and declines in international intermodal
volumes were positive contributors to mix, which were offset by declines in industrial products and finished vehicles
volumes. Core price was a positive contributor to freight revenue in the quarter at about 1.5%.

Slide 21 provides more detail on our pricing trends. As Eric just mentioned, pricing gains this quarter reflect a
competitive marketplace and a soft economic environment. Going forward, we remain committed to our focus on
positive, return-driven core pricing which reflects the value proposition that we provide our customers.
Moving on to the expense side. Slide 22 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which
decreased 6% versus 2015. The decrease was primarily driven by a combination of lower volumes, improved labor
efficiencies, and fewer people in the training pipeline. General wage and benefit inflation partially offset these
decreases. Labor inflation was about 3% in the third quarter, driven primarily by general wage increases and health and
welfare expense, which were partially offset by some favorable pension costs. We still expect full-year labor inflation
to be about 2% and overall inflation to be about 1.5% for the year. As a result of lower volumes, solid productivity
gains, and a smaller capital workforce, total workforce levels declined 10% in the quarter year over year, or more than
4,700 employees. Looking sequentially, total workforce levels were down about 1% from the second quarter of this
year. For the fourth quarter, we expect our force levels to be similar to the third quarter and also down somewhat from
the prior year as comps get a little bit more difficult.
Turning to the next slide, fuel expense totaled $392 million, down 19% when compared to 2015. Lower diesel fuel
prices along with a 6% decline in gross ton miles drove the decrease in fuel expense for the quarter. Compared to the
third quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rate improved 2% to a record 1.075, while our average fuel price
declined 13% to $1.57 per gallon.
Moving on to our other expense categories. Purchased services and materials expense decreased 4% to $566 million.
The reduction was primarily driven by lower volume-related expense and reduced locomotive and freight car repair and
maintenance costs. Depreciation expense was $512 million, up 1% compared to 2015, driven primarily by higher
depreciable asset base. For the full year, we still expect depreciation expense to increase slightly compared to last year.
Slide 25 summarizes the remaining two expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $282 million,
which was down 7% when compared to 2015. Lower volumes, which reduced car hire expense, and reduced
locomotive lease costs were the primary drivers of this decline. Other expenses came in at $271 million, up $66 million
versus last year. We did have a couple of one-time items impacting the other expense category in the third quarter, as
well as a few favorable item that we incurred last year. As we discussed back in September, we have written off the $13
million accounts receivables associated with the Hanjin bankruptcy. In addition, we also incurred $17 million of
write-offs associated with in-progress capital projects which we are no longer pursuing. Higher state and local taxes
and increased environmental costs, partially offset by lower personal injury expense, also contributed to the negative
variance in this category for the quarter. For the full year 2016, we now expect the other expense line item to increase
close to 10%, including the one-time items that I just mentioned.
Turning to our operating ratio. The third quarter operating ratio came in at 62.1%, 1.8 points unfavorable when
compared to the record third quarter of 2015. Fuel price negatively impacted the operating ratio by 0.4 points in the
quarter.
Looking at cash flow. Cash from operations for the first three quarters totaled about $5.5 billion, down about $160
million when compared to the same period last year. The decrease in cash was driven by lower net income and was
partially offset by the timing of tax payments, primarily related to the bonus depreciation on our capital spending. For
the full year 2016, we now expect the net impact of bonus depreciation to be a tailwind of about $350 million. After
dividends, our free cash flow totaled about $1.3 billion year to date through the end of September.
Taking a look now at the balance sheet. Our all-in adjusted debt balance increased to about $18.5 billion at quarter end.
We finished the third quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of over 1.9 times, up from 1.7 at year-end. This
brings us close to our target ratio of less than 2 times. For the first nine months of the year, we bought back over 25
million shares, totaling about $2.2 billion. Since initiating share repurchases in 2007, we have repurchased about 28%
of our outstanding shares. Between our dividend payments and our share repurchases, we returned nearly $3.6 billion to
our shareholders through the first three quarters of this year.

So that's a recap of the third quarter results. Looking out to the remainder of the year, volume declines on a
year-over-year basis should moderate as the volume comparisons get easier in the fourth quarter. We would expect total
fourth quarter volumes to be down in the low single digits, and we still expect total full-year volumes to be down in the
6% to 8% range. While we do not expect to improve the operating ratio this year, we will continue to leverage our G55
+ 0 initiatives to generate positive core pricing and strong productivity to achieve the lowest operating ratio possible.
And as Cam just mentioned, we now expect 2016 capital spending to be down about $100 million to just under $3.6
billion, primarily as a result of a delay in the locomotive deliveries.
While we have not yet finalized our capital plans for 2017, we still expect our capital spending to be around 15% of
revenue. From a productivity perspective, our G55 + 0 initiatives have generated significant efficiency savings for the
company thus far this year. And we are confident that we will continue to drive further improvement well into the
future as we work toward our operating ratio target of 60%, plus or minus, on a full-year basis by 2019. And longer
term, we are keeping our eye on the goal of a 55% operating ration as we gain momentum with our G55 + 0 initiatives.
So, with that, I'll turn it back over to Lance.
Lance M. Fritz
Thank you, Rob. As the team has articulated here this morning, we continue to experience a difficult but improving
market environment in the third quarter. While we were pleased to see improving volumes in some of our business
lines, such as grain and coal, many of our markets still remained at volume levels below a year ago. The
macroeconomic environment still has its challenges: an unstable global economy, the relatively strong U.S. dollar, and
continued soft demand for consumer goods. However, certain segments of the economy are showing signs of life. A
recent rally in energy prices has crude oil over $50 a barrel and natural gas over $3 per million BTU, which are both
encouraging for our coal and shale-related businesses.
We are also pleased to see strength in the overall grain market. With a record harvest currently underway, we are
well-positioned with our network and resources to serve an increase in demand from our ag customers. Closing out
2016 and heading into next year, we're optimistic about the opportunities that lie ahead. In the coming months, we'll
continue to do what Union Pacific does best: operate a safe, efficient, and productive network while providing an
excellent customer experience and delivering solid shareholder returns.
With that, let's open up the line for your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Due to the number of analysts joining us on the call today, we'll be limiting
everyone to one primary question and one follow-up question to accommodate as many participants as possible. Our
first question is coming from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Kenneth S. Hoexter>: Great. Good morning. Just – can you, Rob, talk a little bit about the projects you're writing
off? I just want to understand what kind of costs we have going forward. And it looks like as the business comes back,
you're starting to ramp up your locomotives and employees, but you notice that there are fewer people in the training
pipeline. Should we see some startup costs as you start to bring people back in? Thanks.
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: Yeah, Ken. What I commented in the quarter is there was around $17 million of
projects that were started that we've chosen to not pursue. And so we're taking an adjustment there. So I think if you
look longer term, that's a number that is not going to repeat. I mean, we occasionally will have situations like that, but I
think it's safe to assume that that's a number similar to the Hanjin receivable write-off that I mentioned that are not
going to repeat in that line item. In terms of the costs, we're confident that we are well-situated, both on locomotives

and employees, to leverage the volume that we hope does materialize. So we've got fewer people in the training line
because we've got so many people, if you will, in furlough status at this point. So we feel very good about our ability to
– and we'd love nothing more than to see volume pick up and be able to put resources back to work.
<Q - Kenneth S. Hoexter>: Great. Thanks.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please proceed with your questions.
<Q - Cherilyn Radbourne>: Thanks very much and good morning.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Good morning.
<Q - Cherilyn Radbourne>: With the international shipping lines under continued financial pressure, as you noted,
and the prospect of a record grain crop, matchbacks is something that I've been hearing more about. Just curious if
that's something that you're facilitating and potentially see as a means to increase market share in intermodal or grain or
both.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Eric?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah. As you mentioned, Cherilyn, there's a significant volatility going on in the international
container ship business. There've been three major mergers, one bankruptcy. There are a number of other entities that
are in dire or questionable financial shape. One of the things that all of the container ship companies are looking at
doing is finding ways to have matchbacks or exports from the U.S. to Asia. One of the large historical exports has been
grain; in particular, DBGs to China. We are continuing to look at that as a opportunity to grow our business in terms of
the westbound business to Asia.
We're also real excited longer term or mid-term in terms of the opportunity to ship plastics to Asia from the expanding
franchise we have in the Gulf. And we think that that's going to be an excellent opportunity for matchbacks also. So we
think both of those things are great opportunities, of course. China, occasionally, as they have right now, has tariffs or
other governmental policy things that hinder imports like DBGs. But we think long term that should be a opportunity
for us.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Cherilyn, this is Lance. What Eric just outlined is indicative of the franchise strength that the
Union Pacific brings to the industry. We've got breadth and coverage in a number of markets that allow us visibility
into potential matchbacks.
<Q - Cherilyn Radbourne>: Great. And just by way as a very quick follow-up, when you say medium to long term on
the plastics matchbacks, is that sort of 2018 and beyond?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah. I mean, as we've been saying for the last several quarters, we think most of the growth
will happen in 2018 and beyond. There might be a tail of – a small ramp up toward the end of 2017, but basically 2018
and beyond.
<Q - Cherilyn Radbourne>: Thank you. That's all for me.
Operator
Our next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions.
<Q - Ravi Shanker>: Thanks; morning everyone. A couple of questions on pricing. You've committed to positive core
pricing. Can you also commit to pricing over inflation? And, second, can you just help us understand what the driver of
the pricing, I'd say the deterioration of the gains has been? Is it mostly intra-rail competition? Is truck competition? Or
is it you guys kind of supporting some of your customers who may be going through a hard time and hoping to get it

<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah, Ravi. So one of the things that we are real excited about is the great franchise we have,
and we have a very diverse franchise. And some components of our franchise, obviously, as we mentioned, the
energy-related and the international-related, are facing both economic weakness conditions and also some competitive
conditions. So we've been talking about the challenges in coal. Coal, as you know, has been greatly challenged not only
by a demand because of weather and other usage demands, but natural gas has been a great – a strong competitor to
coal. The low, below-$2 natural gas prices has created a headwind for coal in the past.
We're excited – or we think that with natural gas being above $3 now and even some of the futures markets showing it
in the mid-$3's, that that certainly will improve the competitive condition for coal. But that has clearly had an impact.
Likewise, the three major mergers, the one large bankruptcy in the international intermodal, the volatility that we talked
about in previous earnings releases, has created economic conditions and competitive conditions in international
intermodal. Even despite those challenges in those markets, we still have been able to put our market price at
reinvestable returns. And we think that looking at the broadness of our portfolio, we are pretty positive in the future
about our ability to price for the excellent value we provide. And we're going to price above reinvestable returns, and
we have a broad portfolio of opportunities to drive that message.
<Q - Ravi Shanker>: Thanks so much for that color. Can you also – do you have the confidence that it can stay above
inflation, pricing?
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: Ravi, this is Rob. Let me answer that. I mean clearly, long term that is still our goal.
The one thing with these challenges that – and opportunities – that Eric just outlined, one of the things that we haven't
finalized yet but as we look into 2017, at this stage it looks like Global Insight's inflationary numbers are like 2.5%, and
our number may well be above that from an inflationary standpoint, largely driven by the health and welfare costs on
our labor line. So still some work to play out there, but longer term, absolutely, we're as committed as ever to driving
that price.
<Q - Ravi Shanker>: Great. Thank you.

Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Please proceed with your questions.
<Q - Thomas Wadewitz>: Yeah. Good morning. Wanted to ask a little bit more on the pricing side. You commented
how the higher natural gas price is helpful for coal, so that's obviously a constructive thing. But I'm wondering if you're
optimistic if that should help the coal tonnage. And obviously if you have a normal winter and so forth. But what about
the pricing in coal? If we stay at this gas price or go a little higher, do you think that you'll be able to transition to a
better competitive environment where you could raise price for coal transport? Or is that something that – some of that
pricing pressure would likely persist?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah. So, Tom, you're asking a couple different things here. As you know, there are always a
variety of market conditions that impact price: transportation, capacity, availability, and availability on transportation
networks for other commodities, as you know. Competition, weather. There are a lot of things – natural gas prices –
that will affect coal. We are positive that the use of coal should be increasing in the mid-term. If you just look at, again,
the competition against natural gas, if you look at the economic pickup and the use of energy, we are confident that the
use of coal should be picking up in the near mid-term. And we saw that in second to third quarter in terms of the
sequential use of coal. We will continue to price for reinvestable returns based on the value of service that we provide,
and we're confident in that strategy. We're confident in the value that we're providing, and we're going forward.
<Q - Lance M. Fritz>: Hey, Tom. This is Lance. Clearly, an environment where natural gas price in increasing, put it
north of $3.50 or so, and where weather is favorable and where the stockpiles have been worked down. That's a better

pricing and competitive environment than not. So it helps.
<Q - Thomas Wadewitz>: Okay. I appreciate that. And then for the follow-up, I don't know if this is kind of Rob or
Cameron, but you've shown nice improvement in the train length, good momentum there, so that's very favorable. I'm
wondering if you look at 2017 and if you do see a volume growth as a couple things play out. Let's say you see a
couple points of volume growth. How does that translate to incremental margins? Could you see something that's well
above the kind of normal 50% incremental margin we're talking about? Could you see something, 60%, 70% as you
expand train length more and see some of the benefit of cost take-out and so forth? Is that a reasonable equation, or
would you be more cautious about the incrementals in 2017 if the volumes come back? Thank you.
<Q - Lance M. Fritz>: Rob, why don't you take that?
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: Yeah. Tom, this won't surprise you, but we won't give guidance on the actual
incremental margins. But everything you said are certainly opportunities. I mean, as you know, our G55 + 0 initiatives,
which are some 15 different areas that – our view is we're looking at every single cost bucket in the entire company and
attacking it aggressively with an eye on safety and efficiency and customer value.
So I would just answer that question by saying the scenario you outlined where there's a positive volume and a
reasonably positive economic environment would give us an outstanding opportunity to continue to drive productivity.
And staying away from an actual incremental margin calculation, we would expect it to be a positive contributor. And,
oh, by the way, for us to go from where we are today to our 60%-plus or minus by 2019 and with an eye on getting to
55% assumes we're going to have very healthy incremental margins from here to there. So we're going to certainly go
after it.
<Q - Lance M. Fritz>: Tom, as we've opened up the door now to the productivity in your question, I just want to give
recognition to the entire UP team, who have done a tremendous job in a reduced volume environment of finding ways
to grow, for instance, manifest train size 5% year over year. That's a phenomenal effort, and that's just one of many in
terms of finding productivity on the network. I think the team has done a tremendous job in creating productivity in a
pretty difficult environment.
<Q - Thomas Wadewitz>: Yeah. Clearly, you guys are doing a great job in that area. That's impressive performance.
Thank you for the time.

Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your questions.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Thank you, operator. Good morning, gentlemen. I'm going to stick on the price horse here for
now. As we look at that 1.5%, you mentioned tough volume environment, competitive environment. Is this something
that you would expect UNP to hover around for a while? Or what could break it out of that 1.5%? I'm trying to figure
out, is this near term? Are we going to see that throughout 2017 unless things recover from here?
<Q - Lance M. Fritz>: You know, Jason, we don't give any guidance on price. Clearly, as we've outlined a little bit
here this morning, there are certain markers that make the competitive environment better for pricing. Anytime, for
instance, capacity in alternative modes tightens up, that's good. Demand for the underlying commodities, as it increases
that's good. So you just got to keep your eye on what's happening with, for instance, natural gas prices and stockpiles
and weather in the coal world, what's happening on import demand and the financial health of our international
intermodal ocean carriers, that helps. What happens for industrial production in the United States, that helps. What's
happening to truck capacity, alternative modes, that helps. So all of those are a helpful environment for our pricing.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: No, I appreciate that. I mean, I just, even checking my records, I can't remember the last time
you guys were below what we would call your rail cost inflation. In looking at 2017, and I know you guys don't
provide guidance specifically, but are you pretty confident that you're going to be able to grow your volumes in 2017 –

forget what percentage, but just grow the volumes?
<Q - Lance M. Fritz>: Eric, do you want to handle that?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: We, as we said, we don't give volume guidance, but if you look at the markets that we have out
there and you look at the pickup in different markets that we have, we feel pretty positive that as the economy
continues to grow and is slowly strengthening in many of our markets, we feel pretty positive about the run rate
opportunity. The one cautionary area that we have talked about before is in automotive sales. We continue to take think
those are cautionary. But if you look at even our Mexico franchise, we had great growth in our Mexico franchise in the
quarter. We still think that there are good opportunities to grow volume.
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: If I could just add to Eric's comments, Jason, just kind remind you and everyone else,
our thesis from this point over the longer period is a positive volume environment. And you look at the – as Eric just
pointed out – you look at the unique, diverse opportunities of our franchise, while – Eric's right, we aren't giving
precise volume guidance for next year, but we do feel there's great opportunity for us to continue to leverage and over
the longer period of time for us to have volume on the positive side of the ledger, certainly.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Well, let me ask it quickly another way. So, if you saw negative volume next year, that would
mean that something would have to decelerate from here with the trends. Is that an accurate statement?
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: Yeah, that's an accurate statement, generally speaking. Again, we play in multiple
markets, but that's a fairly accurate statement.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Okay. Gentlemen, I appreciate the time as always.

Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.
<Q - Brandon Oglenski>: Hey, good morning, everyone. And thanks for getting me on the call here. So a couple. I
think a few months into this year we had been talking about OR improvement even when volumes were down pretty
significantly in the first quarter, and I know you guys backed off of that 2Q. But I guess as I listen to the call here, it
sounds like pricing might kind of be in line with cost inflation, maybe even a little bit below it, next year. And let's say
volumes don't come back tremendously. What can you guys do on the operating ratio that maybe we could instill some
confidence again that you guys would break into lower territory?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Let me start, Brandon – this is Lance. And I'll remind you that we have confidence, extreme
confidence, in our ability to continually find opportunities to be more efficient, reduce waste, and increase the value
that we're adding. I'll ask Cameron just to give us a handful of examples of things we're working on when we're going
into next year, but our bucket is full of opportunity to be better.
<A - Cameron A. Scott>: On train size, the only commodity group that is truly optimized or nearly optimized is coal.
Every single commodity that we have out there, from manifest to automotive, to intermodal, to grain, ore, rock, all has
tremendous opportunity for us to continue with the results that you have seen. So we feel confident that that is going to
happen in 2017.
The record all-time recrew rate from a process perspective we feel like we have well in hand, and we should continue
to see that into 2017 and 2018. And we work on other initiatives like rationalizing our low horsepower fleet. We've
done a great job of moving to single-unit local operations versus two-unit. There's a number of initiatives that we have
where truly we're just getting started and framing up the opportunity and getting ready to realize it as we step into the
new year.

<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Yeah. Exactly. And even little things like c-rate, that improved 2% year over year. There's
plenty of opportunities we look forward to become world-class, if you will, in consumption rate for diesel. So there's
just a host of issues there, Brandon, that we can continue to work on.
<Q - Brandon Oglenski>: No, and I appreciate all that you guys probably have going on that we can't see from here.
But I guess in retrospect, Lance, was it just that volume got a lot worse than we thought in the second quarter? Or was
it competitive factors, was it market pricing? What was it that led to the lack of ability to drive OR improvement this
year?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Let me let Rob handle that.
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: Yeah. Brandon, I mean, your comment is right that we have always said and we do
believe that we can make improvements in the operating ratio in spite of a lack of volume growth. In fact, you look out
over the last decade, we've taken almost 25 points off our operating ratio without the benefit of positive volume over
that timeframe. I would say you're exactly right, though. Here in the short term, this year, I would say that the major
driver of not likely improving the operating ratio this year is the pace of which we've been kind of chasing volume
down. I mean, we never have perfect visibility as to where that volume's going to trough, and that makes it difficult, so
we are always kind of chasing it, if you will, I think that's really the answer to what you've seen this year.
So as we look forward, I think it's still a fair assumption, and it's certainly our drive, that we expect to make
improvements in our operating ratio in spite of what the economy deals us in terms of what happens with volume. Now,
having said that, as we look out over the next several years, we do have the volume in our thesis on the positive side of
the ledger, but we're going to not use that as an excuse not to make continued productivity improvements.
<Q - Brandon Oglenski>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Yeah.

Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your questions.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Hey, guys. Morning.
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: Good morning.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: So wanted to follow up on pricing. Rob, your point about inflation picking up to 2.5% next
year, is that to caution us that pricing could be below inflation, or is that you telling us, we have line of sight to
inflation getting higher. So we have line of sight to our pricing accelerating, too, next year. I'm not sure what you're
trying to tell us.
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: Yeah, Scott, my point on the inflationary comment is we do expect inflation to go back
up, if you will, to more normal levels versus the below-normal levels that we enjoyed this year. And, again, 2.5%
Global Insight – our numbers, because health and welfare costs, might be higher than that. So my point on that is
simply to say not unusual against historical numbers, but we do expect inflationary pressures to be back to sort of
normal conditions, if you will.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: But because you have line of sight to inflation picking up, do you have line of sight to your
pricing reaccelerating, too?
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: I would say no. It's not mechanical. As you know, the way we price, and we play in so
many different markets that it's not a cookie cutter, it's not a one-size-fits-all. And as Eric outlined, there are
opportunities for us to achieve stronger prices than other areas in the short term. But we will continue to drive service,
drive value, and price at minimum of reinvestable levels, as Eric outlined, in spite of what that inflationary number
turns out to be. So I would say they're disconnected, if you will, in terms of the day-to-day pricing initiatives that we

take.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: So maybe just bigger picture, it feels like for the long term you guys have said, hey, we're
going to get pricing no matter what. If we get volume, okay; if we don't get volume, we don't care. And, truthfully, you
haven't had much volume, but you've gotten great pricing. Is the philosophy changing where you care more about
volume now as part of G55 and so it's less clear that you necessarily always get the pricing?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Scott, our philosophy is not changing. And as a matter of fact, our top line this quarter reflects
that it's not changing. We are pursuing business in the marketplace that we can price for the value that we represent and
that's reinvestable. And if we can't find that, we walk away from it. So nothing's changed about that philosophy.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Okay. And if I can just ask one more just thing on grain pricing specifically, so as the grain
volumes are finally picking up, are there opportunities to start raising grain tariffs? I was a little surprised by the
sequential drop in ag revenue per car this quarter. I don't know if that's mix or a lack of pricing there, just anything
specifically on grain pricing?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah, Scott. I think if you – some of grain pricing, as you know, is in public tariffs, which is
publicly available. And I think you would see some of that sequential increase in pricing in the publicly available tariffs
that mirror kind of the demand that's picking up in grain. I think you'll also see, in some of the secondary markets, huge
increases in kind of the value in the secondary markets for equipment for grain. So some of that is – you have public
visibility to. And I think if you look at those public things, you would see pricing going with the demand increases.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Okay. Thank you, guys.

Our next question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions.
<Q - Danny C. Schuster>: Hi, good morning. This is Danny Schuster on for Allison. Thanks for taking my question
here. So just coming back to pricing a little bit, I think investors are looking at the downward trend and wondering
whether we could eventually see flat pricing at some point. And I think after today we're a little bit potentially closer
that. So what can you tell investors to alleviate the concern that flat pricing is not a possibility?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Just exactly what we've said this morning, which is our pricing philosophy is that we are
looking for markets and opportunities where we can price for the value that we represent. And if we can't find that and
have it reinvestable, we'll keep searching. As markets improve, as the competitive environment improves, that should
translate into a environment where we have more opportunity than not. But our philosophy, our way of conducting
business, is not going to change.
<Q - Danny C. Schuster>: Okay, great. Thank you. And just switching gears on the fuel side, the discount to spot
diesel prices seems to have climbed a little bit this quarter, back up to around 66%, another 300 basis points up. So
should we expect this trend to continue upwards? Or in other words, expect the discount that you receive to spot diesel
to diminish as fuel prices go up? Thank you.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Rob?
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: Yeah. I guess I would answer that by saying it's hard to say. I mean, I can't give
guidance as to what that gap may be, but certainly the way I look at it is overall, as diesel fuel prices increase, we will
work hard and have good mechanisms in place to continue to – there may be a timing difference, but put surcharge is in
place. So from a net impact, we work hard to minimize that. But I can't predict exactly what the delta to the spot will
be.

Our next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stevens. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Justin Long>: Thanks, and good morning. I wanted to ask about the OR. I know you said you're not expecting
improvement this year, but do you think we'll see year-over-year improvement in the OR in the fourth quarter, given
what you're expecting for volume?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Rob, you want to take that.
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: Yes. I mean, as you probably are on top of here, comps get a little bit easier, if you will,
in the fourth quarter, number one. And number two, we're going to continue to drive the productivity initiatives that
we've been successful with this year. And volumes get easier, and if volumes stay kind of flattish, as I outlined in my
comments, say even flattish with where they are now, we would see the fourth quarter gap over previous year
narrowing. So, having said all that, again, without giving specific, precise guidance on the OR for the quarter, we
certainly have an opportunity to do that.
<Q - Justin Long>: Okay. That's really helpful. And I don't want to beat a dead horse on core price, but we did see the
moderation there. And it sounded like in your prepared comments you said it was mainly due to energy and
international intermodal. I was wondering if there's any way to frame up how much of a headwind you saw from those
two areas of the business, maybe to say that was all 50 basis points of the sequential deceleration that we saw, or
something like that?
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: Justin, this is Rob. We don't break it out that way. But I would just tell you, I mean,
again, as you've heard me say many times, we don't have just a simple cookie-cutter, one-price-fits-all. So all of our
markets that we enjoy – and, again, we have more markets because of the diversity of our franchise than many – gives
us opportunities. And it's – the pricing opportunities for us are very diverse. But having said that, we don't break out the
way you're asking it.
<Q - Justin Long>: Okay, fair enough. I'll leave it at that. Appreciate the time.

Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Thanks. Good morning. I do just need to come back to price, and I apologize because I know
it's been sort talked about ad nauseam this morning. But just one thought on renewals. You guys report core pricing to
be a little bit different than some of your peers. And I guess I just wanted to get a rough sense of the relationship
between inflation and the renewal dynamic. And I know it's not mechanical, Rob, and that you kind of highlighted that.
But just generally speaking, in a higher inflationary environment, would you expect that renewals would accelerate as
well? And how much maybe of a lag do you think that there is? I guess I'm just trying to get a rough sense – regardless
of the magnitude, just sort of directionally, I'm guessing they work together. Just want to get – some color on that
would be great.
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: Yeah, Chris, I mean just a couple comments I would make. Number one, as I think you
and others know, we have about 25% of our business, if you will, that is affected by AII-LF. So over a longer period of
time, that mechanism – it may be lumpy from quarter to quarter, but over a longer period of time, it tends to reflect
what's happening with rail inflation, number one.
But I guess I would more broadly say and remind folks the way we calculate price, and as you all have heard me say
for many years, I'm very proud of fact that we are very conservative in terms of how we calculate price. It is not a
same-store sales kind of number. It is a mathematical calculation of how many dollars we yielded in that particular
quarter from our pricing actions, and the denominator is our entire book of business. So it includes contracts that

perhaps we didn't touch, certainly in the quarter for pricing.
So, having said that, there tends to be a little bit of a lead lag, if you will, in terms of the yield dollars that come from
our pricing actions. But, again, our focus is unchanged from what it's been at this point in time. We've got a couple of
markets out there that are particularly challenging, but our commitment to driving value, driving quality service and
driving positive price and positive margins has not changed.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate that. And then maybe switching gears, wanted to follow-up
on the coal side. Eric you had mentioned, I think, inventories are 27 days above average, I believe is what you
highlighted there. What do you think the right number is in terms of the sort of the go-forward period and where the
natural gas curve is? Sort of – weather has been a factor over the summer; we don't know what it'll be like over the
winter. But what do you think that right number is? How close are you guys to kind of getting towards normalized
inventories, do you think?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Well, if you think about Powder River Basin inventories, the five-year average, as I said, was
the low 60s – 63, 65 [days]. And right now we're still at 90, so that's how you get to the 27 days. I do think that a 60-ish
number is probably right. If we have normal weather patterns, a normal cold winter, if you look at the natural gas
futures curve, I think right now it's like predicting 3.40 in the early part of next year. That will drive the inventories
down; that will drive usage of coal. Coal market share in the quarter was 32% compared to like 28%, I think, in the
second quarter, so coal market share has grown. I think it will be in a good place, a good position; you'll see coal
volumes grow. You'll see the opportunity for coal pricing to grow. You'll see inventories go down, and I think we'll be
in a better place.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Hey, one thing to note. You can get to that days inventory reduction adjustment a number of
ways. If you think about what's happening in the coal world in a different perspective, on a stock level of, call it 80
million tons of SPRB coal, we're about 3 million tons higher year over year, and that represents, as Eric says, about 25
days of burn. So it really doesn't take much in both how much you have in stock and how much you're burning to affect
that days ratio. You can get there a number of ways.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: That's really helpful. And real quick, did you say what the coal outlook was for volume
within the low single-digit decline in the fourth quarter?
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: We didn't, Chris. But it's in the, call it in the low teens, is probably a reasonable
assumption, down low teens.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Okay, great. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it.

<Q - Brian P. Ossenbeck>: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for getting me on the call here. Lance, just wanted to get
your views on the regulatory backdrop. Obviously there's been a lot of things coming out of the STB. They had their
review of the stand-alone-cost test from [indiscernible] (59:15) come out recently. We've got some news out of the
GAO about the ECP brakes. But just looking into next year, it seems like it will still be fairly busy on the docket. Just
wanted to get your thoughts on if there'll be any potential impact, changes in regulations, in 2017 that you would be
particularly focused on?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Brian, thanks for that question. We are focused on the activity at the STB. That's largely driven
by their reauthorization from Congress about a year ago. In that reauthorization, Congress essentially encouraged the
STB to work through their docket. They had a backlog of a fair number of action items. Our concern is that that's
interpreted as a desire to regulate the industry further. We don't believe that is the desire of Congress. We think
Congress's desire was to have the STB work through their workload.

So we've got our eyeballs and are working on different activities, things like the reciprocal switching rules, or the
reduction of exemptions of different commodity groups. We're touching all the right points and making sure our
perspective is known and incorporated into the thought process. There's a lot of moving parts there, so it's taking a fair
amount of work on my part, on our legal team and on our Washington team. I would say our largest concern would be
the kind of overriding, overall impact of each individual regulation. If the STB takes those in isolation, we could end up
in an impact that is unintended and unconsidered. And so we're also working hard to make sure that the STB takes into
account the full perspective of everything they are working and the knock-on impacts of each as a group. Does that
make sense?
<Q - Brian P. Ossenbeck>: Yeah, it does. And it's helpful. Because I think you see all the activity, you think
potentially activist, but it just does seem like a docket just needed to move forward a bit. Just one real quick question
for Eric on the Hanjin impact. You mentioned the $13 million write-off. I was just curious if there's any operational
issues you've been seeing as those containers come onshore and people don't necessarily want to move them? Anything
from the chassis shortage that we've been hearing a little bit about, if that's of a concern? Clearly there's a lot of other
puts and takes in the international intermodal side right now. Thank you.
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah, Brian. So Union Pacific, I think, has weathered a lot of what I call the operational fallout
from the Hanjin bankruptcy fairly well. At a high level, on the day they went bankrupt, they roughly had about 100
ships in flows around the world, 40 owned, about 60 leased. And there are lots of issues in terms of what to do with all
of the in-traffic flows. There was roughly, I think, $14 billion worth of goods in traffic flows, lots of issues about what
to do that. We had a fairly nominal number of boxes en route on our railroad, and we've been able to process all of
those through. We probably have a couple dozen left to process through from roughly probably a little over 1,000 on
the day of bankruptcy.
So we navigated that fairly well. There are issues out there in navigating the rest of that, and it is an issue for the
industry and the supply chain in terms of what to do with those boxes, both loaded and empty, and boxes on chassis,
what to do with those. And that's something that the industry is going to be struggling with to resolve. But for the
Union Pacific side, we've navigated that fairly well.
<Q - Brian P. Ossenbeck>: Okay. Thanks for the detail, Eric.

Our next question comes from the line of John Larkin with Stifel. Please go ahead with your questions.
<Q - John Larkin>: Yeah, thank you very much for taking my question, gentlemen. Had a question on coal.
[indiscernible], (1:03:49) you've said a couple of times that the stockpiles are still well above kind of targeted levels,
yet sequentially there was a huge step up in coal volume to in theory replenish stockpiles run down during the
hotter-than-normal summer. Was that very specific to a few different utilities? Or what really drove that? It seems a
little contradictory to make that comment that coal would be up sequentially even though stockpiles are still on average
way above normal.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Eric, can you handle that?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah. The stockpiles have come down. If you look at over the second to the third quarter, the
stockpiles have come down 13 days, and they came down because the burn increased. And so our volumes improved
roughly 40%, and the stockpiles came down because the burn increased even at a higher percent than that.
<Q - John Larkin>: Okay. So it doesn't sound like the utilities are all that dedicated to drawing those stockpiles down
that aggressively if they're replenishing still fairly aggressively there in the third quarter. Just one more question. The
U.S. dollar has been sitting at elevated levels relative to foreign currencies now for a year or longer. What's your
outlook on that for the rest of this year and throughout 2017 and the impact it might have on exports, which are so
critical in sort of the bulk side of your business?

<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Yeah, John. This is Lance. You're right. The dollar has been strong. We don't make a prediction
about what the dollar's going to be going forward, but you got to believe all reasonable expectations are it's going to
continue to remain strong. In order to change that, you need real acceleration in the global market which would
enhance the strength of other currencies, and there's just not a lot of catalysts that you see for that. To your point, a
strong dollar does make exports difficult. However, even in today's world, you see for instance grain exporting off the
Pacific Northwest and the Gulf Coast and into Mexico despite a strong dollar, so market conditions can still prompt
commodity movement in global trade.
And the other thing to note is that the U.S. is unique in its ability for its manufacturing base to figure out how to be
globally competitive over time. I think the shale energy revolution is indicative of that, where couple of years ago
people would say at $70 a barrel, shale oil was competitive, and in today's world they say, no, that's maybe more like
$50 a barrel. So there's a lot of moving parts there. Clearly we would prefer an acceleration in the global economy,
which would prompt more global trade, which would mean more U.S. exports. That all would be really helpful to us.
<Q - John Larkin>: Got it. Thanks for that explanation.

Our next question comes from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Hey. Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. Rob, I know you guys
don't want to get too much into predicting price, but maybe could you clarify for us kind of what percentage of the
volume right now is under contracts that would have a normal inflationary escalator versus those that are going to be
subject to more the competitive or market conditions that are out there?
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: Yeah, David. I mean, we don't necessarily break it out exactly the way you're asking,
other than I would just remind that overall about 25% of our book of business is touched by the AII-LF index. But to
your question of how much do we have sort of under contract, or if you will, kind of sized from a pricing standpoint,
it's the same answer I would have given you last quarter, and that's about 70%. I mean, every day of every week, we are
negotiating with customers and negotiating our deals, so it's not like it's done each quarter on day one. So it's an
ongoing, continuous process, and roughly speaking, any day of any week we have about 70% of the next 12 months'
business under contract or sized up.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: And I guess as you think about kind of your outlooks and your near-term to 60% and
then the longer-term to G+55, does the recent trend in that same-store sales price metric make you as the CFO sort of
rethink the timing of some of those targets? Or do you think that you see enough opportunity on the cost side here to
keep the forward momentum on the margin side?
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: Yeah. We haven't changed our guidance in terms of our 60% plus or minus by 2019,
and then our eyeball's on getting to a 55%. And I would just say don't read that we are like changing our longer-term
view in terms of our commitment to pricing. We're not. I mean, we've got a little bit of a bump in the road because of
some of the market conditions that Eric outlined. But as we look longer term, the levers that got us to where we are
today that are going to take us to that next rung on the ladder of 60% and then eventually 55% are certainly, we hope,
positive volume. But are going to be solid value to our customers, solid core pricing at reinvestable levels plus, and
solid productivity gains.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: All right. Well, I appreciate the color on that. It's been a long call. Thanks for your
time, and we look forward to hearing about those G+55 initiatives over the coming years.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Thanks, David.

Our next question is from the line of Ben Hartford with Baird. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Ben J. Hartford>: Thanks. Rob, quick question for you. You'd provided the 15% of revenue target that you had
talked about in the past for next year as it relates to CapEx. Can you envision – as you march toward this 55% OR
target longer term, can you envision a situation in which CapEx does approach D&A on an absolute basis? Is that
realistic for a relevant period of time – or over a relevant time horizon?
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: Ben, probably not. I wouldn't use that as a marker, again, because of the timing. These
are long-lived assets, generally speaking. But, to your broader point, I'm very proud of what the team has done to
continue to make progress on tightening our capital discipline. And I think it's a significant step of getting to that
15%-ish range, if you will, from where we have historically been. I mean, there's a lot of great productivity and a lot of
great work that goes into getting to that level. So we'll get to that rung next, and then we'll see where we are at that
point.
<Q - Ben J. Hartford>: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks.

Our next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC. Please proceed with your questions.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Yeah, thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. So just on the OR long term, your
targets, as you mentioned, when we started the year, we heard the entire – all the railroads each indicate that they would
be able to reduce OR despite a challenging environment. You noted the same. Most have done so, and your OR
unfortunately has not followed that trend. And I'm just looking on a relative basis. When you see the improvement
across the group, can you point to something that is specific to your company that – be it a business mix, be it some
structural challenges – that lead you to have that challenge that the others did not? And I frame it in a relative question.
I know you don't like looking at peers, but I know your investors do. So I want to be able to understand, is there
something company-specific here? Or how do I answer that question when I get that OR question?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Yeah. Walter, this is Lance. So again, I won't compare ourselves to our peers. We are a unique
railroad. When we began the year, we were hopeful we were going to make OR improvement. The top line went away
from us, as Rob said, a little more aggressively than we had anticipated. If you think about our ability to improve OR
over the long run, we're still confident that we can do it. That's shown in our maintaining the guidance for a plus-minus
60% in 2019. We did start the year with a very low operating ratio. It's still an attractive operating ratio. We're not
pleased that we didn't have the opportunity to improve it this year. And, again, we're just laser focused on all the
activity necessary to continue to improve our margins for our shareholders.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: So coming back to your long term, then. I mean, from where you sit today, I mean that's a
900 basis point improvement. It's a significant improvement. Several of your peers are there already, and many
investors are banking on you to achieve that. Given the trends they – that were exhibiting the reversal in those trends,
I'm just trying to understand what confidence that we can put in a reasonable timeframe – a long term is a fairly vague
definition – a reasonable timeframe for evolution toward a 55% OR.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Rob, what don't you take that?
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: Yeah. Yeah, Walter. I guess I would remind you and everyone that we are confident and
sticking with our 60% plus or minus target OR by full year 2019. And as you've heard us talk, with eyes on where do
we go beyond that to the 55%? So – and while we haven't put a date on the 55%. But I would just say that getting to a
60% is a very enviable spot, in my opinion. I mean, we've made great progress on that. So I would not read that this
one year of perhaps not making OR improvement is a new trend, or a new objective, or new signal here. It's not. I
mean, to get from where we are today to that 60% is going to take all the initiatives we just talked about, and it's the
same levers that got us a 25-point improvement over the last decade. So we're going to continue to make that progress,
and we haven't backed off our 60% OR guidance.

Our next question is from the line of Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research. Please proceed with your questions.
<Q - Brian A. Konigsberg>: Yes, hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. A lot of ground has already been
covered. Maybe just on the bonus depreciation and moving some of the purchases on locomotives from 2016 into 2017,
so should we just think those two are connected and the carryover into 2017 will show up?
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: I think I would stick with the guidance I gave on bonus depreciation impact this year of
about $350 million. I don't think – that's not going to move much. We haven't finalized what the number's going to look
like all in for 2017, but I think I would still just kind of use that assumption of $350 million-ish for this year.
<Q - Brian A. Konigsberg>: But, conceptually, a lot of that bonus depreciation is associated with the purchases of
locomotives and such things. Is that just the way to think about it generally?
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: Yeah, I mean, it certainly impacts that, but I would say it's still in that $350 million
range for this year. And again, we'll see. We'll get some carryover benefit next year, but we of course have to start
paying back previous years, so we haven't finalized or given guidance as to what the impact all in net will be next year.
But you're right, I mean, the locomotive movement will have some impact on what those numbers are.
<Q - Brian A. Konigsberg>: I'm sure. Thanks. And maybe just touch a little bit on balance sheet. So you're
approaching the self-imposed leverage limits you've talked about. Just thought process from here? Are you able to
maybe de-lever or actively de-lever or will you naturally do it through EBITDA growth? How do you see that playing
out?
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: Yeah, I mean, we've made great progress on that measure over the last several years,
and at this point in time the biggest opportunity we still have in front of us, which we're laser-focused on, is driving
EBITDA, driving cash flow. And that will give us additional capacity. And that's how we're approaching it. So we
think we do have room as we grow our earnings and grow our cash flow.
<Q - Brian A. Konigsberg>: I'll leave it there. Thank you.

Our next question is from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your questions.
<Q - Scott Schneeberger>: Thanks very much for fitting me in. With regard – just focusing on the automotive sector,
you mentioned the contract changes being a headwind into 2017. Could you just kind of compare and contrast what you
think the impact will be as it looks like over-the-road conversions are good? And then obviously there's a lot of
near-shoring and a lot of development in Mexico with manufacturing. So just if you'd compare and contrast within that
sector how you think you enter next year? Is it going to be a net up or down in that category? Thanks.
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Scott, we love our autos franchise. We think we have the premier autos franchise. We think all if
the trends in terms of Mexico production is positive for us in terms of our franchise. We think we're in a great spot for
over-the-road auto-parts conversions. We've have great success this year, and we think that will continue in the future.
There'll always be contract changes, and it's a competitive marketplace, and we saw that this year. And that's something
that will happen across time.
The big driver, as we've been saying, my view on the automotive side is the cautionary impact in terms of sales. Sales
have been at record or near-record levels, and there are some indicators out there that should give cautionary lights; it's
the amount of debt inherent in auto loans and leases, actual sales incentives per car were at an all-time record level in
the quarter, highest since – 2008 was the previous record. So there are some cautionary signs out there. If auto sales

stay strong, we have a great franchise, and we're in a great spot. I do think there are some cautionary signs out there.
<Q - Scott Schneeberger>: All right, thanks. And just a quick follow-on. At Panama Canal, any update there, what
you're hearing from customers? Just looking for a check-up. Thanks so much, guys.
<A - Eric L. Butler>: No, I think the Panama Canal story is what we've been saying for the last several years, and
certainly I think the last couple of quarters we've been mentioning that the amount of traffic hitting the West Coast
versus the East Coast did – there was traffic that moved to the East Coast because of the strike, and BCOs trying to
diversify their risk and not be dependent on the West Coast. We did see that phenomenon.
We have seen some of that business start to come back, but it hasn't all come back from before the strike. That has
probably been a larger factor than any canal opening factor, the fact that the BCOs are diversifying their flows in a lot
of different ways just to not have that risk. Having said all of that, we do believe – I do believe that the West Coast
ports are the most economical, the best supply chain in terms of transit time to get goods from Asia to the interior of the
country and even into the East Coast. And if you look at some of the technologies that some of the West Coast ports are
employing to make themselves more efficient with autonomous vehicles and things like that, I think West Coast ports
are still going to be positioned to be the best supply chain factor going into the future, though you will see people
wanting to do risk mitigation strategies.
