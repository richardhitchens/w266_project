George Rollo Fairweather
Thank you, Gerald.
Overall, we are pleased with the progress this quarter with the results in line with our expectations. We continue to
make good progress towards completing our Rite Aid transaction and today we have raised the lower end of our
adjusted earnings per share guidance for fiscal year 2017.
So turning now to the financial highlights for the quarter. As we expected, currency had a negative impact on the
year-over-year financial performance, with U.S. dollar being around 18% higher versus sterling. Sales for the quarter
totaled $28.5 billion, down 1.8% versus the comparable quarter last year. On a constant currency basis, however, sales
were up 1.1%.
GAAP operating income was $1.4 billion, a decrease of 1.4%. GAAP net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots
Alliance were $1.1 billion and diluted EPS was $0.97. Adjusted operating income was $1.7 billion, up 0.4%, and in
constant currency, was up 2.8%. Adjusted net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.2 billion, up
6.1%, and in constant currency, up 8.2%. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share was $1.10, up 6.8%, and in constant
currency, up 9.7%.
The adjusted effective tax rate, which we calculate excluding the equity income from AmerisourceBergen, this was
25.5%. This was lower than the same quarter last year primarily due to changes in our forecast geographic mix of
pre-tax earnings and the U.S. taxation of our non-U.S. entities.
So now, let me turn to the performance of our divisions in the quarter, beginning with Retail Pharmacy USA. Retail
Pharmacy USA sales were $20.7 billion, up 1.4% over the year-ago quarter, comparable store sales increasing by 1.1%.
Adjusted gross profit was $5.5 billion, up 0.1% over the year-ago quarter, reflecting an increase in retail which was
partially offset by a decline in pharmacy.
Adjusted SG&A was 20.4% of sales, an improvement of 0.5 percentage points compared to the year-ago quarter. This
reflects benefits from our cost transformation program. Adjusted operating margin was 6.2%, up 0.1 percentage points,
resulting in adjusted operating income of $1.3 billion, up 3.7%.
So next, let's look in more detail at pharmacy. U.S. pharmacy total sales were up 2.5%, driven by increased script
volumes and higher specialty sales. We filled 237.6 million prescriptions on a 30-day adjusted basis including
immunizations, an increase of 3.0%. On a comparable basis, for stores which exclude central specialty, our pharmacy
sales increased by 2.0%, with scripts filled up 3.4% primarily due to growth in Medicare Part D volumes.
Within sales, volume growth and brand inflation was partly offset by reimbursement pressure, which was in line with
what we anticipated and by the impact of generics. While branded drug price inflation continued, it was at a more
moderate level than in prior quarters. Keep in mind that these factors impacted sales and gross profit. Our reported
market share of retail prescriptions in the quarter on the usual 30-day adjusted basis was 19.5%, up approximately 40
basis points over the year-ago quarter.
Total retail sales were down 0.9% on the same quarter last year. This includes the impact of the previously announced
closure in September of certain e-commerce operations. Comparable retail sales were down 0.5% in the quarter due to
declines in the consumables and general merchandise category and in the personal care category, partially offset by

increases in the health & wellness category and beauty category.
Gross margin was higher than the same quarter last year, primarily driven by owned brand performance and
procurement benefits. Since the quarter end, while our December comparable sales were still negative, we saw stronger
performances in our key health & wellness and beauty categories.
We have now completed the first phase of the roll-out of our new differentiated beauty offering, which is available in
more than 1,800 stores. In addition, in October, we launched Beauty Enthusiast, a new loyalty offering which engages
our most valuable and beauty and personal care customers. Since the launch, both sign-ups and incremental spend
among beauty enthusiasts has been above plan. As we anticipated, we have increased beauty sales in these remodeled
stores, particularly No7 and Soap & Glory.
During 2017 within these stores, we plan to introduce further new product lines as well as expand the number of stores
with beauty offerings. A significant element of the rollout is the recruitment and training of beauty consultants. In order
to maintain high standards, we are doing this in a methodical manner, which is taking slightly longer than expected.
So now, let's look at the results of the Retail Pharmacy International division. Sales for the division were $3.0 billion,
up 0.5% in constant currency. On the same basis, comparable store sales decreased 0.1%. Comparable pharmacy sales
were down 0.5% on a constant currency basis due to a decline in the UK, which was partially offset by growth in other
international markets.
Boots UK comparable pharmacy sales were down 0.8% due to the expected reduction in pharmacy funding, partially
offset by strong performance in pharmacy services. Comparable retail sales for the division increased 0.2% due to
growth in all countries other than Chile and Mexico. Within the UK, Boots performance was flat versus the year-ago
quarter and we saw growth in our opticians business.
Adjusted gross profit for the division was down 2.7% in constant currency to $1.2 billion mainly due to lower margins
in the UK in what is really a new environment for retailers. Adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales on a constant
currency basis increased by 0.7 percentage points to 32.5%, mainly reflecting higher depreciation costs than the
year-ago quarter. As you may recall, in January last year, I explained that fiscal 2016 first quarter results benefited from
purchase price accounting refinements. In addition, the higher depreciation this quarter reflected our ongoing IT and
store investment program.
Adjusted operating margin was 7.2%, down 2.0 percentage points in constant currency. This resulted in adjusted
operating income of $213 million, a decrease of 21.6%, again in constant currency.
Since the quarter end, I'm pleased to report that December retail sales growth was notably stronger than in the first
quarter. Boots' December retail performance with solid, reflecting actions taken in the fall to counter what are
challenging market conditions. However, from the 1st of December, as expected, Boots was impacted by the
government action to lower pharmacy practice payments.
So now, let's look at our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division. Sales for the division were $5.4 billion, up 0.6% versus
the same quarter last year on a constant currency basis. Comparable sales on a constant currency basis increased by
4.7%. This was slightly ahead of our estimated market growth, weighted on the basis of our country wholesale sales,
with growth in the UK and emerging markets offsetting competitive market conditions in Continental Europe.
Adjusted operating margin, which excludes ABC, was 3.1%, up 0.3 percentage points on a constant currency basis.
Adjusted operating income was $224 million, up 45.2% in constant currency. While the increase was mainly due to
equity earnings from ABC, excluding this, adjusted operating income grew by 10.2% in constant currency, cost
benefits outweighing margin pressures.
Operating cash flow in the quarter was $525 million. During the quarter, our working capital outflow was $1.2 billion.
This reflected our typical seasonal build in inventories and inventory builds for certain new initiatives, partially offset
by improved payables days.

Cash capital expenditure for the quarter was $378 million. We continued to invest in our core customer proposition,
including our stores and U.S. beauty program as well as the upgrades to our IT systems, which we have previously
talked about. Overall, this resulted in free cash flow for the quarter of $147 million.
So turning now to our pending acquisition of Rite Aid, as you'll have seen from today's earnings press release, we're
actively engaged in discussions with the FTC and are still working towards the close of the acquisition in the early part
of this calendar year, having announced the Fred's agreement on the 20th of December, 2016.
So turning now to guidance for fiscal 2017, we have raised the lower end of guidance by $0.05 and now expect
adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $4.90 to $5.20. This assumes, as before, Rite Aid accretion
of $0.05 to $0.12 and current exchange rates remaining constant for the rest of the fiscal year. Keep in mind, we still
expect second half-year growth to be stronger than in the first, as we begin to benefit from the strategic partnerships
announced last year.
During the quarter, we purchased 5.6 million shares at a cost of $457 million. This substantially completes our
anti-dilutive share buyback program for fiscal 2017. At the quarter end, this resulted in just over 1.079 billion common
shares outstanding.
So I will now hand over to Stefano for his concluding comments.
Stefano Pessina
Thank you, George.
As you have heard, the events for the quarter are good and this was in line with our expectations. As usual, they tell the
story of a dynamic business which has many moving parts and we have a wave of complications these sum things
create for people looking from outside the company when they try to measure our progress, especially on a
quarter-by-quarter basis, when we are pursuing strategies that are aimed at delivering value over the long term.
Last quarter, we told you that we expected our results for fiscal 2017 would be weighted towards the second half of the
year as our new agreements with key strategic partners begin to deliver volume increases to offset the commercial
pricing that we are achieving. As this implies, we will continue to see this impact in the second quarter of the year,
which is as we expected in previously [indiscernible] (17:43).
We continue to deliver major progress with cost reduction and sourcing, both areas in which we have a lot more
progress to make, which has allowed us to deliver the good financial results while we implement initiatives to drive
growth in our stores, further differentiate our retail offering, and promote our own and exclusive brands across our
businesses.
We are still at an early stage of the deployment of new retail initiative in Walgreens and refreshing the offering and
processes to enhance the customer experience. It is important to recognize the actual work we are doing in the U.S. We
are trying to bring a new way of thinking to our company, which if we are successful, will hopefully influence the
sector as a whole.
We are focused on working in partnership to provide a better, more efficient, and more effective approach within the
U.S. ecosystem to make better use of the infrastructure in place at the moment and rethink how we do a number of the
things that we do today. There is no doubt that the healthcare system needs to change by improving the provision of
healthcare while at the same time acting to control the rapid growth in costs.
We are working to play our part in the changes that need to happen to achieve this. And as we deliver value in the
system we create, we capture an element of that value within our own business. Of course, we are a single part of the
system, so can only do so much on our own, which is why we are so committed to partnership and talk about it so
much.

Working together with others to retain the interaction and interfaces within the overall system have more impact within
the system, more leverage over time, and more ways and opportunities to create value, both in our business and in the
system as a whole. Of course, the U.S. is only a part of our business, a very significant part of it.
All across our company, our businesses change and constantly reinvent themselves to remain relevant in the
ever-changing market. So we continue to work to grow and develop the company as a whole. During the quarter, I have
visited many of our operations outside the U.S. and remain convinced of the opportunities for us internationally. I've
said in the past that Asia and Latin America are areas of particular interest for us outside the U.S., and the more I see of
these markets, the more convinced I am of this.
In terms of corporate development, you have seen the progress we announced at the end of December regarding the
proposed transaction with Rite Aid and having reached a conditional agreement with Fred's. We still have to complete
our work with the FTC. And as we have seen, these things can take some time, as the FTC are scrupulous in ensuring
that they can see everything properly and fully. That said, I remain as convinced as ever of the strategic benefit of the
proposed Rite Aid transaction and look forward to being able to provide you with another update as soon as we can.
We are clearly making progress, and while I would always like to move faster and do more, we must be measured and
ensure we work at the pace with which we are confident we can deliver for our customers and our shareholders on all
the plans and the strategies we have discussed with you.
Our confidence is only strengthened by our recent performance. Holiday shopping started later than usual, with the
bulk of the sales occurring the last days before Christmas. That said, we have once again seen what appears to be a
solid holiday sales period in our main retail market.
As George has told you, we are raising the lower end of our adjusted earnings per share guidance for the year as we see
the business performing in-line with our expectations. We continue to have many different ways to deliver the value
and growth that we see possible in the business, and as ever, we will evaluate which of these we prioritize depending
on the market and the competitive changes that we see. But overall, these continue to give us the tools we need to
maintain the financial performance we have committed to further company as a whole.
Overall, we remain confident in the outlook for the company, optimistic that the strategy that we are pursuing will
deliver future growth, and convinced of the long-term opportunity to create genuine value for this business for many
years to come.
Thank you. Now, I will hand you back to Gerald.
Gerald Gradwell
Thank you, Stefano. We're now ready to take your questions. Operator, can you open the lines?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. You may begin.
<Q - Ross Muken>: Good morning, gentlemen. So, Stefano, you talked about the changing healthcare landscape.
You're obviously doing a lot of things to kind of revolutionize in some ways how the supply chain functions. As you
think about the competitive responses, as you think about the partnerships that have happened, where do you feel like
you've made the most progress and where do you see the next leg of big opportunity? And obviously, it's going to
depend somewhat on the Rite Aid transaction in terms of what you do next but just on the core business, where do you
feel like you've done the most and where do you feel like in the U.S. business you have probably the most to do?

<A - Stefano Pessina>: A part of the Rite Aid transaction, like you said, I believe that the big achievement of the last
year has been for us to be able to create really a bridge with the main PBM and the other big players in this industry.
Now, we have a certain joint venture so we have certain, let's say, contracts. There may be new patients as a
consequence of what – of these bridges and what we have done but we have something which is much more important.
We have an established trust, the trust between us and a certain number of companies. Not all of them. Not everybody
has been able to create this element of trust but for certain companies the trust is there. And on the trust, we can build a
lot of additional opportunities in future.
And so our relationship with Prime, our relationship with Express Scripts, our relationship even with Optum, even
though there have been mainly discussions about Optum, but are creating a new basis of discussion, a new basis of
collaboration, which of course can go beyond a simple contract and can probably at the end also take in consideration a
wider finale.
<Q - Ross Muken>: No, that's helpful. And maybe just quickly on the international business, you highlighted
obviously key emerging markets as a place for expansion. You entered a number of different countries with different
models, acquisition, joint venture, et cetera, over time. Is this the kind of environment currently that is favorable toward
accomplishing maybe more of those goals and in terms of expanding your geographic reach?
And then two, help us understand what are the key challenges. Obviously, we've seen folks enter Brazil and at times
that's been tough or Russia, et cetera. What makes for a good emerging market in your view in terms of the ability to
make money there and whatnot?
<A - Stefano Pessina>: You see it's always a tricky answer because things change so rapidly. For sure, I wouldn't be
particularly excited to invest in Brazil unless we could find a very, very favorable situation but Brazil is still a big
country. Sooner or later it will be interesting again. But you see, countries like China, for instance, are still enormously
interested. Remember that in China, we have a good presence but as a wholesaler, not as a retailer. And this is due to
the historical reason that until three years ago foreign people could have just 30 pharmacies. So we had 30 pharmacies,
29 in Guangzhou, so we were prevented to buy other pharmacies. So, the only way to do so was to team up being
minority with state-owned company. So, we have – now this restriction has been in reality I would say even withdrawn
there are still certain things but substantially withdrawn. And from in the last two years we have been a very, very
active in finding the right partner for us to have a big pharmacy chain.
Sooner or later we will be able to do it. The problem is that you have to dedicate a lot of time to get a deal in China and
it's true that we have a team in China, a permanent team in China of Chinese people. But it's also true that to do a big
deal in China, you must have the agreement of the chairman of the relevant company and the chairman generally just
want to talk to the chairman. China is a very – it's a very hierarchical society. It's also true that in the last two years I
have not gone to China as frequently as I used to go and so I didn't, I was not able to keep the relationship as I should
have done. But now I have gone to China and spent some time in China in the last month and now we are back and I
strongly believe that sooner or later we will be able to do something. When? I don't know, but it's possible.
<Q - Ross Muken>: Brilliant, thank you so much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Alvin Concepcion with Citi. You may begin.
<Q - Alvin Caezar Concepcion>: Great, thanks for taking my question. How would you characterize the competitive
promotional environment in the U.S.? There's been some concerns that the recent partnerships and your wins could
result in things like a price war, so I'm just curious your take on it?
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Hi. Good morning, Alvin. It's Alex here. I think as we've said quite a few times in the
last 12 months, our partnership strategy is to really get deeply inside conversations with our partners to understand
what they want from us. And it's not about price, only price, it's also the price on service on how we work together to
really help them get their goals of creating better health outcomes. So we feel good about where we are now. We're in

the very early stages of delivering these services to our pharmacies through TRICARE and the first month has gone
well. And of course, January 1 is a very important one for the extension of Med D on our new Prime networks which
again kick in on Jan 1.
So it's not about price from our point of view. We've got a very clear government structure. We make sure that we stick
to the pricing structure and where the market is at, not below the market, and that's very important to us and we're
working very hard to deliver excellent customer care through our pharmacies to make sure we take care of the patients,
our payers have given us to take care of.
<Q - Alvin Caezar Concepcion>: Thank you. And I know this is a tough question but in light of the new political
climate in the U.S., what kind of changes to the operating environment, things like the potential repeal of the
Affordable Care Act, what are you planning for in your outlook? Is there anything proposed out there that would
change your way of thinking about the business?
<A - Stefano Pessina>: We really believe that we could start to work on hypothesis with the information that we have.
We have a lot of affirmation they will repeal the Obamacare okay but after they say yes, but maybe we have to give
something similar we have to create a transition. It's very difficult to understand what practically the new
administration will decide to do because they for sure they will try to do something sensible and rational and they will
study something which will not be to the detriment of the citizens. So, it will take some time to study. Probably the
outcome will be quite rational and at the time we will be able to organize our affairs and prepare our business to
respond to the new environment.
We don't have to be taken by panic just because many rules change. We have to wait for the changes and after
rationally we will decide how to react without panicking.
<Q - Alvin Caezar Concepcion>: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. You may begin.
<Q - George R. Hill>: Yeah. Hey. Good morning, and thanks for taking the question. I guess, Alex, I wanted to talk a
little bit the U.S. business and the price versus volume trends you're seeing there a little bit, where you guys are
continuing to see volume up pretty comfortably on the script side with dollar sales coming in below that. However,
from a lot of the data that we look at, it looks like net price mix is still trending positively so I guess can you talk about
what are the factors that are driving the discrepancy where dollar sales are coming in below script volume growth?
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Sure, George. I think that, in particular, from quarter-to-quarter the differential for us is
just under 3% as you rightly point out. And we see really a couple of main factors that George mentioned on the script.
The first one is less inflation in branded drugs. That's pretty clear and that's a major chunk of it.
The second one is volume. Volume in the market is down so as you say we are doing pretty well in the market, 40 basis
points up in market share from what we measure. But overall the volume in the market is down in this quarter relative
to the last quarter and that makes a chunk of it. And as you have said, we have been pricing more competitively in
some of our networks in preparation to drive volume as Stefano and George have both said in the second half of this
year. And again that's the third element for us. So, that really is the three elements that we see, reimbursement pressure
continuing, branded inflation decelerating and a bit of volume decline in the market during this period.
<Q - George R. Hill>: Okay, that's helpful, and then maybe a quick follow up. There has been a little bit of chatter in
the market recently about the launch of some of the biosimilars, particularly on the pharmacy benefit side, with
wholesalers trying to take different tacks around whether or not they will supply or carry these drugs. I guess how are
you guys thinking about primary and secondary wholesaler relationships in general and secondary source contracts if
your primary vendor doesn't want to carry certain products or if wholesalers all of a sudden want to be more selective
about products they want to carry depending upon the economics they can generate from manufacturers?

<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: To be honest, we have a great relationship with AmerisourceBergen. And as you know,
we are very strong partners now, particularly having bought the second warrants. So from our point of view, we have
direct conversations about how do we continue to make the supply chain more efficient. That is a small part of the
conversation. There are many more opportunities that we're speaking about today for tomorrow. So to be honest, it
really is not an issue that we see as a big opportunity right at this point.

Thank you. Our next question is from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. You may begin.
<Q - Ricky R. Goldwasser>: Yes, hi. Good morning, so a couple of questions. So first of all, obviously Retail and
Pharmacy comps soft across the industry, yet you did raise the bottom end of the guidance. So what has changed since
you guided that gives you more confidence in the outlook for the remainder of the year?
<A - George Rollo Fairweather>: We're obviously very pleased to be able to raise the lower end of guidance by
$0.05. This really reflects that we are now four months into the year. That gives us a clearer view of our performance.
You have seen that we've obviously delivered to expectations in the first quarter, and we remain confident very much
about our ability to deliver the numbers going forward. But I think when you actually look at the shape of the results,
you can see obviously, Alex has talked about the market, the volume issues, and there have been questions about
margin, but we've delivered very strong cost controls, which are very much a key focus of us across all our divisions.
And again, you look to the mix of the profits and the taxes has again helped us a little bit on the comparables.
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Hi, Ricky. It's Alex here. So there are really two things. First one I've spoken about
already. We've seen the first month of TRICARE. And it's on plan, and that gives us confidence for the rest of the year.
And we'll see the first month of Prime already this month.
Secondly and I think equally important strategically, we have seen ongoing solid trends through our investments,
particularly in beauty, wellness and health categories in the front end. And we saw Retail Pharmacy operating margin,
as you know, step up as a result of our investments and our focus on environment, service, and differentiated product.
Indeed, differentiation is the key example there.
<Q - Ricky R. Goldwasser>: Okay. And then when we've talked in the past, you talked about the vision of Walgreen
as being like the new retailer with a lot of different wraparound services that will attract patients and consumers into the
stores. I think you recently opened or are piloting a vision offering in one of your flagship stores. Can you talk a little
bit about what type of assets you're looking to add to your current offering and how it fits in with the recent
partnerships that you signed in 2016?
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Sure, I think we have got solid businesses in Europe and particularly all in the UK, to
be honest, in both optical and hearing care. So we have great partnerships in these businesses, and we have partnerships
with manufacturers that help us. So we have tested, as you said, a pilot really in our flagship store in Chicago and that
really is to try and understand the market and how customers react to that, and we'll take decisions based on how that
comes through going forward. So these are two, vision and hearing care, which clearly we can transport from our
experience in Europe.
I think also we've been very successful in the last 12 months at being able to outsource our retail clinics. And again,
that's a partnership model that we speak about a lot, and we have continued to sign deals and outsource these
successfully with many partners across America. And again, that's another way that we bring wraparound services and
more patients into Walgreens is by working closely with local service providers and providing the services that they
want inside of our pharmacies across the USA. That's another example of how we're thinking how we're working.
<Q - Ricky R. Goldwasser>: Okay, thank you.

Thank you. Our next question is from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. You may begin.
<Q - Lisa Christine Gill>: Great, thank you. Good morning. George, I just want to start with a question for you. You
talk about being back-half driven, and I think we heard you say that when you gave the initial guidance, but I'm just
curious as to how to think about the cadence. And how do we think about going from Q1 to Q2? Should it be a little
more back-half weighted than what you're currently seeing in the Street? Is that the message that we should be taking
today?
<A - George Rollo Fairweather>: I think the message today is no different to the message that we were certainly
trying to give in the full-year results. And the partnerships that we have been talking about, it takes time for us to build
the volume. And so when you're actually looking at relative numbers, our expectation has always been that the earlier
part of the year relatively would be the tougher part, then it will take time for us to build the volume to see the gross
profit therefore in dollars come through from the new partnerships that we're all so excited about. So you should think
of that in shape and really be thinking about those as either being a build across the four quarters and take the first
quarter results as an indication of that and then think in terms of building.
<Q - Lisa Christine Gill>: And then my second question, and maybe I've misunderstood this, but I never thought of
drug price inflation as being very important to the drug retail model. Am I misunderstanding that? Is there more than
just that interim opportunity of capturing some level of spread as the price went up before the reimbursement changed,
or are there other inventory opportunities or something else because I did hear you call out today less or moderating
drug price inflation as being a little bit of a headwind?
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Hi, Lisa. This is Alex. Sorry on this. No, it's a headwind to sales via the volume
differential, if you like. It's a slight headwind to the retail business, but obviously it's a support to the wholesale
business, so in the mix it really isn't a big difference, but it does make a difference in sales, which is the question I was
answering, I think, from Alvin earlier on.
<Q - Lisa Christine Gill>: Okay. And I guess if I could just slip in just one last one and that's just around utilization,
you talked about increasing your level of market share, but yet you're seeing less utilization. Do you have any thoughts
around why that is? Normally, I know this is a quarter ending November but we start to see pickup as people move
towards the end of their deductible. Are you seeing anything or have you seen anything in the December quarter that
that's shifted from what you've seen historically?
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: No, the December quarter, it's one month so far so again this is a season, it is a season
for obviously for cough, cold and flu and illness. And as Gerald said, there's a bit of that around the table here this
morning as well. So I think we are seeing a more normal flu trend which kicked in a bit later in the season than we'd
expected but that's the only thing really that's changed in December which is going to be obviously a slight tailwind for
us in the second quarter but that's still early on and we'll see what happens with the rest of the season.
<Q - Lisa Christine Gill>: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Willoughby with Credit Suisse. You may begin.
<Q - Robert Willoughby>: Hi. What's a good assumption for what sale leasebacks can contribute in cash over the
remainder of the year? The first quarter was a bit higher than where we thought. And then secondarily, any metrics on
what the new store format is contributing for you?
<A - George Rollo Fairweather>: Okay, I'll take the sale and leasebacks one. We're continuing to look at sale and
leaseback opportunities on a go-forward basis. The timing of those is a little tricky to actually predict because we're
very disciplined on the returns that we're looking for on the various transactions but you should take it that it's

something that we will continue to do going forward. But as I said, those tend to be in individual transactions. It's hard
to predict quarter by quarter exactly when they're going to occur.
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: I'll take the other. With regard to new store formats, the investment at the moment is to
update the whole estate so we have been upgrading the whole estate with a particular focus on beauty in our top volume
stores, the top 1,800 so far with more to come next year, as George has said. We have got some pilots in test both in
urban and what we're calling the lower volume stores. We call these opportunity stores under the very early stages of
testing and trialing these out. And again, we'll update you when we get further down the line but the investment now is
to upgrade the whole estate to make sure that we give a more consistent Walgreens brand and offer across 30,000-plus
drugstores in the USA.
<A - Stefano Pessina>: But I would like to assure you that the operating cash flow this year will be very good. We
expect very good operating cash flow. Of course, we have had the first quarter with relatively low operating cash flow,
but this happens every quarter because of course we buy more stock for Christmas because we pay bonuses, because
we pay of course the dividends. There are many cash draws in this period. And so in all of our stores, the first quarter
has been relatively modest in cash flow and free cash flow. But after it goes up during the year and we don't see any
reason why this year should be so dramatically different from the previous year. Of course, it depends on how we
manage our investment, how we manage our leases, but substantially we don't have structural differences. So it's as
always very difficult to analyze things quarter-by-quarter and to draw a conclusion just from the last number.
<Q - Robert Willoughby>: That's great. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from David Larsen with Leerink. You may begin.
<Q - David M. Larsen>: Hi. Can you please talk a bit about the $1 billion synergies that you expect to capture from
the Rite Aid transaction by year three or four? Like, I'm assuming that's $1 billion a year. And then what makes up
those synergies? And then how do you think about RAD earnings themselves versus cost synergies? Is that $1 billion
inclusive of both? And then, how do I tie this $1 billion back to $0.05 to $0.12 of accretion in year one? The $0.05 to
$0.12 sounds very modest to me. So, that's a lot. Thanks very much. Appreciate it.
<A - George Rollo Fairweather>: Okay. So there're quite a few questions in there, so hope I won't miss any. To start
by saying that the first thing is that in terms of the accretion for this year, I think it's important to remember where we
are. We're already four months into the year. And when we complete transactions, the first priority is always very much
about focusing on the customers getting the key elements of everyone working together.
And in terms of delivering synergies, our approach to synergies, as you saw in the Walgreens Alliance Boots
transaction, is to have a very clear plan going in and then build the synergies up over – or ramp up over a period of time
so that we do things in a disciplined way that we can secure the synergies year after year. So we don't just go for quick
wins and pay the price later, and we've got a good track record of doing that. Clearly, there are certain synergies that
take time to access. So on procurement synergies for example, it takes time to put in place new arrangements. We've
got stock sitting on the balance sheet that needs to be sold through. So, that is really reflective of the guidance that
we've given for the balance of this year.
In terms of the synergies themselves, curious the $1 billion will come from, starting with areas like procurement where
we've got our sourcing operation on generics that sources products today both for ourselves and for
AmerisourceBergen. There's going to be then certain overhead cost savings that we will be able to deliver over time.
But what the $1 billion doesn't include, which is important to understand, is it doesn't include the opportunity that we
would have to actually rationalize the portfolio where there are overlaps in existing large markets. And that's something
that we would do separately and it's equivalent to file buys, and that is outside the synergy number.
What's also important in the number of the $1 billion is that we are very disciplined in the way we measure and track
synergies, and the $1 billion is the synergies that we're confident that we can – are very clearly identifiable and

quantifiable synergies that we can measure and track and report on because that delivery is very important. What one
always gets in transactions over and above that is a lot of the less tangible measurable synergies, but these are the ones
that over time really all help to deliver real long-term sustained shareholder value. The $1 billion I say is a run rate, just
to be absolutely clear. It's what we expect to deliver per annum.
<Q - David M. Larsen>: Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you. And then how was – when we think about Prime and
TRICARE and Express Scripts, for this most recent quarter, were the new prices and also co-pay and deductible plan
designs in place at the start of the quarter?
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: It's Alex here. No, remember, the first one actually was DoD in TRICARE, which
started on December 1, and Prime started 1/1/2017.
<Q - David M. Larsen>: Okay, that's great. So then all of the new prices and the co-paying plan design start on those
dates, right?
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Yeah, correct. Yeah.
<Q - David M. Larsen>: Okay, great. Thanks very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Percher with Barclays. You may begin.
<Q - Eric Percher>: To start, Alex, did you just mention rationalization of the Rite Aid base post-acquisition? And is
that an important part or an important opportunity strategically following completion and approval of the transaction?
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: These Scottish accents are difficult. I didn't mention it, but George answered the
question and I think what he said was that – no decision was made on this at all. Let's be straight about this. And it's not
including the $1 billion synergies that we announced, is what George said.
<Q - Eric Percher>: Okay. It will be looked at as a strategic effort post...
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: There's a possibility, for sure. Of course, it is. But it's not in the $1 billion synergies
and it's not currently in the plan, yeah.
<Q - Eric Percher>: Okay. So with...
<A - Stefano Pessina>: More generally, more generally when we talk of synergies, we talk of mergers. We try to
figure out which is the level – the potential level of synergies, and we do it with elements that we have comparing, let's
say, that there are stores in this case to us thinking that at the end we will be able to unify the terms with the suppliers,
imagining that we can reduce a certain function, a certain duplication and so reduce certain costs.
So we put in place all the area we know where we can reduce costs, but it's an exercise. We cannot be precise because
we don't know exactly the situation of the other company. We don't know exactly how these companies buy today. We
don't know exactly which kind of contract they have with PBM. When we will be in charge of the company, we will
analyze all these documents and of course we will be able to assess a level of synergies, which is much more precise.
What does it mean? This means that the level of synergies that we have are calculated in a relatively prudent way,
rationally prudent, I mean, rationally prudent way because, of course, we cannot run the risk not to meet our target
internally. So we take some contingencies. And not all of them are really dependent on the number of stores. I mean
500 stores more or 500 stores less, 10% more, 10% less are in reality I would say in the rounding on which we have to
calculate the synergies because we don't have a very clear understanding of what our counterparty is because we
cannot. The law doesn't allow us to share all the figures, so our due diligence is necessarily a superficial – relatively
superficial due diligence.

So in reality, one thing I can tell you that when we do whatever acquisition, whatever merger, we find that the final
synergies are wider and substantially wider, substantially larger than the synergies that we have announced. And so,
today we shouldn't talk too much about the synergies, but we will be able to give you a precise target and the timing as
soon as we will have acknowledged what there is really in the company. But as we have calculated the synergies in a
rational way, we believe that the number probably will be higher in [ph] October (59:00).
<Q - Eric Percher>: So I will come back to the rationalization at a point where we can all talk about it, but maybe my
original question was actually going to be volume. We've talked a lot about this year's volume. As we consider
commercial versus Part D where a lot of the growth has been, do we expect that commercial may actually be a greater
contributor to growth in the second half and does that then extend over the next year or two where commercial pricing
could be stable and give you a bit of an offset to the reimbursement pressure we see annually in Part D?
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Hi, it's Alex here. So the truth of it is that reimbursement pressure is consistent. And
while maybe for sure is an annual contract that you see more regularly coming through, the pressure in the commercial
business is also strong. One does, to some extent, follow the other. So the market is the market. We are very clear on
how we govern within the business and how we structure pricing within the business. We do that both at the Walgreens
level through myself and Alan Nielsen [indiscernible] (1:00:12), and also the group level through Stefano and George,
but the reimbursement pressure is real and we manage within the market.
So I don't think you'll see that upside, to be really straight with you. In the future, I think you'll see continued
reimbursement pressure and we are managing it through a combination of three things: through more volume, through
better partnerships, which we are very happy with at the moment and they are going well; secondly, through increasing
our retail gross margin and retail operating margin, where we are seeing good green shoots and have seen a good
growth in the last three years, and that continues; and good cost control.
<Q - Eric Percher>: That's a straight answer, thank you.
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Okay.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Steven Valiquette with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may begin.
<Q - Steven J. Valiquette>: All right, thanks. Good morning, everybody. So it's interesting now with some hindsight
that Walgreens never ended up pulling the trigger on the international tax inversion phenomenon from a couple years
ago, but now you may be in a position to benefit from U.S. corporate tax reform. So really just a couple of questions on
taxes. I guess first, over these past couple of quarters, you seemed to have been able to get your tax rate down to levels
that people were only dreaming about with this inversion craze a few years ago, so kudos on that. But how should we
think about your tax rate for the rest of fiscal 2017?
And then second, do you have any preliminary comments on the pros and cons of this potential U.S. corporate tax
reform and what it might mean for Walgreens? Thanks.
<A - Stefano Pessina>: I can answer on the second part of the question whether we have some ideas on the coming tax
reform. I can repeat the same thing I said before. Now there is not a project of tax reform. There are certain principles.
People are discussing about certain principles. Not everybody in the administration agrees on the same principle. And
even if they agree on the same principle, they don't agree on the level of or on the quantity of the principles. So it's a
waste of time today to start to create synergy, which very likely will be in reality substantially different. So let's see
when we will have the frame of the tax, and after we will start immediately to think how we can live with this new
environment.
In any case, we will not have a new tax system tomorrow morning. It will take months and we will have time to see
how these will shape over time. And when we believe that we are close to a final shape, we will start to see how we can
work. But even though having looked at the different principles that now have been debated, yes, there are certain

principles who could damage us, but there are other principles who could benefit us. And it's clear that the principles
who could damage us will damage all our peers, and so the market will find another equilibrium in other assets.
So at the end of the day, the conclusion is that, for the time being, we have to continue to work with the rules that are in
place today, and probably in one year or two year or three years, we will have to change something. But now it's too
early to distract our people to do things, which probably will never happen before at the end. The mix will be
completely different.
<Q - Steven J. Valiquette>: Okay.
<A - Stefano Pessina>: The second part of your...
<A - George Rollo Fairweather>: But just commenting on the rates at the year end, we indicated our effective tax rate
last year I think was around 26.3% excluding the discrete tax items. And we look at the calc excluding ABC equity
income on an adjusted basis because it's the only easy way to do the math. This quarter we've come in around the
25.5%, so a little better. It's a function really of two things: the geographic mix, which of course varies quarter by
quarter; and then the certain discrete items in an individual quarter that results in historic tax issues or other discrete
items that can have a little impact on the quarters-by-quarters results.
That mix really reflects the composition of profits across Walgreens Boots Alliance, recognizing we've obviously got
profits from our international operations, and we try and obviously organize our intergroup funding structure in an
efficient way from a taxation perspective. And we obviously have sources of I say profit outside the U.S. that benefit
our rate, but beyond that, really not a lot to comment on. And Stefano has already covered the view of what may or
may not happen in the future. But we are very focused on EPS. And whether it's tax or whether it's our funding costs,
they get a lot of focus in our organization as well as adjusted operating income along with cash flow, which Stefano
also talked about, to drive shareholder value.
<Q - Steven J. Valiquette>: Okay, that's helpful. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our last question is from Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. You may begin.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Hey, guys, thanks for fitting me in. So I just wanted to talk about strategy. And I know,
Stefano, you talked about acquisitions overseas. When we think about Rite Aid, what's the Plan B if it doesn't get
approved as we get down to the end here in the U.S. business? And then does that speed up some of your thoughts
overseas?
<A - Stefano Pessina>: We are working hard to have this deal approved. And for the time being, we don't want even to
think of the fact that the deal could not be approved after so many months when we have given a lot of information and
we have had a very good relationship with the people of the FTC. And they have continued to ask information and we
have continued to give information. And in reality, we believe that if they have spent so much time asking and
analyzing so many documents is because they want to understand the substance of this transaction, which is fine.
So we are not thinking of a Plan B today. We don't have to distract people today. I can assure you that if let's say we
had a big surprise that this wouldn't happen after, we would have to sit down and decide what to do because there are
many, many possible reactions to this, as you can imagine. We would have to see what our counterparty, Rite Aid,
wants to do and see whether there are solutions or not, what are other alternatives.
In reality, we would have money and we will use the money in the best interest of our shareholders. We will continue
to act rationally. We will not spend money in an irrational way just for the matter of principle. We will analyze all the
opportunities very quickly, very quickly because I and the multitude team of people here are thinking always of
different scenarios, analyzing many other things. Very quickly we will decide what to do, then we will communicate to
the shareholders what we want to do. But I can assure you that we will not have, let's say – how could I say, any [ph]
hysterical (1:09:52) reaction, and we will not feel forced to do something at any cost. Just be sure that we are doing

something. We will take stock of the money that we have and we will analyze various actions which is the best use of
this money at the time for our shareholders.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: But it does seem like you potentially could litigate depending on what happens, is that
correct interpretation of what you said?
<A - Stefano Pessina>: Potentially, sorry. Say it again.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Potentially litigate.
<A - Stefano Pessina>: Listen, how can I give you an answer like that? We don't know. For the time being, everything
looks fine, so we don't go so fast.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Perfect. I wanted to move onto one last question and I appreciate the time. So Boots in the
UK, the retail side of the business, it sounds like it was slightly positive, but I think there were comments that maybe
December got a little bit better. We were over in the UK. It seems like its discounting was pretty significant in the front
end of the Boots operation. So I was wondering if we could get a little more color on the retail side of Boots and what's
going on there. Then I'll yield, thank you.
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Hi, Scott. It's Alex here. Yeah, I think that as George said really clearly in the script
two things. First of all, environment in the UK has changed in the summer, that's a big change to the retail environment
in particular which we are working with then, so we've repositioned our business and focused on rebasing our costs
again and also focused on customer care. So the good news is these plans are working, and as George said, we've had a
notable improvement in sales performance through December as we said in the script. Again, we are very much
focusing back on our core business in a very clear way.
The real challenge is going forward, I would say, for the retailers which we are taking care of. We were very effective
on the omni-channel model, which is working well. We have to obviously operate our costs lower because obviously
that does affect the margin slightly. And of course, as George said in his script from December 1, the government is
taking additional action – new action effectively on practice payments, which really means more call back in terms of
pharmacy which we are aware of and we have planned for and what we actually planned against. So we are feeling
we're in a good position with a very strong business in a difficult environment and we're pleased with the progress.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: All right. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it. Good luck.
Operator
Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Gerald Gradwell for closing remarks.

questions, please feel free to reach out to any member of the IR team: myself, Ashish, Deborah, Jonathan or Patrick,
