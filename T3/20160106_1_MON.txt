MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Greetings and welcome to the Monsanto Company first quarter fiscal year 2016 earnings conference call and R&D
pipeline update. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow
the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Laura Meyer, Monsanto Investor Relations Lead. Thank you. You may
begin.
Laura J. Meyer
Thank you, Adam, and good morning, and Happy New Year to everyone. I'm joined this morning by Hugh Grant, our
Chairman and CEO; Brett Begemann, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Pierre Courduroux, our CFO; and by
Dr. Robb Fraley, our Chief Technology Officer. Also joining me from the IR team are Tim Baker, Priyal Patel and
Ashley Wissmann.
Our first quarter call provides the initial insights into our fiscal year with a summary of our first quarter results, and
importantly, our views into our outlook for the rest of the year. Additionally, as we always do in the first quarter, we

will provide our annual R&D pipeline and product performance update.
This call is being webcast and you can access the webcast, supporting slides and the replay at monsanto.com. We have
provided you today with EPS and other measures on both the GAAP and ongoing business basis. Where we refer to
non-GAAP financial measures, we reconcile to GAAP in the slides and in the press release, both of which are on the
website.
This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on
assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may vary in a
material way from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. A description of the factors that may
cause such a variance is included in the Safe Harbor language in our most recent 10-K and in today's press release. The
forward-looking statements are current only as of the date of this call, and the company disclaims any obligation to
update them or the factors that may affect actual results.
First and foremost, let me review our first quarter results as shown on slide four. Our first quarter ongoing loss per
share of $0.11 was better than expected on the basis of lower-than-expected operating expenses and better Intacta sales
in Brazil. When compared to the prior year, currency accounted for approximately half of the decline in ongoing
earnings per share.
On an as-reported basis, our first quarter loss per share was $0.56, reflecting $0.46 for restructuring charges, consistent
with our planned actions to reduce annual spend by $500 million by fiscal year 2018. Finally, our free cash flow for the
first quarter was more than $1 billion as compared to $969 million in the prior year, reflecting the reduction in
inventory and modest growth in our prepays.
With that brief summary, let me hand it to Hugh to provide the strategic outlook.
Hugh M. Grant
Thank you, Laura, and Happy New Year to everybody on the line this morning. First of all, a special thanks to the 130
of you who joined us our recent biannual investor event. We were pleased to share with you our long-term outlook and,
importantly, an early preview into our outstanding pipeline and product our performance, which will build upon today.
Consistent with our earlier event, I'd like to start today with the topic of industry consolidation right at the beginning.
First, we have an incredible standalone growth plan backed by our commitment to innovation and the industry's
broadest, deepest and most proven pipeline. Second, we expect industry consolidation to continue, and it should, given
the opportunities for significant synergies and value creation in R&D across the industry. Third, we expect to continue
to be the partner of choice across the industry, whether it's through our broad licensing approach, through collaboration
and partnerships, or through strategic M&A.
Yes, two of our largest competitors recently announced that they're combining, but they're also two of our largest
technology licensees and we expect that to continue, given the opportunities of our unparalleled pipeline. Finally, we'll
continue with a disciplined approach to evaluating M&A opportunities as we seek a strong strategic fit and synergistic
value.
So with that, let's move to the update for the quarter and our annual R&D pipeline update, which is more relevant than
ever, given the macro trends in agriculture as shown on slide five. We see innovation in agriculture as being pivotal in
addressing the three megatrends, namely, sustainable food security, climate change, and industry consolidation. And
we believe our innovation places us in a unique position to lead in all of these areas.
As we move to slide six, this is our third consecutive year of more than 20 advancements and our core pipeline is still
expected to deliver up to $25 billion in peak net sales. And this is before considering the upside value from our
transformational new growth platforms. We continue to see significant growth from our core, spanning the spectrum of
grower needs. This ranges from breeding enhancements to deliver yield to multi-generational projects in the categories
of insect and weed control.

Further, our new platforms in Climate and the BioAg Alliance are beginning to show meaningful progress in the
relatively untapped category of plant health and fertility. Collectively, this progress drives our ability to deliver what
we expect to be greater than 1.3 billion acres of technology upgrades by 2025, providing sustainable intensification on
our existing 400 million acre footprint as shown on slide seven.
Today, however, the headwinds from currency and commodity prices that we outlined at the start of this fiscal year
have not yet abated, and in fact, currency has become a much stronger headwind with the recent events in Argentina.
We're pleased to see the early decisive approach of the new President, and we believe that his actions, particularly, the
lifting of export taxes on grain, will create longer-term benefits for agriculture, for which we are well-positioned to
participate.
However, the approximate 35% to 40% devaluation of the Argentine peso is expected to create an estimated $0.20 to
$0.25 charge in Q2. And with that increased headwind, we now expect our fiscal year 2016 ongoing EPS to trend to the
lower half of our guidance range of $5.10 to $5.60, as shown on slide eight.
Despite this currency pressure, we still have a strong outlook for cash generation, and we continue to expect our free
cash flow to be in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion. And we've continued our disciplined spend management
with plans now in place to deliver on $500 million of annual cost savings by fiscal year 2018.
Despite these near-term headwinds, we continue to confirm our long-term growth targets to deliver greater than 20%
compounded annual growth and our ongoing earnings per share from the end of fiscal year 2016 to fiscal year 2019 as
outlined in slide nine. In that timeframe, we expect demand trends for grain to continue and improve grower margins.
We expect currency to remain relatively consistent with today's rates, and importantly, we expect our innovation to
carry 80% of expected gross profit growth with continued industry-leading corn hybrid renewal and growth from the
Intacta and Roundup Ready 2 Xtend, blockbusters and soybeans.
The breadth, depth, and productivity of our pipeline gives us confidence in both our long-term growth targets as well as
the strong role that we believe we will play in addressing the evolving landscape across agriculture. With the unique
vantage point that we have from our pipeline and the technology in hand to create the nine to 14 gene stacks by 2025,
we expect to lead and design the integrated solutions for the industry.
So with that introduction, let me hand over to Brett for the operational update.
Brett D. Begemann
Thanks, Hugh, and good morning to everyone on the line.
Delivery of our near-term and long-term targets that Hugh just shared with you hinges on our ability to deliver on our
key operational priorities, namely: delivering $3.5 billion of expected gross profit growth from fiscal year 2016 to
fiscal year 2019; upgrading the industry's largest seed technology platform to the Xtend technology; monetizing our
new growth platforms; and maintaining our financial discipline, as outlined on slide 10.
Let's look at these priorities in more detail, with an update on relevant key milestones from the first quarter and how
those will inform the rest of fiscal year 2016. First, let's take a look at our global corn seed franchise. With
industry-leading share positions in almost every one of our major corn regions, as shown on slide 11, we plan to drive
our growth off of this leading footprint from a combination of continued share gains and annual price mix lift gains in
germplasm.
Even in this challenging Ag environment, we continue to target to hold or grow share in every major corn growing
region in fiscal year 2016. And while it is still early days to estimate share gains, we are confident that we grew our
corn brand share in the summer season in Brazil. And in the Northern Hemisphere, the dealer and grower order book
volumes and prepays in the U.S. are tracking modestly ahead of the prior year despite the continued compressed
commodity prices.

Not only do we continue to pursue our plan to hold or grow share in every major corn growing region in fiscal year
2016, but we continue to target to deliver positive low single-digit price mix lift in corn germplasm globally, exclusive
of currency impacts. In Brazil, we've been able to deliver germplasm price mix lift of 10% exclusive of currency in the
first quarter, which has allowed us to moderate a portion of the currency downsides, and we will continue to target to
do so going forward.
In the U.S. order book, after our pricing ladder adjustments, the year one to year three hybrids make up 50% to 60% of
the portfolio, consistent with the trends we outlined on slide 12. The continuation of our industry-leading performance
supports this targeted mix lift. However, our realized mix lift will ultimately be determined in the second and third
quarters, where we will be closely monitoring discounting in this environment of compressed grower margins.
Moving beyond corn to soybeans, our second-largest gross profit driver for fiscal year 2019, we continued to see great
uptake of our Intacta technology in South America. Our results came in better than forecasted in the first quarter, in part
due to Intacta sales, and we remain confident in our target to penetrate 30 million acres across South America in just
the third year of launch, as you can see on slide 13. With its greater than four-bushel average yield advantage and
reduction in insecticide sprays, growers continue to demand Intacta technology in what we see as a 100 million acre
opportunity in South America.
And while Intacta has had the fastest penetration of any biotech trait to date, we expect Roundup Ready 2 Xtend
soybeans to top this level, with greater than 3 million acres expected this year in its first year of commercial launch.
Based on our U.S. reservation system, we feel confident in the demand for more than 3 million acres of the technology.
We've also been progressing with our dicamba chemistry strategy and closed on multiple supply agreements, as shown
on slide 14. These agreements are expected to provide us with adequate supply of dicamba in the early years following
launch, and together with our pending self-manufacturing plans, are expected to provide a balanced approach to
cost-effective dicamba supply.
Not to be outdone, Bollgard II XtendFlex cotton is expected to penetrate 1.5 million acres this season in the U.S.,
double the more than 750,000 acres in fiscal year 2015's limited commercial introduction. Not only do we expect this to
create value from improved weed control, but we expect these new varieties to drive share in Deltapine seed, just as it
did in fiscal year 2015.
Moving beyond our core businesses, we continue to progress with our plans for the coming U.S. season at Climate,
where we're working towards the closing of our most recent agreement with John Deere, which uniquely positions us
with exclusive third-party, near real-time connectivity, and in-cab visualization of data. This agreement marks our third
connectivity agreement with the major equipment dealers and is a great addition to our industry-leading retail network
to the top six U.S. Ag retailers. In addition, this agreement is accelerating both grower and retailer interest in the
technology.
This reach combined with the capabilities of our advisors and the adoption we've secured to date, as shown on slide 15,
establishes Climate as the digital ag platform, and we expect to continue that momentum in fiscal year 2016, with
expected penetration to 12 million paid acres and platform adoption to an expected 90 million acres, as shown on slide
16.
Our success, however, is based on more than gross profit growth drivers I have just outlined. It is also predicated on the
continuation of discipline, discipline in how we manage our existing Ag Productivity business segment and discipline
in how we execute our restructuring and cost savings plans.
On the Ag productivity front, we saw the tough comparison we expected in the first quarter results. With generic prices
down significantly versus the prior year and very challenging comparisons on currencies, particularly in Brazil, we
experienced year-over-year declines in pricing of more than 20% inclusive of currency. Overall, however, as shown on
slide 17, we still expect to sell roughly 300 million gallons for the full year, as we expect to continue to manage our
price premium closely and pick up the decline in volumes from Q1 in the latter half of the year.
Moving to the topic of disciplined spend management, we now have restructuring plans and cost savings initiatives in
place that align to our target to deliver $500 million in annual savings by fiscal year 2018. The actions we disclosed

earlier today build from the foundation we outlined on slide 18 to streamline the organization to create enduring and
durable savings. We are focused on creating scale and efficiency while still delivering outstanding innovation and
customer service through the creation of four commercial hubs and a R&D center of excellence and from fully
leveraging data analytics.
With that, let me pass it to Pierre for the financial update. Pierre?
Pierre C. Courduroux
Thanks, Brett, and good morning to everyone on the line.
Before I go into the financial view on our business outlook for the year, let me start with the results from the first
quarter, as shown on slide four. First, we delivered a loss of $0.11 per share on an ongoing basis, which was better than
our expected ongoing loss of $0.23 to $0.33. That improvement versus our expectation was driven by lower operating
expenses and by better than expected results in Intacta in Brazil. Specifically, operating expenses, excluding
restructuring charges, were 9% lower than the prior year, mostly driven by currency.
From a year-to-year perspective, currency and particularly the Brazilian real accounted for approximately half of the
decline in ongoing earnings per share. On a constant currency basis, the decrease in earnings per share versus the prior
year was mostly due to the decline in Ag Productivity gross profit related to the anticipated glyphosate price declines
and the impact of the timing of glyphosate deliveries.
Seeds and Genomics gross profit was mostly impacted by the anticipated reduction in corn volumes arising from timing
shifts and lower planted acres in the Southern Hemisphere. Offsetting some of those decline was the $125 million of
gross profit growth in soybeans before the effect of currency, led by the strong performance of Intacta.
Second, on an as-reported basis, we reported a loss of $0.56 per share, reflecting $210 million of after-tax restructuring
charges in the quarter. We have now recorded approximately 70% of the expected restructuring charges, and this sets
us on pace for the $500 million of annual cost savings we're expecting by fiscal year 2018, as outlined on slide 19.
Third, from a cash flow perspective, we delivered more than $1 billion of free cash, representing a 6% increase versus
the prior year. As expected, this reflects the cash benefit of the implementation of a disciplined corn seed production
plan that drove significant inventory reductions as well as modest growth in our prepays in the U.S.
Moving to the outlook for the year, with the recent currency devaluation in Argentina, we now expect to trend to the
lower half of our ongoing earnings per share guidance of $5.10 to $5.60 for the full year, as shown on slide 20. We
expect an approximate $0.20 to $0.25 net downside to our ongoing EPS in the second quarter related to the
approximate 35% to 40% weakening of the Argentine peso versus the U.S. dollar.
We're expecting to book a one-time significant charge in the second quarter related to our net balance sheet exposure
and expect modest variability in the adjustment thereafter as we will mark to the currency evolution every month.
Altogether, from a currency perspective, we are now expecting $0.60 to $0.70 of currency headwinds for the full-year
versus the prior year expectation of $0.35 to $0.40, with the Argentine peso accounting for the majority of this increase.
Despite some moderating in our outlook for currency and corn price mix lift with the competitive dynamics in this
challenging Ag environment, we still see an opportunity for a 5% to 7% growth in Seeds and Genomics gross profit.
We continue to expect this growth to come from the benefit of the $275 million or more in expected licensing
agreements, from corn germplasm mix lift in the low-single-digits, exclusive of currency, from targeted corn share
gains, and from the growth in our Intacta soybeans. This growth is expected to be partially offset by the expected costs
of $70 million to $80 million associated with the Roundup Ready 2 Xtend launch and the $90 million to $100 million
of incremental corn cost of goods coming from the smaller corn seed production plans.
For Ag Productivity, we continue to expect gross profit to be in the range of $900 million to $1.1 billion, as we expect
to sell roughly 300 million gallons for the full-year at prices expected to improve slightly as we move through the fiscal
year. Based on the estimated savings from the additional restructuring actions, continued cost savings and currency

benefits, we now expect operating expenses, exclusive of restructuring and environmental and litigation settlement
expenses, to be flat versus fiscal year 2015, inclusive of new platform spend.
Operating income and expense, considering the expected impact from the Argentine peso devaluation, is expected to be
approximately $100 million to $120 million worse than the prior year on a full-year basis. Beyond the operating profit
drivers, the net effect of our ongoing $3 billion accelerated share repurchase, including increased financing, should
generate a net annual EPS benefit of $0.24 to $0.27, unchanged from our prior guidance. We continue to expect the
ASR to close and be trued up in the next three months, closing out another key step in the progress of our capital
allocation strategy.
From a capital allocation perspective, we remain committed to a balanced approach between share repurchases,
dividends, capital investments, and investments in technology, as shown on slide 21. This approach, combined with our
commitment to a solid investment-grade credit rating that allows access to commercial paper, should allow us to
operate with strategic flexibility to invest in high-growth opportunities that support our strategy, while giving us the
latitude to execute on larger-scale opportunities, as appropriate. Backing this strategy is our ability to convert earnings
into strong cash generation.
Overall, even as our earnings guidance moves to the lower half of our range, we still expect to generate $1.6 billion to
$1.8 billion of free cash flow in fiscal 2016. We see the opportunity to grow this in future year, absent the
approximately $200 million to $250 million of after-tax restructuring charge costs we expect to incur in fiscal year
2016.
As I shared at our Investor Event, my focus is on return on innovation, financial discipline, and balanced capital
allocation, all of which support long-term growth and return of value to our share owners. Continuing to execute well
on these pillars, along with delivering on the innovation in our pipeline, provides the gateway to the rapid future
business growth necessary to deliver on our plan to grow our ongoing EPS by more than 20% annually from fiscal year
2017 to fiscal year 2019.
Thanks, and I'll turn the time over to Robb for the annual pipeline update.
Robert T. Fraley
Thanks, Pierre, and good morning to everybody.
This is an exciting time for technology. The convergence of the advances in biology and data science are transforming
agriculture, both expanding the breadth of what's possible today and accelerating the pace of innovation.
On slide four, you can see the unparalleled diversity of platforms and the significant number of technologies that we
draw upon both internally and externally to drive new innovations. And as excited as I am about what we do in our own
world-class research organization, I'm really equally proud of the work we do through collaborations with academics,
public and private sector partners, and strategic M&A deals. Over the last few years, we've initiated venture capital
investments in 20-plus organizations in key areas of agricultural productivity, digital agriculture and biologicals,
complementing our company's integrated systems approach to drive future growth.
Which brings me to a key point, innovation is delivering the growth engine that will take us well into the next decade.
On the heels of two $1 billion-plus blockbuster product launches, expected with Intacta and Xtend, this is a robust
pipeline of multi-generational upgrades expected to deliver up to $25 billion in peak net sales in the core alone, as
shown on slides five through seven, with considerable upside potential from our new platforms.
I'm particularly excited about our 30 advancements this year, which is the third consecutive year of greater than 20
pipeline advancements, as shown on slide eight. And I think this progress showcases the breadth and depth of our
integrated yield pipeline, which really fuels innovation for the industry.
As we look at the agronomic focal points for a grower, yield is by far the biggest one. And our pipeline value aligns
with that targeting to deliver estimated peak net sales of up to $14.5 billion. Now breeding is clearly our cornerstone.

And as you'll see on slide nine, we're expanding our capability and advantage and further transforming our breeding
program.
The success of our breeding program has been built on three competitive advantages. We have the largest and most
diverse germplasm library on the planet, and that's paired with the industry-best discovery technologies such as high
throughput screening, advanced markers, and seed chipping, and finally, we have the largest global integrated testing
network, which we leverage to identify, select, and deploy the best-performing seeds globally.
But now using genome-wide selection, we expect to create a step change in breeding, allowing us to significantly
increase the size and rate of our germplasm screening. We expect to be able to analyze 10 times more breeding crosses
by the beginning of the next decade based essentially on DNA sequence knowledge and predictive analytics, which we
expect will translate to a 30% increase in genetic gain, giving us even more horsepower to upgrade our global
germplasm portfolio every year. So this competitive advantage in R&D is what feeds our biggest commercial
advantage.
On slide 10, I'm pleased to share with you that for the 10th consecutive year, DEKALB corn has been delivering an
average yield increase of seven to 10-bushel advantage in the U.S. across the gamut of growing conditions, which
really underscores the consistent performance advantage. Final harvest results for this year once again show a strong
performance advantage of more than seven bushels per acre versus the competition, and it doesn't stop there. On slide
11 with our advances in molecular breeding, our class of 2017 is expected to deliver 6 to 10 bushels more than our best
commercial hybrids today.
Let's look at soybeans next on slide 12. Roundup Ready 2 Yield, the established second-generation platform for
herbicide tolerance, continues to deliver a greater than four bushel per acre average advantage as compared to the
original Roundup Ready soybeans. And our new generation of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans provides superior
weed control and has the same high yield as Roundup Ready 2 varieties.
As we look to the future, the class of 2017 Roundup Ready 2 Xtend varieties shows increasing yield performance,
which reflects the benefit of the improved mix of the latest genetics in the new platform and the accelerating use of
molecular markers in soybeans. And finally, the panel on the right shows the greater than 70 varieties for this spring's
expected launch of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans, showcasing the genetic breadth and product performance that
sets up our biggest expected biotech seed launch.
Moving to cotton, our leading Deltapine cotton varieties on slide 13 demonstrates 70 pounds of lint per acre
performance advantage for the sixth consecutive year. Again, underscoring consistent yield advantage and setting up
the rapid adoption of Bollgard II XtendFlex.
Continuing in the yield category is our work in Yield-and-Stress. We are streamlining our focus based on insights from
the last decade and through our joint research collaboration with BASF, we've been able to identify a series of key
enabling traits that we believe will lead to increased yield.
And I'd like to highlight two projects leveraging this trait first approach, as shown on slide 14. That is the
next-generation of higher yielding corn and soy, both in Phase 1. And in collaboration with BASF, our next-generation
higher-yielding corn exhibits stronger roots and stocks, and in soy, the novel soybean yield trait demonstrated plants
with more pods in its first year of field testing.
We're also highlighting two new breeding projects that are making significant breakthroughs in yield beyond our
annual germplasm refresh. On slide 15, our High Density Corn systems are examples of how we're leveraging
germplasm, which can perform at higher plant populations and drive yield. With the potential to aggregate this with
insights from our Climate Script Creator, we can help growers target precise seed placement to optimize yield.
Let's move to weed control. 2016 represents the 20th anniversary of the Roundup Ready trait, a platform that has
penetrated over 350 million acres, making it the largest trait platform in the world. With our Roundup Ready Xtend
Crop System, shown on slide 16, we are going to refresh that broad platform, and we're progressing third and fourth
generation weed control systems to provide additional modes of action and weed control well into the future.

Complementarily linked to these systems is chemistry. We have five next-generation chemistries for weed control
advancing in our crop protection pipeline, shown in slide 17, and these products target much needed improvements and
solutions beyond what's possible in the market today. XtendiMax and Roundup Ready Xtend contain our proprietary
VaporGrip technology, which will offer superior season-long weed control with residual activity in new, easy-to-use,
low volatility dicamba formulations.
We're also working on a pre-mix of Warrant herbicide in dicamba, which will combine the crop-safe encapsulated form
of acetochlor with dicamba. And this will make it easier to apply multiple modes of action in a single application to
control both grass and broadleaf weeds, making it, I think, a very effective component of our Roundup Ready Xtend
system across soybean, corn, and cotton and with a fit on up to 100 million acres at peak penetration.
So these novel chemistry formulations along with the robust pipeline of multi-generational herbicide trait upgrades that
are coming beyond Xtend are expected to deliver up to $4.5 billion in peak net sales. Jumping even further into the
future, we're developing the next-generation complex gene stacks that will become the future platforms. Our
technology team has already discovered the stacked corn and soybean trait products that we expect to launch in 2025.
On slide 18, you can see that the future corn product is expected to have 14 traits, four unique below-ground insect
protection traits, four unique above-ground insect protection traits, five unique herbicide tolerance traits plus a novel
Yield-and-Stress trait. And as you can see on the bottom of the slide, the story repeats. The future soybean stacks we
have in hand are expected to give rise to a nine-gene stack in that same timeframe. I think, the point is, is that we know
today, which products are going to redefine the competitive standard in 2025.
Our global regulatory track-record combined with our leading seed and licensing footprint makes us a partner of choice
in this industry, and we're currently working with several parties to co-develop the next-generation of weed control,
pairing traits from new breakthrough chemistry modes of action, as shown on slide 19. And by working in parallel to
develop new weed control systems, these exciting collaborations and partnerships are expected to allow us to create
next-generation products far more quickly.
Insect control is another critical grower need, where like weed control, we have a pipeline of multi-generational
upgrades of novel insect protection traits in progress, and these are valued at up to $4 billion in net peak sales. As you
look across the key crops on slides 20 to 22, you can see that we have four products in Phase 4. And by the end of the
decade, we expect to launch all of these products, from SmartStax PRO across the Americas to the second-generation
of Intacta for South America, and all of which target some of the most significant pests in agriculture. And this year,
several of these are progressing in our pipeline, including the fourth-generation corn rootworm, the fourth-generation
above-ground insect protection in corn, as well as the third-generation insect protection in soybeans. These products are
expected to deliver new modes of action for increased durability, and many offer broader spectrum of control.
I'd like to highlight the work that we're doing with lygus. The Bollgard platform has revolutionized cotton protection
around the world with its control of the bollworm and other caterpillar pests. I believe the lygus product will be an
equivalent breakthrough product for controlling sucking and piercing insects, such as lygus, thrips, and leaf hoppers,
which have emerged as the major pests in cotton production. This technology will not only protect yield, but farmers
today are spraying extensively to control these pests, which combined with estimated losses cost farmers nearly $200
million annually.
Rounding out our core is our focus to deliver disease control solutions in an integrated system, and these are estimated
to deliver peak net sales of up to $3.5 billion. First in corn, on slide 23, across the major diseases such as stalk rot,
northern corn leaf blight, and Goss's wilt, it's clear that our breeding techniques are providing growers with enhanced
disease protection.
To complement this, we're pleased to share the advancement of our Acceleron seed treatment and enhanced fungicide
offering moving to Phase 4. This new chemical seed treatment in corn has averaged an impressive three bushels per
acre yield increase versus the standard seed treatment, and provides growers with early-season disease control and
late-season stalk rot suppression.

Our disease solutions expand beyond breeding and chemistry, and today we're announcing that we have identified lead
genes for transgenic broad-spectrum disease control. And layer on top of this the disease insights provided by our
Climate Field Health Advisor, and we're developing an unparalleled integrated disease control system.
Additionally, as shown on slide 24, we continue to make progress in our vegetable business with conventional breeding
techniques, this year advancing disease-resistant tomatoes and cucumbers. One of the most exciting new products in
our pipeline is a novel molecule for nematode control, shown on slide 25. So nematodes are a persistent soil pest across
all crops, resulting in about $1 billion in crop losses in U.S. soybeans alone, and in excess of $10 billion in losses
annually across all row crops across the globe. In its second year of expanded field testing, the Nemastrike technology
is showing outstanding field performance across several crops, and we expect it will become a key component of our
Acceleron seed treatment portfolio as well as attract licensing interest from third parties.
And building on the success with Nemastrike, as shown on slide 26, we've expanded our crop chemical approach
through a collaboration with Nimbus Therapeutics. Using their unique computationally-driven approach, we've
identified a novel fungicide chemistry currently in Phase 1 that is demonstrating increased yield protection in corn in
the presence of Rhizoctonia and Fusarium disease versus both untreated and commercial standard checks. These
projects, whether in breeding, biotechnology, crop protection, or climate, demonstrate the breadth and depth of our
systems approach to delivering disease control solutions.
So now shifting to our new growth platforms, I'd like to begin with microbials on slide 27, where in collaboration with
Novozymes, we're working to understand which microbes we can use to treat seeds to improve nutrient uptake,
promote growth, and provide insect control and disease protection.
In the early phase work, microbial strains are advancing from discovery to Phase 1 for disease and insect control. And
in the later stage, our enhanced corn inoculant lead, as shown on slide 28, is advancing from Phase 2 to Phase 4, and is
planned for a 2017 U.S. launch. This enhanced formulation delivers critical seed stability, and our 2015 yield data
showed a greater than four bushel per acre average yield advantage. Ultimately, the interplay between this technology
and our data science tools will allow us to position the right seed in the right field with the right microbial supplement
to stimulate productivity and yield.
The other platform within biologicals is our BioDirect platform, shown on slide 29, where we're developing new
topically applied RNAi-based tools to target plant disease, insect and weed control, as well as targets that enhance bee
health. And first in bee health on slide 30, the BioDirect technology is demonstrating significant improvement in
beehive survival by targeting the Varroa mite, a pest that feeds on the bee. With this efficacy, we've advanced this
project to Phase 2.
And in the BioDirect Canola Flea Beetle project on slide 31, it's advancing to Phase 1. Today flea beetles cause about
$300 million in damages in North America alone, and this technology would provide growers with an alternative
solution to the neonics currently used to control flea beetles. So with the significant strides we've made in BioDirect
manufacturing, we see tangible solutions coming to market to help growers.
Let's shift to our Digital Ag Platform, shown on slide 32. In just two years after acquisition, we have a fully populated
pipeline supporting our Digital Ag Platform. First, let's look at the exciting field results for our Nitrogen Advisor.
Nutrients are one of agriculture's most significant inputs, with a global market of more than $180 billion. This year our
Nitrogen Advisor was on millions of acres, as you can see on slide 33, and we saw phenomenal results across a sample
of more than 3,800 fields. Over 10% of those fields showed a nitrogen shortfall, which resulted in significant yield loss.
And more than 40% of the fields had excess nitrogen. When you add it all up, it exceeds $10 per acre of value on
average, and across the U.S. market, that's a $1 billion opportunity.
Now we're developing models to optimize within a field, where there's significant variation of nitrogen levels at any
given time. And in fact, we're advancing our Sub-Field Nitrogen tool, which will be field tested during the 2016 season.
And finally, as we develop models for other crops like wheat and canola, we'll start to unlock more of that multibillion
dollar opportunity.

Moving to slide 34, other highlights for the platform are our foundational connectivity, data capture, and visualization
tools, where we're seeing real commercial progress and a rapidly evolving pipeline. Just a few weeks ago we launched
our Climate FieldView Drive, which enables seamless connectivity while passing through the field. Our recent
agreement with John Deere enables near real-time connectivity through their wireless data server. And so at the end of
the day, regardless of the brand of their equipment, growers will have access to seamless data transfer to the cloud,
unlocking our unique ability to deliver actionable insights to millions of acres.
I'd like to wrap up by summarizing a few key points on slide 35. First, we have never had a sense of complacency about
our R&D leadership, and now, once again, we're transforming our efforts. And the efforts we're making now to change
breeding are raising the bar dramatically on what it will take to compete in this industry in the future.
In the area of biotechnology, we're putting in place literally today, the future 14 genes stack product for corn and the
nine gene stack for soybean that we believe will create an incredible competitive advantage and unique value to our
growers. We have novel new next-generation seed treatments, fungicides, herbicides, and biologicals progressing in our
crop protection portfolio. And with the progress we're seeing in our new platforms, there's been a translation from
concept to reality that's played out in just two short seasons. Importantly, we're integrating these technologies starting at
the research level, just like we've been doing in our core breeding and biotech platforms for years.
Second point, all of this innovation not only makes for an incredibly exciting time for technology, but it plays a role I
think of significant importance in addressing the key global macro trends that you discussed. The innovations we
deliver will create more yield to meet the increasing global demand for grains in a more sustainable, targeted, and
precise manner.
And finally, I think what's clear is our unique breeding and biotech engine has been transformative to the crop
protection industry. Today, the growing depth of our pipeline along with our new Digital Ag and biologicals platforms
gives us a unique view on how the crop protection landscape will continue to evolve going forward, and places us in a
position of strength in a dynamic industry.
So thanks for your time today. I'll turn it back over to Laura for the Q&A.
Laura J. Meyer
Thanks, Robb. With that, we'd now like to open the call for questions. As we typically do, I'll ask that you please hold
your questions to one per person so that we can take questions from as many people as possible. You're always
welcome to rejoin the queue for a follow-up.
Adam, we're ready to take questions from line.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial.
Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Don Carson>: Thank you. Hugh, a question on industry consolidation. In 2015 you made two offers for
Syngenta, but then you dropped it because you weren't in any direct discussions. Are you finding a different receptivity
on their part to discussions? Are you in direct discussions and able to look at any financial data?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Don, thanks for the question. Happy New Year to you. So you're right. We had two runs at
Syngenta last year. The belief that we had last April, we still have that there is a significant opportunity there for the
integrated platform, and frankly, as the industry goes through challenges, I think the opportunity becomes even greater.
Growers are looking for help. A lot's changed in the industry since last spring. The industry has got tougher. And I

would say, we expected some of that. The operating environment has become tougher as well. And I think because of
that, there's a greater need now than there was last spring to be able to quantify what that opportunity would look like
and quantify what that integrated platform would look like.
So engagement becomes more important now than it did before with Syngenta, and we haven't seen much progress in
that front. So when you look at some of the challenges in the industry, when you look at some of the challenges that
their portfolio faces, I think I'd say that engagement's been difficult.
<Q - Don Carson>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with
your question.
<Q - Vincent Stephen Andrews>: Thanks. On the order book, could you just – you mentioned there's a modest uptick
in prepays, but when I look at your deferred revenue line, it looks like it's up by more than a modest amount. So are you
being modest about the prepays? Or is there some disconnect between those two figures?
<A - Pierre C. Courduroux>: So, Vincent, this is Pierre. Good morning. So there's definitely an accounting
disconnect in between the order book and the amount of prepay and what you see in the deferred revenue. So long story
short, what we see today, which gives us confidence in our plan right now is an uptake in our order book, as Brett
mentioned, a modest uptake in our order book versus last year, and about $100 million more prepays than last year.
From an accounting perspective, you see a huge spike in deferred revenue, because we have got less glyphosate
receivable that we usually use to offset some of those deferred revenues. So visually, it looks like you've got a huge
increase in deferred revenue, but at the end of the day, I think what you have to keep in mind is we've got an increase in
prepay of about $100 million, which is very positive.
<Q - Vincent Stephen Andrews>: And can I just ask you on the foreign exchange on Argentina? You used the term
charge, one-time, et cetera. Does that imply that this reverses out next year?
<A - Pierre C. Courduroux>: The thing about Argentina for us is Argentina is a U.S. dollar functional entity for us,
which means we have to revalue our balance sheet basically on a monthly basis, and when you have a 35% to 40%
devaluation as we are currently seeing, you have that big one-time charge, which is basically the revaluation of your
balance sheet. On an ongoing basis, assuming flat currency, you would expect it to stay flat. And from a pure business
perspective, as you know, we've got some flexibility in Argentina in the way we price. So really what we're looking at
this point in time in Argentina is really the devaluation impact on our balance sheet because it's a U.S. dollar functional
entity.
<Q - Vincent Stephen Andrews>: Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your
question.
<Q - Christopher S. Parkinson>: Perfect, thank you. You've got a few extra pages on your R&D presentation this
year, but specifically, on pages 19 and 23, you mentioned collaborations with numerous chemical companies in both
weed control and seed treatments and fungicides. I believe that one was with Bayer. But can you quickly give a little
color on how much of the weed control agreements pertain to the Roundup Ready PLUS program, specifically,
glyphosate resistance? And also, how your R&D team evaluates these agreements versus hypothetically bringing it
in-house, including potential for M&A? Thanks.

<A - Robert T. Fraley>: Thanks. This is Robb. Appreciate the question. And as I made in my formal comments, one
of the things that I am really focused on as a R&D leader is to be externally focused, and in particular, we've been very
aggressive in partnerships in both the disease control in the – with Novozymes, with the insect and weed control
opportunities to bring in technologies from around the world that we think can supplement our pipeline.
And particularly in the case of the weed control opportunities, as we're building those future generation of stacked
products, we want to have multiple modes of action to control both the grass and broadleaf weeds that we believe will
be important for growers, both to control their difficult to control weeds as well as to control weeds that have become
resistant to Roundup. I'd say most of the targets that we've approached in the weed control area are designed to
supplement, support and ensure the long-term performance of the Roundup Ready trait system.
And incidentally, in addition to those external projects, you'll note that we had a release today that talked about some of
the investments that we've made in start-up companies through our venture capital fund, which we've made an
investment in over 20 start-ups that, again, cover chemistry, biologicals and data science tools. So that external focus is
really important.
<Q - Christopher S. Parkinson>: Perfect, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar from Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Yes, hi. Good morning. You talked about lower corn inventory. Was that low inventory in
anticipation of lower corn acres? Or was that your effort to reduce SKUs? And then, do you think the industry has
excess inventory that could potentially lead to some price competition that Brett talked about?
<A - Pierre C. Courduroux>: So, P.J., I'll talk about our own inventory, and I'll let Brett give you the outlook
regarding the market conditions. But as far as we are concerned, this is a decision we made last year, actually. As you
can remember, last year we entered the year and were surprised with commodity price and the reduction in acres. So we
had production plans in 2014 that were way higher than the market we saw in 2015.
So we did an adjustment exactly to avoid the risk you're mentioning that we end up with excess inventory. So this is the
production plan of 2015 that has been lower, which really helps now from a cash flow perspective, because as you
could see in the first quarter, we had good results from an inventory perspective, but this is the decision we made at the
time. So from a pure market perspective, I'll let Brett comment on that.
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Good morning, P.J. I think as Pierre said, we're in a really good position with our
inventory. And I don't feel uncomfortable with that at all, not only in the U.S., but globally at this point in time. That
more of the challenge that we face in the market that we see today is driven by the depressed commodity situation, and
it's encouraging. I would say, more discounting for sure this year than we've seen in the last couple of years.
That's why I pointed out this morning really the second quarter and third quarter is going to determine how much mix
lift we get out of this, because there's – some of our competitors are being quite aggressive from a pricing standpoint.
It's late in the year, as I always say, by the time we get to this point. It's not changing share a whole lot; it's just going to
change price mix is what it's going to do, because everybody's going to fight to defend their own position. But there's
clearly more of it this year, P.J., than we've seen in the last couple of years.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Thank you. And, Brett, quickly, can you give a clarification on – I think that in the comment you
made on outlook that there's $275 million of additional licensing opportunity. Is that new opportunity that you did not
have before in the plans? Thank you.
<A - Pierre C. Courduroux>: So, P.J., I'll take this one. These are the opportunities we mentioned entering into the
year, and the way we've been thinking about it is basically, I mean, leveraging our pipeline, leveraging our portfolio,
leveraging our Climate platform, so obviously, those are confidential in nature, and we're not going to give much more
detail than that. But this is really what we were talking about entering into the year. I mean, there is no change from

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrne from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your
question.
<Q - Steve Byrne>: Yes, thank you. Presumably, you have a pretty good idea how many acres of Intacta soybeans are
in the ground right now. My question would be, how much of that revenue did you recognize in the November quarter
versus the fiscal second quarter? What fraction of that would be prepaid cash versus POD? And what was your net
realized royalty price per acre?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: I think one way to look at that, Steve, is I think we have to remind ourselves that the Brazil
approach to the market is a little bit different than what we're looking at in the U.S., which most people are more
familiar with. In Brazil, the farmer has choices. They can buy their seed and pay right up front. They can buy their seed
and agree to pay at POD. Or legally, they can save seed and pay with POD.
As we said, the big shift has occurred, and the vast majority of farmers are buying new seed every year, but they get
that choice. It also goes to market through seed multipliers, which are a step removed from us. So we do not have the
kind of insight in the marketplace that we enjoy the U.S. where we have a large branded business ourselves and a
handful of other large branded players that we can get information from as a licensee. So we just don't have that down
there.
What I can tell you today is I feel really confident in our 30 million acres of Intacta in Brazil. And I'm really excited
about the demand that we see from the farmers. It's too early for us to be able to call how much of that was prepaid and
how much of that was bought seed and whether or not it's going to be above 30 million acres, but I feel really good
about the 30 million acres that we laid out today.
<Q - Steve Byrne>: And any comment on the net realization per acre?
<A - Pierre C. Courduroux>: As we mentioned in terms of the price per acre, price per acre is very consistent with
basically what we outlined entering into the year, I mean this is a royalty we collect, so the key balance is going to be in
between POD and the prepaid and as of today, we are pretty much in line with our expectation. As we announced
today, I mean, we've had a really good first quarter in terms of Intacta, and actually we have seen some nice growth
obviously excluding the impact of currency, and as Brett was saying now, we are entering in the second quarter where
we will know the final numbers. But as of now, I mean, it really looks good about Intacta, both on a volume and acres
basis, but also from a pricing perspective.
<Q - Steve Byrne>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your
question.
<Q - Brian Maguire>: Hey, good morning. It's actually Brian Maguire on for Bob. I think I heard you mention that
you expect glyphosate pricing to improve throughout the year, throughout 2016. Just wondering what indicators or
metrics you're looking at to try and give you confidence that pricing might start to inflect upwards in 2016?

<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Thank you. Good morning. This is Brett. As you look at Roundup, and you're right, we did
say that we would expect it through the latter half of the year that we would see some improvement in price. We
haven't seen that start to occur yet. It's been more flattish, which really leads to the wider range that we've given around
our Ag Productivity business this year.
If you assume prices kind of float around where they are today, then we were at the low-end of that range, and if they
do get some lift throughout the rest of the year, we would see it float to the higher end of that range. But that's what
drives the breadth of that range.
I think a couple of things to keep in mind is, China price is clearly an impact on what the price is, but also what kind of
margin opportunity the generics participate in. So we watch the generic price in the marketplace, that's what our
farmers are looking at. We don't price based on what's going on in China. We price based on the generics in the market.
And we have not seen them start to lift those prices. But in most of the world, we feel like we're in pretty good place
right now with some hope that the price will continue or will lift towards the latter half of the year.
<Q - Brian Maguire>: Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sandy Klugman from Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead
with your question.
<Q - Sandy H. Klugman>: Thank you. Good morning. I was hoping you could provide an update on the anticipated
timeline for regulatory approvals for Xtend. And then if you don't receive approvals in time for the spring planting
season, should we expect the 2017 launch to be even larger given that I assume you'll have more varieties to offer next
year than you would this year?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Sandy, thanks for your question. I'll say a few words and maybe ask Brett to say some. So
first-off, and Robb mentioned this in his presentation as well, strong demand, so an enormous amount of
encouragement from growers and from the field. They see Xtend as a tool that they really, really need, and frankly,
they're tired of waiting. So this has gone on for a long time.
We're in the final stages. We've provided, and Robb can probably underscore this, we've provided all the data to the
regulatory authorities, and frankly, we were encouraged by the exchange between President Obama and Premier Xi
during his visit. So the public statement that came from that was encouraging. So we're now waiting on the finalization
of that, and I think it's imminent and also the EPA. So, Brett, anything that you'd add to that from a field point of view?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: I would just add that, to Hugh's point, we feel like we're on track with those approvals. I'd
just remind you that there are two different approvals. One approval for China is for the seed, and the other approval
from the EPA is for applications of dicamba over the top of the crop. So both of those set us in different situations, and
we'll watch both. And for the full system to be executed, we need both. But if we get a China approval, for example,
that puts us in position to sell the seed, and you might think about what we looked at last year with cotton. We found
ourselves in that same situation with cotton last year. I'm not suggesting that's where we'll be, I'm just saying that there
are different options for us to pursue, and we're living this real time right now.
<Q - Sandy H. Klugman>: Okay, great. Thanks. And just to follow up on the cotton front, if you don't get the
over-the-top registration for dicamba in the domestic market, I assume growers will receive a rebate similar to what
they received last year.
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: That's the way we would look at it. And the whole approach behind that is getting the
farmers comfortable with the varieties and buying new varieties. And I missed that in your earlier question. Yes, if we
have the opportunity to get some out there, whether they use the whole system or not, it will make for a bigger launch
next year than this year. So it definitely benefits us and the farmer to get that experience with the new varieties.
<Q - Sandy H. Klugman>: Thank you. That's very helpful.

<A - Hugh M. Grant>: That's been our general approach. But as I said at the start, you've got a lot of growers out
there frustrated and getting tired of waiting. So it would be nice to see weeds controlled with this system this year.
<Q - Sandy H. Klugman>: Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan Chase & Co. Please go ahead
with the question.
<Q - Jeffrey J. Zekauskas>: Thanks very much, good morning.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Good morning.
<Q - Jeffrey J. Zekauskas>: Hi. Dow licenses SmartStax on relatively advantageous terms. If they do combine with
DuPont, does that larger entity that's formed, are they allowed to license SmartStax on the same terms, or would a new
agreement have to be put in place? How does that technology licensing work?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Jeff, thanks for the question. So I guess Robb said on the 20th anniversary of Roundup Ready,
I think for 20 years we've licensed broadly with an open architecture system and licensed the industry. That will
continue, but for 20 years we haven't discussed the content of these licenses. So we license company by company, and
the content of those licenses is confidential. What I would say broadly is, the design of those licenses, they commute,
so they're not triggered by change of control, and that allows consistency regardless of what companies do and how the
genealogy plays out, and I expect that that will continue.
The name of the game of this for us going forward is coincidental to Robb's presentation today. Companies win when
they deliver innovation. Companies win when they put that innovation in the hands of growers. And that's the heart of
our licensing model. And I anticipate that that will continue going forward. But the content, the nature of those licenses
is really the business of the licensees.
<A - Robert T. Fraley>: I think another key point, Jeff, is that, I've truly tried to emphasize that is, for us it's
continuing to drive the new innovation. So we're just within a few years of launching SmartStax PRO with the new
rootworm mode of action, and then SmartStax stacked with DroughtGard. And as I mentioned in my formal remarks,
we are literally building today the 14 gene stack product in corn that we'll launch in 2025. And as you mentioned, both
Dow and Pioneer and DuPont have been licensees of the technology, and we would expect that these will be attractive
technologies for the future.
<Q - Jeffrey J. Zekauskas>: Okay, thank you very much.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your
question.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Thank you, good morning. Are you looking at the new Dow-DuPont entity, could you assess
the potential of any long-term competitive threat to Monsanto as well as maybe the potential short-term opportunity as
they combine the businesses, and there is some normal natural disruption?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: I can't really speculate. They're big. I think this makes them the biggest in the world. But as
Robb said, they're also a customer. And so we will continue our license and efforts for them. There's clearly going to be
a disruption while you bring two entities of this size together. But I think that's more for them to comment on than us.
We've talked for the last – since last spring, we've talked about continued focus on our core. As the industry as a sector

goes through a tough time, you need to double down on that. We're managing our costs, but at the same time we're not
shorting on innovation. And I think we're more successful in that innovation drive than anybody else in the space.
So I like the cards that we hold, but I think there's going to continue to be consolidation in the space when you see
what's happening with commodity prices today. I think we will continue to have a role in being a consolidator, and I
also think that we will drive to continue to be the partner of choice. And as long as we have that innovation pipeline,
then we'll be in a very, very good position on both of those vectors, whether it's consolidation or maintaining our
position as the technology partner of choice.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Thank you, and one quick thing for Robb. Robb on wheat, I noticed the projects did not
advance this past year. Can you discuss what's happening with wheat programs and timeline as well?
<A - Robert T. Fraley>: Thanks for the question. So we continue to work in developing wheat, and I'd say we're
taking a pretty broad approach. We're applying a lot of the same marker-based and genome sequencing technologies in
wheat that we've applied in corn. We're doing the microbial testing, looking at seed treatments, both biological and
chemistry in wheat, and we're starting to look at the climate models for both nitrogen and other weather-related apps
for wheat in addition to the core effort that we've had in biotech, primarily focused historically on weed and insect
control. So wheat is an important crop. We continue to look at R&D opportunities and to develop them.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts from UBS. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - John Roberts>: Thank you. I think price lift has never been above 10% globally when foreign exchange is
relatively stable. I'm sure it varies by region, but you said Brazil is now running about 10% in the first quarter. Do you
think you can go above 10% in local currency in some of the devalued markets?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: This is Brett, good morning. I think what you're looking at in Brazil is clearly an impact on
currency. So we attempt where we can to use pricing to offset some of the currency devaluation that we face, and
Brazil is a good example of that where we pushed it to 10%. And we will continue to look at that in Brazil as we go
into the second season there as well as into next year. So there are clearly opportunities. It's hard to speculate whether
or not it could ever be above 10% because you've got to take into account what's the current situation, what's the market
competition look like, and then you're speculating on what currency is going to do. But we always look for every
opportunity we can to leverage our price to offset the currency.
<Q - John Roberts>: Have you ever gone above 10% in any other markets?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yes, there have been times when we have been above 10%, we've been close to
mid-double digits in some markets where we saw a significant acceleration in the marketplace. And again, it varies.
When you're in a market that's high demand for corn and you have high commodity prices, you have more latitude than
when you're in a situation today where you depressed commodity prices. That plays a huge role. But yes, we've been
higher than 10% before.
<Q - John Roberts>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Thank you.

<Q - Mark W. Connelly>: Thank you. I'm just wondering if you can help us with the rate of spend in Climate? And
where that's going and on the same topic, where are we in the Nitrogen Advisor roll-out? We met several farmers at
your own Investor Day who didn't have access to it yet, but seemed to want it.
<A - Pierre C. Courduroux>: So as far as the rate of spend is concerned, I mean, we are still, as part of our planning
in terms of expense, we are still investing in Climate, but as part also of our efforts and the way we've been managing
spend, and the way we anticipate to manage spend in this challenging Ag environment, we were also very cautious on
the way we do that. So this is still an investment that's growing, but proportionally to the prior year, we're not growing
as much, definitely, and we will be very diligent in not starving the efforts but also being very fiscally responsible in
how we are managing these investments. From a market perspective, Brett, maybe you want to comment on...
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: We started in, we've referred to it as the I states; Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, southern
Minnesota, with our models. And this year we've expanded that fairly dramatically to include big parts of the Dakotas,
Nebraska, Missouri, down to Kentucky, and we intend that we'll expanded it again next year.
So we today have a pretty good majority of the corn growing area in the U.S. is covered by the Nitrogen Advisor, but
we'll continue to spread it out, and as Robb noted, we're looking at other crops and how we expand it to other crops as
well. Nitrogen behaves the same way regardless of what crop is growing above it. We just need to get the models put in
place to make those recommendations for the other crops.
<Q - Mark W. Connelly>: Is that a long lead time to get those other crops in place?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: No, you're looking at a year or two to get the models worked out.
<Q - Mark W. Connelly>: Perfect, thank you.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Pretty fast, Mark. And with the elevated, the terrible elevation in rainfall and precipitation and
the mild winter – there's a lot of interest in the product.
<Q - Mark W. Connelly>: Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo Advisors. Please go ahead with
your question.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Good morning. I was going to start off with Happy New Year, but I think happy 20th
anniversary on Roundup is even more impressive.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Thank you.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Just a quick question on the productivity program. Obviously, three months ago you
announced 12% reduction in the workforce and you're upping that target today. I'm just curious what may have
changed since then, and as you got into the program you start to see more or in what areas might it be, if you could add
a little more color there that'd be helpful.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Frank, thanks for the question. So this has been a work in progress, so as we build the plans
and get more granular in the detail, we've gained in constant, so today is the final tranche of this. Brett mentioned a few
of the areas that we've been working on. Brett, maybe a word on the commercial hub, so that's probably one of the
biggest changes for us and going to these four regional hubs.
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: We started on the path of targeting the $300 million to $500 million and we had the final
tranche in October and this was the final piece of that. And what we were building out is the commercial hubs and we
needed to put those in place to be able to define the opportunity and it really gives us the opportunity with these four
hubs to think about how we create centers of excellence for various processes that we have within Monsanto that will
drive through those commercial hubs, not unlike what we've been working on with our supply chain and in R&D with

the R&D hub in Chesterfield that we're building out, out there. So it's really a focus, leveraging data analytics and
process improvements to drive our innovations faster, and to drive our customer service to a higher level.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: And, Robb, maybe I'll work on the R&D side.
<A - Robert T. Fraley>: So Brett mentioned, we've created a Center of Excellence now with our Chesterfield site, and
if you've been on the tour recently, and I know you have, you know how we've expanded that, but that's given us also
the ability to close some of the smaller sites, move people and focus our efforts.
We've done other focusing efforts, you recall, in November, we announced that we would be exiting sugarcane, we'd be
streamlining our Yield-and-Stress program and changing the R&D approach. And then finally, you know, one of the
big efforts has been building on Brett's comments is, using the Digital Ag tools to really change how we do our
breeding and our field testing using a lot more data inputs to make those decisions. And those have had, I think very
big, very important and very significant impacts on improving how we do the research.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Terrific, that's helpful. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Duffy Fischer>: Good morning, fellas, two quick questions. The first is just should we think about the
Dow-DuPont deal altering what our out-year Xtend in soybeans in the U.S. numbers should be? And then just a second
one is on the slide that you showed the five geographies where you plan to hold or increase market share and corn,
could you rank those which ones you have the most confidence in, and maybe which ones you're going to have to fight
the hardest to hit those numbers?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Duffy, good morning. Thanks for the questions. So on Xtend, I don't think it changes the
out-years at all. So we don't see any shift in the projection. And then in the five areas, if you were ranking them, Brett?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: I think you'll find yourself in a different situation in every one of those countries. We have
a strong position the U.S., but we also have really strong competitors in the U.S. And you don't see big changes in
market share very often in those size of markets, but we continue to win there and little by little, grow.
When you look at places like Eastern Europe, where you have improving genetics replacing really old genetics from
before, not as strong a competition, we can get pretty healthy gains there, and we have over the past five years, and
that's leapfrogged us into the number one position over there.
And then of course, in Argentina, as an example, we have a really, really strong position in Argentina. And we never
give up on our opportunity to grow, but I'm thrilled every year that we hold that position down there because it's a
really strong position. And then in Brazil, we find ourselves in a unique situation right now where our competitor is
challenged with a trade offering in the marketplace, and quite frankly, we're getting an opportunity to grow there, so
we're taking advantage of that and growing our footprint, and that's part of the confidence we have in the summer
season that we had improvement this year. So each market is going to be a little bit different, but we feel good about
our position.
<Q - Duffy Fischer>: Perfect. Thanks, guys.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Thank you.

<A - Laura J. Meyer>: Adam?
<Q - Joel Jackson>: Oh, sorry.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: We'll probably make this the last question.
<A - Laura J. Meyer>: Adam, we'll close after this question from Joel, please.
<Q - Joel Jackson>: Thanks, Laura. Just about dicamba again, I don't think dicamba still has board approval. Maybe
you can give an update on your thinking on that? And just some thoughts also on why the Chinese producers down the
road won't compete as hard on dicamba as they are on glyphosate. Thanks.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: I think we covered some of the approval – you're right; we're waiting on two approvals. We're
waiting on Chinese import approval and the final approval from EPA for the over-the-top spray. The second piece of
your question, just tell me again?
<Q - Joel Jackson>: Just why Chinese producers down the road won't really ramp up on dicamba and compete just as
hard as they have in glyphosate over the past year.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: We think that they will. I think with the investments that we're making, we'll be about a
quarter to a third to the – we think this is going to be a very, very substantial product. We think that our manufacturing
will maybe cover a quarter to a third, but we anticipate that we'll see Chinese and Indian producers stepping up, and we
expect that we'll be running some partnerships on this product as well. And frankly, we're going to need that. So we
would welcome that competition because the volume off-take, I think, is going to be really, really significant.
<Q - Joel Jackson>: Okay. Thanks, guys.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Thanks very much.
Hugh M. Grant
So I think, Laura, maybe I'll just quickly wrap. So I wanted to begin by thanking you for your patience. This is always a
slightly longer call for us, but I think it's, like all good things, it's worth waiting on. So it was worth taking the time
with Robb's pipeline review.
I also want to thank you for your support. So I think today we've covered in a number of ways the breadth, the depth
and the productivity of our pipeline, and probably that gives us confidence in both our long-term growth targets as well
as the strong role that we believe we play in addressing the evolving landscape across agriculture, but in a sector that's
changing at the moment.
So with the unique vantage point that we have from our pipeline and the technology that we have in hand to create the
9 to 14 gene stacks that we believe will define the future agriculture that Robb outlined today, we see ourselves in a
position of strength in a dynamic industry. So I guess the bottom line for us is, we continue to view this as a time of
opportunity where a balance of innovation, which is kind of the heart of who we are, and discipline can grow our
long-term competitive position.
So thanks very much for joining us on the call this morning, and the very best to you all in the New Year. Thanks very
much.
