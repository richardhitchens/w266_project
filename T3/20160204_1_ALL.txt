MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Allstate Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this
time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions
will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded.
I would now like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. Pat Macellaro, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Please go ahead.
Patrick Macellaro
Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning, and welcome, everyone, to Allstate's fourth quarter 2015 earnings conference
call. After prepared remarks by Tom Wilson, Steve Shebik and myself, we'll have a question-and-answer session.
Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement and posted the
results presentation we'll use this morning in conjunction with our prepared remarks. All these documents are available
on our website at allstateinvestors.com. We plan to file our 2015 Form 10-K later this month.
As noted on the first slide, our discussion today will contain forward-looking statements regarding Allstate's operations.
Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2014, the slides and our
most recent news release for information on potential risks. Also, this discussion will contain some non-GAAP
measures for which there are reconciliations in our news release and in our investor supplement.
We're recording the call today and a replay will be available following its conclusion. I'll be available to answer any
follow-up questions you may have after the call.
And now I'll turn it over to Tom Wilson.

Thomas Joseph Wilson
Well, good morning. Thank you for investing time to keep up on our progress at Allstate. I'll cover an overview of the
results, and then Pat and Steve will take you through the details.
Our comments today are more detailed on four topics to make sure we provide you with good transparency. I will
spend some time discussing our rationale for 2016's underlying combined ratio outlook. Pat will provide more detail on
the auto profitability plans. Steve will discuss the asset-liability investment decisions, including Allstate's financial
operating income and the impact that has on operating income. And then Steve's also going to provide some
perspective on the overall investment portfolio. That will include both the investments we're in, including limited
partnerships and energy.
Also in the room today to answer any questions on any and all topics are Matt Winter, our President; Don Civgin, who
leads our Emerging Businesses; Judy Greffin, our Chief Investment Officer; and Sam Pilch, our Corporate Controller.
So let's begin on slide two. We finished 2015 with a strong fourth quarter. That was driven by our repositioned
homeowners business, continued progress in executing our auto insurance profit improvement plan, and reducing
expenses. The underlying property-liability combined ratio for the fourth quarter was 87.4, which brought that full year
result to 88.7, which was within the original annual outlook range we gave last year at this time. The recorded
combined ratio in the fourth quarter was 92.0, which generated $611 million of underwriting income.
The comprehensive program we implemented shortly after a significant increase in auto accident frequency and claims
severities includes seeking higher approval for auto insurance prices, making changes to our underwriting standards to
slow new business growth and addressing underperforming segments, it does both of those, and reducing expenses.
This proactive approach, however, did not offset the impact of the external trends and the underwriting profits from our
auto insurance declined significantly in 2015.
Continued strong results from homeowners insurance and moderate catastrophe losses resulted in operating income of
$1.60 per diluted common share for the quarter and $5.19 for the full year. The return on equity on an operating income
basis was 11.6% in 2015, down 1% from the prior year. Common shareholders received $691 million in cash during the
fourth quarter and $3.3 billion for the full year through a combination of common share dividends and share
repurchases.
If we move to the chart on the bottom of the slide, revenues were up 1.2% for 2015 and property-liability premiums
grew by 4.8%. Net investment income declined 8.8% compared to the prior year, and that reflects a smaller balance
sheet which is due to the sale of Lincoln Benefit in April of 2014 and the continued downsizing of our annuity
business; lower interest income, which resulted from shortening the duration of our fixed income portfolio; and a slight
decline in income from performance-based investments. Net income for the year was $2.055 billion, which was $5.05
per diluted common share.
If we go to slide three, it shows our full year operating results for our four property-liability customer segments. So
total policy in force growth across all brands was 1.3% in 2015, as you can see at the top, and the recorded combined
ratio was 94.9.
The Allstate brand, which is in the lower left, is our largest segment and comprises 90% of premiums written, and it
serves customers who prefer a branded product and value local advice and assistance. Allstate brand total policies in
force in 2015 were 1.7% higher than 2014.
Auto insurance, which is on the left-hand side of that box, new business and retention were both impacted by profit
improvement actions, but policies still increased by 2.1% for the year. Homeowner policies grew over the prior year at
a rate of 1.1% and other personal lines grew by 2.7%, compared to 2014. The underlying combined ratio was a strong
87.4 for this segment at year-end 2015, as you can see in the red box at the bottom.
Esurance, in the lower right, serves customers that prefer a branded product but are comfortable handling their own
insurance needs. Growth was slowed throughout 2015 in this segment, as our focus shifted to profit improvement.

Policies in force were 1.4% higher at the end of 2015 than the prior year and net written premium grew by 6.6%. The
underlying loss ratio in Esurance improved by 1.2 points in 2015, ending the year at 75.4. As a result, the underlying
combined ratio declined to 108.4, which includes about 4 points due to a number of expansion initiatives.
Encompass, in the upper left, competes for customers that want local advice but are less concerned about their choice
of insurance company. This business decreased in size in 2015. Its policies in force declined by 8.2% from a year ago,
due to lower new business and retention, which is largely a result of price increases and underwriting changes. The net
written premium decline of 2.8% for 2015, that reflects higher average premiums from increasing rates to improve
returns. The underlying combined ratio was 92.6 for 2015, which was 1.1 points better than the prior year.
Answer Financial, in the upper right, that serves brand-neutral, self-service customers, and it's essentially an aggregator
that does not underwrite insurance risk. Total non-proprietary written premiums of $581 million in 2015 were 10%
higher than the prior year.
So let's go to slide four. Looking forward to 2016, we expect our annual underlying combined ratio to be in the range of
88 to 90. That range is comprised of a number of key assumptions. First, we assume there will be continued
improvement in auto insurance profitability across all three brands, given the profit improvement actions we undertook
in 2015, and that will continue in 2016. We do expect modest increases in both auto accident frequency and claims
severity, which reflects the broad-based trends we experienced in 2015. Third, we assume the homeowners underlying
combined ratio will increase slightly from last year's level. And as our profit improvements are realized, as we start to
realize the benefit of a lower combined ratio, we will continue to invest to generate long-term value, which will likely
increase our expense ratio. As you know, of course, predicting frequency and loss trends in a rapidly changing external
environment is difficult. As a result, we put a range on our outlook every year.
Now what you also know is that we react quickly to trends, whether they are positive or negative, to adapt our business
priorities, so we're building long-term shareholder value. So our operating priorities for 2016 are designed to build
long-term value and, as you can see, they're generally the same as 2015. Serving our customers and generating returns
on shareholder capital are our two top priorities and they're central to our plan. When we do these well, we grow
insurance policies in force.
We intentionally slowed auto insurance growth in 2015 to improve auto margins, since new business typically has a
higher loss ratio than more tenured business. New auto insurance volumes in the Allstate brand declined by 24% in the
fourth quarter as a result of tighter underwriting, lower advertising and increased prices. While these actions are
necessary, they're also flexible. So our appetite for new business will increase as the auto profit improvement efforts
translate into a lower combined ratio.
The largest factor in overall growth, however, is the rate at which we retain customers. The auto retention rate declined
in the fourth quarter, in part reflecting higher auto insurance prices. We're implementing actions to reduce the impact
that'll have on growth, but what competitors do in their pricing is also a major driver and that's not controllable. So our
2016 growth plans and prospects vary by customer segment. Growth in the Allstate brand auto insurance will depend
on the timing of the successful implementation of auto profitability actions and competitors' pricing actions. The sooner
we see a lower combined ratio, the sooner we will increase new business.
We do have growth plans in place for homeowners and other personal lines policies, given the attractive returns on
those products. We expect Esurance and Allstate Benefits to continue to grow in 2016. Encompass had a decline in
policies in force in 2015 and is not yet in a position to grow. So we're still committed to growing policies in force
across the company, but it will be more difficult in 2016 than it has been in the past.
Pat will now go through the property liability results in more detail.
Patrick Macellaro
Thanks, Tom. I'll start with a review of our property-liability results on slide five. Beginning with the chart on the top
of this page, property-liability net written premium of $30.9 billion in 2015 grew $1.3 billion, or 4.2%, over 2014. The

recorded combined ratio for the year of 94.9 increased 1 point versus 2014, driven by an increase in auto losses which
was partially offset by lower expenses, strong homeowner underlying margins and catastrophe losses of $1.7 billion,
which were 13.7% lower than 2014.
As Tom mentioned earlier, the year-end 2015 underlying combined ratio of 88.7, while 1.5 points higher than 2014,
finished within our original annual guidance range given the strong results in the fourth quarter.
Net investment income for the property-liability segment decreased 4.9% from the prior year, due primarily to lower
performance-based investment income. Property-liability operating income in 2015 was $1.9 billion, which was 8.2%
lower than 2014.
Chart on the lower left-hand side of this page shows property-liability net written premium and policy in force growth
rates. Red line, representing policy in force growth versus the prior year, shows a slowing growth rate of 1.3%, given
actions in place across all three underwriting brands to improve auto margins.
Even with these headwinds, we grew policy counts by 449,000 to 34.6 million in 2015 compared to 2014. The Allstate
brand accounted for almost all policy growth in 2015, as Esurance policy growth slowed and Encompass policies were
lower than 2014.
These policy growth results exclude 5.6 million Allstate Financial policies, which grew by 6.1% in 2015, driven by
11.1% policy growth in Allstate Benefits. Average premium increases to reflect higher costs resulted in the net written
premium trends you see shown by the blue line.
Bottom right-hand side of this page shows property-liability recorded and underlying combined ratio results. The
recorded and underlying combined ratios both finished the year strong compared to results earlier in the year, given our
actions to improve auto returns. The underlying property-liability combined ratio in the fourth quarter of 2015 was
87.4, and it was 2.1 points lower than the fourth quarter of 2014.
Slide six highlights the margin trends for Allstate brand auto and Allstate brand homeowners. Chart on the top left of
this page provides a view of quarterly recorded and underlying margin performance for Allstate brand auto. As Tom
mentioned earlier, our fourth quarter results continued to be impacted by elevated frequency and severity, as they have
been since the fourth quarter of 2014. Our efforts to respond to higher cost trends through price, underwriting and
expense management resulted in an underlying combined ratio of 97.6 in the fourth quarter of 2015, which was 0.6
points improvement from the fourth quarter a year ago. On a sequential basis, the underlying combined ratio improved
by 0.5 point compared to the third quarter of 2015.
Chart on the top right highlights the trends driving the change in the Allstate brand auto underlying combined ratio.
Annualized average earned premium per policy, shown by the blue line, continued to show upward momentum, as rate
increases implemented throughout 2015 resulted in a 3.9% increase in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the
quarter a year ago. Average underlying losses and expenses per policy in the fourth quarter of 2015 increased 3.2%,
compared with the fourth quarter of 2014, given the influence of higher frequency of severity, but lower expenses per
policy. The gap between these two points remains positive, but it's smaller than where it's been historically.
Similar information is shown for Allstate brand homeowners on the bottom of this page. On the bottom left, you can
see that the favorable impact from low catastrophes that we experienced for most of 2015 continued in the fourth
quarter, resulting in the 71 Allstate brand homeowners recorded combined ratio. Lower frequency of fire claims in the
fourth quarter benefited the underlying homeowners combined ratio which, at 56, was 5 points below the results in the
fourth quarter of 2014.
Components of the fourth quarter homeowners underlying combined ratio are in the chart on the bottom right. Average
earned premium per policy increased to $1,085, or 1.9%, over the prior-year quarter. Underlying losses per policy
decreased 6.6% in the quarter, compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, resulting in continued favorable underlying gap
between the two trends.
Slide seven provides some context on combined ratio and top line trends for both Esurance and Encompass. Chart on
the top of this page includes fourth quarter and annual combined ratio results for both companies.

Esurance's recorded combined ratio of 107 in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 8.5 points lower than the same period a
year ago, given decreased investment in marketing along with a 5-point improvement in the loss ratio, which is
reflective of ongoing actions taken in the business to improve auto returns. Esurance's combined ratio of 110.3 in 2015
improved 7.4 points compared to 2014.
Encompass' recorded combined ratio of 95.5 in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 2.4 points worse than the prior-year
quarter, and was adversely impacted by 2.9 points of higher catastrophe losses compared to the prior-year quarter.
Encompass' combined ratio of 102 in 2015 was 4.1 points better than the full year result in 2014.
Two charts on the bottom of this page show how growth is being impacted by profit improvement actions in both of the
brands. In Esurance, policy in force growth slowed to 1.4% over the prior year and continued to decline sequentially,
while net written premium grew by 5.3% in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to the same quarter a year ago.
In Encompass, net written premium declined by 5.5% in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to the fourth quarter of
2014, as the 8.2% decline in policies in force more than offset higher average premiums from increased rates and
underwriting actions. As with the Allstate brand, we continue to evaluate our results and will adjust profit improvement
actions to ensure returns in both of these brands are appropriate.
Slide eight provides an update on our ongoing plan to improve auto returns. As we discussed throughout 2015, our auto
profit improvement plan is comprised of four parts, which are designed to work together to address the higher loss
trends we're experiencing. First, we have sought approval for higher auto rate across the country. Second, we've
implemented underwriting changes to slow new business and address specific underperforming segments business.
Along with underwriting changes, we've also increased our ongoing correct classification programs. Third, we focused
on claims operational excellence and precision. And fourth, we've reduced expenses across the organization to quickly
impact the combined ratio while the other components took hold. These actions, in total, helped us to finish 2015
within our underlying combined ratio guidance range.
Details for the fourth quarter of 2015 are shown on the bottom of the slide. Approved auto rate increases for all three
underwriting brands in the fourth quarter of 2015 are worth $401 million in net written premium, while the total
amount of approved rate increases for 2015 in total were worth $1.1 billion in net written premium, the highest amount
of approved auto rate increases in over 10 years.
We also continued to intentionally slow new business and make underwriting changes on isolated underperforming
segments of business in geographies across the country to improve auto returns. These underwriting actions, in
conjunction with our correct classification programs and price increases, have slowed new business and impacted
retention. As Tom mentioned earlier, all these actions are flexible and they're all driven by local market conditions.
We'll continue to adjust them selectively for market to market as auto returns improve.
Maintaining claims operational excellence and precision also continue to be priorities given cost trends that we and
others in the industry are experiencing. Property-liability expense ratio decreased by 2.8 points in the fourth quarter of
2015, compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. That's 1.2 points lower than 2014 at year end, reflecting expense actions
taken across the company. You can see the impact by underwriting brand in the chart on the lower left. These actions
included reductions in advertising in the Allstate and Esurance brands, as well as professional services costs and lower
compensation incentives across the company.
The bottom right-hand chart shows the net written premium amounts generated by the rates we've received approval for
over the past three years across all three underwriting brands. The Allstate brand represents the largest component of
these rate increases, accounting for $942 million of the $1.1 billion for the full year of 2015, and $342 million of the
$401 million for the fourth quarter of 2015.
Rate and underwriting changes will drive customers to shop their insurance with other carriers, non-renew their policies
or change their level of coverage, which will result in lower levels of premium, in aggregate, than what's shown on this
chart. Allstate agency owners and their staff proactively consult with their customers during the insurance review
process to arrive at the best coverage and deductible options for their specific situations and needs. We feel that having

a trusted advisor to help guide customers' understanding of protection needs during a period of rising auto prices across
the industry is a key competitive advantage for us.
This analysis only includes rates approved through December 31. We continue to evaluate and run our business on a
local, market-by-market basis, and continue to adjust our actions going forward whether it be through price,
underwriting, claims excellence or expense management to ensure appropriate auto returns.
And now I'll turn it over to Steve who will cover Allstate Financial, investments and capital management.
Steven E. Shebik
Thanks, Pat. Slide nine provides an overview of Allstate Financial's results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015, as
highlighted on the top of the slide. Overall we've made good progress to narrow Allstate Financial's focus and position
the business to support long-term value creation. In 2015, we continued our efforts to fully integrate the life and
retirement business into the Allstate brand customer value proposition and reposition the investment portfolio
supporting our immediate annuities.
Premiums and contract charges in 2015 increased 4.2%, when excluding the impact of the 2014 results from Lincoln
Benefit Life Company, driven by 5.7% growth in Allstate Benefits accident and health insurance business as well as a
7.3% increase in traditional life insurance premiums.
Operating income for 2015 of $509 million was 16.1% lower than 2014, driven primarily by higher life insurance
claims, the disposition of LBL and lower investment income. In the fourth quarter, operating income of $98 million
was $30 million below the prior-year quarter, driven by a lower fixed income yield and a decrease in
performance-based long-term investment income.
The bottom half of the slide depicts the liabilities and investments of our immediate annuity business. The
approximately $12 billion of liabilities pay out over the next 40-plus years. Our investment strategy is to match
near-term cash flows with fixed income and commercial mortgages. However, for longer-term liabilities, we believe
equity investments provide the best risk-adjusted returns.
As such, in the third quarter, we sold approximately $2 billion of long-duration fixed income securities to make the
portfolio less sensitive to rising interest rates. Sale proceeds were invested in shorter duration, fixed income and public
equity securities, which will lower net investment income in the near term. Over time, we will shift the majority of the
proceeds to performance-based investments that we expect to deliver attractive, long-term economic returns, although
income will be volatile from quarter to quarter.
Moving on to slide 10 and investments, I'll start with our portfolio composition at the top of the slide. We have a
diverse $77.8 billion portfolio. Fixed income represents 74% of the portfolio value, with $8.6 billion or 15% in below
investment grade. As we have discussed previously, we are increasing and shifting the risk posture of our portfolio to
deliver more attractive long-term returns. We created capacity for this incremental risk by strengthening our capital
position through issuing preferred securities, reducing debt, exposure reduction to catastrophe-prone regions and
shrinking our annuity business over the past two years to three years.
We are utilizing a portion of that capacity in our investment portfolio to increase idiosyncratic risk through
performance-based investing and selectively increasing our high-yield holdings. Our high-yield portfolio is
conservatively positioned relative to the broader market, weighted meaningfully towards BB and, to a lesser extent,
single B issuers. We have also managed with underweights of certain sectors, including metals and mining and energy.
Our portfolio breakdown by investment approach is at the bottom left. Within the context of these four approaches, we
target asset mix that reflects our risk tolerance and liability profile. Our market-based core, by far the largest part of the
portfolio, delivers predictable earnings aligned to our business needs. We seek to outperform the public markets and
take advantage of volatility through our market-based active strategy, with a growing allocation to performance-based
investments, both what we term long-term and opportunistic, including private equity and real estate partnerships and

direct investments.
The majority of our energy holdings shown in the middle table are investment grade corporate bonds. We are
conservatively positioned versus the broader energy market, preferring midstream and higher quality exploration and
production players, which we believe are better equipped to withstand the dislocation in energy prices.
With that said, this is a dynamic environment, and the implications of the fall in energy prices are being felt across the
market. During the fourth quarter, $47 million of the trading losses of $82 million of the recognized impairments
related to energy holdings. Losses were split between public and private securities.
Details of limited partnership holdings and our performance-based long-term strategy are shown in the table on the
right. Approximately three-quarters of these investments are in private equity, including timber and agriculture, and
one-quarter in real estate. Likewise, approximately three-quarters are accounted for under the equity method of
accounting, or what is termed EMA.
Our performance-based long-term strategy had strong results despite a lower fourth quarter, with 2015 being our
second-highest income year. We've received significant cash distributions from realizations in this portfolio, which
have reduced the amount of undistributed income related to our EMA investments.
Moving on to slide 11, net investment income was $710 million in total for the quarter and $3.2 billion for the full year
of 2015. Investment income and yield by business segment is provided at the top of the slide. In addition to a
multi-year shift in the long-term mix, we continue to proactively manage the portfolio in light of current economic and
market conditions. This includes reducing the duration of our fixed income holdings in both the property-liability and
Allstate Financial portfolios, with the belief that the markets were not providing sufficient compensation for taking
interest rate risk in the low yield environment.
To the left is property-liability. We reduced our interest rate risk in this portfolio in 2013, which resulted in a lower
yield than the Allstate [ph] Financial (27;31) portfolio. The yield is now increasing, reflecting our increased allocation
to high-yield bonds as well as reinvestment into higher interest rates, and our continued shift of the portfolio to
performance-based long-term investments.
To the right is Allstate Financial. We took actions in 2015 to make the portfolio less sensitive to rising interest rates, as
I covered a bit earlier in talking about the immediate annuity business, which is reflected in a lower interest-bearing
yield in 2015.
Moving to the bottom half of the slide, at the left is our GAAP total return. The investment income component of the
return has been fairly consistent, while the valuation contribution was negative in 2015 on wider credit spreads across
the market, with the majority attributed in our returns to investment-grade securities given their weight in our portfolio.
In the middle is our realized capital gains and losses. In 2015, we had a net capital gain of $30 million, which included
$470 million of net gains on sales including the gains on long-duration fixed income securities we sold through the
Allstate Financial portfolio, largely offset by impairments [ph] and intent (28:39) write-downs. The impact of lower
valuations can be seen in the decrease in our fixed income unrealized gains in the chart to the right.
Slide 12 provides an overview of our capital position and highlights the cash returns common shareholders received
throughout 2015. Allstate remains in a position of financial strength and strategic flexibility. Our deployable holding
company assets totaled $2.6 billion at December 31, 2015.
Book value per common share was $47.34 as of year-end 2015, down 1.9% from 2014, reflecting lower unrealized net
capital gains and losses on fixed income securities. Excluding this impact, book value per common share rose 4.2% in
2015 versus 2014.
We returned $3.3 billion in cash to common shareholders in 2015 through a combination of common dividends and
common share repurchases. We repurchased 9.3 million common shares for $573 million during the fourth quarter of
2015, which brought the annual total to 42.8 million shares, 10.2% of our beginning-of-year common shares
outstanding.

Now let's open up the call for your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis from Credit Suisse. Your question, please.
<Q - Ryan J. Tunis>: Hey. Thanks, Good morning. My first question I guess is just on the expense side. I appreciate
there's a good amount of flexibility there, whether it's advertising expenses or just lower incentive comp. But I guess in
the base case that you highlighted in your guidance, that assumes, I guess, some step-up in severity and frequency, how
should we think about the Allstate brand expense ratio in 2016 relative to 2015?
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: Ryan, it's Tom. I'll make a overall comment and then Matt might have some
perspective as well. First, you should expect the expense ratio to go up, because this year, to make our goal, we did cut
advertising. I wanted to improve some of the effectiveness of the advertising stuff anyway with some new advertising.
And then we took some nice-to-do technology stuff and deferred it and decided not to do it and then cut some other
expenses. And if you look at it over the quarters, you can see we increasingly reduced our expenses throughout the
year, which was a focus.
That said, there are a number of things we're investing heavily in and want to invest in, in terms of either long-term
growth or short-term growth, everything from technology, I mentioned, to things like telematics. Matt, do you want to
add anything to that?
<A - Matthew E. Winter>: I think the only thing I would add, Ryan, is that as Tom said in his prepared remarks, as
we see the combined ratio in each local geography getting to an appropriate point and our loss ratios getting where they
need to be and the profit improvement actions fully taking hold and rate burning in, we will want to be able to stimulate
growth in selected areas as long as we're earning appropriate return, and growth requires some investment. And so part
of the expense ratio this year will be influenced by our growth plan and when we're able to turn on growth in certain
areas and when we want to invest.
We're focused on long-term value creation and long-term value creation does require some investment, but it requires
investment with appropriate levels of profitability. And so it's flexible, it will go up. The degree it goes up will depend
upon thoughtful analysis of whether or not we're at appropriate profitability, appropriate margin and whether or not
we're going to earn an appropriate return on the investment.
<Q - Ryan J. Tunis>: Okay. That's helpful. And then my follow-up is just, I guess in the supplement you guys, a few
quarters ago, started breaking out gross versus paid frequency. And the way I understand it is you incur the losses based
on what the gross frequency is and that's also what I think you guys tend to talk about, what the investment community
tends to talk about. But the paid frequency number has been running significantly below the gross over the past several
quarters. I'm just wondering how we should think about that. Is there a possibility that you've been over-estimating
what frequency is?
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: Ryan, let me make that – first, we think our reserves are appropriately established, so
we do that in a bunch of different ways. We look at both gross and net. We look at what the original amount – we do it
by claim. So when a claim comes up, we put up some dollar amount for it. Then as the adjustor learns more, they keep
building that up and it leads to an incurred. And then obviously, we think that we have to factor in future upward
development of that, so we look at that as well. So we look at paid, incurred, incurred but not reported, and we come up
with a number. Obviously for things like physical damage claims, where they're really settled out in about 90 days, that
tends to run through pretty quickly. The bodily injury, where it takes about four years before you get 80% paid out, has

a little bit longer trend line on it. And as a result of that longer trend line, you tend to have more process changes along
the way because you do things differently every year. And so that number tends to bounce around a little more. But I
think we're appropriately reserved. I don't think you should think there is more or less in there than we thought. It's the
right number.
<Q - Ryan J. Tunis>: Thanks. I'll stop there.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please?
<Q - Josh D. Shanker>: Yeah, thank you very much. I had two questions. Tom, the first one is revisiting last quarter
actually. We talked about the 4Q auto accident seasonality that did not seem to appear in this quarter. In the end, is it
just a dream? Or is there something really there? Or what do you think?
<A - Matthew E. Winter>: Josh, it's Matt.
<Q - Josh D. Shanker>: Hi, Matt.
<A - Matthew E. Winter>: How are you? I'm going to refer you to a page in the appendix that we put in there. If you
look at the presentation slide 14, there's a whole bunch of drivers of the combined ratio and a whole bunch of drivers of
even frequency. Some of them are controllable, some of them are uncontrollable. Some of them we can manage and
some we can't.
Even within the ones that are somewhat manageable, like new business quality and volume of new business and
geographic mix, there's also some things you just can't predict. Seasonality and weather, especially, is one of those
completely unpredictable pieces of this puzzle. And so when we look at year over year, you can look back, we have
some charts that show fourth quarter seasonality that tend to spike up. And then you have last year where we had
almost no catastrophes and benign weather and this year a much more normalized catastrophe year, but I'd say also a
more normalized weather environment.
Seasonality is one of those high-level generalities that tends to pan out over multiple years, but you can have
dislocations and aberrations in that on a year-by-year and quarter-by-quarter basis. So I would not draw trend line
conclusions based upon one or two quarters and how they appear versus previous quarters.
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: And Josh, I don't know if I'm reading into your question, but it sounded like frequency
was actually up quite a bit in the fourth quarter, so I couldn't tell what your underlying assumption is. Matt has a slide
in there as well on the increase in frequency in the fourth quarter.
<Q - Josh D. Shanker>: No, I'm – not related to frequency, just to look in the past, and I've always – I'm anticipating
fourth quarter being a tough comp every year. My other question – look, I listened to your prepared remarks and I
know you're going to invest in the future and homeowners can change a little bit. But you did an 88.7% underlying
combined ratio firm-wide for 2015, and you have 5.5% rate increases coming through on the auto side, yet you've
guided to 88% to 90% underlying for 2016. It seems to me a very hard thing to believe that there's a world where the
underlying combined ratio is going to be worse in 2016 than it was in 2015. Are you just being conservative? Or I
mean, do you really think that that's the right range and at 89% with a plus or minus 1% around it?
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: We think it's the right range. I think we've been doing this since I became CEO, I think
it's maybe our ninth or 10th year that I've done this. We've never missed it. So we do it so that we think it's the right
range, but that's reasonable. You get a point swing either way from frequency and severity. I mean, you can get – as
Matt mentioned, you can't predict frequency and, to be honest, it's really difficult to predict severity within a point. So
that alone gives you a two-point spread. There have been some years, Josh, where we've had a three-point spread, but
that was when we weren't sure how quickly the homeowners business was going to take hold. And we did quite well,
we got ahead of that and it was faster than we had done in our modeling.

But we do a lot of statistical modeling around this. We think it's about right. I mean, if you – you're right. You will see
a lot of rate come through, that's the $1.1 billion. And if loss costs, which is a result of frequency and severity, keep
going up, which is what we have in our predictions, we'll put more in rate increases.
So no, we think it's the right number. We set it up to get there. And if you want to assume your case, then that would be
in the middle of the range. We don't get so precise that we do it to the tenth of a point. It's like I'd like to give just round
numbers, and we think 88 to 90, we'll be in that range.
<Q - Josh D. Shanker>: All right. Well, good luck. And I hope it's even better than that.
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar from Macquarie. Your question, please.
<Q - Amit Kumar>: Thanks, and good morning. And congrats on the print. Maybe two quick follow-up on Josh's
question. First of all, just going back to the discussion on guidance and rate increases, how should we think about
future rate increases? You've obviously had meaningful rate increases over the past few quarters. Are you factoring in
that, based on where we stand, that number to diminish or continue to ramp up from here?
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: It will be reflective of our results in the cost basis. So if frequency and severity
continue to increase, you'll continue to see us go into individual states with targeted rate increases. If it moderates, then
I think you should expect to see it come down, but we don't know for sure.
<Q - Amit Kumar>: So I guess related to that is what are you baking in for frequency and severity here?
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: We have a plan, obviously, that we have frequency and severity but when we moved
to do – when we got away from EPS guidance, which I thought in our business didn't make a lot of sense which I will
give you an underlying combined ratio guidance which excludes catastrophe, so things we can pretty much predict. We
think at 88 to 90, what happens with increases in frequency and severity, we can manage to it with the premium
increases we'll be able to get next year.
<Q - Amit Kumar>: Okay.
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: But we don't give out the specifics of components. That just ends up being – it helps
people do their models, but it turns our conversations into one of modeling as opposed to the pace of the business. We
feel good about the business where it is. We'd like to make more money in auto insurance. Even though the returns are
above our cost of capital, we've made much higher returns than that. Our competitive position and strength enables us
to do that. And we're headed down that path. When we get there, it will be dependent on what happens with the
external environment.
<Q - Amit Kumar>: Got it, that's fair enough. And just I guess on the external factors, I know Josh was asking about
this, one of the questions you were getting was the benign set of weather in Q4. If you were to normalize it, would it be
materially different to what you're looking at in charts, I guess, 21 and 22? Or would it be modestly different?
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: Well, let me talk about it. So the fourth quarter, we came in and were able to get with
inside our range, so at 88.7 for the year. The good weather really was a result – it wasn't really good weather,
necessarily. The homeowners business did a little better because we had fewer fire losses, which tend to be big losses. I
don't know whether that's weather or just luck. On the other end of that, which is completely controllable as Matt
pointed out, is expenses. We did a good job getting expenses down because we wanted to be within the range. And then
the profit improvement actions did start to go through. But Matt, maybe you can flip to – maybe, Matt, take them
through slide 15 which shows the frequency just because I think everyone is saying it's like benign weather and like we
had a big increase in auto frequency in the fourth quarter and I don't want you to walk away thinking that it wasn't
there.

<A - Matthew E. Winter>: So Tom referred to slide 15. What slide 15 does is show what we believe is one of the
primary drivers of frequency. As we've talked about on almost every call, frequency is driven by primarily miles
driven, but also weather, distracted driving, new business volume, new business quality and underwriting. And miles
driven itself is driven by employment rate and gas prices, and we know what's happened to both of those over this last
year.
One of the confusing things is I have referred in the past to the fact that the frequency trend is widespread. But I think
some of you have taken that to mean that it is consistent across the country. It is widespread, but it is not consistent
across the country. In fact, it's geographically varied.
And slide 15 is just some data from the Federal Highway Administration that shows how miles driven, as of November
versus prior year, has gone up in each of the different regions. And you'll notice that in the Northeast it only went up
2.9%, while in the West it went up 5.5% and South Atlantic 5.1%, et cetera. So this is one driver, but it's a major driver
and it does help to explain some of the other questions that you've been raising about why different companies have
different experiences. They have different geographic concentrations of their business, their books of business, and the
miles driven in those areas is different. It will clearly impact results.
<Q - Amit Kumar>: Got it. Okay. This is very helpful. Thanks for the answers.
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: Thanks.
<A - Matthew E. Winter>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel from Janney Montgomery. Your question,
please.
<Q - Robert R. Glasspiegel>: Good morning, Allstate. Just an observation, Tom. When you hit your forecast nine
years in a row, I guess that's another way of saying you tend to be conservative with your outlooks because no one's
that good to be able to forecast. My question... [Laughter]
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: I'm not sure what you're saying, Bob. I would say, look, we have a good system, we
have a great team. They're goal driven. They know how to deliver what we've said we would deliver. If you had asked
me last year when we gave our range of 87 to 89, did I think frequency and severity were going to clip up at above 5
points, I would have said no. So the point is you really can't forecast frequency in that. What we can do is tell you,
given the strength of our system and the transparency we have, our management processes in place, we think we can
manage to 88 to 90 next year. And so that's what we've set out to do. If we do better than that, then that will be because
we reacted well and did well, but we don't set it up so we can be below it. Like that's not the goal here because
obviously, as you would expect, you want to be balanced, thoughtful and transparent with your shareholders. You don't
want to under-promise and over-deliver because then everybody will think, well, the whole world's falling apart; nor do
you want to over-promise and under-deliver. So we try to do it on what we think this system can deliver and we think
88 to 90, we did not set it up to be too optimistic or set it up to be too conservative. It's right down the middle.
<Q - Robert R. Glasspiegel>: I hear you. My question is, I understand all your profit moves and I'm encouraged by
the fourth quarter underlying showing some improvement, which suggests that you're on track. And I guess I
understand what you're doing in Allstate brand and Encompass. On Esurance, trying to slow the growth dramatically
certainly fits within your profit objective and seems like a sound way to go to achieve your short-term plan. But I guess
my question is, are you where you want to be in scale in that business long term? And what is your overall sort of
long-term game plan on Esurance? How big do you have to be in that business to be a long-term player?
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: Well, let me make an overall long-term comment, and then Don can give you some
specifics. So Esurance is twice the size from when we bought it four years ago or so. And we think it is of scale at $1.6
billion, because if you look at normal direct-marketing companies, it'd be 10% of your premiums you would spend in

advertising, and at $160 million that's enough media weight to make sure people hear you. If you're half that size, you
just don't have enough throw weight in the marketing world. So I think it's of scale today.
That said, we have good growth plans and I don't want you to think that this is a backing off of Esurance growth. Don
can talk about the things we're doing to get into homeowners and motorcycles, and Canada, new markets. So there is
plenty of growth up there. We just were managing this year to some objectives that Don had set for the team. So Don,
maybe you want to comment about that.
<A - Don Civgin>: Yeah, Bob, first, remember, when we acquired Esurance, we did it for the strategic reason of going
into the lower right-hand corner with the self-serve brand-sensitive customer, and really focusing the customer value
proposition against the Geico and Progressive direct models. And when we acquired it, what we said we were going to
do was run it for economics as opposed to GAAP accounting. So as you know, in the direct model, you expense all
your marketing expenses upfront, and as a result the first year or the first quarter looks particularly bad when you're
growing. But then in later years, you tend to make money as the business retains, and you don't have to spend the
marketing again.
As Tom said, the business is now twice as large as it was when we acquired it a little over four years ago. It does have a
meaningful impact on where Allstate reports. And with twice as much growth, we were having some pressure on the
loss ratio. And so what we decided to do this year was slow the growth down, really focus on getting more efficiency
out of our model. That meant both on the marketing side and on the operations side. And I would tell you, I'm
absolutely delighted with how they responded and how the business is doing. You talk about slowing it down
dramatically; it's still growing, what, 5% in the four quarter and more than that for the year. Not as high as it had been,
but given the reduction in marketing, still a good growth rate. And the underlying combined ratio is down over 8 points
from last year in the quarter. So feel really good about where they are.
Having said that, I would echo what Tom said, the business is at scale. It could run at this size with meaningful growth
rates I think, and certainly do it in an economic way. But we do want to grow the business in the future as aggressively
as we can. We just want to do it with a balance of profitability and growth. We felt that was getting a little out of kilter
a year or 18 months ago. We're getting it back in line now, feel good about what they're doing.
And the one other thing I'd amplify is, I think Tom mentioned it in his comments, we had 4 points of investment in
2015 that shows up in the combined ratio, but you don't get the benefit of those investments in the current year. Things
like expanding homeowners, which is now in 25 states, Renters which is in 20 states, motorcycle is in 11, auto
continues to expand to 43 states and one – Ontario in Canada as well. And so we are investing heavily in building our
capabilities for the future, building out features and expanding our footprint. I think the answer to your question is we
have very aggressive growth plans for the future. We're investing heavily in that, but we want to make sure that we
balance that with the economics and the reported results on a current basis.
<Q - Robert R. Glasspiegel>: Thanks for the thoughtful answers.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please?
<Q - Kai Pan>: Good morning. Thank you. First question on capital management, and it looks like you returned more
than you earned in 2015. I'm just wondering, is part of it the capital, like optimize your capital structure, and going
forward, is that going to be sustainable?
<A - Steven E. Shebik>: So if you look back over the last couple years, we set up our share buyback program really on
a basis of [ph] did we put up (52:58) capital that we have available. We sold Lincoln Benefit Life, which freed up both
some capital and also the proceeds from the sale. So we moved that up to the parent company, $1.2 billion, in 2013 and
2014. So in 2015, we used a fair amount of that to increase that buyback program for what may normally have been to
the $3 billion level we're talking about.

Page 13 of 15
In addition, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've done a fair amount of work at kind of bringing our risk
profile down in the corporation, which once again has freed up some capital. We do need to grow the business. So if
you look in the future, unless we can continue to change our risk profile, which we would say at the moment, as we
said, as I said, we're going to put a little more money into our investment portfolio to back that into the equity-type
investments. We will need to put some money aside each year to grow the business and we will also have to pay our
dividend, obviously. And what we free up essentially from net income, we pay out on a year lag generally in our share
buyback.
<Q - Kai Pan>: Okay. So we're looking more probably like a payout ratio around 100% levels?
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: Well, we don't do it that way. That's of course the way the banks do it. But we do it the
way, Steve, which is – so we look at how much capital we need, then we say how much did we earn, how much do we
have. And so we don't do it as a percentage of earnings.
<Q - Kai Pan>: Okay. That's great. And second question for Tom. It looks the change on slide four of your operating
priorities in 2016, two things. One is, number one is better serve our customers through innovation, effectiveness and
efficiency, could you give some example of that? And then the fifth item, basically the long-term growth platform, now
you mention about acquiring, I just wonder like what platform, like Allstate currently lack that you would like to grow
into and what's the appetite of your acquisition?
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: Okay. So let me answer the last one and ask Matt to answer the first one. So first, in
terms of the priorities, they're all important. So they're not – like we don't fight over which order they're in. And so
Matt will talk about the customer, which is obviously very important to us, but as important as all the other ones.
We did add – it was a good catch on your part, Kai. We added the 'acquire' to the 'build long-term growth platforms'.
Long-term growth platforms are the ones we're building, including things like telematics and what we're doing in
roadside and Allstate Benefits and those things. We think if we need to acquire something to help accelerate those
efforts, we would do that.
Secondly, we believe that there's additional capacity in, particularly, the Allstate agency channel, but also some in
Esurance, to pick up adjacent products and services which are consistent with protecting and preparing people.
Particularly as Matt makes progress on the trusted advisor model in the Allstate agent channel, we think there are other
things we could sell. And we could either decide we want to get into the business, do filings, break the clock and that
kind of stuff if it's unique enough. Or if somebody has a platform that we can buy and we can bolt it on to ours, we
would do that. So that's the concept behind acquisitions. We didn't put it in there because we have some specific target
or anything we want to talk about. Matt, do you want to go through the customer piece?
<A - Matthew E. Winter>: Sure, Kai. So you correctly pointed out that it's customer base. So it's all about
customer-centricity and using innovation effectiveness and efficiency not just to manage financials and manage
margins, but to better serve our customers. And there's three primary tracks of work going on under that category. The
first, as Tom just mentioned, is trusted advisor. And trusted advisor is all the work we have underway to help our
agency owners and their staff and our exclusive financial specialists better serve our customers through personalized,
customized tailored solutions, geographically based; that are advice based, not product push; that are solutions as
opposed to transactions, and based on long-term valued relationships. And so we have a lot of work underway there,
and that goes to both the effectiveness of our agency system as a distribution model and the efficiency with which we
put through product.
The second major line of work that we have underway is we refer to it as our Continuous Improvement; others refer to
it as Lean engineering. And we have installed Continuous Improvement in a good portion of the company already. It's a
set of management principles and practices that empower frontline employees, get them involved in root-cause problem
solving, create flow of information, create an environment where they're engaged in their work. And we have seen
dramatic increases in productivity and efficiency of those operations that we've installed Continuous Improvement.
We've also seen greater customer satisfaction and employee engagement in those areas.

The third, and this is on really the innovation side, the track of work we have underway, we refer to it as Integrated
Digital Enterprise, but you've also heard me refer to it as a set of projects that take data, predictive analytics and
emerging technologies, and combine those capabilities to better serve customers. And that includes a range of things
that both use internal sources of data as well as external sources of data to provide more predictive guidance to our
agency owners in serving their customers, to help them better serve those customers, tell them what the next logical
product for them might be, and to use those emerging technologies to deliver that in a way that's more accepted by the
customer, more intuitive to the customer, and is more respectful of the customer's time and energy.
And so you will continue to see a lot of focus there. As Tom referred to in his opening remarks, as he explained why
the expense ratio may float up a little bit, we will continue to invest in all these core initiatives because they're all about
long-term value creation. If we're able to better serve our customers through innovation, effectiveness and efficiency,
we will create a more valuable organization and we're all about that. And so I thank you for asking the question.
<Q - Kai Pan>: Thank you very much.
<A - Patrick Macellaro>: Hey, Jonathan, we'll take one more quick one.
Operator
Certainly. Our final question comes from the line of Alison Jacobowitz from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your
question, please.
<Q - Jay Arman Cohen>: Yeah, it's actually Jay Cohen as you can probably tell by the voice. Two questions. One is
you're obviously taking action, as you've talked at length about, to improve the auto profitability. And you suggested
that certainly the effect will depend partly on what your competitors do. Question is, what are your competitors doing?
What are you seeing out there?
And then secondly, relative to miles driven, arguably one of the reasons is lower fuel prices, would you suspect that oil
going from $100 down to $40 has a bigger effect than oil going from $40 to $30? In other words, the effect one might
suggest would be declining over time.
<A - Matthew E. Winter>: Jay, it's Matt. Those are two really good questions. First of all, what we are seeing on the
part of our competitors, some of our competitors, is a significant rate action. And the filings that we're reviewing as we
make our filings, we see competitor rate filings as well. Some of them are quite significant. Some of them are more
moderate. Most of it depends upon if you look back three or four years, the level of rates, they started this period in.
And so those who had a greater gap to cover in order to deal with the frequency and severity pressure are taking greater
rates.
So we expect that to generate some increased turmoil in the environment, and it will certainly generate shopping
behavior in the industry. And shopping behavior can be a positive or a negative depending upon how you approach it,
and where you're positioned. It's all part of competition.
So we believe we're well positioned. We believe we're prepared for it. We believe we're monitoring their actions. But
we're mostly focused on what we need to do to earn appropriate returns and serve our customers. And so I would say
our primary focus is always on managing our own business with an eye towards what the competitors are doing, as
opposed to trying to react to competitors all the time, which I find can just drive you crazy.
On your second question, it's a great point. There is a point of diminishing impact with gas prices on miles driven.
We've always said that we thought the unemployment rate and economic activity had even a greater impact than the gas
prices, because economic activity impacts employment driving, and gas prices typically impact only discretionary
driving activities, because if you have to go to work, you have to go to work and you're going to pay $3 a gallon or
you're going to pay $1.90 a gallon. If you're thinking about a vacation this summer and you're deciding whether to stay
home or drive down to Florida, if gas is at $1.60, it's probably going to influence you differently than if gas was at
$3.50 a gallon.

Now there is a point at which, though, it's just plain cheap and it's no longer a question. And I think we're probably at
that point. So I think you're correct in that, from what we look at, we think the biggest influence of the drop in gas
prices has already occurred, and it's unlikely that that will drive much further increase in miles driven. But that being
said, we also don't know what economic activity is going to look like, and what all the other influences on frequency
will look like.
Thomas Joseph Wilson
So thank you all. I'm going to leave you with a couple thoughts. Allstate has an extremely strong operating platform,
first, that enables us to react quickly to whatever appears in the world. Secondly, we proactively manage our risk and
return on a consolidated basis, whether it's catastrophes, auto margins, investment returns or our capital structure, we
look at it in total. And thirdly, we are focused on long-term value. We pay attention to current earnings because it is a
step along the way, but we will not give up long-term value creation for short-term earnings, because we believe that's
what shareholders want, which is creating long-term economic cash value. Thank you very much. We'll talk to you next
quarter.
