concluding remarks, followed by your questions.
With that introduction, it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Ellen.
Ellen Kullman
Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. This is our first earnings call since we completed the separation of our
Performance Chemicals segment on July 1. That business is now officially a separate entity known as the Chemours
Company. And we've crossed a key threshold to become the next-generation DuPont.
Separating Chemours has been an essential and perhaps the most visible step in our ongoing transformation to a
higher-growth, higher-value company with a more stable and consistent earnings profile. This profile is evident already
in the results delivered by the ongoing, post-spin businesses over the past six years. As you know, this quarter also felt
the continued impact of challenging industry-wide conditions in agricultural markets and ongoing currency headwinds.
As we look ahead, our priorities are clear. First, we will continue to drive productivity and reduce costs as we enhance
efficiency and simplification. Second, by pairing our streamlined infrastructure with our innovation, science, and
applications expertise, I'm confident we can accelerate sales and margin growth and extend or build leadership
positions in attractive markets that benefit from long-term macro trends. And, third, we'll maintain our disciplined
approach to capital allocation to deliver value to shareholders. Our successful execution of these priorities will make us
even stronger, better able to withstand the kind of macro and industry challenges we currently face.
Nick will now walk us through the specifics on our financial details for the quarter, and then I'll come back to expand
on these priorities while previewing our strategy for the remainder of 2015 and the long term. Nick?
Nicholas C. Fanandakis
Thank you, Ellen.
Let's start with the details of the second quarter on slide 2. Operating earnings per share were $1.18 versus $1.17 in the
prior year. Performance Chemicals segment operating earnings were down $0.11 from the prior year, reflecting
continued challenges in the TiO2 market, which contributed to the lowest earnings performance for this segment since
the global financial crisis. Currency continued to be a significant headwind in the quarter, impacting operating earnings
by $0.17 per share, of which $0.03 per share is included in Performance Chemicals' results. Consolidated net sales were
$8.6 billion, a decline of 11% versus the prior year, with 5 percentage points of that decline due to currency, as the
dollar remained strong relative to most other currencies, particularly the euro, Brazilian real, and Japanese yen.
Prior-year portfolio actions, local price, and volume each reduced sales by 2 percentage points in the quarter.
Turning now to slide 3. Currency continues to be a significant headwind in 2015, negatively impacting operating
earnings by $0.17, which is included in segment results. Exchange gains and losses and income taxes together were a
benefit of $0.14 in the quarter, of which $0.09 was attributable to prior periods. Segment results were down $0.16,
including the $0.17 negative impact from currency I described earlier. A lower share count contributed a $0.02 benefit
in the quarter. Lower corporate costs provided about a $0.02 benefit, more than offsetting higher interest expenses,
resulting in a net benefit of $0.01 in the quarter.
Turning now to slide 4, I'd like to highlight some of our geographic results. As you can see, our geographic mix of sales
shifted year over year to a higher percentage of reported sales occurring in the U.S. and Canada. A highlight in second
quarter was volume growth in EMEA in most of our segments. However, the region was down overall, primarily due to
currency. Excluding the impact of currency, the geographic mix would have been similar to the prior year.
Now let's turn to the second quarter segment earnings analysis on slide 5. As you can see, earnings growth in
Performance Materials and Electronics & Communications was more than offset by lower results in Performance
Chemicals and Agriculture. The growth in Performance Materials was driven by demand for ethylene, productivity, and

lower raw material costs, which more than offset the impact of currency and the prior-year divestiture of Glass
Laminated Solutions/Vinyls. Electronics & Communications results were driven by continued productivity gains,
partially offset by the impact of currency. Volume growth in Tedlar film and consumer electronics was more than
offset by competitive pressures impacting Solamet paste. As I noted earlier, Performance Chemicals' operating earnings
were down $0.11 or 55% from the prior year. Currency, local price and product mix together impacted sales by 10%,
reflecting challenging TiO2 market conditions in the quarter.
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash on slide 6. We maintained our strong balance sheet position during the
quarter. Negative free cash flow of about $3 billion reflects our typical seasonal agricultural cash outflow in the quarter
and was slightly higher than the prior year due to an increase in purchases of plant, property, and equipment. Net debt
has increased in the quarter over our ending 2014 balance, which reflects our normal seasonal shifts. We used existing
cash balances to fund our seasonal agriculture working capital requirements, growth investments, and dividends. Today
we announce that in connection with the completion of the spin-off of Chemours, the board of directors authorized the
use of approximately $4 billion distribution proceeds to repurchase shares as follows: $2 billion to be repurchased and
retired by the end of 2015, with the remainder to be repurchased and retired by the end of 2016. We expect to use an
accelerated share purchase plan in connection with the $2 billion buyback by year-end 2015.
On slide 7, I'd like to highlight that we are continuing to execute on our operational redesign initiative, which delivered
about $0.10 of benefit in the second quarter and is on track to deliver about $0.40 of savings in 2015 and $1.3 billion by
the end of 2017 on a run-rate basis. Productivity was a key driver of results in the quarter, resulting in operating margin
improvement in five of our six ongoing operating segments and visible in a $100 million reduction in selling, general,
and administrative costs versus prior year. We remain focused on productivity and continue to look for additional areas
to improve and accelerate our cost-reduction programs.
The spin-off of Chemours was completed on July 1, creating two highly competitive companies: the next generation of
DuPont, which will be focused on higher growth, higher value; and Chemours, which was structured to focus on cash
generation, productivity, and higher yield.
I'd like to take a few moments to share with you the process we undertook in determining the capital structure for
Chemours. We evaluated the cash flows of the Performance Chemicals segment over several business cycles and
established an appropriate capital structure of $4 billion of debt and $100 million of quarterly dividend. The capital
structure was not based on peak or trough conditions, but was designed to serve the business well over time as the
business cycle turns and the benefits of recent investments are realized.
In addition, the credit rating agencies evaluated Chemours and issued a corporate credit rating of BB/Ba3. While the
TiO2 market is currently in a down cycle, Chemours' management has publicly shared the actions they intend to take to
improve earnings and cash flow going forward. Chemours is comprised of very solid businesses with strong market
leadership, and they are well-positioned for the long term.
As we have previously communicated, DuPont established Chemours' capital structure at the separation to support a
quarterly dividend to our shareholders such that the sum of DuPont's and Chemours' aggregate third quarter dividend is
equivalent to DuPont's aggregate dividend paid in the second quarter 2015 to shareholders. DuPont remains committed
to our dividend. Today we announced our 444th consecutive quarterly dividend since 1904, and I reiterate today our
intent to continue to grow our dividend on a continuing operations basis in line with future earnings growth.
Turning to slide 8. As a result of the completion of the spin, we are updating our outlook for 2015 on a continuing
operations basis. We now expect 2015 operating earnings of about $3.10 per share. On a continuing operations basis,
our first half earnings were $2.35 per share, comprised of $1.26 in the first quarter and $1.09 in the second. We expect
earnings per share of about $0.75 for the second half on a continuing operations basis, of which about 25% will be
earned in the third quarter, and the remainder will be in the fourth quarter. Our second half earnings are weighted
towards the fourth quarter, primarily due to our agricultural segment. Our second half expectations reflect a slower start
in the Latin America summer season for both seed and crop protection businesses.

Our full-year outlook of $3.10 per share excludes $0.80 per share in previously anticipated full-year earnings from the
Performance Chemicals segment. The $0.80 per share was based upon our assumption of flat full-year earnings year
over year and a base tax rate of 22%. The outlook also reflects lower expected results in our Ag segment due to weaker
demand in global crop protection markets, reduced expectations for corn area in Latin America, and
lower-than-expected soybean volumes in North America.
The global currency markets continue to be volatile, and the dollar continues to remain strong relative to a broad basket
of currencies which we operate in. As a result, our full-year operating earnings now reflects an expected currency
headwind of about $0.60 per share, which excludes the impact of currency as it relates to Performance Chemicals. We
expect net sales to be down mid to high single digits versus prior year, as volume and local price growth are expected
to be offset by the impact of currency, portfolio changes, and a challenging agricultural environment, as I just
mentioned. For the full year, we expect to continue our base tax rate of 22%, an increase from prior year due to
geographic mix of earnings and the absence of the U.S. R&D credit. Changes in the anticipated geographic mix of
earnings could impact our expected tax rate for the full year. Capital expenditures, excluding Performance Chemicals,
are expected to be about $1.5 billion.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Greg.
Gregory R. Friedman
Thanks, Nick. I'd like to provide some brief segment insights focused on our second-quarter results. As a reminder, the
slides with complete segment commentary are posted on the investor website under Events & Presentations, along with
other materials for today's call.
Beginning on slide 9, in Performance Materials, operating earnings increased 3%, driven by broad-based improved
product mix, productivity, and volume growth for ethylene, as the prior-year ethylene sales were constrained due to the
scheduled outage at the Orange, Texas, ethylene unit. This was offset by $42 million of negative impact from currency,
the portfolio change from the sale of Glass Laminated Solutions/Vinyls, and a negative impact from an unplanned
ethylene outage. Excluding the impact of currency, operating earnings would have increased by about 17%.
On slide 10, operating earnings for Electronics & Communications increased 4%, as productivity gains more than
offset volume decreases and a $3 million negative impact from currency. Volume growth in Tedlar film in
photovoltaics and consumer electronics was more than offset by competitive pressures impacting Solamet paste.
Excluding the impact of currency, operating earnings would have increased by about 8%.
On slide 11, Nutrition & Health operating earnings decreased 2%, as productivity gains were more than offset by a $12
million negative impact of currency. Volume growth in probiotics, cultures, texturants, and ingredient systems were
offset by a decline in specialty protein. Excluding the impact of currency, operating earnings would have increased by
about 10%.
Turning to slide 12, in Industrial Biosciences, operating earnings decreased 15%, as increased demand for bioactives
was more than offset by lower pricing and a $6 million negative impact of currency. Increased enzyme demand,
principally in animal nutrition, health and personal care, and food markets, was offset by lower biomaterial sales.
Excluding the impact of currency, operating earnings would have been about 5% lower than prior year.
On slide 13, Safety & Protection, operating earnings decreased 7%, as productivity improvements and volume growth
in medical packaging and protective garments were more than offset by $20 million of negative currency impact, the
portfolio impact of the Sontara divestiture, and lower demand, particularly from the oil and gas industry for Nomex
thermal resistant fiber and Sustainable Solutions offerings. Excluding the impact of currency, operating earnings would
have increased by about 3%.
On slide 14, Agriculture operating earnings decreased 7%, as improved productivity and increases in price from new
products were more than offset by lower volume and an $84 million negative currency impact. Decreased volumes are
due to reduced soybean sales, lower crop protection volumes, and reductions in global corn planted area. Excluding the

impact of currency, operating earnings would have increased by about 3%.
And finally, on slide 15, Performance Chemicals' operating earnings decreased 55%, driven primarily by lower prices
for titanium dioxide and from the negative impact of currency. Excluding the negative impact of currency, operating
earnings would have declined by about 38%.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Ellen.
Ellen Kullman
Thanks, Greg.
Since 2011, we've completed three major and many smaller portfolio actions with the intent to strategically to align our
businesses with our science capabilities and with large, attractive long-term growth markets. With the Chemours
separation complete, we are stronger in several respects. Our core portfolio is more resilient and less cyclical, with the
capacity for more stable and consistent earnings growth.
In the past three years, we have significantly streamlined our asset base, and today we have almost 30% fewer
manufacturing plants than before, with 60% of them now biology based. We are more R&D intensive, deploy more of
our capital to growth projects, and have a higher margin profile. In addition, organic and developing market growth
from our current portfolio historically has been strong, and we expect that to continue into the future given our global
scale and targeted market presence.
As I mentioned in my opening comments, our current priorities are clear. We took the opportunity presented by the
separation to take a fresh look at our cost structure and are on track to deliver $1 billion in savings by year-end 2015
and $1.3 billion in savings by the end of 2017, both on a run-rate basis. You can see the progress in our second quarter
results, as our selling, general, and administrative costs were $100 million lower than last year, and we increased
operating margins of our ongoing segments by 180 basis points.
Additionally, cost reductions in our production and supply chain operations have lowered cost of goods sold and are
improving our margins. We're doing this by making important improvements that have transformed the structure of the
organization. We have taken out layers of management, consolidated facilities, simplified support activities, and
improved the efficiency of our supply chain. These are meaningful savings that will not only improve our margins but
better equip us to invest for top line growth.
We fully expect to continue to find additional opportunities that will take us beyond the $1.3 billion of cost reduction.
The next important phase of productivity improvement will come from our enterprise resource planning system, which
we refer to as One DuPont. Productivity has played an important role in our margin expansion. With the early success
of our redesign initiative and focusing on accelerating top line growth, we believe we have further runway to build on
that progress.
Another focus for DuPont moving forward is top line growth in near-, mid-, and long-term horizons. We're intensifying
our drive to increase sales and value by building and leveraging existing, world-leading positions in three highly
attractive strategic focus areas: agricultural and nutrition, bio-based industrials, and advanced materials. In agriculture,
our long-term success has been driven by innovation and strong return on our research and development investments.
And we are well-positioned to grow in the future as markets recover.
Our robust pipeline of new genetics, innovative trait combinations, and crop protection products provide a strong basis
for future growth. And our combination of capabilities position us well competitively. Two key emerging products
include Optimum Leptra corn hybrids and DP4114. Leptra, which will offer three modes of action to help manage a
broad spectrum of pests while preserving the performance of today's trait technologies and protecting the outstanding
yield potential of Pioneer germplasm. We launched Leptra in the United States in 2014 under a stewarded program and
have expanded our lineup of Leptra corn hybrids in 2015. We're excited about Leptra in Brazil, where we're
demonstrating its benefits to customers this summer. We recently received approval for cultivation in Brazil, clearing

the way for an introductory commercial watch of Leptra for the 2015-2016 Safrinha season. We believe Leptra will
help us strengthen our position in the Brazil corn market as we ramp up volumes in 2016 and 2017.
We also continue to make excellent process towards the commercial launch of our new seed trait, DP4114. Once
stacked with other insect traits, DP4114 will offer growers the high yield potential and solid agronomics that they
expect from DuPont Pioneer, along with proven above- and below-ground insect protection. This means that we'll able
to develop more, higher-yielding corn hybrids with DP4114 than with the current traits, delivering faster genetic gains.
We believe this will translate into more value for the farmer and a price lift for Pioneer. We've received cultivation
approval for DP4114 in the United States and Canada and continue to pursue registrations in key import countries as
we prepare for commercial launch.
In Nutrition & Health, we're continuing to see the benefits of the Danisco acquisition. We delivered operating earnings
growth of 27% last year and improved our operating margins by about 200 basis points. Just this quarter, we delivered
low-teens earnings growth excluding the impact of currency and portfolio changes and are seeing broad-based progress
in key areas like probiotics and cultures. Our formulation and research efforts helped us launch a new texturizing
culture strain for yogurt production, branded YO-MIX, that builds on our leadership position in cultures and yogurts.
This new offering provides the right texture and attributes while also facilitating sugar-reduction efforts to improve the
nutritional profile without compromising the taste or feel of typical yogurts. This is just one small example of our R&D
and application development delivering innovation.
In bio-based industrials, we delivered against two important milestone in July. First we have mechanically completed
our Nevada, Iowa, biorefinery, which will open later this year and will be among the largest commercial-scale
cellulosic biorefineries in the world. Second, DuPont is in active discussions around the world with potential licensees
and two weeks ago announced a licensing agreement with New Tianlong Industry in China to begin the development of
China's largest cellulosic ethanol manufacturing plant. The agreement allows NTL to license DuPont's cellulosic
ethanol technology and use our Accellerase enzymes to produce renewable biofuels from the leftover biomass on Jilin
Province's highly productive corn farms. This is another proof point and milestone demonstrating the efficacy of our
strategy in the global renewable fuels marketplace.
Turning to advanced materials, our growth will be fueled by applying our science and innovation capabilities to
capitalize on key trends and add value for customers. Lightweight, fuel-efficient materials in the automotive and
aerospace industries and increasing demand for protective materials are key areas of opportunity for DuPont as we
leverage new science to create more differentiated high-value materials. From 2012 through the first half of 2015, in
advanced materials, our segments delivered segment margin improvements of about 450 basis points in Safety &
Protection, over 700 basis points in Electronics & Communications, and about 400 basis points improvement in our
industry-leading Performance Materials segment. Our focus moving forward is on preserving and strengthening these
margins while accelerating top line growth.
As we capitalize on the opportunities in our three strategic areas of focus, our objective is to grow sales from $28.5
billion to $40 billion to $45 billion by 2020. We've made the right decisions about what business to be in for the long
term. We're taking disciplined actions to be an ever more competitive leader in these spaces. The organization is
focused on accelerating product development, leveraging our global reach, driving productivity, and actively managing
the portfolio. And we're prepared to create a step change in growth over the next five years through the development of
our existing businesses and through future partnerships and acquisitions. Even as we continue to address today's
challenging external conditions, it's an exciting time for all of us as we continue to build the next-generation DuPont.
I want to close by building on Nick's comments about the remainder of 2015. Looking ahead, the remainder of 2015 is
likely to present challenging market dynamics for us as well as our peers, particularly in agriculture and more broadly
through the negative impact of currency. We are addressing these challenges by staying close to our customers and
focusing relentlessly on cost. With the Chemours separation now behind us, we have a new opportunity and a clear set
of priorities. The productivity enhancements we've put into place have positioned us to be even more competitive in the
marketplace.

Importantly, our ongoing business will have reduced cyclicality and greater visibility that will make our business more
predictable for us and for our shareholders. Today DuPont is very different than just a few short years ago, which you
can see in our portfolio, our footprint, our operating model, and in the stronger historical performance of the ongoing
post-spin businesses. We remain confident that our efficient, streamlined organization; our pipeline of new products
aimed at large, attractive growth markets and tailored for expansion into emerging geographies; and our continued
focus on productivity and top line growth will strengthen our position as we move forward and increase value for our
shareholders. Greg?

Thanks, Ellen. Before we open the line for questions, I wanted to announce that we are planning on an Investor Day on
September 29. I invite you to join us to learn more about our long-term strategy, segment plan, and updated long-term
segment targets. We'll have the opportunity to hear directly from our business leaders. We hope you can join us.
We'll now open the line for questions. John?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any
background noise. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Vincent S. Andrews>: Thank you and good morning, everyone. I couldn't help thinking as Greg was going
through some of the segment commentary and he was talking about the Performance Materials segment, there was a lot
of conversation about ethylene. I just was wondering, Ellen, if you could remind us, as you think about sort of DuPont
as it is today, why is that still core to your overall portfolio and sort of the goals of the future?
<A - Ellen Kullman>: Thanks, Vincent. Thanks for the question. Now, our Performance Materials segment and the
ethylene copolymers that come from the unit that you're talking about provide a very unique set of capabilities that we
utilize in the packaging industry to leverage our strength in nutrition and in packaging into that industry, and also in
sporting goods and other areas like that. So the application development groups within that business are very active in
those two markets, a real good face of DuPont to them. And we utilize not only those materials through it but also
integrating Industrial Biosciences materials, renewable materials through that channel as well. So it does serve a
purpose within our company from the standpoint of bringing science to those industries and is a very valuable face for
DuPont.
<Q - Vincent S. Andrews>: And just as a housekeeping follow-up, the $2 billion repo you're going to do by year-end,
I assume the impact of that is in the 310 million. And so I'm just wondering if you can help us with a share count that
we should be using for the full year.
<A - Ellen Kullman>: Sure. Nick?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Yeah. So we'll be doing the $2 billion by the end of the year, as we said. We'll look at
doing the accelerated share repurchase. And the share count, obviously, is going to depend on the purchase price we get
back and what level we can do that. But I would estimate it to be somewhere in the 900 million to 905 million share
range.
<Q - Vincent S. Andrews>: Okay, great. Thanks very much.

Our next question is from P.J. Juvekar from Citi.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Yes, hi. Good morning. Just have a question on P-Chem business. It earned about – in my
calculation it earned about $0.20 a share in the first half. But for your full-year guidance, you're subtracting $0.80 per
share for that business. I mean, shouldn't you be subtracting something less than that? And does that indicate any
weakness in the core business? Thank you.
<A - Ellen Kullman>: Sure. I mean, I think you have to go back, P.J., to where we started the year with our $4.00 and
$4.20. Nick, why don't you take him through the details?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Sure. Well, I think you were absolutely right, Ellen. We've got to go back in time,
P.J., here. When you look at the start of the year, we gave a range of $4.00 to $4.20. And after the first quarter, we
realized that currency headwinds were going to be greater than had anticipated, and we guided to the low end of the
range of $4.00. So what made up that $4.00? Let's just kind of start from there.
And when you look at the P-Chem businesses, you had a TiO2 business that for the first three quarters of 2014 was
stable business. You had a price increase that was announced by the industry in the first quarter of 2015. You had
additional opportunities that were arising, like the Altamira facility. You had the work we had done on Opteon 1234yf
and the traction that was starting to get as the year was unfolding. So you had all of these dynamics playing at the time
that that outlook was set. And at that time, that outlook was set at $0.80.
Now, that's in line very much with what we had communicated all along, because we've been saying from point one on
this that the expectation for P-Chem at that time should be equal to about last year's performance. And if you look at
last year's earnings levels, that's about where it was – $0.82 is that number. So we've been very consistent along that.
Now, the market dynamics are changing, obviously, as the year unfolds. But when the outlook was put together, that's
what was represented in that outlook.
<A - Ellen Kullman>: Yeah, and Mark will be coming out next week with his earning calls and give you all the
forward look for Chemours.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Thank you. And just quickly, you talked about slowdown in global auto builds. You're seeing a
slowdown in – sort of slowdown of growth in second half? Can you just talk about that? Thank you.
<A - Ellen Kullman>: P.J., I think what we saw was the fact that in the first six months of the year, the growth was
about 1.5%, and the expectation as we entered the year was it was going to be 3%. So there's been a drag on growth
from that standpoint. Now, the external economic groups that put the data out show a pretty big third quarter. It's pretty
much counting on China growing north of 10%. And so I think there's a healthy understanding of whether that is real or
not or whether that will be taken down. So we're anticipating that the ag (sic) [auto] industry is not going to grow at
5%-plus in the second half of the year. It's going to be more in the range of 2% to 3%.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Thank you.
<A - Ellen Kullman>: Ah. I'm sorry, auto, not ag. I apologize.

And our next question is from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.
<Q - Jeffrey J. Zekauskas>: Thanks very much. Good morning. 2015 is turning into a tough year for agriculture, and
what you've done is you've sort of lowered your expectations for the third quarter in terms of operating income. How
do these lowered expectations affect the overall cash flow from operations of the company? And of course there are
changes with Performance Chemicals. Do you think your cash flow from operations for the year will be higher than last
year or lower and by any significant amount?

<A - Ellen Kullman>: Nick?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Well, there's no doubt, Jeff, that the performance in ag from a overall perspective is
going to have an impact on the cash, but obviously it's not a one-for-one sort of exchange, because you're also going to
have changes in the working capital needs to support those reduced levels of earnings. When you look at the net cash
flow- you know, for the year, it's going to be far higher because you've got the additional inflow of the cash from the
Chemours separation. If you were to take that out and you look at it net of the share buyback that we're also going to do
in the same year, the $2 billion, it's going to be roughly equal, maybe slightly better than last year from a net cash flow
perspective.
<Q - Jeffrey J. Zekauskas>: Okay. And then secondly, with the accelerated share repurchase, are you doing it in the
third quarter or the fourth quarter? Or why might you do it in the third or the fourth?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Yeah, so with the ASR, Jeff, we're going to initiate that very soon after the blackout
period lifts for us on the earnings announcement today, and we're going to do it as a accelerated share repurchase. So
the majority of the $2 billion will be done very quickly from a share reduction perspective, but the close-out of that
ASR will be done by year-end.
<Q - Jeffrey J. Zekauskas>: Okay. Great. Thank you so much
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Yeah. Thanks.
Operator
Our next question is from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Thank you. Good morning. Nick and Ellen, just on the ASR, was there a restriction on doing
an even larger ASR right now than $2 billion due to the Chemours spin-off? And if not, why not bring the entire $4
billion forward now given where the stock price is?
<A - Ellen Kullman>: Yeah. Great question, Dave. Nick?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: So, Dave, thanks for the question. When you look at the $4 billion that we're getting
in from the spin, you got to keep in mind the credit rating agency and our commitment around maintaining that strong
balance sheet. And so when you think about the EBITDA level that is going out the door and you look at our current
leverage, you see a number that supports $2 billion happening this year and the rest happening next year, and that really
just allows us to maintain that credit rating that we have today, the strong balance sheet we have.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Understood. And, Ellen, just on the potential next layer of cost takeout at DuPont, beyond
the $1.3 billion, where do you see that coming from, and what timeframe and drivers and the thought process? How do
you get at that additional cost layer?
<A - Ellen Kullman>: Yeah. Yeah, David, absolutely. So over the last three years, we have undertaken a program that
we call One DuPont, and it basically changes the fundamental transactional backbone of the company into a simplified,
standardized to SAP standards, not to DuPont standards, and moving to standard costs, common chartered accounts, the
whole thing, across our globe. That will start to stand up in January and roll around the world over the next two years
as we convert these systems. And that is going to enable us to automatically, instead of using a propriety consolidation
and reporting system – which we now have, GCAP – it's going to allow us to use a standard one that will automatically
create the schedules, the spreadsheets we need to understand the business very quickly.
So it's going to be an impact on our supply chains in creating standard data very quickly for them to utilize, and there's
going to be great efficiencies there. It's going to impact our financial organization. I mean, a lot of organizations around
the world, this is going to help us really streamline and simplify. So that's the next tranche. We're going to be talking
more about that at Investor Day, and giving you an idea about the savings that we'll see then. But, you know, it's never

finished. I mean, whether we use tools like One DuPont to help get more efficient or even our warehouses and things
like that and modernizing those, which are part of the One DuPont, there's always opportunities we see to drive
productivity, and we'll continue to go after it.

Our next question is from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Robert A. Koort>: Thanks. Good morning. Ellen, I was wondering if you could dive a little deeper into the
Solamet problems and how long you see that continuing before your new products can sort of overwhelm the
challenges there.
<A - Ellen Kullman>: Yeah. So we've been after this for a little while now. You've heard us talk about it for the past
year. The market is still going strong in PVR. Kevlar sales are very strong, and PV is where the issue is. We have just
launched the PV19A. We launched it in the second quarter. First shipments are now in July. All the competitive
information and the testing we've done shows that we believe that will stabilize the situation. And then we have two
other advancements beyond that that are in the pipeline that we're looking to bring out later this year and early next
year to continue to drive from a stabilization to a differentiation between us and the competition. So I think this is a
very focused time. We see how innovation is changing very quickly in some of these markets, and we got a little bit
behind in Solamet, and we're driving to get ahead now.
<Q - Robert A. Koort>: And if I could follow up on ag, you mentioned that farmers were looking to reduce input
costs, yet they're also embracing your newest – arguably highest-priced technology. So can you help me with that
apparent contradiction?
<A - Ellen Kullman>: Well, I think you'd see in our segment results for the quarter, that price was up in Ag. And if
you take a look at it, there is, with the market challenged, they're closely scrutinizing all their input costs. Seed first –
what is it going to yield for them? And then crop protection and how many times do they need to lay it down and what
timeframe? And so we're seeing a lot of hesitation there and true scrutiny, and maybe taking a little bit of risk that if
they don't, it will turn out fine. So I mean, it's delayed some things that we've seen, and so we're not seeing the
inventory move out into the marketplace as people are delaying their decision much closer to when they're going to use
it. So I just think it's a natural course with the state of the ag industry right now, and it's something our teams globally
are staying very close to.
<Q - Robert A. Koort>: Okay. Thank you.

Our next question is from Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo Securities.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Good morning, folks. Nick, in the commentary regarding the geographies, you actually were
talking about volume growth in Europe. I was wondering if you could expand upon that and the expectations for the
back half of the year.
<A - Ellen Kullman>: Yeah. I mean, Europe being the best-performing region, mostly in developing Europe – I mean
it grew 10%. That's very strong volume performance for us and across Performance Materials and in [ph] HCs, (47:06)
Protection Technologies. So, Nick, what would you add?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Well, I think it was the bright spot in that it was somewhat of a surprise in that
volume was up in this region of the world – 2% volume overall in EMEA. And, like Ellen said, developing EMEA
even stronger, with a 9% volume increase. And it was driven by the products Ellen mentioned. Pioneer was one, and
Nutrition & Health another. So we did see some areas of brightness there that were somewhat of a surprise. Conversely,

when you look at some of the things in Asia, in China, we saw some negatives that were somewhat a surprise as well in
the context of the work that's going on there. And it was pretty much close to across the board. The couple of bright
spots, like N&H and DPT, but in most other areas we saw negatives in a region like China.
<A - Ellen Kullman>: Yeah, but India was a bright spot.
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: India was a bright spot as well. Volume was up about 13% in India, Frank.
<A - Ellen Kullman>: And that was pretty much across the board. We're seeing that improvement in that economy and
a little bit of confidence coming back in, and it's really making a difference.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: All right. Terrific. And just to follow up, I understand the response on why at a $2 billion
ASR rather than a $4 billion ASR with respect to the credit rating agencies, but I was wondering – keeping some cash
on hand or your powder dry, I mean, there's a lot of discussion these days about major, major M&A in the ag space and
perhaps some of the properties could be coming available. What are your thoughts about participating in further
industry consolidation in the ag space in particular?
<A - Ellen Kullman>: What we're seeing is a confirmation that you need more than just one product line in ag to be
successful in the long term. You really have to add not only seed but crop protection services, the things that we've
been talking about, and that scale is very important. And so I think that the industry dynamics are all very interesting
right now. Certainly it's something that we stay very close to. I think the importance of crop protection and how it can
really add a lot of value in the marketplace is being confirmed, and I think our pipeline there is doing very well. So
we've recognized for a long time that we've needed a strong seed and a strong crop protection business. But we
continue to understand what our options are there or where it could create value and understand how that could add to
the strong pipeline that we have in both seed and in crop protection. And right now as you walk around the
marketplace, it seems like everybody's a buyer, nobody is a seller. So I think it'll be interesting to see how this plays
out.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: And we would put you also in that buyer camp, possibly, correct?
<A - Ellen Kullman>: Everybody's a buyer, nobody's a seller.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Thank you.
Operator
Our next question is from Mark Connelly from CLSA.
<Q - Mark W. Connelly>: Thank you. Just two things. When I look at the drop in your pesticide numbers, it looks
fairly large relative to what we're seeing from others, but obviously the comparisons are not that simple. I wonder if
you could help us understand why this quarter might have been tougher for your mix than for somebody else's, if I have
that right. And, second, you mentioned slower sales in specialty proteins, and I'm wondering if that's a secular shift
away from soy or if there's something else going on?
<A - Ellen Kullman>: Thanks very much, Mark. I think that as we take a look at CP, our crop protection business,
we're looking very clearly at where our insecticides and fungicides, herbicides are playing versus others. There is
weaker demand across the industry. So the demand being weak is hitting us all. We have a very competitive position in
growers' fields. We're confident in that. We've got a strong position in insect control. But that's been impacted by lower
demand in Latin America. So that has a little bit of an impact on us potentially...
<Q - Mark W. Connelly>: Sure, sure.
<A - Ellen Kullman>: ...versus others that you're seeing. And your second question was?
<Q - Mark W. Connelly>: About the shortfalls you're seeing in specialty proteins. I'm just wondering if it's a
soy-versus-other-protein issue.

<A - Ellen Kullman>: Oh, okay. Yeah, no, I think what we're seeing is an increased competitive dynamic with new
capacity coming in and the Chinese. There are other protein sources, but it's not the sole reason for the dynamic that's
going on in that market right now.
<Q - Mark W. Connelly>: Okay. So you're not looking at anything specific shifting in your protein business? You're
not looking to reposition it, then?
<A - Ellen Kullman>: The protein business is one that has its ups and downs, and we're constantly looking for ways to
stabilize it and to improve it. And so I think this is just one of the challenges with that area that we continue to drive.
Operator
Our next question is from Mike Ritzenthaler from Piper Jaffray.
<Q - Mike Ritzenthaler>: Yes. Thank you, Ellen, for your previous commentary around the ag consolidation. But I'm
curious about a bit more nuanced aspects and your thoughts about maintaining competitiveness in ag into an
environment where consolidation is becoming this louder and louder component of the narrative. Is it going to require
an acceleration in R&D spend or a redesign of how new product introductions are embraced in the ag segment?
<A - Ellen Kullman>: Yeah. So I think that the ag segment has always been very intense around what R&D
contributes for each one of the players there, including us. I mean, we've seen the value of really novel crop protection
products like Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr and the fungicides and the impact that can have on our position at marketplace
and the tremendous progress we've made there. We have a very strong pipeline in crop protection products, and we're
very excited about what is coming in that industry.
On seed, it again is something that has – historically, farmers have paid for the yield and the yield has been driven by
not only the strong germplasm and the strong genetics of the seed, but also the traits and other things that are very
additive to it.
The third dynamic of it that's coming is services. And I think it's becoming more and more important with the
increasing complexity of whether it's a regulatory environment, the weather impacts, all of those things. And we've had
services out to the marketplace for decades and we are well-positioned with our direct model, direct-to-farmer model,
to really get firsthand feedback on not only what our pipeline should be, but how the services can truly continue to
differentiate us in the marketplace.
<Q - Mike Ritzenthaler>: That makes sense. I guess is the current environment sort of tailoring some of your
emphasis on certain products over others as you kind of look out into 2016, 2017?
<A - Ellen Kullman>: Yeah. I think that 2016, 2017, we're very focused on Leptra, on – DP4114's going to have a
tremendous opportunity for us, and Cyazypyr. We're continuing to get more registrations in Cyazypyr around the
world, and that's been a positive for us. And then seed treatments. It's becoming a more important part of the mix and a
more important part of how we control from a crop-protection standpoint, and I think there's still a tremendous amount
of opportunity out there.
Operator
Our next question is from Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial.
<Q - Don D. Carson>: Yes. Thank you. Want to follow up on crop protection, Ellen. You were down 21%. You
mentioned earlier you have more of a focus on insecticides. But how much of this reduction is actual growers using less
versus how much was just the full pipelines that you still have from last year in Brazil and North America? And,
overall, what percentage of your reduction in ag guidance is driven by crop chemicals?

<A - Ellen Kullman>: Yeah. I think that – so it's both, right? It absolutely is both. Growers using less and therefore
stuff not moving through the channel. Weather's played an impact on here, on delays, and also pest pressure, which is
not – being as strong as it was in previous years, are driving really the market conditions as well. And so it's really hard
to gauge exactly what percentage comes from which of those areas, but all three are tending to have the kind of impact
as we have. As we look forward in the second half of the year, certainly, crop is part of the decline based on what we're
forecasting to occur down in Latin America. And so I think it's part of the mix, along with the lower corn acres down in
Latin America coming up second half of the year.
<Q - Don D. Carson>: And then just a follow-up on the dividend. You've assigned $0.11 of the quarterly dividend to
Chemours. If market dynamics have changed and that's not sustainable, would you bump up the DuPont dividend going
forward?
<A - Ellen Kullman>: We recognize the importance of the dividend to our owners and understand the concern that
we're talking about, about the combined aggregate dividend given the current market conditions for Chemours. And I
think it's important to keep in mind that we've got a long track record demonstrating our commitment to the dividend. I
think it's 444 consecutive quarters of paying a dividend. That dates back to 1904. You know, Nick took you through
kind of how we set those numbers. I just want to say that the primary question of whether or not a change would occur
in the future – they're an independent company. They're going to make the decisions that are in the best interests, and
I'm not going to speculate on what may happen in the future. But if there is a change, our board and leadership will
have an opportunity to evaluate it, and we remained ever-mindful of the importance of the dividend to our owners.

It's John McNulty from Credit Suisse.
<Q - John P. McNulty>: Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just had one for you. So earlier in the
year with the Chemours move, you moved two of your board members off the board and added two. I guess the
question is, any new actions or changes in priorities within the DuPont board that we should be thinking about now
going forward with the changes that have occurred? Thank you.
<A - Ellen Kullman>: Well, our board's getting together. We just had the spin a couple of weeks ago, 27 days ago, and
so we're taking a look at our strategy and reaffirming what that strategy is driving forward. We're going to be bringing
that out in the investor meeting in September. But the focus is on how innovation can deliver real value to the
marketplace and create growth for our company. The focus is on productivity, and it's a very competitive world out
there. And on making sure that our resource allocations and how we're delivering against that are appropriate given the
marketplace. So driving the top line's productivity, I think, are really key in the wheelhouse, and we'll continue to drive
that. So, yeah, we're going to update you guys coming up here the end of September, and I think it's going to be a great
day.
<Q - John P. McNulty>: Great. Thanks very much.
