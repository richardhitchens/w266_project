MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to NIKE's Fiscal 2015 Fourth Quarter Conference Call. For those who need to
reference today's press release, you'll find it at investors.nike.com.
Leading today's call is Kelley Hall, Vice President, Corporate Finance and Treasurer.
Before I turn the call over to Ms. Hall, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking
statements based on current expectations, and those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could
cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in the reports filed with the SEC,
including Forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q. Some forward-looking statements concern future orders that are not necessarily
indicative of changes in total revenues for subsequent periods due to mix of futures and at-once orders, exchange rate
fluctuations, order cancellations, changes in the timing of shipments, discounts and returns which may vary
significantly from quarter to quarter.
In addition, it is important to remember that a significant portion of NIKE, Inc.'s continuing operations, including
equipment, NIKE Golf, Converse and Hurley, are not included in these futures numbers.
Finally, participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including references to wholesale equivalent sales.
References to wholesale equivalent sales are only intended to provide context as to the overall current market footprint
of the brands own by NIKE, Inc. and should not be relied upon as a financial measure of actual results. Participants
may also make references to other non-public financial and statistical information and non-GAAP financial measures.
Discussion of non-public financial and statistical information and presentations of comparable GAAP measures and
quantitative reconciliations can be found at NIKE's website, investors.nike.com.
Now I would like to turn the call over to Kelley Hall, Vice President, Corporate Finance and Treasurer.

Thank you, operator. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss NIKE's fiscal 2015 fourth quarter
results. As the operator indicated, participants on today's call may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You will find
the appropriate reconciliations in our press release, which was issued about an hour ago, and at our website,
investors.nike.com.
Joining us on today's call will be NIKE, Inc., President and CEO, Mark Parker; followed by Trevor Edwards, President
of the NIKE Brand; and finally, Don Blair in his final earnings call as our Chief Financial Officer, will give you an
overview of our financial results. Following their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. We'd like to allow as
many of you to ask questions as possible in our allotted time, so we would appreciate you limiting your initial questions
to two. In the event you have an additional question that was not covered by others, please feel free to re-queue and we
will do our best to come back to you. Thank you for your cooperation on this.
I'll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, Mark Parker.
Mark G. Parker
Thank you, Kelley, and hello, everyone. Fiscal year 2015 was an outstanding year for NIKE, Inc. We've shown once
again that NIKE is a growth company.
Here are the fiscal 2015 highlights. NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 10% to $30.6 billion despite significant FX headwinds.
On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 14%. Gross margin increased 120 basis points to 46%. Earnings
per share rose 25% to $3.70, and we delivered ROIC of 28%. These are the quality results that our shareholders have
come to expect from us and that we demand from ourselves.
One of the reasons we're able to deliver results like these are the talented people who work at NIKE around the world.
So before going on into the detail on our results, I'd like to thank one of those talented leaders, and that's Don Blair. As
you all know, this will be Don's last earnings call with NIKE. And if you're keeping track, that's 63 calls. During my
tenure as CEO and before that as co-President, Don has served as a trusted advisor and a valued business partner. He
has helped lead the company through great times and challenging times, always with a calm focus and level of
discipline that creates confidence and ensures we continue to move forward.
Don will always be remembered as the creator of our long-term financial model, which guides our financial planning to
this day. But more than that, Don will be remembered for the talented leaders he has developed over the years, both
within finance and across the company. I want to thank Don for his leadership and dedication to NIKE over the last 15
years and wish him the very best in his future endeavors.
Don's successor, Andy Campion, is a testament to Don's commitment to developing talent. Andy has been a great
leader during his eight years with NIKE, helping to develop a strategy that will drive NIKE's growth for years to come.
And I'm confident that Andy will continue to build on the strong foundation Don has set for the company as we strive
toward our full potential. Andy will assume the CFO role on August 1 and will join us on the next earnings call.
So while I'm proud of the results we delivered this last year, what sets NIKE apart is our ability to deliver sustainable,
profitable growth year in and year out. It is our proven track record of driving growth under a variety of
macroeconomic conditions that gives us the confidence we can deliver growth for years to come. This past fiscal year,
we managed through a volatile currency environment and sharpened our focus in key markets and we will continue to
drive that same level of discipline and focus as we look ahead to fiscal year 2016.
As we have consistently done in the past, we will leverage the power of the NIKE portfolio to drive growth. We have
demonstrated time and again that our diverse portfolio of brands, categories, geographies and products is a competitive
advantage that allows us to serve our consumer and drive growth better than anyone else. And you can expect us to
leverage our portfolio to further unlock growth around the world, to expand the market and increase share. And we will
do this by staying true to our commitment to the athletes and our commitment to innovation.

I recently sat with the innovation teams for an in-depth review of our future product concepts, and I can tell you I am
incredibly energized by what's to come. Today, we are pushing ourselves to create products and experiences the
consumers want and some they never thought possible. The scale and pace at which we are bringing new innovations to
market is unprecedented. Let me share a few examples. Flyknit, of course, continues to be one of NIKE's great
breakthroughs for the athletes and for our company. It's created a whole new model for design and manufacturing.
Instead of engineering down to the piece, we can now engineer down to the pixel to enhance performance, aesthetics
and sustainability. And the most exciting part is we're just discovering new ways to use it every day.
We've advanced Flyknit into other sports over the past few years, but there's no doubt last summer's World Cup was the
launching pad for Flyknit in global football. More than one-third of the players chose to wear the Magista, our first
Flyknit boot, including Mario Götze, who scored the winning goal in the World Cup final. When you look across our
business, Flyknit's dynamic strength and lightweight benefits have been applied across our key performance categories,
Running, Basketball, Men's and Women's Training, as well as into premium Sportswear.
With the success of Flyknit, we've been inspired to engineer new types of materials like Flyweave. This innovative
performance weaving process pushes the limits of lightweight with superior strength and it was introduced this year
with the Jordan 29. And just a few days ago, we revealed the newest signature shoe from Kevin Durant, the KD 8,
which utilizes this incredible technology. I'm very excited about the potential for Flyweave, so keep an eye out for
further innovation in this area.
We not only deliver new breakthroughs, but we also push ourselves to reinvent our most iconic products. Products in
our Running category are a great example. This year we matched Zoom Air in its 20th year with the Pegasus 31 to
create the fastest, most responsive Pegasus to-date. It proves that much better does not always have to be entirely new.
We also continue to diversify one of our greatest collections of apparel technologies, Dri-FIT. Dri-FIT is the foundation
for everything from shirts to tights to socks and it adapts to any athlete need.
Strong performance this year included Nike Pro Hyperwarm, running Dri-FIT Knit, and running Dri-FIT Hypercool.
One of this year's greatest Dri-FIT innovations was with the NIKE Pro bra collection. With the broadest assortment of
styles and sizes, we are able to provide the athlete with the right fit and support for any type of training or sports.
Finally, Dri-FIT also forms the basis for our most advanced NCAA basketball uniforms ever. Two of our long-standing
partners, Duke and UConn, won their respective men's and women's national championships wearing the NIKE Hyper
Elite uniform. Our uniforms weigh only 11.4 ounces and we have set every detail, from vented waistbands to laser
perforations, which enhance cooling and increase mobility. The Hyper Elite truly sets the standard for basketball
apparel. And it's examples like these that make me so excited to bring the full power of NIKE's innovation and
creativity to the NBA. With NIKE, Jordan and Converse, we can't wait to help grow the game of basketball even
farther across our entire global reach.
At NIKE, innovation comes in many forms, and our growing digital ecosystem is a great example. Consumers are
increasingly connected and utilizing premium personal digital services. Digital is an accelerator of growth that is
shaping everything we do, from building deep connections to consumers with digital services and communities to
driving rapid expansion of our eCommerce business. This is all made possible because NIKE is one of the world's most
engaged brands online. It's where we connect with the consumer one to one and it's where we connect people to one
another. And we're constantly looking for new ways to seamlessly connect social platforms to commerce.
Earlier this quarter, for example, Nike Women's launched the Instagram Shop, a new tool that allows users to click a
photo and be taken directly to nike.com product pages. And just last week, we announced that we are one of the first
partners to offer curated product collections through Twitter. And there are many more exciting opportunities to come
in this space as the power of the NIKE Brand creates strong demand from consumers anytime, anywhere, on any
platform.
We deepen our relationship with consumers through services like Nike+ Run Club and Nike+ Training Club that
inspire and enable them to do more and to get better. Our Nike+ Training Club app continues to build a motivated
community of devoted athletes and now features 135 workouts and is available in 17 languages. Access through

nike.com to Nike+ Run Club training plans bring together the best NIKE expert running guidance to one place. There is
great potential here to connect more runners to the product they need to meet their goals. And in April we unveiled a
Nike Trainer's Hub that unites the global network of elite trainers to help every athlete reach their peak potential.
We connect, motivate and inspire our community of members with great products and services, because ultimately
what sets NIKE apart is our innovative product. And eCommerce is rapidly expanding our ability to serve consumers
with products for any sport all over the world.
Fiscal 2015 was a great year for nike.com. We delivered 51% revenue growth in Q4 with 55% growth for the full year.
We saw increases in both traffic and conversion, fueled by our investments in critical infrastructure to improve the
consumer experience on both desktop and mobile. As I mentioned last quarter, our traffic on mobile has exceeded
traffic on desktop, making it a very sharp point for consumer engagement going forward. I'm proud to say our
eCommerce business surpassed $1 billion in revenue this past year, a fantastic achievement from all of our teams. But
really we're just scratching the surface of our potential in this area. Global consumer spending through eCommerce
exceeds $1 trillion, a significant portion of which is done on mobile devices. Tremendous opportunity ahead for us in
eCommerce.
What I just recapped is by no means an exhaustive list, but it clearly shows how much ground this company can cover
in just one year. And while we are pleased with this year's results, at NIKE we're always moving forward. We are
relentless in our pursuit to get better, and we see opportunities that no one else can, and most importantly, we have the
resources and the talented team to deliver.
Fiscal 2016 will be no different. We have great momentum and we will continue to drive it by growing our largest
categories, such as Running, Basketball, Football, at our geographies, such as North America, Western Europe, and
China, and by unlocking the areas with the greatest potential for growth, such as women's, young athletes, and apparel,
and also by accelerating new opportunities such as breakthrough technologies and products in advanced manufacturing
and digital. We have one of the strongest brands in the world with a world of opportunities still ahead. And that's why
fiscal 2016 will be our best year yet.
Thanks, and now here's Trevor.
Trevor A. Edwards
Thanks, Mark. The NIKE Brand closed the year with a strong finish, demonstrating yet again the power of the
Category Offense to drive growth. On a constant currency basis, NIKE Brand revenue grew 13% for the quarter. For
the year, revenue was up 14%, with double-digit growth in North America, both European geographies, and China.
NIKE Brand DTC revenue was up 27% for the quarter. For the year, DTC revenue was up 29%, driven by comp store
growth of 16%, online growth of 59%, and new stores. And finally, global futures accelerated to 13%, reflecting
continued strong demand.
The success in our business is a natural outcome of putting the consumer at the center of everything we do. Our
connection with consumers strengthens our brand every day, from our own retail to wholesale partners, from in-store to
online, from digital experiences to unforgettable live events. It's those deep and authentic connections that power the
NIKE Brand around the world.
Within our Category Offense, we often talk about our Amplify strategy to compete, train, and express. Sportswear
represents the express portion of that equation where consumers express their love and passion for the game with
premium sports-inspired products. Sportswear is a key complement to the product assortment for our performance
categories, offering an opportunity to elevate the design and technical innovation in traditional sportswear styles while
also creating new ones. This drove tremendous growth for Sportswear in fiscal year 2015, which was up 20% for the
year.
Now let's turn to a few of our performance categories. First, I'll start with Running. By serving our consumers through
product innovation and consumer engagement, we drove growth in this important category with revenue up 9% for the

year to nearly $5 billion. Our premium performance footwear continues to resonate with runners, led by the Air Zoom
Pegasus 31 and the Flyknit Lunar 3 and our premium sportswear styles such as the Air Max 1 and the Roshe also
continued to drive growth.
We saw a return to growth in our core running footwear across all markets, including North America. Core running
footwear consists of our products at mid-tier price zones. This return to growth was led by core performance styles like
the Downshifter and the Winflo, which features Zoom Air technology.
As we continue to drive innovation, running apparel was once again a key growth driver, led by the continued success
of our Dri-FIT Knit tops and our Epic Lux tights. And more than ever, we are expanding our overall Running business
by inspiring new generations of runners every day. As Mark discussed, giving runners the knowledge and tools they
need through digital services has helped to create deeper, meaningful relationships. The opportunity to build new
connections with our Nike+ community are virtually unlimited, and as we add even more exclusive experiences like
special product launches and running events.
Nike Basketball, which in fiscal year 2015 grew 21% to nearly $4 billion. Our Basketball business fueled the strength
of our brand and our product innovations have never been stronger. This year, as always, we launched incredibly
innovative products for our consumers. Nike Basketball introduced great footwear such as the LeBron 12, completely
redesigned to deliver precision and explosive performance. And the Kyrie 1 the first signature shoe for this dynamic
and exciting young player. And in the Jordan brand, we introduced the Air Jordan XX9, the lightest Air Jordan
performance shoe ever. And the Superfly 3 which employed Nike Zoom technology for lightweight, durable
cushioning.
What's more, every year, Nike Basketball and the Jordan brand put on great consumer experiences and fiscal year 2015
was no exception. Standout examples include last quarter's NBA All-Star Weekend in New York and the Nike World
Basketball Festival in Spain last September was a great example. These events showcase the tremendous combined
power of the two great basketball brands, something only NIKE can offer. Nike Basketball and Jordan are driving the
kind of energy that excites current fans and brings in new ones, growing the market today and into the future.
And as Mark mentioned, our partnership with the NBA gives us tremendous opportunity to grow the sport. It's a
platform for true innovation, not just for our products, but also for the many ways we can serve our consumers. This
partnership will let us share our passion for basketball in exciting places like Rio, to Beijing, to Barcelona. The energy
around basketball is at an all-time high, and we're excited to accelerate its growth around the globe.
Finally, our Women's business continues to drive strong growth. For the year, revenue grew 20% to nearly $6 billion.
The strong growth in our Women's business is driven by the innovation and style we bring to the products that matter
most to these athletes. Key apparel styles, such as the Nike Pro Bar collection, and broad assortments of tights are
resonating strongly with consumers and create an excitement in the marketplace. In Q4 we released our biggest ever
market initiative for women called Better For It, which in just two months had totaled more than 18 million online
views. Better For It resonated with consumers because it wasn't just a campaign. It was a call to action for all athletes to
push themselves to be their best, and it was served by the global community of women who interact with NIKE and
each other every day for inspiration.
Our new women's-only door in London, along with our newly reopened Santa Monica store, exemplify the focus on
providing products and services specifically for women. We've also continued to increase the number of stores with
premium services such as bra fitting, gait analysis, and pant hemming. That success is mirrored by the strong growth in
our Women's business on nike.com, which exceeded both men and the total NIKE Brand in the quarter. All told, our
work both in-store and online is helping to drive strong growth in our overall Women's business.
Now let's talk about a few of our geographies. North America had a great quarter and another remarkable year.
Revenues were up 14% for the quarter and 12% for the year, despite the headwind from the West Coast port
congestion. Growth in the quarter was driven by nearly every key category. We saw continued strong performance
from DTC, which grew 13% in the quarter, with nike.com growing 31%. This performance was complemented by
strong executions with our wholesale partners, such as the Field House with Dick's Sporting Goods, House of Hoops

with Foot Locker, and the Track Club with the Finish Line.
In Q4, we also remained focused on working through the impact of the West Coast port congestion by diverting some
shipments to alternative ports and shipping select product via air freight. As expected, product flows began to
normalize in Q4, but we expect it will take a couple of quarters before product flow fully returns to normal. That said,
we continue to see great demand for our products in the marketplace and expect to efficiently move through the
inventory and maintain a healthy pull market.
We continue to see incredible potential for growth in North America, and the reason is simple and familiar. We remain
focused on the consumer, delivering innovative products and services through compelling retail experiences. This
allows us to expand the market while also taking market share.
Now let's turn to Western Europe, where we've seen broad-based demand with growth of 17% in the quarter and 21%
for the year. Growth in the quarter and throughout the year was fueled by our continued efforts to transform the
marketplace in line with the Category Offense. We saw strong growth across most key categories, led by Sportswear,
Running, Women's Training, and Basketball, and in the territories, particularly in AGS, that's Austria, Germany and
Switzerland, as well as in the UK and Ireland.
Our execution with our wholesale partners such as JD Sports, Foot Locker, and INTERSPORT all performed well in
the quarter as did our own DTC which had revenue growth of 39%. The momentum we've seen in fiscal year 2015 in
Western Europe combined with the strength of the NIKE Brand reinforces our view that there is tremendous growth
potential in this important geography. Our focus on the consumer will continue to build on that momentum as we head
into fiscal year 2016 and beyond.
Now let's turn to the Emerging Markets, where quarter four revenue declined 3% due in part to comparisons to strong
World Cup results last year as well as actions we are taking in Mexico and Brazil to ensure a healthy marketplace. For
the full year, revenue grew by 8%. For the quarter, we saw seven territories of the nine territories grow with six
territories growing at a double-digit rate. The NIKE Brand continues to be very strong in the Emerging Markets and our
products are resonating with consumers across all territories.
Let's take a closer look at two of these territories. In Mexico, we've been actively working to clear excess inventory
which resulted primarily from a distribution center transition in fiscal year 2014. Our brand remains very strong and
we're seeing accelerated growth in retail sell-through. As a result, we're now returning to more normalized inventory
levels as of the end of fiscal year 2015. We continue to work with our wholesale partners to ensure a healthy pull
market in Mexico, and we feel confident that the market is now well positioned for profitable growth.
In Brazil, Q4 revenue was down about 20%, reflecting comparisons to strong World Cup sales in the prior year as well
as weak macroeconomic environment. At the same time, we continue to take steps to proactively manage the supply of
product in the marketplace. The NIKE Brand remains incredibly strong in Brazil, and we continue to see tremendous
opportunity for sustainable profitable growth. To realize this opportunity, we are leveraging the Category Offense to
segment and differentiate our points of distribution. We are confident that these steps will offer our consumers more
premium and compelling retail experiences while increasing the productivity and profitability of the market for our
wholesale partners and our business.
And finally in China, where Q4 revenue grew 20%, and we posted a full year growth of 19%. Our strong growth in the
quarter was driven primarily by Running, Basketball and Sportswear. For our wholesale partners, doors that have been
re-profiled continued to outperform the rest of the fleet and in DTC, we saw a growth of 52% with continued strong
growth in our stores as well as online. In China, the NIKE Brand is incredibly strong, which provided the foundation to
reset the market in line with the Category Offense. Our strong results throughout fiscal year 2015 demonstrate that our
strategy has paid off. We returned to strong revenue growth. We've improved profitability and productivity for
ourselves and our wholesale partners. And inventory in the marketplace is healthy. Going forward, we will leverage the
momentum from fiscal year 2015 and continue to execute this consumer-led strategy to drive sustainable, profitable
growth in this key geography.

At NIKE, viewing sport through the eyes of the consumer isn't just a strategy; it's our obsession. We know what our
consumers want, and we deliver it: innovative products, personalized services, unforgettable experiences and the
inspiration to go after their biggest goals. And serving our consumers means we lead every day. Our consumer focus
ensured we'd be out in front in Q4. It ensured we'd be out in front in fiscal year 2015. And it ensures we'll be out in
front in fiscal year 2016 and beyond.

for everything. Thanks for your friendship. Over to you.
Donald W. Blair
Thank you, Trevor. FY 2015's results demonstrated our ability to deliver profitable growth even in a challenging macro
environment. We did it by focusing on the fundamentals, building deep connections with consumers and delivering
innovative products through compelling retail experiences. At the same time, we leveraged our global portfolio to
manage risk while continuing to invest for future growth and profitability. Our ability to use all the levers in our
business to drive growth and manage risk is one of our greatest advantages. And it's why we're confident in our ability
to continue to deliver shareholder value on into the future.
So on to the details for Q4 and FY 2015. Q4 revenue for NIKE, Inc. increased 5%, up 13% on a currency-neutral basis.
For the full year, NIKE, Inc. revenue increased 10% to $30.6 billion. On a currency-neutral basis, both NIKE, Inc., and
the NIKE Brand grew 14% while Converse grew 21%. Growth in the NIKE Brand was broad-based across categories
and driven by continued strong performance in three of our largest geographies, North America, Western Europe and
China.
Also on a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand futures orders grew 13%, driven by a 5% increase in average selling
price and an 8% increase in units. The growth reflects continued strong demand across the NIKE Brand portfolio, led
by double-digit growth in North America, Western Europe and China. On a reported basis, futures grew 2%, reflecting
weaker international currencies, particularly the euro, ruble, reais and yen.
Fourth quarter diluted EPS increased 26% to $0.98 and full year diluted EPS rose 25% to $3.70, driven by revenue
growth, gross margin expansion and a lower tax rate, partially offset by higher SG&A investments. The effects of FX
on the quarter and the year were fairly modest, as the negative impact of the stronger dollar was largely offset by our
FX risk management. Gross margin expanded 60 basis points in Q4 and 120 basis points for the full year. For both the
quarter and the full year, margin expansion was primarily driven by higher average selling prices and continued growth
in our higher margin DTC business, partially offset by higher cost of goods due to labor inflation and higher logistics
costs.
Fourth quarter demand creation was 7% below the prior-year quarter, which included significant World Cup related
expenses. For the full year, demand creation increased 6%, driven by support for key events and product launches,
DTC, and investments in sports marketing. Operating overhead increased 13% for the quarter and 16% for the full year.
This reflected growth in our higher gross margin, higher-cost DTC business as well as investments in operational
infrastructure and digital, including consumer engagement.
The effective tax rate for FY 2015 was 22.2%, lower than last year's 24% rate, primarily due to favorable resolution of
tax audits across multiple jurisdictions. The rate was significantly lower in Q4, primarily due to adjustments to reduce
tax expense recognized in interim quarters of FY 2015 on intercompany transactions.
We continued to deliver strong returns on capital, as FY 2015 ROIC reached 28.1%, up 360 basis points from the prior
year. For the year, we returned $3.4 billion in cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. As
of May 31, inventories were up 10%, primarily driven by business growth and the impact of port congestion in North
America. As we discussed last quarter, we anticipate the flow of product in North America to return to normal in the

first half of FY 2016. We expect inventory levels to be somewhat elevated for the next several quarters as we work to
rebalance supply and demand in the market.
Now let's look at our performance by segment. North America delivered another remarkable year as FY 2015 revenue
grew 12% to $13.7 billion, the fifth consecutive year of double-digit revenue growth. Growth for the year was driven
by higher revenues in nearly every key category, led by double digit growth in Basketball, Sportswear and Women's
Training. The growth also reflected strength in both sales to wholesale customers and DTC. Sustained broad-based
growth at this level in a market as developed as North America demonstrates both the tremendous strength of the NIKE
Brand and the effectiveness of the Category Offense in expanding both the market and our market share. North
America EBIT grew 18% for the full year, driven by strong revenue growth and gross margin expansion.
Western Europe also had a great year as FY 2015 revenue reached $5.7 billion, up 15% despite the weakness of the
euro. On a currency-neutral basis, revenue grew 21% for FY 2015 as every territory grew and we posted double-digit
growth in every key category except Golf and Global Football, which grew at a high single-digit rate despite tough
comparisons against the World Cup last year. Western Europe EBIT increased 49% in FY 2015, driven by revenue
growth, gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.
In Central and Eastern Europe, FY 2015 revenue grew 15% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by growth in every
territory except Israel and every key category except Action Sports and Global Football, which declined at a low
single-digit rate, reflecting comparisons to last year's World Cup. On a reported basis, FY 2015 revenue for CEE grew
2% and EBIT declined 11%, largely reflecting significantly weaker currencies, especially the ruble.
In FY 2015, China returned to strong profitable growth as revenues topped $3 billion, up 18% for the year. On a
currency-neutral basis, FY 2015 revenue grew 19%, driven by the ongoing strength of the brand, a more focused
category assortment tailored for China, and new retail formats including nike.com. In addition to driving revenue
growth, we've sharply reduced inventory levels in the market and significantly increased the productivity and
profitability of retail for NIKE and our wholesale partners. FY 2015 EBIT for China grew 22% due to strong revenue
growth and expanding gross margins.
In Japan, currency-neutral revenue grew 9% for the year and 19% for the quarter, driven by strong growth in
Sportswear, Basketball and Running. Reported results in Japan were significantly reduced by the weaker yen as FY
2015 revenue declined 2% and EBIT fell 24%. In our Emerging Markets geography, results were mixed. On a
currency-neutral basis, FY 2015 revenue increased 8% but Q4 revenue fell 3%. Nearly every key category grew for the
year and the quarter. Sportswear, Running and Basketball led the growth for the year while Global Football declined
for both periods as we lapped strong sales in advance of last year's World Cup. For the year and the quarter, we posted
strong currency-neutral revenue growth in most territories, led by [ph] SOCO (39:29), Pacific, Korea and Southeast
Asia, while revenues in Mexico and Brazil declined for both periods.
As Trevor discussed, we're clearing the excess inventory in Mexico and feel confident the market is now positioned for
profitable growth. In Brazil, a weakening macroeconomic environment and changes in the retail marketplace have led
to a slowdown in our business. In response, we're taking strong steps to tighten the supply of products as we work to
re-profile the marketplace along the lines of the Category Offense. We're confident we're taking the right actions now
to position this market for renewed growth. FY 2015 reported growth for our Emerging Markets geography was
affected by both the marketplace actions we've taken in Mexico and Brazil as well as significant currency headwinds
across the region. On a reported basis, FY 2015 revenue decreased 1% and EBIT decreased 14%, reflecting lower gross
margins and SG&A deleverage.
Converse continues to deliver strong growth, as FY 2015 revenues reached nearly $2 billion, up 21% on a constant
currency basis. The growth was driven by the conversion of several European markets to direct distribution and
ongoing strength in the United States. On a reported basis, revenue grew 18% for the year, but only 6% for the quarter,
as we shifted customer shipments to Q3 in advance of a systems implementation. EBIT increased 4% for the year, but
declined 15% for the fourth quarter, as revenue growth was offset by SG&A investments in market transitions and
Converse IP enforcement as well as new systems and infrastructure.

In FY 2015, NIKE, Inc. delivered strong growth, and we had great momentum across the portfolio. Our FY 2016
guidance reflects that momentum as well as continued investment in our growth strategies and operational capabilities.
While currency markets remain volatile, our growth rate expectations for FY 2016 are largely unchanged from what we
shared last quarter, even though we delivered stronger performance in FY 2015 than we expected 90 days ago.
Specifically, for FY 2016, we expect reported revenue growth in a mid-single-digit rate reflecting low double-digit
growth on a currency-neutral basis, partially offset by the impact of the stronger dollar. For Q1, we expect low
single-digit reported revenue growth, roughly in line with reported futures growth, as FX comparisons are more
challenging in the first half of the fiscal year.
We expect gross margin for Q1 and the full year to expand by about 50 basis points, driven by higher average selling
prices and rapid growth in our DTC business, including nike.com. We also expect to see some benefit from lower oil
prices. However, these upsides will be partially offset by ongoing labor cost inflation, higher prices for some raw
materials, and FX headwinds. For SG&A, including both demand creation and operating overhead, we expect full year
growth at a mid-single-digit rate. For Q1, we expect growth slightly lower than the full year rate as we anniversary
World Cup investments in the first quarter of FY 2015.
We anticipate other income will have a more meaningful impact on our FY 2016 results than we've seen historically, as
a portion of our expected FX hedge gains will be reported in this line item. We currently expect other income will be
approximately $50 million for each quarter. For FY 2016, we expect the effective tax rate will be approximately 24%.
Before I open the call to questions, I'd like to share a few reflections on my nearly 16 years with NIKE. First, I'd like to
thank Mark and Trevor for their kind words today as well as their support and partnership over the years. It's been a
privilege to work closely with you both as well as the rest of the tremendously talented leadership team that has led and
will continue to lead NIKE into the future.
I'm incredibly proud of the results we've delivered and the value we've created for our shareholders. The company
today is stronger, more diversified, more profitable and better positioned to drive growth than at any time in our
history. Our brands are deeply connected with consumers around the world. We're delivering unmatched innovation
and we've become highly effective at creating compelling retail experiences online and in-store, across wholesale and
DTC.
We're better operators than we've ever been, and our people are the most talented in the industry. That's why I know
NIKE will continue to drive profitable growth and shareholder value for years to come.
Finally, I would like to congratulate Andy on his promotion to the CFO role. I've worked closely with him over the last
eight years and I have great confidence in his ability to help lead the company toward its full potential. Andy is a
strategic leader with a clear passion for our brands, our business, and most importantly, delivering strong results for our
shareholders. And he'll be supported by the finest team of financial executives I know. While it won't be easy to depart
at the end of October, I know I leave the company and the finance function in good shape and in good hands.
Thank you, and now we'd like to open it up for questions.

<Q - Bob S. Drbul>: Hi. Don, congratulations. Thanks for everything. Best of luck.
<A - Donald W. Blair>: Thanks Bob.
<Q - Bob S. Drbul>: I guess the question that I have is on the Running category. I just wondered if we could just have
a little bit more of a discussion around, the core, I think it has gotten better but just an update on the competitive set and
sort of how you guys are feeling about that category as we look forward?
<A - Trevor A. Edwards>: Yes, Bob. Actually I feel very good about the Running category. For the year, the Running
category actually grew 9%. And what we saw certainly in the fourth quarter, we saw actually strong double-digit
growth in most of our geographies from North America to Europe to China. And what we are doing very well is we are
connecting very well with runners in the marketplace. So we continue to feel very confident about the business and at
the same time, what we have seen is a strengthening of the core as we discussed, which is really about the mid price tier
zone. And what we've done there is certainly we've gone in and zoned in and we always talk about diving in deeper.
That's a great example. We've gone in deeper and focused on that.
At the same time, I feel very confident about the innovation that is coming and will – that has been delivered and
continues to be in the pipeline for Running. So overall, I'm very confident about the Running business. There's always
room for opportunity and more growth, and obviously for us to continue to excite our consumers, but I certainly feel
positive about it.
<A - Mark G. Parker>: I'm just going to jump in, too, and I want to shout out NIKE Running apparel as well, which
has had an incredible run this past year and that momentum continues into fiscal 2016. And as I said before, I was
sitting through the innovation – category-based innovation meetings recently and our innovation pipeline for Running
leading up to Rio is incredibly strong. So very bullish on that core category for NIKE.
<Q - Bob S. Drbul>: Great. And I guess could you elaborate a little bit on my second question it would be on the
NBA, the deal that you struck with the NBA. And I was wondering maybe we can just put Don on the spot and he
could give us his pick for the number one spot tonight?
<A - Donald W. Blair>: Well, it's not going to be my hometown Sixers I don't think. Well, first of all, I'm going to
jump in on the NBA. Very, very excited about our partnership with the NBA. As you know, there's great energy in the
sport globally. We have very progressive leadership under Adam Silver, really strong leadership there. Adam and his
team, the owners have an appetite to really innovate and advance the game, which is perfect for us. We're thrilled to be
a part of that. We have three incredible brands that can play in this space, of course NIKE, Jordan and Converse. We
have on-court brand exposure head to toe for the first time, and that's across the NBA, the WNBA, the All-Star game,
the D-League. It's going to be a great opportunity to showcase our leadership in this critical category for us, not just
here in the U.S. but globally.
<Q - Bob S. Drbul>: Great. Thank you very much.

The next question is from Kate McShane with Citi.
<Q - Katharine McShane>: Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon.
<A - Mark G. Parker>: Hey, Kate.
<Q - Katharine McShane>: My question, my first question is on gross margins. In fiscal year 2016, the guidance that
you gave today, can you give us an idea on just overall manufacturing costs and how they are coming into play into
cost of goods sold, just given all the initiatives you have with automation in Flyknit and everything else?
<A - Donald W. Blair>: Sure. Well, we are starting to see some benefits out of that program, and as you know, we've
been on a long journey of working with our factory partners to improve costs in the factory system and maintain the

innovation and the quality of our products. So we've been doing things that are more evolutionary like lean
manufacturing, and just factory efficiency types of initiatives with them all the way to breakthrough things like Flyknit.
So we've been getting benefits for quite some time. We are starting to see some of the newer technologies coming on
stream now, and so that's a part of the equation for FY 2016. At this stage there's lots of other factors. There are some
headwinds out there, of course, with labor inflation and FX, but on the flipside, we've done a pretty consistent job of
raising average gross selling prices. Our DTC business of course is accretive. So overall on margin, we're pretty
confident we can keep moving margin forward.
<Q - Katharine McShane>: That's great. Thank you. And then my second question is on SG&A going, again on your
guidance, they have mid single-digit growth for fiscal year 2016. I know fiscal year 2016 has at least one quarter of
Olympic spend or more because we're entering into an Olympic year. So can you help us understand better how we
should think about demand creation and corporate overhead and the breakdown of that for fiscal year 2016?
<A - Donald W. Blair>: Well, I don't want to get into too much granularity here, because we don't normally provide
that level of granularity. And as we've talked about in the last couple of calls, Kate, there's really been an evolution of
how we think about consumer engagement. And in today's world, where so much of our marketing is digital, we are
investing quite a bit in digital consumer engagement and a lot of those costs fall into our operating overhead lines. So
there's been a little bit of a blurring of the nature of those costs. Obviously from an accounting standpoint, there's still
clarity of it, but from a business standpoint, a lot of the things that we use to drive our business and consumer
engagement is actually falling into the operating overhead lines.
<Q - Katharine McShane>: Okay. Thank you, and, Don, best of luck.
<A - Donald W. Blair>: Thank you.

The next question is from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI.
<Q - Omar Saad>: Thanks. Great job, guys, this quarter.
<A - Donald W. Blair>: Thanks, Omar.
<A - Mark G. Parker>: Thank you.
<Q - Omar Saad>: I wanted to ask a question about, kind of on the topic of the geographic evolution of the supply
chain. There was a pretty important vote through the Senate yesterday, and I know you guys have made some
comments publicly, maybe about some manufacturing eventually coming back. But, how do you think about some of
these recent developments, legislative developments, and your overall supply chain as you look out in the coming years
and the potential to even bring, put some production into the U.S. and North America?
<A - Mark G. Parker>: Yeah, well, first of all, the passing of the TPA was obviously an important step toward what
we hope is the final approval of TPP. And as we've said before, as you know, this will help us to accelerate the work
that we're doing with advanced manufacturing, will help us expand our business overall. I think certainly, give us an
opportunity to build local manufacturing here in the United States to put us closer to market, advance some of the
innovation, particularly in the area of customization. We are in the middle, Don had mentioned this briefly, but scaling
our advanced manufacturing initiatives, which we've really been working on over the past three years or four years, so
you're going to start to see those scale.
But the opportunity to get some, translate some duty relief into investing in our advanced manufacturing supply chain
efforts here in the United States is going to be significant we hope. I mean that's our goal. So the idea is that, that will
accelerate and we'll see some real benefits from that. I think you're going to see the overall supply chain geographically
shift a bit here and there with the advancements of new manufacturing innovation that is a major priority for NIKE. It
will give us the flexibility to create more localized manufacturing over time. And that will put us closer to market and
again, allow us to advance product particularly in the customization area and to meet more local demand, as well.

<A - Donald W. Blair>: The point I would make, too, Omar, is we are really encouraged by the passage of TPA. We
still have a little bit of a ways to go from a timing standpoint to see TPP taken up by the Congress, and then of course,
once it were implemented, it would take some time for those duty changes to be phased in.
<Q - Omar Saad>: Absolutely. And is the right way to think about it, any sort of potential duty savings kind of being
reinvested back into the supply chain or other areas of the business? Or is it more of a sustainable kind of opportunity
on the margin line?
<A - Donald W. Blair>: I think it's way too early to say on that.

The next question is from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.
<Q - Matthew Robert Boss>: Hey. Congrats on a great quarter, guys.
<A - Donald W. Blair>: Thank you.
<Q - Matthew Robert Boss>: So just to kind of look ahead and put things together, if top line growth remains at least
high single digits and then you take the combination of Europe and China margin recapture and some increased scale
with both eCommerce and Flyknit, is there anything structurally – I guess my question, is there anything structurally
preventing a high teens operating margin longer term at NIKE?
<A - Donald W. Blair>: Well, as you know, our model has said that we believe we can grow our top line at a high
single-digit rate, that we will expand our profit margins and over time, we aim to deliver mid-teens EPS growth. So that
is our goal. And what that would imply is that we are going to be expanding margins over time. The speed at which that
happens is always a function of lots of different variables. We are really excited about the strength of our business at
this point and think we're delivering some fantastic results, as you can see from what we reported today. We obviously
have a macroeconomic environment we're dealing with. So we believe we can expand the profitability of the business
over the long haul. How that plays out over given fiscal years and quarters is a subject of a lot of different variables.
<Q - Matthew Robert Boss>: That's great. And then could you just speak to the composition of the order book in
terms of the frontend versus backend and also, the breakdown between pricing and unit growth?
<A - Donald W. Blair>: Well, the front half/back half, it's slightly stronger in the second quarter than in the first
quarter on the futures, and that's both a function of a slight acceleration in the back half of the window as well as
slightly easier foreign exchange comparisons in the second quarter. So on a reported basis, a little faster in the second
half of the window.
<A - Kelley Hall>: Matthew, the average selling price is up 5% and average increase in units is 8%. That gets you to
the 13% currency-neutral futures orders.
<Q - Matthew Robert Boss>: That's great. Best of luck, guys.

The next question is from Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Lindsay B. Drucker Mann>: Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone.
<A - Donald W. Blair>: Hi.
<Q - Lindsay B. Drucker Mann>: On the North – I wanted to ask a couple of questions on North America. First, I
was hoping you could give a little bit more detail on your Women's business in North America, maybe an update on
some of the moves you've made in distribution. I know you had a Nike Training Club shop-in-shop in Macy's and
perhaps in some of your other retail partners and then also some of the stores. Can you just tell us where you are with
that and what we should be expecting for the next fiscal year? And maybe quantify any metrics around how well those
openings are doing. Thanks.
<A - Trevor A. Edwards>: Okay. I'll maybe just kick it off this way and maybe just start at the top and just continue
to reinforce. What we certainly are seeing in our Women's business is just tremendous growth. And so we saw,
obviously, 20% growth for the year, and which brings us to about $6 billion. So one of the reasons we feel we've been
able to drive the growth is because we're putting the pieces together, this aspect of being able to communicate very well
with her, at the same time, making sure that the products that we're bringing to the market are really, really strong. And
so I think I've talked a few times about this aspect of bringing innovation and style together, which is really working for
us.
And then certainly, as you sort of step down into the distribution, we're certainly working with our partners to continue
to roll out shop-in-shops in many of the locations that you mentioned. But nike.com has certainly been one of the really
great hallmarks for us because we've seen our ability to really invite the consumer in through our communications,
importantly, engage her, certainly with the NTC app and things that we're doing there and then serve her very
specifically online. And that business is growing at a much faster rate, faster than our Men's business online and faster
than the total brand online. So we believe that that really is providing a great window of opportunity for what we think
is just going to continue to be great growth there.
<Q - Lindsay B. Drucker Mann>: Great. The next thing I wanted to ask was on North American margins were really
solid in the quarter even though you were dealing with some inventory backup from the West Coast port congestion, so
I was wondering if we should be expecting deteriorating margin performance across the year as you work through some
of that inventory or, and Trevor, you sounded pretty optimistic about how healthy the market was. So maybe it'll be a
nonissue. Just some clarification around that. Thank you.
<A - Donald W. Blair>: Well, as I said in the prepared remarks, and Trevor said this as well, that we feel very
confident that we're going to be working through that inventory in a way that's brand accretive and is not going to be
problematic from a profitability standpoint. Again, not trying to get to any specific prediction of a percentage on one of
the geographies. North America has done a phenomenal job over the last few years of building profitability. They have
a very well-developed network of factory stores; they manage that marketplace very well. So we're confident that we're
going to work our way through that inventory in a constructive way.
<Q - Lindsay B. Drucker Mann>: Great. Thanks so much.
<A - Kelley Hall>: Operator, we have time for one more question.

The last question is from Robby Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

<Q - Robert F. Ohmes>: Two questions. Just first on Western Europe, and I guess maybe Europe overall, how much
further do you think the Category Offense has to go? And I think DTC I think you guys said it was up 39% in Europe.
How much of that is driven by new store openings versus dot-com? Just how are you getting that great growth in
Europe?
<A - Trevor A. Edwards>: Yeah, as we've sort of talked about before, one of the things that we really feel confident
about is that the Category Offense is really providing us the opportunity to continue to uncover and unlock more
growth in the marketplace. And certainly what we've seen take place is the brand is very, very strong in Western
Europe. We're seeing really growth across the different territories. Obviously we spoke about AGS as well as in the UK
and Ireland. And our partnerships that we're doing with our wholesale partners, whether it's JD Sports, Foot Locker and
INTERSPORT, are continuing to drive that.
Our dot-com business in Western Europe is also growing at an accelerated pace. So what is driving the numbers in the
DTC primarily would be the dot-com growth. That's growing at certainly a faster rate than the overall business. But our
ability to drive more conversion in the stores where we currently exist still is taking place. So we've been able to
increase the sell-through within our own doors as we've always talked about. That learning, we then take that to our
wholesale partners, and that's really helping to drive the overall growth in the marketplace. So we continue to feel very
confident about the growth. Again, I won't say that it will go on forever, but certainly we see a lot of runway for quite
some time.
<A - Mark G. Parker>: I just want to add that the growth and the strength of NIKE in Western Europe is sort of a
smaller example of what we often refer to as our complete offense. So we're seeing really strong broad-based growth
across the various countries, across Europe, across the categories, across both DTC and wholesale. So it's a very
healthy broad-based complete offense from a brand strength and a growth standpoint. And the brand, by the way, based
on recent surveys, this seem to be the number one favorite sports brand in 10 of the key Western European cities. So
that's all good news for us.
<Q - Robert F. Ohmes>: That sounds great. And just my last question, I guess for Trevor. Trevor, when you think
about the success of shoes like the Downshifter and Winflo in the mid-tier, how do you think about how successful
those shoes can become without cannibalizing some of the higher price point sneaker styles that you guys are already
hugely successful in?
<A - Trevor A. Edwards>: Yeah, I would say that obviously Mark always talks about the complete offense, and that is
really what we're ensuring that we're doing. We're making sure that we look at certainly our Running business or the
opportunity certainly from the premium segment and making sure that we're driving that. The important opportunity
around what we described as core, which is the mid-tier price zones. But also our Sportswear business provides another
opportunity for us to continue to really come at the market from a holistic perspective. So we believe that there is still
more growth in the marketplace, and we're able to continue to take share, but by growing the market altogether. So we
feel very confident about that strategy, and we continue to bring innovation amongst all those dimensions.
<Q - Robert F. Ohmes>: Great. Thanks very much, guys.
<A - Mark G. Parker>: Thanks Robby.
Kelley Hall
Thanks Robby. Before we end the call today, I'd also, on behalf of the finance function, like to thank Don for his
leadership over the years and his mentorship to me personally, and to welcome Andy as the new leader of our function.
So thank you, Don.
With that, we'll go ahead and end the call. Thank you all for joining us, and we'll talk to you in Q1.
