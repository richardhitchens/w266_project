MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day and welcome to the Texas Instruments Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, I
would like to turn the conference over to Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir.
David Pahl
Thank you and good afternoon, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. As usual,
Kevin Marks, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on
our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A
replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to
differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding
forward-looking statements contained in the earning release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for
a more complete description.
I'll start with a quick summary. Revenue and earnings per share for the quarter were slightly above our expected range.
Compared with the year ago, demand for our products continued to be strong in the automotive market and strength in
the industrial market. Demand in the personal electronics market was about even from a year ago.
In our core businesses, Embedded Processing revenue grew 10% and Analog revenue grew 6% compared with the
same quarter a year ago. Operating margins increased in both businesses. Earnings per share were $0.94. With that
backdrop, Kevin and I will move on to the details of our performance, which we believe continues to be representative

of the ongoing strength of our business model.
In the third quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially
on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing
12 month period was $3.9 billion, up 8% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 29.5% of revenue, up from
27.5% a year ago. We continue to benefit from our improved product portfolio and the efficiency of our manufacturing
strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300 millimeter analog output and the opportunistic purchase of assets
ahead of demand.
We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to
shareholders. For the trailing 12 month period, we returned $3.8 billion of cash to investors through a combination of
dividends and stock repurchases. Also today, we announced a 32% dividend increase that Kevin will provide more
detail on in a moment.
From a year ago, Analog revenue grew 6% due to high performance analog, Silicon Valley Analog, and power
management. High volume analog and logic was about even. Embedded Processing revenue increased by 10% from a
year ago due to growth in all three product lines led by processors. In our Other segment, revenue grew 7% from a year
ago, primarily due to calculators and DLP products, and was partially offset by decreases in royalties and custom ASIC
products.
Now I'll provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end market versus a year ago. Automotive
demand remains strong with most sectors growing double digits. Industrial demand improved and had broad-based
growth with most sectors growing. Personal electronics was about even despite continued year over year decline in
demand from one customer. This decline was offset by growth elsewhere. Communications equipment grew from a
year ago and was even sequentially. And lastly, enterprise systems grew.
We continue to focus on making our company stronger through manufacturing and technology, the breadth of our
product portfolio, the reach of our market channels and our diverse and long-lived positions. These four attributes taken
together are at the core of what puts TI in a unique class of companies capable of long-term free cash flow growth.
Kevin will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook.
Kevin P. March
Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon everyone. Gross profit in the quarter of $2.28 billion was 62.0% of revenue. From a
year ago, gross profit margin increased 380 basis points primarily due to lower manufacturing costs. Operating
expenses were $804 million or 21.9% of revenue. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.33 billion in R&D, an
important element of our capital allocation. Acquisition charges were $80 million, all of which were the ongoing
amortization of intangibles which is a non-cash expense.
Operating profit was $1.40 billion or 38.0% of revenue. Operating profit was up 20% from the year-ago quarter.
Operating margin for Analog was 40.9% and for Embedded Processing was 27.7%. Our focused investments on the
best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enabled both businesses to continue to contribute
nicely to free cash flow growth. Net income in the third quarter was $968 million or $0.94 per share.
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations
was $1.41 billion in the quarter. Inventory days were 117, consistent with our long-term model of 105 to 135 days.
Capital expenditures were $139 million in the quarter. On a trailing 12 month basis, cash flow from operations was
$4.46 billion, up 8% from the same period a year ago. Trailing 12 month capital expenditures were $585 million or 4%
of revenue.
As a reminder, our long-term expectation is for capital expenditures, including the expansion of our 300 millimeter
analog capacity, to be about 4% of revenue. Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $3.87 billion, or 29.5% of
revenue. Free cash flow was 8% higher than a year ago. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model.

As we've said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing
shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to
shareholders. Our intent over time remains to return all of our free cash flow plus any proceeds we receive from the
exercise of equity compensation minus net debt requirements.
Consistent with this intent, we have announced a 32% or $0.12 increase in our quarterly dividend. This brings our
quarterly dividend to $0.50 per share or $2 annualized. I will also note that we have updated our long-term dividend
model from our prior target of about 50% of trailing four year average free cash flow to a range of 50% to 80%. This
new range provides a more robust framework to adjust the allocation of our shareholder returns between dividend
growth and share repurchases. Today's announcement extends our string of dividend increases to 13 consecutive years,
which we believe are an important element of shareholder returns.
In the third quarter, we paid $382 million in dividends and repurchased $500 million of our stock for a total return of
$882 million. Total cash returned to shareholders in the past 12 months was $3.82 billion. Outstanding share count was
reduced by 2% over the past 12 months and by 42% since the end of 2004 when we initiated a program designed to
reduce our share count. These combined returns demonstrate our confidence in our business model and our
commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders.
Fundamental to our commitment to return cash are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the third quarter
with $3.14 billion of cash and short-term investments with our U.S. entities owning about 80% of our cash. This
onshore cash is readily available for a variety of uses.
Our orders in the quarter were $3.64 billion, up 6% from a year ago.
Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $3.17 billion to $3.43 billion and
earnings per share to be in the range of $0.76 to $0.86. Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2016 is
unchanged at about 30%, and this is the tax rate you should use for the fourth quarter and for the year.
So in summary, we believe are third quarter results continue to demonstrate the strength of our business model. With
that, let me turn it back to Dave.
David Pahl
Thanks, Kevin. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible
an opportunity to ask a question, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an
opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we do have our first question from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.
<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: Hi, guys. Thanks for take my questions. First I wanted to ask about OpEx. It was roughly
flat quarter over quarter, R&D op, and you talked about increasing R&D investments. Given that, what are your
expectations for R&D in total OpEx as we go into Q4? I know seasonally they would be down, but given the increases
that we're seeing in R&D, how should we think about OpEx going into next quarter?
<A - Kevin P. March>: So, Stacy, I think as we've talked about R&D, we'll continue to reallocate through the first half
of next year resources from other areas in the company into R&D. But overall, you should think about OpEx in 4Q
pretty much being the same as you have seen in each of the last several years. And that is down, because we have the
seasonal benefit there just from the fact that there's going to be Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays going on. So total
OpEx should continue to be seasonally down.

<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: Yes. Thank you. For my follow-up, I wanted to ask about the change in strategy between
– or apparent change in strategy between dividends and buybacks. Does that imply, I mean what does that imply in
terms of how you see the current return on your own stock versus the potential for at least how you view the stability
and strength of your business model going forward? Seems like you're allocating more into dividends now.
<A - Kevin P. March>: Well, and that is correct. We are planning to allocate more towards the dividends at this point
in time. We've always said that buybacks will vary as a function of the stock price, and a dividend model that can vary
from 50% to 80%, we believe is a more thorough comprehensive on capital allocation. This new model provides a
more robust framework to adjust the allocation of our shareholder returns between dividend growth and share
repurchases. And that's really what we're talking about here.
<A - David Pahl>: Okay. Great. Thank you, Stacy, and next caller, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore.
<Q - C.J. Muse>: Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for take my question. I guess first question on the Analog op
margin side, I believe record levels for you, 40%-plus here. I think the highest I have seen out there is high 40s at
Linear. Curious, do you think that you could achieve that over time and as part of that thought process, what percentage
of your mix would have to be on 300 millimeter to get to get that kind of level?
<A - Kevin P. March>: C.J., the possibility for improving margins in Analog are not anything that we would hold
back your expectation on, because you've actually hit the essence of the formula there. And that is as we have more and
more revenue being generated on 300 millimeter, well, we enjoy significant cost benefit versus any of our competitors.
We'll see that just falling straight through not just to margin but all the way through to free cash flow, which is most
important in our mind. So, clearly, as you pointed out, this has been a new high for our Analog segment and that
business still has plenty of runway underneath as we go forward.
<A - David Pahl>: Yeah, and I'd just add, C.J., that when you look at our practice of buying capacity well ahead of
demand, that puts us in a place of at the end of last year we had about $6 billion of open 300-millimeter capacity. So as
revenue grows, if that was 200-millimeter capacity, that will help to grow free cash flow margin as well as operating
margins in the businesses that use them. So the fact that it's 300-millimeter of course, and the fact that it's a 40% lower
cost will certainly help us as well. Did you have a follow up, C.J.?
<Q - C.J. Muse>: I do. A shorter-term question. As you look to your implied guide of down 10%, and I know typical
seasonality is kind of thrown out the door here, but I guess in the last five years your average is roughly down 7%. So is
there any one-time issues here? Customer concentration? Conservatism? How should we think about that?
<A - David Pahl>: Yeah, I think if you look at the midpoint of the guidance, C.J., it would suggest a year on year
growth of about 3%. So I think in general, we just believe that's just very consistent with the modest overall macro
environment and that's really kind of been the case for the last few years. So our view really remains that we're in this
slow growth economic environment. We don't really see any catalyst that's really going to change that one direction or
the other anytime soon. So thank you, and we'll go to the next caller, please.
Operator
Our next caller is Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Toshiya Hari>: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. My first question is on the demand environment. I was
hoping you could provide a little bit more detail on the different buckets within TI, industrial, personal electronics,
comms equipment and automotive, specifically what sort of trends you saw in the quarter. And more importantly, what
your external expectations are heading into Q4.

<A - David Pahl>: Okay. So let me just talk about what drove the quarter. As I mentioned before, the automotive
market remained strong. We've got five sectors inside of that market and most of them had grown double digits.
Industrial demand improved and an encouraging part of that was it was very, very broad based and we had most of the
sectors growing. Inside of personal electronics, that was even and that was despite continued year over year declines in
demand from one customer.
But I think just speaking to the diversity of our product portfolio and our customer base, we were able to offset that
with growth elsewhere inside of personal electronics. And then communications equipment grew from a year ago. It
was even sequentially. So, and lastly, we did see growth in enterprise systems as well. So when we look into the fourth
quarter, we'll call out anything that is moving around significantly. You've seen us do that the past when we've had
some type of discontinuity to help explain the results and that's not the case as we move into fourth quarter. So do you
have a follow up, Toshi?
<Q - Toshiya Hari>: Yeah, I do. Thanks for that. So my second question is on M&A. Clearly TI's been very
disciplined, especially with regards to valuation over the past couple of years, maybe even several years. Obviously
you've seen a lot of activity elsewhere in the industry. So just I was just hoping you could provide an update on as to
how you approach M&A these days. Thank you.
<A - Kevin P. March>: Yeah Toshi, our approach to M&A is really no different than we've talked about in the past.
There are really four attributes that we think that we have that put us in a pretty unique position versus our competitors,
and it's actually quite difficult for others to duplicate. Those include our approach to manufacturing technology, the
breadth of our product portfolio, our reach to our market channels and the diversity in all the positions that our products
enjoy in the marketplace.
So when we look at the acquisitions, it's about trying to see if we can strengthen those four attributes and really it starts
out by looking at companies from the standpoint of their strategic match. And that means will that strategic match
leverage the strength and competitive advantages we've been building on for these last number of years. So from a
strategic standpoint, that would probably include a company that's likely engaged in analog and probably has pretty
good exposure to industrial and automotive, which is where we believe most of the growth [indiscernible] are going to
happen for quite a few years to come.
If a potential target passes the strategy test, then we've got to get past the numbers test, and that really means the price
that we pay for it. Will the return on that price, will the return on that investment in capital exceed our weighted
average cost of capital in about a four-year timeframe? If we can't get all that to work, then we will remain disciplined
and just stay on the sidelines. As we look at what's been going on in the M&A landscape these last couple years, it
strikes us that there are probably really two things underway for most participants in that space. They're either trying to
increase their scale or broaden their market opportunities because they have fairly narrow markets. In our case, we
already enjoy advantages in both of those, so we don't feel compelled to have to move unless we can pass that strategy
and math test I just talk about a moment ago.
<A - David Pahl>: Okay. Thank you, Toshiya, and we'll go to the next caller please.
Operator
We have Chris Danely with Citi.
<Q - Christopher Brett Danely>: Hey. Thanks guys. I guess one more question on the Q4 revenue guidance. I'm just
looking at the results of the last 10 or so years, and it's only been down double digits I think once in eight years or
something like that. And I remember last year you guys guided down 7% sequentially. So did anything, has anything
changed recently? Have you seen any change in order rates, any change in the end markets, change in linearity, change
in anything? I'm just wondering why the down 10%.
<A - David Pahl>: Yeah again, Chris, no big changes on that. I think it's just consistency with the overall macro. And
if you look over the last five years, we've had a range from as high as down 1.3% back in 2012; I think we were down

12.1%. So certainly our range that we've given is certainly inside of those things from a sequential standpoint. So that's
kind of how we're looking at it. Do you have a follow on?
<Q - Christopher Brett Danely>: Yes. Can you just talk about utilization rates? How much below capacity you guys
are, and where we should expect utilization rates to trend in Q4. And how you feel about inventory as a result of that.
<A - Kevin P. March>: So, Chris, on utilization. It really hasn't changed much over the last three or four quarters. And
I don't expect it to change anytime in the near term. We load the factories in accordance with our expectation of
demand, and because of our inventory strategies, sometimes that demand just goes beyond just next quarter and may
include the following quarter.
From an inventory standpoint, you recall that our model is to have 105 to 135 days. We had quite a bit more inventory
last quarter and from a days standpoint, and we had mentioned then that we had built that anticipation of growing
revenues in the third quarter. We have had those growing revenues and our inventory days dropped down to 117. So I
expect that we'll continue to operate within the model days that we talk about and our utilizations will continue to be
relatively stable as we've seen the last three or four quarters.
<Q - Christopher Brett Danely>: Great. Thank you, Chris. Next caller, please.
Operator
Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Joseph Moore>: Great. Thank you. I have one short-term question and one long-term question. In the shorter
term, you said personal electronics kind of flat year over year despite declines at one customer. Can you give us a sense
for which areas are growing year over year? Is it other, is it smartphone, is it PC? What are the growth components of
that business right now?
<A - David Pahl>: Yes, at that level, we've had PCs come in year over year about even, which is a improvement from
what we saw. I think that outside of that one customer we've actually seen really broad based growth. And so I think
that all the classical areas inside of personal electronics are doing well. So you have a follow-on?
<Q - Joseph Moore>: Sure. Thank you. And then yes, on the longer-term side, as you look at your automotive
business, obviously that's a focus for you guys. Can you talk a little bit about how do you plan for that business? And
how much of your effort is aimed at traditional building block catalogue type products? And how, when you think
about markets like autonomous driving where there might be sort of systems-level solutions, how much are you
thinking about the sort of need to do something that's a little bit more revolutionary rather than evolutionary in that part
of the market?
<A - David Pahl>: Sure, yeah. So we've got five sectors that make up the automotive market for us that we look at.
They're infotainment, safety, advanced driver assist systems or ADAS, body electronics and lighting, and then
powertrain systems which include hybrid and electric systems. And we have a very intentional focus to invest across all
of those five sectors. We're seeing that in the results with revenues in most of those sectors growing double digits. And
we have an approach inside of automotive that is similar really across our other markets where we look to leverage our
four competitive advantages. And I think that that's helping to turn in those results.
So we are favoring what I would say catalog and application-specific solutions. I wouldn't put that into the category of
full turnkey system-level solutions where we're doing what we would consider to be the work that our customers do. So
we are providing them building blocks that have different levels of integration, but we're not looking to provide a full
ADAS system as an example. So we'll enable those systems, and I think that that's pretty consistent with what you see
across all the markets and sectors that we serve. So, okay. Thanks, Joe, and we'll go to the next caller, please.

And we have Chris Caso with CLSA.
<Q - Christopher Caso>: Yes. Thank you. Good evening. I guess first question would be regarding your comments on
the industrial segment. You talked about some broad improvement. I guess could you talk about your level of visibility
there and the likelihood of that sustaining into the end of the year and moving into next year?
<A - David Pahl>: Can you just ask that once again to make sure I got the question right, Chris?
<Q - Christopher Caso>: Sorry. It was regarding the industrial segment and your comments on that. You talked about
broad improvement. If you can give some more color on that and your view on the potential for that to sustain into
year-end and into next year?
<A - David Pahl>: Yeah, I think as we talked about last quarter, we did see an improvement in industrial demand. It
actually had been flat for several quarters year on year, so we were encouraged by that. This quarter, we built on that a
little bit and like last quarter, it was very, very broad based. I won't try to go in and try to predict how long that will last
or carry forward, but I definitely would say that we were encouraged as we saw most of those sectors growing. You
have a follow-on, Chris?
<Q - Christopher Caso>: I do. Yeah, the follow on is regarding inventory in both the channel at your customers. And
given the stronger growth in Q3, was any part of that growth perhaps attributed to some increase in inventory?
Understand that most of your inventory in the distribution channel is on consignment now, but what's your view of
customer inventory levels right now?
<A - David Pahl>: Yeah, so if we look into the distribution channel, inventory actually decreased by about a half a
week and it's currently at very, very low levels at about four weeks, and that's pretty similar to what we saw a year ago.
So, again, we believe that that inventory level just reflects an environment of really good product availability. We've
got good inventories on our books available to be able to ship. We've continued to have very stable lead times. And
those things kind of taken together just drive very high customer service metric, so customers in general are getting
products when they want to have them. So, and I'll just make the reminder too, that that four weeks of inventory is just
structurally lower because of the consignment programs that we have at our major distributors. So thank you, Chris,
and we'll go to the next caller, please.
Operator
We have Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.
<Q - Ambrish Srivastava>: Hi. Thank you. My first question is on the embedded side. This segment has been
growing really well for the last now third quarter in a row you're posting pretty good year over year growth. What's
driving that, Dave? I know it has three major segments. Could you just help us understand the drivers behind the
growth?
<A - David Pahl>: Yeah, I think when you look at the embedded markets, we've seen good growth there for a number
of quarters. And if you look at the end markets, they have a very good exposure to automotive, to industrial and to the
comms market. So as we talked about the communications market, or really all three of those markets contributed to
growth. And the great thing about the growth is it's very broad based. It's not in one market. It's not in one sector. It's
not driven by one technology. So we feel really good about the sustainability of that growth. And the great thing with
that is it's fallen through to the operating profit which you can see inside of that business and most importantly, it's
fallen through to free cash flow growth. So do you have a follow on, Ambrish?
<Q - Ambrish Srivastava>: Yes, I did. Could you talk a little bit about your, there seems to be change in the
relationship at how you work with the major distribution partners and our sense is this is nothing new. But could you
just help us understand how you thought through the pros and cons of this change and whether it's just a matter of you
having more in consignment? Or it's a trade off between confidence of sourcing your own wins versus potential loss in
future sales? Thank you.

<A - David Pahl>: Sure. Yeah, so our relationships with distributors have been evolving and always evolve. I think
any healthy business relationships evolve, but especially as the reach of our channel advantages continues to
strengthen. So you've heard Kevin and I both mention our four competitive advantages and certainly the reach of our
channel is one of them. And so that includes both the size and the skill of our direct sales and applications teams, but
it's also, it includes the growing capabilities of the web and ti.com.
So as an example, three years ago we discontinued our incentive programs for demand creation on accounts that
represented about 80% of the TAM where we had resources calling on those accounts directly. And we made that
change because our team is just more effective and efficient in demand creation. And this has played out as we've
continued to gain share every year since then.
And then more recently, we've discontinued the incentives for the remaining balance of the account. And so we expect,
as with all relationships, they'll continue to evolve. But we do believe distributors will continue to play an important
role in order fulfillment for our customers. So okay. Thank you, Ambrish, and we'll go to the next caller, please.

We have David Wong with Wells Fargo.
<Q - David M. Wong>: Thanks very much. TI and several other chip companies had really impressive September year
over year growth that was many percent above guidance and you're also giving the same guidance, which is solid. Even
then, the year over year growth in December looks like it's going to be below September. Can you give us some feel as
to what's happening here? Did things weaken as September progressed? Or is December a particularly tough
comparison?
<A - David Pahl>: Yeah, David, if you look at our normal seasonality, the one thing that we can conclude for sure is
that second and third quarter are our seasonally strongest quarters. Fourth and first are seasonally weakest. And so
certainly that will play an effect as we go into fourth quarter. So it's not unusual for us to see a fourth quarter that's
down and in fact why we point to the year over year guidance and how that is consistent with just our belief is that
things in the macro really haven't changed too dramatically. So that has gone into the guidance. Do you have a follow
on?
<Q - David M. Wong>: No, I'm good. Thank you.
<A - David Pahl>: Okay. Thank you, David.

Our next question is from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Vivek Arya>: Thanks for taking my question, and congratulations on the strong results and the dividend boost.
Maybe I'll also try my hand on this Q4 outlook question, because I still don't know whether this is a top-down forecast
or it's a bottoms-up forecast, because which specific end market is going down sequentially so much for your overall
sales to go down 10%? And I don't know whether it's the Other segment, which had very strong growth in Q3. And I
know, Dave, you mentioned on a year on year basis but last year I believe your sales were down in Q4, so the comps
should have been easier versus the last year. So that's really my first question, that is this a top-down forecast or is this
a bottoms-up forecast?
<A - Kevin P. March>: I think Dave has probably answered that same question about three or four times now and the
answer is still going to be the same. It is our best outlook right now based upon a continuing weak macro economy. We
had a book-to-bill in 3Q of 0.99. Compare that to 1.0 a year ago. So the visibility into the quarter is a little bit reduced
versus what it was a year ago. There is no one market, no one customer, no one product. It is our best estimate at this
point in time and I will remind you, it does include a range, and that range probably comprehends to a higher

probability of where we'll land for fourth quarter.
<A - David Pahl>: Yeah, and I'd just add, Vivek, that whenever we've had a big discontinuity that your searching
around for, we've been clear at calling those things out. So, and we want to be able to provide that transparency when
it's necessary. So do you have a follow on?
<Q - Vivek Arya>: Yes. Thank you. Now given the focus on free cash flow, why isn't TI better utilizing an asset like
your balance sheet? Because you're operating, if my numbers are right, at about 0.15 net debt to trailing EBITDA, and
most of your peers are comfortable operating at 3 to four 4. So given this low growth environment and sort of negative
returns for holding cash, why is TI holding so much cash? And why not buy back more of your stock if you think M&A
looks expensive or not attractive right now? Thank you.
<A - Kevin P. March>: I take it from that you consider our stock quite undervalued at the moment in time, so I
appreciate that observation. We have been buying back shares every quarter since the fourth quarter of 2004. Our
method for buying back shares is to be disciplined and consistent in how we go about doing it. More importantly, what
we've talked about is that we will buy back more shares when the price is lower, and probably fewer shares when the
price is higher. And so to that end, we recently as with today's announcement have updated our allocation budget, if
you will, for what we allocate from free cash flow to dividends from 50% of our trailing four years average free cash
flow to 50% to 80%. We think this new range provides a more robust framework that allows us to adjust the allocation
of our shareholder return between dividend growth and share repurchases.
As far as leveraging the balance sheet any further right now, that balance sheet has been leveraged higher in the past.
We have been slowly paying that debt back down over time, which means the debt is available should an important
strategic opportunity present itself at the right moment in time. We believe that leveraging now just for the sake of
leveraging would actually block the balance sheet from being available should an opportunity present itself out there
from a strategic standpoint.
<A - David Pahl>: Okay. Great. Thank you, Vivek. And we'll go to the next caller, please.

The next caller is Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Amit Daryanani>: Thanks a lot. I have a question and a follow up as well. Just starting on the dividend increase
that you guys announced, could you just talk about, as I think about the future dividend payout strategies you guys
have, is it going to be more a reflection of your free cash flow growth on a annualized basis? Or would the desire be to
increase dividends along with free cash growth plus increasing the payout until you get to the midpoint of this 50% to
80% range? Just how do I think about this on an annual basis?
<A - Kevin P. March>: Well, I think if you think about that what you have been seeing is probably what you will see,
and that is our free cash flow has been growing consistently for quite a few years now. And our formula design means
that by definition, our dividends are increasing consistent with that. What this new range does is just give us more
framework to adjust the allocation between dividends and stock buyback. Recall that we take all the free cash flow, and
we use it either for dividend or a buyback. And this allows us to allocate more towards dividend growth as opposed to
buyback going forward.
If we reach a point where share price tends to be relatively lower at a point in time, then this allows us to slow down the
dividend growth rate and adjust that back towards dividend repurchases. So that's what this new range is designed to
do, is to give us more flexibility to be responsive to the changing market valuations that we see out there.
<A - David Pahl>: You have a follow on?
<Q - Amit Daryanani>: Got it. And if I could just follow up. Your R&D has sort of increased double digit for a few
quarters. It sounds like it will do so again. Is that suggesting you are kind of shifting a little bit from harvesting towards
investing more in your business? And if that's the case, should we recalibrate expectations maybe in calendar 2017 and

2018 that the share gains that you guys have typically had of 30, 40, 50 basis points could be somewhat higher given all
the investments you're making?
<A - Kevin P. March>: Well, certainly we're investing more into R&D with the intent of continuing our share gains
and ideally accelerating them. And really what we're doing on this stuff is we're being very disciplined on R&D as
well. We're not spending just for the sake of spending, but we're spending because we have a higher degree of
confidence in the ideas that are coming to us that we can actually turn that into profitable revenue growth, and ideally
market share. And we're doing that by just reallocating our internal resources, as we've mentioned, meaning we're not
taking our total spending up, but we're taking people who may have been working in the manufacturing lines, or people
who may have been working in sales or general administrative areas and putting them into working on R&D projects as
well. So it's an overall reallocation internally, and I would expect that that will continue to support our market share
gains as we go forward.
<A - David Pahl>: Yeah, and I would just add that we've gained on average 30 to 40 basis points of market share, and
I think we've gained share each of the last six years. I think we're on track to be able to put a seventh year up, and we'll
wait for the numbers to get posted before we declare that. But, again, market share just doesn't move quickly in the
markets that we've got, and I think that that just speaks to the quality of the market. So I think these opportunities that
Kevin's talking about just gives us confidence that we can continue to have share gains into the future. So thanks, Amit,
and we'll go to the next caller, please.

The next question is from Ian Ing with MKM Partners.
<Q - Ian L. Ing>: Yes. Thank you. In your prepared comments, you talked about being opportunistic in terms of
purchasing assets ahead of demand. So do you anticipate any greater opportunities or fire sales as the industry, I would
say, rapidly consolidates? I mean, you probably got enough wafer fabrication equipment, but maybe there's other areas
like test and packaging. Thanks.
<A - Kevin P. March>: Yeah, Ian, I would say that we are continuously on the lookout for buying assets that we don't
need now but we believe we will need at some point in time where it could be a strategic cost advantage to us at some
point in time. And we have been in pretty much every quarter picking up some piece of equipment here or there. But,
again, we look at the total opportunity, meaning can we get it at the right price and can it be something that will
contribute to our free cash flow as we go forward. And so we look at it in that context when we consider these sort of
things. So I would expect that we'll continue to be out there making opportunistic acquisitions. Some may rise to the
level of an announcement, but most of them are probably just remain as they have been, just spot purchases that we do
from time to time as we look around the world.
<A - David Pahl>: Yeah, and I'll also point out, we're making those purchases while keeping our CapEx at about 4%
of revenue. So continuing to strengthen that competitive advantage. You have a follow-up, Ian?
<Q - Ian L. Ing>: Yes. Over to Embedded Processing, questions on expectations for DSP applications. Should we
think of it as largely communications infrastructure, 4G and 5G? I notice there's DSP IP companies out there. They're
talking about using these chips as accelerators for things like deep learning, artificial intelligence, accelerating some
applications.
<A - David Pahl>: Yeah, I think when you look at our portfolio, the lines between what's a DSP and what's not a DSP
blur to some degree. So like you said in the comms equipment space, you've got processors that have multi-cores of
both arms in DSPs, but also have a heavy component of hardware accelerators. Our OMAP products that are gaining
traction in automotive and other applications inside of industrial have DSPs inside of them. If you look at our
communication products where we support over a dozen different standards that help machines be connected and be
smarter, they will have DSPs inside of them.

So we kind of just look at that as an enabling technology. The good news is that that business complements our Analog
product portfolio very well. It isn't one type of product or technology that's building that business. We've got a very
good diversity of customers that we're building over time, so we're encouraged by the confidence and the sustainability
of that revenue. And the wires underneath and the technology underneath are important on how we deliver it, but the
business model is what's really encouraging for us. So, okay. We can go to, have time for one more caller, please.

Our next question is from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
<Q - John William Pitzer>: Yeah guys, thanks for squeezing me in here. Kevin, I guess my first question is, you
talked about OpEx being down sequentially in the December quarter. Depending upon how much down sequentially it
is, you could still have gross margins kind of flat to up in the December quarter. And notwithstanding the revenue
decline, you've had prior quarters where down revenue doesn't necessarily mean down gross margins. So kind of
curious how you think about gross margins going into the calendar fourth quarter and what levers you can still pull
other than just volume to keep moving gross margins up and to the right.
<A - Kevin P. March>: Yeah John, I think you know that we normally don't try to give that precise a forecast other
than just top line and earnings. But I will just remind you that just like 3Q benefited from lower costs as we increased
production in the 300 millimeter and depreciation's rolling off, depreciation will continue to roll off and 300 millimeter
will continue to become a bigger portion of our wafers that we start. So you got a number of underlying cost things that
will continue to give us good results on the overall gross margin for those who are interested in that number.
<Q - John William Pitzer>: That's helpful. I appreciate it. And then, Dave, I guess as my follow up, you talked about
your largest customer in personal electronics being down year over year in the September quarter. Do you think that's
an accurate reflection of kind of their unit demand or is there something going on with your content or your pricing,
and would you expect that customer to be down again year over year in the December quarter?
<A - David Pahl>: Well, I will say that I'm not going to make any comments on their demand. And with most of our
large customers, if I'll just generalize the comment, most of our large customers will be on some type of consignment
or hub-based system. So there is usually not a large delay in the demand when it actually gets pulled and when it's used.
There is always exceptions to that overall. From a content standpoint, I think we've mentioned before that we sell
hundreds of products into our largest customers, including our largest one, and we continue to win new products. So
we're confident in the design wins that we've got and the revenue that that will drive overall. So, okay. Well thank you,
John, for your call.
