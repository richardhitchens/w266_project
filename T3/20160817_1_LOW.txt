Good morning and thanks to your interest in Lowe's. We delivered a solid first half of the year, and made continued
progress against our key strategic priorities, providing better omni-channel experiences to more closely connect with
customers, deepening our relationship with the Pro customer and driving productivity and profitability. We continue to

generate strong cash flows, enabling us to strategically invest in the business while returning capital to our
shareholders. In the first six months of 2016, we delivered comparable sales growth of 4.4% in line with our plan. In
the second quarter, comparable sales grew 2%, driven primarily by 1.7% increase in average ticket.
As we mentioned before, the timing of spring impacts the first half of the year. This year, the season began with robust
demand for outdoor projects. Customers took advantage of favorable weather conditions in the first quarter to complete
those projects. In the second quarter, we saw more strength in indoor project demand, leading to strong performance in
lumber and building materials, kitchens, tools and hardware and fashion fixtures.
Our seasonal living business also performed well in the second quarter, driven predominantly by air-conditioner and
patio furniture sales. Healthy macro fundamentals, our project inspiration and expertise and targeted promotions
continue to drive demand resulting in positive comps in 10 of 13 product categories.
We were also pleased with the work we've done to further advance our product and service offering to the Pro
customer. The strategic investments we've made to build deeper relationships with the Pro are allowing us to capitalize
on strong product demand driven by a favorable macro backdrop, as our Pro business continue to perform well above
the company average. Today, we have a strong foundation for the Pro customer including dedicated service in the store,
solid inventory depth, field-based Pro account executives, and a national accounts team. Our LowesForPros.com
website, re-launched in the second quarter of last year, continues to gain traction, and we will continue to build on this
strong foundation by incorporating the feedback we receive from Pros and our Pro services team to constantly improve
the customer experience and deepen our relationships with this important customer segment.
From a geographic perspective, our U.S. home improvement business achieved 1.9% comps for the quarter, with all
regions of the South and the West comping positively. Our Northern regions were challenged by an abbreviated spring,
which hindered outdoor activity.
We continued our strong performance in international markets, including double-digit comps in Canada and Mexico in
local currency. We closed the RONA acquisition on May 20, and I'm pleased with the progress of our integration. By
bringing together Lowe's global scale and resources with RONA's local expertise, we can enhance relevance and
expand customer reach, ultimately enhancing our competitiveness and profitability in Canada, establishing a strong
presence in Québec and positioning us to capitalize on the significant long term potential of the market. We welcome
RONA's talented team into the Lowe's family.
For the quarter, operating margin contracted 13 basis points, and we delivered earnings per share of $1.31, a 9%
increase over last year's second quarter. These results include an $84 million loss on the foreign currency hedge entered
into in advance of the RONA acquisition. This loss had a $0.06 impact on earnings per share for the quarter.
Delivering on our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, in the quarter we repurchased $1.2 billion of stock
under our share repurchase program and paid $251 million in dividends.
Looking ahead to the second half of 2016, the outlook for the home improvement industry remains positive. Persistent
gains in the job market and disposable income growth that continues to outpace the economy should further contribute
to solid growth in consumer spending, and the outlook for housing remains bright with strong home sales and
construction in the first half of the year poised to benefit growth in the second half of the year. With home value
appreciation expected to persist and incomes continuing to rise, we expect homeowners to be motivated to spend on
their homes. Overall, strong consumer housing fundamentals should continue to benefit the home improvement
industry.
Our second quarter consumer sentiment survey showed similar trends. Consumers continue to view their personal
finances and home values favorably with half of homeowners believing the value of their home is increasing. We
believe this positive sentiment around home values is driving home improvement spending. Consequently, we continue
to see home improvement spending outpace overall consumer spending as well as positive home improvement project
intentions including strong engagement in big-ticket discretionary projects.

Our key priorities in 2016 are focused on leveraging this favorable home improvement backdrop. We are pursuing
further top line growth by differentiating ourselves through better omni-channel customer experiences that make us the
project authority and continuing to focus on improving our product and service offering for the Pro customer. At the
same time, we continue to focus on driving productivity and profitability. The execution of our strategic priorities along
with a solid macroeconomic backdrop gives us confidence in our business outlook for 2016.
Before I close, I would like to express my appreciation for our employees' unwavering commitment to serving
customers. In particular, I would like to thank those Lowe's team members who work diligently to assist our neighbors
that were impacted by the historic flooding in West Virginia and those that are now assisting our neighbors in
Louisiana.
In circumstances like these, we ship truckloads of critically-needed supplies to affected areas, and many of our
employees pledge their time to help individuals in need. Lowe's has also donated a total of $750,000 to the American
Red Cross to assist with the relief efforts.
Thanks again for your interest, and with that, let me turn the call over to Mike.
Michael A. Jones
Thanks, Robert, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, we achieved positive comps in 10 of 14 regions
with all regions in the South and West comping positively. This strength was offset by weakness in our Northern
regions. We also posted positive comps in 10 of 13 product categories. While comps were below expectation for the
second quarter, we delivered a solid first half of the year in line with our plan. As Robert mentioned, the season kicked
off with stronger-than-expected outdoor project demand as customers took advantage of favorable weather, bolstered
by a strong macroeconomic backdrop.
We drove traffic in Q1 through compelling offers, designed to take advantage of the early spring project demand,
leveraging enhanced digital capabilities to reach the spring customer earlier in the season. As we moved into Q2, we
saw softer comps in May stemming both from Q1 project pull-forward and unfavorable weather. Temperatures below
normal in our Northern regions prevented customers from enjoying outdoor projects.
As we moved into June and July, traffic rebounded, and we capitalized on stronger demand for indoor projects, and
customers' continued desire to invest in their homes, with our project inspiration and expertise and targeted promotions.
This contributed to stronger performance in interior categories, such as kitchens and fashion fixtures.
We also drove solid comps in appliances, and for the eighth time in the last nine years, J.D. Power and Associates
ranked Lowe's highest in customer satisfaction among appliance retailers based on our knowledgeable sales specialists,
breadth of assortment, competitive pricing and delivery.
To take advantage of increasing demand for kitchen projects and to ensure we provide a more holistic solution to a
simple kitchen refresh or a full remodel, we display our kitchen solutions, including cabinets and countertops
immediately adjacent to our appliance offering, so customers can both envision and design their dream kitchens.
This quarter, we drove above-average comps in kitchens through a combination of project inspiration and expertise, our
investment in project specialists who meet the customers in their homes, and targeted promotions.
Within fashion fixtures, we leverage our customer experience design capabilities to optimize our lighting reset,
featuring an expanded collection of lighting styles, finishes and brands, including the expansion of Kichler Lighting,
the largest lighting showroom brand in the industry, along with Progress Lighting and Quoizel Lighting.
Adding to our attractive product offering, we also simplified the presentation, grouping lighting fixtures by style and
collection to provide a cohesive decorating solution and make selection easier.
Customers have responded well, driving strong comps in fashion fixtures. We've also expanded this enhanced display
approach to ceiling fans.

Our shower door reset also leverages our customer experience design capabilities, enhancing our shower door offering
by designing a complete solution for customer needs, providing a great line design, offering innovation and expanded
selection and product delivery and installation services. In doing so, we're differentiating ourselves as the retail
destination for bathroom refresh as well as developing a best-in-class in-store customer experiences that can also serve
as a selling center for Pros and our product specialist teams. We're also efficiently leveraging our network of regional
distribution centers to offer customers product when and where they want it.
Our seasonal living business also performed well in Q2, driven by robust air conditioner sales due to
warmer-than-average temperatures and patio furniture and fashions. We also saw continued strong demand from the
Pro customer with comps well above the company average.
Once again, productivity drove solid comps in lumber and building materials. Tools and hardware also benefited from
increased project activity from both DIY and Pro customers. We're able to capitalize on this demand by improving our
tool brand assortment with exclusives like Hitachi and Bostitch, the number-one and number-two brands in pneumatics,
and the extension of brands like Vaughn along with our extensive private label line of Kobalt tools.
And we're proud to announce the return of yet another destination tool brand to Lowe's, Marshalltown, a trusted Pro
brand and the leading supplier of cement masonry tools, which we'll roll out to all our stores in the upcoming weeks.
We also continue to focus on the strategic priorities, leveraging our omni-channel capabilities to help customers
achieve great project results. Customers can engage with our associates in-store for expert advice, our content on
lowes.com for inspiration, our contact center for ongoing support, or our project specialists who work with them in
their homes.
This quarter, we launched our new lowes.com site, advancing our online shopping experience with optimized
functionality and display for touchscreen devices to support a better mobile experience, improved product and content
recommendations, refined search algorithms, improved click-to-chat capabilities, larger project images, and expanded
product views, including video content.
As anticipated, following the launch, we had a brief period of disruption as customers increased their familiarity with
the redesigned site. We are now seeing improved performance and have received great customer feedback on the new
site.
Our interior and exterior project specialists are another critical element of our omni-channel strategy and the
differentiated capability in capturing and serving project demand. They meet with customers in their homes to design,
plan and manage their home improvement projects. Our exterior project specialists are currently available across all
U.S. home improvement stores, and we're expanding our interior project specialists program, reaching all U.S. stores
by the end of this year.
We're very pleased with our in-home sales program performance, with above-average comp growth again this quarter.
Our expertise in project inspiration, design, advice and execution are setting us apart as the project authority in home
improvement at a time when consumers continue to demonstrate a desire to invest in their homes.
We continue to advance our Pro business, driving comps well above the company average by continuing to optimize
our product and service offering to better serve the Pro customer. Beyond improvements in our tools offering, we have
also strengthened our portfolio of Pro-focused brands with the addition of GAF roofing, Owens Corning insulation,
Ventec's HVAC, Masonite entry and interior doors and Hubbell residential wiring devices.
We're also working closely with our field-based merchandising team to identify local market opportunities and brands
to further optimize our offering for the Pro customer, and with the re-launch of LowesForPros.com last year, we've also
made it easier for Pros to manage multiple properties and quickly and easily purchase items nationwide.
Thus far, we've been pleased with our program rollout given the positive customer response and results which have
exceeded our expectations. We're also serving the Pro customer through our account executive Pro services or AEPs.
AEPs work with larger regional customers to help them order and replenish products across multiple geographies and

locations.
Our AEPs have been very effective in growing our business with larger Pro customers. We currently have over 200 Pro
outside sales representatives in the field and continue to be very pleased with the program's results. Excluding the AEPs
we added this year, we saw double-digit growth in AEP sales which contributed to the strong Pro comp growth in the
quarter. Building on the success, we'll continue to grow the program adding additional AEPs to continue capturing
market opportunity with large Pro customers.
Our focus on further strengthening our portfolio of brands, continuing to build our omni-channel offering through our
growing Pro services team and our relaunch of LowesForPros.com are all a part of a broader commitment to build on
our strong foundation with the Pro. In addition to our efforts to drive top line growth, we continue to focus on driving
productivity and profitability.
For the quarter, gross margin declined 3 basis points. Our operating performance drove 17 basis points of improvement
with the result of our ongoing line review process. The RONA transaction negatively impacted gross margin by 20
basis points. Bob will provide the details in a moment.
As you can see, we had a solid first half of the year. As we look forward to the second half of 2016, we believe we're
well-positioned to capitalize on a favorable macroeconomic backdrop for the home improvement industry, and we
continue to execute our strategic priorities and make progress on initiatives to drive top line growth, improve
productivity and profitability.
Thank you for your interest in Lowe's, and I'll now turn the call over to Bob.
Robert F. Hull
Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. This is the first quarter that we're including RONA in our financial results.
While we closed the acquisition May 20, our second quarter includes only five weeks of RONA results, as they are
consolidated on a one-month lag.
In conjunction with the transaction, RONA's operating results are adjusted to reflect purchase accounting as well as to
align their accounting policies with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, regarding RONA, they will be
included in our comp sales calculation after we anniversary the transaction in the second quarter of 2017.
Now on to our Q2 results. Sales for the second quarter were $18.3 billion, an increase of 5.3%. Total customer
transactions grew 3.7%, with RONA accounting for about 75% of the increase, and total average ticket increased 1.6%
to $68.91. The sales increase was driven by the addition of RONA in increasing comp sales and new stores. For Q2,
$461 million or 2.7% of the sales growth came from RONA. New stores contributed approximately 60 basis points of
the sales growth.
Comp sales were 2%, driven by comp average ticket increase of 1.7% and comp transaction growth of 0.3%. Looking
at monthly trends, comps were negative 2.8% in May, positive 5% in June and positive 3.8% in July. The timing of
Memorial Day and July 4 versus last year had fairly significant impacts on the monthly comps. We estimate that
normalizing for the timing of the holidays, comps would have been positive all three months with comps of 1.7% in
May, 2% in June and 2.3% in July. We estimate that weather negatively impacted comp sales in the quarter by 110
basis points.
Year-to-date sales of $33.5 billion were up 6.4% versus the first half of 2015, driven by a 4.4% increase in comp sales,
1.5% from RONA and 0.5% from new stores. Gross margin for the second quarter was 34.44% of sales, which
decreased three basis points from Q2 last year. Gross margin was negatively impacted by the RONA transaction due to
both purchase accounting adjustments and mix.
The purchase accounting adjustments were required to write the opening inventory balance up to fair value. As this
product is sold, the higher cost of goods hurt gross margin. The mix impact was a function of RONA's lower gross
margin rate. In the quarter, these items negatively impacted gross margin by 20 basis points, which more than offset 15

basis points of benefit from value improvement.
Year-to-date gross margin was 34.71% of sales, a decrease of 21 basis points from the first half of 2015. SG&A for Q2
was 21.2% of sales which deleveraged 26 basis points. The deleverage was primarily driven by a foreign currency
transaction loss and store payroll.
As mentioned on our first quarter call in anticipation of the RONA acquisition, we entered into a foreign currency
hedge to lock in the purchase price in U.S. dollars. In the first quarter, we reported a $160 million unrealized gain.
However, in the second quarter, the Canadian dollar strengthened, resulting in an $84 million loss. This item negatively
impacted Q2 SG&A by 45 basis points. In the quarter, store payroll deleveraged 30 basis points, driven by wage
pressure as well as lower-than-planned sales.
These items were partially offset by 24 basis points of leverage in bonus and 16 basis points of leverage in employee
insurance. Year-to-date SG&A was 21.69% of sales, which leveraged 70 basis points versus the first half of 2015.
Depreciation for the quarter was $366 million, which was 2% of sales and leveraged 16 basis points.
In Q2 earnings before interest and taxes or EBIT decreased 13 basis points to 11.24% of sales. The RONA impacts to
gross margin and the foreign currency hedge negatively impacted EBIT by 65 basis points in the quarter. For the first
half of 2016, EBIT was 10.86% of sales, which was 68 basis points higher than the same period last year.
For the quarter, interest expense was $166 million. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 38.1%. Earnings per share
was $1.31 for the second quarter, an increase of 9.2% over last year. The foreign currency hedge negatively impacted
earnings by $0.06 per share. For the first six months of 2016, earnings per share were $2.29, representing a 20.5%
increase over the first half of 2015. The foreign currency hedge aided earnings per share by $0.05 in the first half of the
year.
Now to a few items in the balance sheet, starting with assets. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter was $2
billion. Inventory at $10.6 billion increased $900 million or 9.3% versus Q2 last year. Approximately 85% of the
increase relates to the addition of RONA.
Inventory turnover was 3.89 times, essentially flat to last year. Asset turnover increased four basis points to 1.78.
Moving on to the liability section of the balance sheet, accounts payable of $7.7 billion represented an 8% increase
over Q2 last year due to the timing of purchases year-over-year, terms improvement as well as the addition of RONA.
At the end of the second quarter, lease adjusted debt to EBITDAR was 2.45 times. Return on invested capital was 15%.
The net impact of last year's non-cash impairment charge related to our Australian joint venture and this year's foreign
currency hedge gain hurt ROIC by 194 basis points.
Now looking at the statement of cash flows, year-to-date operating cash flow was $4.6 billion, capital expenditures
were $490 million, resulting in free cash flow of just over $4.1 billion, which is up 15% to last year.
In May, we entered into a $500 million accelerated share repurchase agreement. At this point, we expect to receive
approximately 6.3 million shares but the ultimate number of shares will be determined upon completion of the program
in the third quarter. We also repurchased approximately 8.9 million shares for $700 million through the open market. In
total, we repurchased $1.2 billion of stock in the quarter. We have approximately $1.2 billion remaining on our share
repurchase authorization.
Looking ahead, I'd like to address several items as detailed in Lowe's business outlook. First, a reminder. Fiscal 2016
will include an extra week in the fourth quarter for a total of 14 weeks and 53 weeks for the year. Second, since we've
closed the RONA acquisition, our outlook now includes the impact of the transaction as well as their operating
performance.
Finally, the first half of 2016 came in essentially on plan. We are confident in our ability to achieve our goals for the
year. As a result, the only changes to our outlook are related to RONA.

Now let's get into the outlook. As Robert noted, the forecast for home improvement industry remains positive. For
2016, we expect a total sales increase of approximately 10% driven by a variety of factors.
First, we are forecasting a comp sales increase of 4%. Second, we expect RONA to contribute 4% to sales growth.
Next, we estimate that the 53rd week will aid total sales by 1.5%. Lastly, we plan to open approximately 45 stores,
which adds 0.5%.
For the EBIT growth rate, we are excluding the impact of last year's Australian joint venture impairment charge, and
this year's net FX hedge gain. We believe excluding these large one-time items is a better representation of our
operating performance.
We're anticipating an EBIT increase of approximately 50 basis points. While the acquisition of RONA adds EBIT
dollars, there's a negative impact to the percent of sales. There are two factors causing this. First, RONA's EBIT is
lower as a percent of sales. As part of our synergy case, we expect that RONA's EBIT will improve over time. Second,
are the impacts of purchase accounting I noted a moment ago. This primarily hurts 2016 with minimal impact in 2017
and beyond. Combined, these items pressure EBIT by 35 basis points for the year. The negative impacts to Q3 and Q4
are estimated to be 60 basis points and 50 basis points, respectively. For the year, we expect EBIT dollars to grow by
approximately 16%.
The effective tax rate is expected to be 38.1%. For the year on a GAAP basis, we expect earnings per share of
approximately $4.06. We are on target to hit our original 2016 operating plan. I'd like to walk you through our EPS
outlook, starting with the $4 per share we communicated on the Q4 call in February.
From here, we add the net gain from the foreign currency hedge of $0.05. Lastly, we add $0.01 as we expect RONA's
operating results to more than offset the acquisition and integration costs. As a result, we do expect that RONA
transaction will be modestly accretive for the year.
We are forecasting cash flow from operations to be approximately $5.6 billion. Our forecast for capital expenditures is
approximately $1.5 billion. This results in an estimated free cash flow of $4.1 billion for 2016. Our guidance assumes
approximately $3.5 billion of share repurchases for 2016.
Regina, we are now ready for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Robert, are you surprised that the
business didn't sequentially improve more than it did, adjusting for some of the calendar shift over the course of the
quarter, given the demand pull-forward that you saw earlier in the year? And then based on that, what's still inspiring
your confidence that business can accelerate to 3% to 4% comp in the back half of the year?
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Yeah, well, Michael, if you look at the adjusted calendar numbers that Bob gave you, we
certainly saw the sequential improvement in comps over the quarter, and then if you also look at – 40% of our business
in the second quarter is outdoor seasonal products.
When you think about the impact that weather had, the rain impact we had in May, and then obviously the late spring,
which impacted the North and the extreme heat that we ran into later in the quarter, we still saw sequential
improvement. When we look at everything from talking to – our consumer sentiment survey, everything we're hearing
from the consumer, they're still highly engaged in discretionary spending around the home driven by how they feel
about the overall housing market and the value of their home continuing to increase.

So when we look at the macroeconomic environment and look at the impacts that weather had on our particular
business in the quarter, it still sets us up incredibly well. Now I'll get Mike to jump in on some of the things that he
thinks is going to drive the excitement for us on our outlook for the back half of the year and what we're focused on.
<A - Michael A. Jones>: Yes, we absolutely did. Macro backdrop certainly is constructive. Consumers wanting us to
do projects feels good. As you get into the back half, you start to lean more towards interior projects. Certainly less
weather impact on interior projects. We're positioned to take advantage on some of the strong demand in the back half
with respect to interior projects.
We've spoken about our project specialists program being expanded to all stores. I spoke earlier about the investment
that we've made in digital. I like how we're positioned from a product perspective with our strength in appliances, our
full vignettes, our delivery, all brands and installation. I like how we are positioned in fashion lighting with our three
brand strategy around Kichler, Progress and Quoizel. Our flooring lineup is second to none with PERGO laminate, Cali
Bamboo and our STAINMASTER brand.
We like our position in paint. We've talked a lot about Sherwin-Williams, Valspar and PPG, Olympic the exclusives
that we have there. We've done a lot of work around stain, bringing back Cabot and expanding our Minwax. And if you
think about the Pro business, we continue to be more relevant with Pro with return of brands like Marshalltown on top
of those other brands that we took back and spoke to earlier in the year. So we think we're well-positioned going into
the second half. And we think that macro is going to play to – we've made a lot of investments, in particular on interior
strength and on some of that demand.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: That's helpful. And my follow-up question is over the last few quarters, you've engaged
in targeted promotions. What have you learned from that? And how is that going to inform your promotional posture
moving into the second half of the year and beyond? Thank you so much.
<A - Michael A. Jones>: Sure. Absolutely. First, we continue to learn. Both the promotional landscape as well as
marketing, digital marketing, continue to evolve. We continue to utilize media-mixed modeling so that we can optimize
every dollar spent against the best return. We continue to migrate from print advertising and analog into digital.
We're not seeing a fundamental shift in promotional cadence or promotional depth, so the market remains very rational
in terms of promotions. But what we are seeing are new and enhanced techniques on getting our promotions in front of
our customers.
So as an example, we have a very strong social media footprint on Snapchat, Facebook, on Instagram. In the second
quarter we drove 27 million impressions on social media alone, and that's on top of 32 million impressions in the first
quarter. So with our digital capabilities and our ability to continue to flex promotions, we're finding we can get the right
promotion in front of the customer at the right time. So we're learning a lot. We continue to evolve it and it's an
evolving space.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: Thank you so much, and good luck with the rest of the year.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Thanks, Michael.

Your next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Thanks. Good morning. Can you share with us the spread between some of the
weather-impacted markets and the non? And I think you mentioned – just to clarify – a 110 basis point shortfall from
weather, and I don't know if you can share maybe the percentage of markets where there was weather. But I don't know
if it gets something like a 400 to 500 basis point negative impact in weather markets.
<A - Robert F. Hull>: Sure, Simeon. I'll start. So Robert talked about the 40% of outdoor/seasonal business. That
certainly a strength of ours. While we experienced the same weathers, everybody else, we're disproportionately

impacted by the strength in those categories. As we talked about Q1, we had weather favorability of 150 basis points.
That came back in the second quarter. In Mike's comments, he talked about the strength we saw in the West as well as
positive comps in the South. Certainly, we had pressure up in the Northeast which contributed most of the pressure
associated with weather.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Yeah, Simeon, this is Robert. If you look at – to part of your question, kind of the spread,
the West was our best-performing area of the country, best-performing division. As we said, the North was our weakest
performing division. There was almost a 500 basis point spread in comps between those two divisions, so hopefully
that highlight – or addresses the spread questions you were talking about from what we saw from market to market.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Yep. Okay. And then I guess a follow-on to that. You said that I guess if it was 110 basis
points, then I presume you were expecting to do a 3% and a 3% on top of – I guess next to the 7%. So the first half, you
were looking more at a 5% compared to the guidance of 4%. Is that fair? And then do you think about the back half in a
similar way where you set up and if things go well, there could be some upside to that?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: Yeah, so regarding the first half, Simeon, we delivered a 4.4% comp, was which was essentially
on plan for the first half. Q1 came in a little better based on the weather benefits. Second quarter came in a little bit
worse based on the weather drag. But we're on plan for the first half of the year. As we think about the second half, we
essentially are looking at a 3.5% comp in Q3 and Q4 to achieve the 4% comp for the year. So we feel comfortable and
confident with our ability to achieve that.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Thanks a lot. Good morning. I'd like to follow up on sales, if we could. I guess my
question is to the extent that the impact of weather peaked in May and abated gradually through the quarter, and you
had the heat driving air-conditioner sales. Why don't you think the recovery on a calendar adjusted basis was more
rapid? And also within that, did you see – was all of the recovery, the sequential recovery on an adjusted basis a
function of traffic? And if traffic recovered more, did tickets subside during that period of time?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: So from a traffic and ticket perspective, the performance was relatively flat across the months
of the fiscal period, similar to the comp performance. So the adjusted figures 1.7%, 2% and 2.3% were fairly narrow
band. We saw ticket and traffic perform largely consistent for the three months of the period.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: And then just by way of follow-up, and I understand the macros are where they are and
lots of tailwinds pointing in your direction. Given that none of the three months of Q2 on an adjusted basis were at
parity with the second half comp guide, is there anything you're seeing today here at the outset of Q3 that's reinforcing
your confidence in that 3.5% for the second half of the year?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: So with the start to Q3, we are confident in our ability to achieve the 2016 targets. Certainly,
there's much less potential for weather impact in Q3, and based on the sales drive in Q4, there's always potential for
weather, but it's less of an impact.
We talked about some modest disruption associated with the dot-com platform in Q2. That's behind us. We're seeing
really strong performance subsequent to that. The other thing I would suggest, Matt, is we've had some modest
deflation pressure on sales in the first half of the year; more so in Q1, less so in Q2, that should flip with strength of
lumber prices to modest inflation in the second half of the year.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Got it. Thank you so much.

Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Christopher Michael Horvers>: Thanks. Good morning. Also following-up on sales, so just looking at the
category performance, you had weakness in millwork, rough plumbing and electrical, paint, really core repair and
remodel project categories. So how should we think about that? And think about the favorability of weather, was that a
pull-forward into 1Q but also did you actually see some pull-forward into 4Q 2015 last year, and this is just
normalization and we're going to get back to stronger trend?
And then on that, it sounds like you're expecting 3.5% in both the third quarter and the fourth quarter. Do you think that
that fourth quarter could be a hidden tough weather comparison, considering that category performance?
<A - Michael A. Jones>: Let me take the first part of that on the category performance. Where we saw pressure with
the categories below average, in most cases, it's because of outdoor sales. So in outdoor power equipment, as an
example, we had very soft mower sales.
In millwork, we had soft doors and window sales. However, with some of our interior millwork categories, we actually
saw very robust sales. In paint, we had soft sales in exterior coatings but positive comps in interior coatings.
Another way to think about it, if I think about big-ticket strength, as an example in the second quarter, kitchen cabinets
actually showed strength. Chandeliers and vanity lightings were up double-digit. Wood and vinyl flooring was up
double-digit. Bath vanities were up double-digit. We had some exterior projects that were up quite strong as well.
Shingles were up double-digits. [ph] hoardings (42:22) were up double-digits. Fencing was up high-single digits. But
where we did see real growth softness was in exterior projects, and particularly the type that DIY customers would take
on. So the macroeconomics feel pretty good. And rough plumbing and rough electric, we had deflation, and particularly
around copper that impacted the category.
<A - Robert F. Hull>: Chris...
<Q - Christopher Michael Horvers>: Okay. Go ahead. Sorry.
<A - Robert F. Hull>: The potential pressure from weather in looking at the second half, our comparisons in Q3 are
4.6% and Q4, 5.2%, so not much of a difference in our comparisons we're going up against in the second half of 2015.
And based on the factors that Mike described, the efforts with the Pro, our re-platforming dot-com site and progress
we're making on LowesForPros, enhancing our PSI offering and the resets he described, we feel confident in the
second half of the year.
<Q - Christopher Michael Horvers>: Okay. And then as a follow up, could you – I'm not sure if you said this, but
could you quantify what you thought the dot-com disruption was? And then on the other side, perhaps what you
thought air conditioners lifted comps in the second quarter? Thank you.
<A - Robert F. Hull>: So, Chris, the estimated impact of the dot-com disruption in Q was roughly 25 basis points. As
far as ACs, I don't have the – actually, I do have that impact. That's roughly 20 basis points of impact to the second
quarter.
<Q - Christopher Michael Horvers>: Thank you.

<Q - Greg Melich>: Hi. Thanks. I want to do just another sales follow-up, and then understanding RONA a little bit
better. Were dot-com sales down in the quarter when you said that 25 bps disruption, or was it just less growth than you
expected? And also just to be clear, are we currently this quarter running in that sort of 3% to 4% plan that you have for
the second half?
<A - Ricky D. Damron>: Yeah, Greg, this is Rick. On the lowes.com performance, we still had a solid double-digit
comp performance on the platform at 14%. So we expected roughly a five-week disruption period from the re-launch of
the platform. Historically that's what we've always seen. And that held true again. We ran back to normal run rates after
that five-week period when the customers became adjusted to the new site and how the new site functioned.
<A - Robert F. Hull>: We're also seeing good dot-com performance to start Q3. As I mentioned a moment ago, with
the Q3 start, we're confident in our ability to hit the targets for the year as well as the 3.5% for the second half.
<Q - Greg Melich>: Got it. And then – that's helpful. And on RONA, just to make sure I got these right. In this
quarter, the hit I get was about $35 million of purchase accounting hitting the COGS, right?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: That's about right.
<Q - Greg Melich>: Then if for the full year, it's a 35 bps hit to the plan. It implies it's about a $200 million hit. Could
you help us walk through how much of that $200 million hit is fees to lawyers and bankers; how much of its purchase
accounting? How much of it is integration costs? And I thought you said accretion of RONA was next year, not this
year, but just wanted to clarify that.
<A - Robert F. Hull>: Yeah, so what we're seeing. So if you exclude the net gain on the hedge, as we bring in the
operating performance of RONA, that more than offsets transaction and integration costs. So from an EPS perspective
and from a EBIT dollar perspective, it's accretive. What's happening is, there's two items. So if you pull in RONA's
results which have a lower EBIT percentage, has the effect of mixing the total company's EBIT down. Second are the
purchase price accounting adjustments.
So by the impacts I gave you for the year and then specifically for Q3 and Q4, the 60 and 50 basis points impact on
EBIT, you should be able to take RONA's 2015 reported financials to be able to discern the mix and the purchase price
accounting impact for the second half of the year. So it is accretive from a EBIT dollar and EPS standpoint, but does
have a negative impact as a percent of sales.
<Q - Greg Melich>: So that $35 million that we saw in the second quarter, we're not done with the purchase
accounting. There's more of that in the next two quarters.
<A - Robert F. Hull>: There's more of that. That's why the 60 bps...
<Q - Greg Melich>: That 50 bps to 60 bps. Okay.
<A - Robert F. Hull>: That's the purchase accounting and the EBIT mix.
<Q - Greg Melich>: That's great. And I apologize to sneak a third one in. But on the categories, which were the – I
think there were three categories that were actually down in the quarter. Could you – did you mention which ones those
were?
<A - Michael A. Jones>: I spoke to them. It's outdoor power equipment, millwork and paint.
<Q - Greg Melich>: Millwork and paint. Great. Thanks a lot.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Sure.

<Q - Daniel Thomas Binder>: Great. Thank you. With regard to the changes in promotion, some of that we saw in
credit promotion with some of the broader percentage off promotions that you ran. I was just curious, as you look back,
how would you grade the level of promotional effectiveness? And how should we think about those programs going
forward in Q3 and Q4? Will we continue to see them?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: So, Dan, we talked a lot about promotions in the first quarter; certainly, margin down 43 basis
points. We talked about some specific things we did in Q1 to take advantage of the spring season. Again, it's a strong
proportion of our business and we had favorable weather. We indicated that that pressure was largely contained to Q1.
As we think about our gross margin performance, absent the RONA impact up 17 basis points in the second quarter.
Mike can take you through the array of options we have for promotions. But we do think about the tools and
capabilities we have to align the promotional tactics around the categories and the timing to stimulate demand and build
baskets.
<A - Michael A. Jones>: Yeah, I guess I would probably describe the promotional environment – again, I think it's
rational. I don't know that you're going to see any substantial increases in promotional depth. I think you'll see us
leverage our consumer insights analytical capability to tweak promotions, to make them more efficient. I think you'll
see us use some of our marketing digital capabilities to ensure that we're getting better utilization on how we extend our
promotions. But again, I would define the promotional environment as rational with much better tools to help us
optimize how we bring promotions in front of our customers. And I think the learnings I think are inherent in some of
the digital tools that are being deployed and how we better utilize promotions to get a return on every dollar spent.
<Q - Daniel Thomas Binder>: I was wondering separately if you could just talk to us a little bit about what happens
next with the RONA integration. How long that will take? What do you tackle first? What changes should we see to
that organization first, whether it's in stores or back of the house?
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Hey, Dan. Richard Maltsbarger is in the room, and RONA reports up through him as Head
of International, so I'll get him to address your questions.
<A - Richard D. Maltsbarger>: Yes, Dan. Thank you for the question. The integration is going quite well so far.
We've made great progress on our initial plans. Our initial focus has been very much on placing the right leaders and
the right structure in order to be able to manage the integration and to be able to manage the joint planning of the two
organizations as we shape a new culture to compete in Canada.
As we said when we were putting the deal together, we have three core fundamental tenets to what we're doing with
our integration and our plan. This is about revenue and cost synergies as we go about competing in the Canadian
market with better customer relevance by leveraging our strengths in omni-channel and our approach to be able to bring
all of our channels together to serve customers, our expanded customer reach through our strengths and expertise in key
product categories, including introducing appliances into the RONA stores across the country, and then increased
profitability.
We do believe that the combined scale of our two organizations, both in our direct purchasing and our indirect
purchasing, as well as eliminating key things like public company cost, will allow us the opportunity to possibly double
profitability within the first five years. All indications to-date are that we're well on track for that, and we're quite
encouraged by what we see.

<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: So I have a question on the 110 basis point impact you highlighted from weather. Wouldn't all
of the weather impact really have been in the month of May? Because it seems like that would be a really sizable hit if
it was just in that one month. Or did you see disruptions throughout the quarter that maybe we're not thinking about
properly?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: So Scot, as we think about weather impact, we compare actual temperature and precipitation to
historical norms to determine the weather impact. The majority of the weather impact certainly was in May. There were
some minor impact as well in July because of the extreme heat.
<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: Okay. So if we were to try and kind of eyeball or back-of-the-envelope some of those impacts,
the June numbers should've been relatively clean in terms of the monthly comp that you provided with July just a slight
change versus what you disclosed?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: Yeah. So what we did is we've given you the weather impacts based on the methodology I just
described. What I can't quantify is the exact amount of pull-forward and the impacts to each of the first six months of
the fiscal year, right? I can't tell you how that changed consumer behavior and the timing of their purchases.
<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: Okay. Understood. And then can you provide any more color or magnitude in terms of the
difference that you saw regarding the comp growth between the DIY and Pro? Because it seems like you guys highlight
a couple of times the strength of the Pro this quarter. Thanks.
<A - Robert F. Hull>: Yeah. There was almost a 400 basis point gap in the Pro comp relative to the DIY comp.

Your next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Robert Baird. Please go ahead.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Hey, guys. Sticking with the Pro a little bit, just curious how the MRO business has been
trending for you guys. Maybe get a comment there?
<A - Ricky D. Damron>: Sure. We continue to be pleased with what we're seeing from the MRO customer segment,
especially when you look at the Pro in general. We continue to make and leverage our investments. As Mike
highlighted earlier, to continue to drive relevance and build relationships with those customers.
When you look at our LowesForPros launch is really something that we continue to see the MRO customer gravitate to
as it becomes easier for them to shop our stores and make it easier for them to purchase and build segmented profit list.
And then you look at the investments in our inventory depth as well as our AEP networks, international sales teams, I
think all combined to help us continue to drive that performance.
As we've talked about, Pro is now approximately 30% of our total volume; continues to grow at a faster rate than our
DIY business as the Pro continues to leverage our strength in the categories, the brands that we're bringing in and
continue to introduce, as well as our five ways to save value proposition. So we think holistically those aspects drive
great relationships and synergies across all Pro customers, not just one segment.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Okay. Perfect. And my follow-up is just back to RONA. As we think longer-term, Bob, does
RONA impact the EBIT margin flow-through profile benchmarks that you guys have spoken to in the past at all?
Thank you.
<A - Robert F. Hull>: Peter, thanks for question. As you know, we've got an Analyst Conference in December. We'll
update you on our long-term financial targets at that time.

Our final question will come from the line of Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael Baker>: Thanks. I wanted to ask about some of the bigger-ticket items because the big-ticket growth
was as well as it's been in a couple years. So appliances I think in-line this quarter and below average last quarter. Can
you discuss with us what's going on there? It seems like you're not doing as well as some competitors. There's been
some new entrants in this space. Is that having an impact at all?
<A - Michael A. Jones>: No, we're not seeing any impact from new entrants. I guess I would think about appliances as
we had comps in-line on top of very strong comps last year. So our two-year stack on appliances is very, very strong.
We like how we're positioned in appliances. We like that. We have the largest dedicated showroom floors on
appliances. We like where we are with respect to our J.D. Power and Associates ranking. We like the fact that we do
our deliveries. We really do appreciate the way we do our display techniques with appliances with full vignettes to
allow the customer to envision more appliances in their home.
The way I would think about appliances is that it's a critical category for us. We hope to – we will work to maintain our
number-one position, and it's a great way for us to sell the entire kitchen and leverage the cabinets and countertops
space that we have right next to the category. So we continue to be very bullish about it, and we think that we'll gain
share in the second quarter – excuse me, in 2016, just as we did in the second quarter.
<Q - Michael Baker>: Okay. You think you gained share in the second quarter?
<A - Michael A. Jones>: Yeah, when we look at our performance in appliances versus the industry, we actually
believe we gained share in the second quarter.
<Q - Michael Baker>: Okay. Interesting. I wanted to follow up on paint as well. With some of the moves you guys
made earlier in the year with some vendors, are you surprised – I guess you explained that outdoor was weak, but are
you surprised that the paint business isn't doing better at this point, or is it really just because of the weather?
<A - Michael A. Jones>: We felt good in the, certainly in the fourth quarter and the first quarter on paint, with both
quarters being above the company average. We can clearly see that we're gaining share in the fourth quarter and first
quarter.
As we look at the second quarter, we can see this clear split, this clear line of demarcation between indoor and outdoor.
We think there's some opportunities for us to continue to enhance our line design. But outside that, we feel real good
about our brands. When you have Sherwin-Williams, Valspar, PPG, Olympic, those exclusive brands are very
powerful. We think it positions us well.
<Q - Michael Baker>: Okay. Lastly, just one more bigger-ticket, Pro. Can you repeat the gap? Did you say 100 basis
points gap? And how does that compare with the previous quarters?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: So the number is 400 basis points.
<Q - Michael Baker>: 400 basis points. Okay.
<A - Robert F. Hull>: Right. Which was slightly higher than what we saw in the first quarter. Also, as you think about
the big-ticket categories in the comp performance above $500, our worst-performing category in the quarter was
outdoor power equipment. Think riding mowers, we've got number-one share. That's a big-ticket category and had a
disproportionate negative impact on that segment of our business.
<Q - Michael Baker>: And why was that weak again? Just the weather, you think?
