Ravi Ganti
Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. I welcome you to Exelon's third quarter 2013 earnings conference
call. Thank you for joining us today. We issued our earnings release this morning. In case you did not receive it, the
release is available on Exelon's investor website.
The earnings release and other matters we will discuss in today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates
that are subject to various risks and uncertainties and the actual results could differ from our forward-looking
statements. Please refer to today's 8-K and Exelon's other filings for a discussion of the factors that may cause the
results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations and for a reconciliation of operating to
GAAP earnings.
Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon's President and CEO; Ken Cornew, Exelon's Chief Commercial Officer
and President and CEO of Exelon Generation and Jack Thayer, Exelon's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial

questions following the prepared remarks. We have scheduled 60 minutes for this call.
I will now turn the call over to Chris.
Christopher M. Crane
Thanks, Ravi. Thanks, everybody, for taking the time to join us this morning. Operationally, we had another strong
quarter with great performance in both the utilities and the entire generation fleet. Financially, the third quarter was
strong and results were higher than our guidance range. The third quarter operating earnings were $0.78 per share.
Jack's going to cover that in more detail in his remarks. Low commodity prices, low load growth and tough retail
margins continue to challenge our industry. While these challenges are mostly beyond our control, we are leveraging
our core competencies to control what we can and influence what we cannot. We're focused on operational excellence,
regulatory advocacy, financial discipline and investment that provides value to our shareholders.
As I said, operationally, we had a good quarter and we're having a very good year. Once again, our Generation fleet
performed at high levels. For the quarter, the nuclear fleet ran at 94.8% capacity factor and during the summer period
had a 97.4% capacity factor. The fossil and the renewable fleet had a strong quarter as well, in particular, the fossil
hydro fleet performed at exceptional level with a dispatch match rate of 99.1%.
The utility performance remains very solid. All three utilities year-to-date improved on the Customer Satisfaction Index
year-over-year, and in some places, we're reaching our highest numbers that we've seen in over a decade. No major
storms did contribute to this favorable quarter for the utilities.
On the regulatory advocacy side, we continue to push on many fronts. The rate case at ComEd and BGE are on
schedule with decisions expected in December for both.
On the RPM stakeholder process, we continue to work with PJM and other stakeholders on improving the capacity
market rules. The stakeholders are discussing reforms in the area of reducing speculation, demand response and
imports. PJM has committed and continues to commit to proposed tariff reforms to FERC in time to take effect before
the next auction in May. We are very pleased with the Federal Court decision on the New Jersey LCAPP program.
Combined with the decision in Maryland, these decisions uphold the principles of the competitive electric markets by
finding state programs, such as these, subsidizing certain power generators are unconstitutional.
Our financial discipline is key to our success. With rightsizing the dividend early in the year, our balance sheet remains
strong and provides us with the flexibility to make investments in challenging times. We continue to look at ways to
strengthen it further. For example, the work that has been done in completing the Continental Wind off balance sheet
financing that was closed earlier this quarter. We believe project financing allows us to grow the business in a credit
supportive manner, and again, Jack is going to cover more of that in detail in his remarks.
On the investment side, we continue to invest in our regulated and merchant businesses to drive value for the
shareholders. On the utility side, we are growing rate base with investments in gas infrastructure, transmission and
distribution systems and the smart grid and smart meter installations.
On the smart meters, the installation of the projects at all three utilities are underway in 2013. BGE has installed over
426,000 meters through the third quarter. PECO is at 465,000 meters, and the ComEd smart meter deployment began in
September is off to a good start installing nearly 10,000 meters in the first month. At Exelon Generation, we've
installed 153 megawatts of solar capacity as part of the AVSR to-date. Now there are two blocks that have been
delayed due to issues on the construction. Jack's going to talk about the impacts on capital and revenue on that when we
go through his comments.
So, for the full-year guidance, given our year-to-date performance, our expectations for the balance of the year, we are
narrowing the full-range guidance from $2.35 to $2.65 to $2.40 to $2.50 (sic) [$2.60] per share.
Now, I'll turn it over to Ken, who will discuss the hedge disclosure and put some color on how we're incorporating the
gas basis into our hedging.

Kenneth W. Cornew
All right. Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. As Chris mentioned, I'll cover changes in natural gas basis, and
how we incorporate these risk while we hedge our portfolio, as well as our hedge disclosures.
If you turn to slide 3, I'll turn to Exelon Generation's results this year and the outlook for the next few years. Challenges
we have faced over the past year have continued over the third quarter. With natural gas modestly down across all
years, power prices mixed across all regions and years, heat rates modestly increased in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest,
very little volatility outside of ERCOT and the retail competition continues to be aggressive.
These factors all combined to put further pressure on our ability to extract margin for our wholesale and retail
businesses. To offset these pressures, we've mentioned $100 million reduction in 2013 O&M during the second quarter
call.
As seen on slide 3, for 2013, the total reduction to gross margin for last quarter is $50 million. While prices were lower,
especially in ERCOT, where summer peak prices came in lower than forecast, our hedge position and execution of
$100 million in our power new business target provided an offset to the open gross margin decrease of $150 million.
Unfortunately, the lack of volatility in other regions and our outlook for the remainder of the year has caused us to
reduce our expectations for incremental margin from our commercial business.
Our non-power business continues to relatively transition from our to-go bucket to our executed bucket. It's important
to note that we expect this $50 million reduction in 2013 to be offset by cost reductions. And Jack will be highlighting
these a bit more as he discusses our full-year guidance.
In 2014 and 2015, our disclosure indicates a reduction of $50 million for each year in the total gross margin. In 2014,
the open gross margin saw a decrease due to a significant peak spark spread drop in ERCOT, as well as a reduction in
the expected output from our wind assets. This was offset in our mark-to-market of hedges by the execution of some of
our power new business to go. In 2015, our gross margin was impacted by price decreases in nearly all regions on our
open position.
As you have heard us say for the last few quarters, the retail space is extremely competitive and challenged. We have
remained disciplined and have not gone after volume for the sake of volume and have maintained appropriate margin
on our sales. We have not seen anything in the market to lead us to believe that we have turned the corner and are
headed for growth in this business, and the guidance we gave previously on retail volumes and margins still stands.
While we expect little to change, we will provide an update to our volumes at EEI.
As we mentioned to you earlier, we will be providing you the details of our 2016 hedge position and gross margin
estimates at EEI in a couple of weeks. If I had to make a statement directionally about what you'll see, I would say our
gross margin estimates would largely be unchanged year-over-year, except for value of our hedges which is simply a
reflection of the amount of hedging we've done for 2016 so far this year.
Going to slide 4, as you know, the impacts of shale gas on the United States energy industry are immense. We have
seen the prompt month price of Henry Hub natural gas fall from its high of $13 in 2008, down to $2 in 2012. The
decline in natural gas prices has had a corresponding impact on power prices.
Much of this gas comes from the Marcellus Shale formation which largely lies within the footprint of the PJM power
grid. A surge in natural gas production has caused a fundamental shift in the pricing structure of gas in the Mid-Atlantic
location, sometimes referred to as basis from a premium-priced area to a discount area. The discount is in relation to
Henry Hub, the primary trading point of U.S. natural gas. The Henry Hub location has historically traded at a discount
to the Northeast region due to its formerly significant gas production in the Gulf of Mexico and confluence of pipelines.
The surge in gas production in the Marcellus has caused this relationship to reverse.
With the rapid expansion of production within Marcellus, we've begun to see what was once approximately a $0.60
premium at M3 to Henry Hub in 2010 move to a discount of approximately $0.25. This change in the basis relationship

was expected and has been in steady decline over the last few years.
Over the next several years, we anticipate new pipelines to be built and some pipelines to reverse enabling the surplus
to be moved to higher-priced areas. This will work in tandem with all other factors that will impact the market such as
expanding LNG exports, exports to Mexico, industrial expansion and gas demand for power generation. A combination
of these factors will stabilize Mid-Atlantic basis and support our fundamental view that natural gas will trade between
$4 and $6 in MMbtu between 2017 and 2020.
Over the last several quarters, our hedging profile has tracked at or ahead of ratable in PJM East. This has limited the
impact of the basis move on our portfolio. Although Chicago basis has also been weaker recently, this has a minimal
impact on PJM power prices at NiHub.
We believe the size of the basis discount seen in the East will not be seen in the Midwest. This view is primarily driven
by local supply and demand and pipeline capabilities for natural gas in the Midwest. We continue to stay behind ratable
in our PJM Midwest power portfolio because of our view that heat rates will expand.
Now, I'll turn it over to Jack to review the full financial information for the quarter.
Christopher M. Crane
Before we go to Jack, I need to correct one thing I said. I said the range was going to $2.40 to $2.50. It's $2.40 to $2.60
is the new range.
Ravi Ganti
Thank you, Chris.
Jonathan W. Thayer
Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone. I'll review the third quarter financial results, our full-year guidance range, key
events of the quarter, and our balance sheet and cash flow outlook starting on slide 5.
And as Chris mentioned earlier, Exelon's results for the quarter exceeded our expectations. Operating earnings for the
third quarter of this year were $0.78 per share, well above our Q3 guidance range of $0.60 to $0.70 per share.
Compared to our guidance, favorability at both ExGen and our utilities drove us well above the range.
While we expected to be at the upper end of the range provided, we continue to limit costs resulting in
lower-than-planned O&M across all our businesses. We are realizing merger synergies faster than forecast and that is
helping results.
Utilities accounted for just over half of the savings compared to guidance. As Ken alluded to earlier, the full-year 2013
RNF production shown in the hedge disclosures was offset by ExGen with lower O&M and interests. The lower O&M
was driven by reduced O&M costs related to outages of power and lower labor and benefit costs. Across our operating
companies, some of the reduced spending were one-time benefits, like fewer than expected large storms. And others
may reverse in the fourth quarter, but in general, our focus and execution on cost management helped drive these
results.
The $0.78 compares to our operating earnings of $0.77 per share during the third quarter of 2012. The
quarter-over-quarter difference was largely driven by improved performance at our utilities, specifically at BGE and
ComEd. I will go into greater detail on the quarter drivers in a few minutes. As Chris mentioned, for the full year, we
are narrowing our guidance range to $2.40 to $2.60 per share from our previous guidance of $2.35 to $2.65 per share.
With our strong year-to-date performance at the utilities, we are bringing up the bottom of our range.

When we look at the fourth quarter, we see some unfavorability in gross margin expectations from our Constellation
business as shown in the hedge disclosures and addressed by Ken during his remarks. As I mentioned earlier, we were
able to offset those reductions with cost savings. Additionally, since our second quarter earnings call, we had delays in
two blocks at our Antelope Valley solar project, moving their in-service date and the related portion of our expected
investment tax credit into the next year. Overall, we're confident that we can deliver 2013 results comfortably within
the revised full-year guidance range.
Please turn to slide 6. Turning to Exelon Generation on slide 6, ExGen's results were $0.05 per share lower
quarter-over-quarter primarily driven by lower RNF due to lower realized energy prices. This was partially offset by
higher capacity prices, favorable nuclear performance, lower income tax primarily due to AVSR investment tax credit
benefits and lower O&M costs due to merger synergies.
Before I turn to the quarterly earnings for the utilities on slide 7, let me provide a brief update on our load forecast. In
general, we saw a slight dip in our load expectations for the full year compared to the update I provided on last quarter's
call. This decrease was largely driven by lower residential usage during the summer and some uncertainty about the
economy heading into the fourth quarter driven by the recent government shutdown.
Our overall load growth yield is still very modest and virtually flat for the full-year 2013, when excluding the impact of
RG Steel's bankruptcy for BGE. More detail on the utility load can be found in the Appendix on slide 19.
ComEd's earnings increased $0.05 per share compared to earnings in the prior period last year. This is primarily driven
by the benefits of higher distribution revenue due to the recovery of pension costs, additional investments that resulted
in a growing rate base, and higher allowed ROE from a rise in Treasury rates. These are partially offset by unfavorable
weather compared to the third quarter of 2012 when Northern Illinois experienced above-average heat.
PECO's earnings decreased $0.03 per share compared to the earnings in the prior period last year. This decrease is a
result of one-time items that occurred last year with favorable weather and a benefit from the gas distribution tax
repairs deduction not repeating this year.
BGE's earnings increased $0.06 per share compared to the earnings in the prior period last year. The combination of
lower storm costs, without the derecho storm from July 2012, and improved electric and gas rates helped improve
BGE's quarter-over-quarter earnings.
Third quarter saw further progress for utilities in the regulatory and legislative arena. During this quarter, BGE filed its
Strategic Infrastructure Development and Enhancement, or STRIDE, plan to accelerate the modernization of its natural
gas distribution system. In addition, ComEd and BGE continue with their rate case proceedings that were filed earlier
this year. The ComEd distribution formula rate filing requests an increase of $353 million which reflects actual 2012
expenses and investments and forecasted 2013 capital additions to our distribution network.
We expect the decision by year-end with the new rates going into effect in January of 2014. Additional information on
the ComEd rate filing can be found on slide 20 in the appendix. BGE's ongoing rate case with the Maryland PSC
requests an increase of $86.2 million for electric and $24.4 million for gas, adjusted for the actual data submitted in
August of this year. We expect the final order in mid-December with new rates going into effect shortly thereafter.
BGE rate case details are shown on slide 21 of the presentation.
Slide 8 provides an update of our cash flow expectations for this year. We project cash from operations of $5.8 billion.
This is up from last quarter by about $225 million. The primary driver of the increase was favorable working capital at
ExGen, mainly driven by higher accounts payable related to the AVSR project delays.
Our CapEx forecast is decreased by $70 million from last quarter, mainly due to the AVSR construction delay I
mentioned earlier and some lower-than-projected spend at the utilities. That decrease was partially offset by additional
wind and non-AVSR solar project spend. Our current five-year plan includes $16 billion in growth CapEx with
approximately $13.5 billion of that at the utilities where we have the ability to earn a stable rate of return. On the
financing side, we have long-term debt issuances at both ComEd and PECO during the third quarter.

In August, ComEd issued $350 million of 30-year bonds with an annual interest rate of 4.6%. In September, PECO's
bond issuance was for $550 million including $300 million of three-year bonds with a 1.2% annual interest rate, and
$250 million of 30-year bonds with a 4.8% annual interest rate. We do not anticipate any additional long-term bond
issuances during the remainder of the year. Our expected financing cash flows are $150 million lower than what we
provided in our second quarter update. With the decrease largely driven by reduced AVSR Department of Energy loan
draw given the construction delays I previously referenced.
On slide 9, in late September, Exelon completed the largest ever wind financed transaction, Continental Wind, a
667-megawatt portfolio of 13 projects located in six states and across five different wind regimes, issued $613 million
of project-financed bonds with a 6% coupon maturing in February 2033. Net proceeds were dividended up to Exelon
Generation. This financing is non-recourse to Exelon and solely dependent on the cash flows of Continental. The
transaction is consistent with our previously communicated strategy to use project financing as a means of
strengthening ExGen and Exelon's credit metrics.
As a reminder, the appendix includes several schedules that will help you in your modeling efforts. Now, I'll turn the
call back to Chris for his concluding remarks before we open the call for Q&A.
Christopher M. Crane
Thanks, Jack. There have been a few reports in the past month commenting on the impact of the lower gas and power
prices on our earnings. I think these reports all assume that we'll sit on our hands and not take any action and the
market participants will not rationalize their behavior. In fact, we continue to take a hard look at our assets and
determine their economic viability. We will shut down facilities that we do not see a path to a long-term sustainable
profitability. We've built our record on reducing costs and improving productivity of our business which is shown in
the $550 million of synergies from our merger exceeding our original estimate. We are hedging our portfolio to reflect
our fundamental view of the market that it will improve.
We continue to look for opportunities to grow. We will continue to advocate for public policies and market designs that
properly compensate our fleet, victories in the court and the legislative and regulatory fronts that will support our
pricing. We'll continue to optimize the use of capital structures, different capital structures like the Continental Wind
project financing. And our current view of some of the analysts on Exelon's expect performance is not worth – excuse
me. The current view of some of the analysts on Exelon's expected performance is not what we see it to be. We believe
that the analysts have it very wrong, and we will act to change that.
With that, I'll open it up for questions.

<Q - Greg Gordon>: You guys have been doing a good job on the cost side, can you tell me – I think we've been
assuming the total O&M and TOTI at ExGen, if you include C&G of around $5 billion, but given the headway that
you've made on costs this year, could you tell us what the right run rate is as we go into 2014?
<A - Jonathan W. Thayer>: Greg, as you mentioned, we have pulled out a substantial amount of cost out and we will
update on our O&M at EEI. But I think it's safe to assume we are in the midst of our five-year planning process that
we're targeting flat O&M across the business plan on ExGen.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Okay. The second question is and this goes to a statement you made earlier and I think that you
reiterated. There's a view that this negative gas basis that we're seeing in Pennsylvania is going to migrate west as the
REX pipeline partially flips around. Can you go into a little bit more detail why you feel like the expectation that
negative basis permeates west is incorrect?
<A - Joseph Nigro>: Greg, good morning. It's Joe Nigro. There's a couple of reasons for that. The first is, I think,
you're right. We do expect the REX pipeline to move gas out of the Mid-Atlantic into the Midwest. Historically, we
have seen the need for inflows to the Midwest area of natural gas to meet the demand and they've historically come out
of Canada and the Gulf Coast. We would expect to see the displacement from the gas moving in from the Mid-Atlantic
and displacing that gas that historically has come out of Canada and the Gulf.
I think the other important point to mention, though, Greg, is the gas basis is one component of it, when you look at our
– when we look at our fundamental forecasting and do all the puts and takes of what we expect from a generation
change perspective over the next few years, you still only have gas on the margin. A lot less than you do in the
Mid-Atlantic. So, the impact on the gas basis change when we see a $0.25 change in gas basis lower, for example, the
impact on power pricing is less than $0.25 a megawatt hour. So, when you convert that to power, the impact isn't nearly
as great.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Great. A final question for Chris and I don't know how much of this you want to answer. But
obviously, also a lot has been written about the potential for further consolidation in PJM. You guys have done a
remarkably good job notwithstanding the bad overall macroeconomic environment of making the best of your merger
with Constellation. Would you try to – do you think that in Exelon's future there's further consolidation given your –
how you've refined your expertise in managing costs and optimizing portfolios?
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: Greg, we've continually supported further consolidation in the industry, not only across
PJM where it can be done but in other RTOs, also. We have a small group that's constantly looking at value-accretive
potentials and will continue to look at that as we go forward.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Thank you, guys.
Operator
The next question comes from the line of Dan Eggers.
<Q - Daniel Eggers>: Hey. Good morning, guys.
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: Good morning, Dan.
<Q - Daniel Eggers>: Chris, I guess, just kind of following up at the end of your comments, you kind of talked about
the idea that you're looking at the fleet and rationalizing assets if they don't make sense or you don't see a recovery as
you guys expect. How do you frame out the timing of making those kind of decisions relative to kind of the
longstanding internal point of view that market conditions are going to recover?
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: So, we think through 2014 into the first part of 2015, we should see the uplift in the
market. If we have it wrong, then we – there are some assets that we'll have to look at for the long-term profitability,
and that would be around the timeframe that I think there would be a very serious conversation taking place.

<Q - Daniel Eggers>: So you're saying kind of it would be about 12 months from now is kind of the time horizon you
think that would be kind of the natural progression to see a recovery?
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: Yes.
<Q - Daniel Eggers>: Okay. And then I guess you guys have talked previously about freeing up some capital because
of the dividend reduction earlier this year, the idea of potentially buying more assets or getting more contracted assets.
Can you just share your thinking on, A, what you're seeing in those markets and B, with some downward pressure on
your – the upper end of your open gross margins and ExGen, is that going to have a bearing on the timing of maybe
deploying that capital?
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: Jack, do you want to go...
<A - Jonathan W. Thayer>: Sure. So, Dan, you've heard us speak about the reduction in dividend gives us between $1
billion and $2 billion of balance sheet space or growth capital that we could use and deploy. As we've looked at various
markets and assets, interestingly, you're seeing, in certain markets, very attractive pricing from a ownership standpoint
in ERCOT and obviously, we're a very major owner that isn't necessarily translating into perceived value into our
merchant fleet.
In other markets, there have been recent transactions in New England as well at attractive values and as you know,
through our BostonGen acquisition, we are a significant owner in that region as well. There hasn't been a lot – I would
say, there's been a whole lot of speculation about PJM. There hasn't been any actual assets. And so, we'll watch as will
others as other companies may look to strategically realign to a more regulated footprint.

Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fleishman.
<Q - Steven Fleishman>: Yeah. Hi. Good morning. First, a question for Ken, I think Ken you mentioned briefly you'll
be giving the 2016 margin information, and I think you said 2016 will be kind of flattish with 2015. Is that on an open
basis, open gross margin?
<A - Kenneth W. Cornew>: Steve, I would say, if you look at our hedge disclosure and go down the lines between
2015 and 2016, we will relatively see flat 2015 to 2016 in open in several other areas. I would say we have a
mark-to-market of hedges in 2015, that's $450 million. We have been hedging 2016, and we have positive
mark-to-market value with those hedges as well. And I just wanted to make sure you all were thinking about that, and
we'll go into much more detail at EEI in a couple of weeks.
<Q - Steven Fleishman>: Okay. But is the flattish more open, or could it even be on a hedged margin?
<A - Kenneth W. Cornew>: The flattish is on open and in several areas. On the hedge, there is a lower hedged –
mark-to-market of hedges in 2016 and 2015, but it's not drastic. We have positive mark-to-market value. And like I
said I'd like to go through that more detail at EEI.
<Q - Steven Fleishman>: Okay. And then Chris, just your comment at the end of the call that the – your view that the
analysts have it wrong with all the recent downgrades, when you say that, how much of that is the analysts have the
kind of power market view wrong versus if the power market stays just as it is, that you can continue to do more to
make sure Exelon handles the conditions better. Could you just give a little color where you see people having it
wrong?
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: Yeah. I'll start and will let Ken continue to fill in the blanks. We've talked about this
upside in 2015, with the 22 gigawatts coming out. There has to be a market rationalization of that. There's a tightening
of the stack. We have gone back and the team is in process of modeling asset by asset again in the stack to make sure

we have it right. We'll have more details on that at EEI, which, Ken, you want to fill in?
<A - Kenneth W. Cornew>: Yeah, Steve, I think we're making a couple of comments there. Chris talked about what
we see is upside and I sound like a broken record when I do this, but I'm going to do it again. In 2013 so far at NiHub,
we're seeing an 8.6 heat rate, we're seeing close to $32 power prices. And then when you look out the curve, you see
you have sub $31 prices until 2016, with contango in gas and you see heat rates that are a full point lower.
We scrub and continue to scrub our modeling of coal retirements. We look at all the announcements and the activity
that's going on in the market, whether it's a plant that some may think we're retiring and are now being converted to
natural gas. Whether it's some plants that a lot of people didn't think are retiring that are retiring. And we've actually –
given the latest information we've seen on coal plants, we actually are a little more bullish in our analytics about our $2
to $4 upside. Because we, quite frankly, have been conservative and had some plants running on coal long-term that
now have been announced they're either being converted to gas, which will take them up the stack and not running
nearly as much, or actually retiring.
So, we do think when the spot market rationalizes itself in 2015, 2016 you're going to see a very different heat rate
environment than what the forward market's projecting. I think the other thing that's important to realize here is, as
Chris said, we're going to be very disciplined and rational about our actions if this is the market and we're not going to
sit on the current market valuations and prices and do nothing about it.
So, I think that's what we're trying to say. We do think the market will improve. We do think we need to be
compensated fairly for the assets and what we provide with our fleet, and we're going to work hard at it.
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: It's hard to get your head wrapped around an implied valuation for our nukes at $100 a
KW.
<Q - Steven Fleishman>: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Good morning. Can you hear me?
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: Yep. We hear you fine. Thanks.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Excellent. So, first, just in light of the latest transaction, Energy Edison. I'd be curious
just to get your views in terms of what that did to the market versus your $2 to $4 expectations, if you could.
<A - Jonathan W. Thayer>: Julien, I'll let – I think I just commented on that at some level, but let me let Joe Nigro
dive into that a little more for you.
<A - Joseph Nigro>: Good morning, Julien. We take into account all the changes that we see in the generation stack
when we run our analytics or our fundamental forecasting. We've seen a number of changes, though, for the quarter
with some units that we expected to remain in the generation stack actually retiring, some units that we expected to be
refueled no longer going to continue operations. We've seen some of the announcement of what specifically NRG plans
to do with refueling some of the assets that they'd be acquiring from EME.
When we take all of that into account, as Ken mentioned a minute ago, we still see that $2 to $4 of upside in the market
when you look at the changes coming to the generation stack between the increased dispatch cost for the coal that
remains, the increased costs for plants that are going to refuel, you're talking about PRB coal plants that currently
dispatch at $25 a megawatt hour in a refuel environment they're closer to $40 a megawatt hour. So that has an uptick to
energy and then we continue to see that 20-plus gigawatts of coal retirement that we expect in PJM alone. And when
you put it all together, as Ken said, we expect to see the $2 to $4 of upside.

<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: And perhaps conversely, what do you think about the wind impact, perhaps, in
subsequent years offsetting these retirements?
<A - Joseph Nigro>: Yeah. There's a couple elements to that. We do see the impact of wind greater and greater,
especially on some of the plants at the nodal level or at the generation busbar specific level, but we do factor that all
into our modeling. In the disclosures that we provide you, represent the values of what we'd expect the plants to receive
at the generation busbar and we take that all into account.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Excellent. And then, perhaps, this is more of just a high level. As you think about your
disclosures, the non-power margin of executed versus to go, just thinking about the to go side of that. For 2013, you're
talking about that was $400 million executed; $200 million in theory to go. Given where we are in the year, how do you
think about achieving that to go piece? Is that sort of in theory something that you achieve more on a spot basis in a sort
of transactional sense, or is that something that you still need to sign contracts to get? I'm just trying to understand what
you're say.
<A - Joseph Nigro>: Yeah. There's a couple of elements to that. The non-power bucket includes our fuels business
both on the retail and wholesale side. It includes our services business on the retail side, so that would be energy
efficiency, demand response, our BGE Home business, our Solar business, and then lastly, it includes the results of our
proprietary trading book.
What I would say is, as noted in disclosure, the gross-up of our services businesses are extensive. It really inflates the
amount that remains to go. So, the results of these businesses have been reflected on an EBIT basis in our earnings
guidance. The gross-up of those businesses, the way it's reflected, is approximately $100 million. So, we're in line,
generally, with the expectations that we remain with that non-power to go business. And again, it's across the three
areas that I mentioned, our services business, the seasonality to our fuels business, and then finally, our proprietary
trading results.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Great. Go for it.
<A - Kenneth W. Cornew>: Julien, just to reiterate, though, a large piece of that is run rate business on our services
and our natural gas sales that renew themselves on a monthly basis.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Great, and a quick clarification actually on a prior question, when you were referring
to Texas and New England, is it that you want to acquire more there, or is that it's a potential sales opportunity? Sorry,
if it wasn't clear.
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: We are looking at growing the portfolio where it makes sense and we see good returns.
Conversely, if we think the market's right and it's a good time to harvest capital, we would also sell assets.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Got you.
<A - Jonathan W. Thayer>: And, Julian, some of the reference that similar to the Continental Wind financing, there
are opportunities that we can look at within certain of our parts of our fleet that could be considered non-core, to look at
that structured finance opportunity as another means of extracting value. So ERCOT, New England, and then our
Hydro assets would be areas where we might consider pursuing that activity as well as incremental financing at the
Continental Holding company level.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: So project finance at some of the thermal assets?
<A - Jonathan W. Thayer>: Correct.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Great. Thanks again.

Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold.
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: Hey, Jon.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Hi. Could I – I just want to revisit the last question Julien had there. On Texas, I think you
talked about sort of a disconnect between asset values and sort of expectations in the market, something like that. And
are you – could you comment on recent changes in expectations around market structure and are you more inclined to
be a buyer or a seller in that market?
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: We would like to be more of a buyer in the ERCOT market where we see the market
rules going. The most recent assets that have traded have been slightly above a value that we would put on them. So,
we'll still participate. Nothing I've seen yet would say it's time to liquidate. We think there's upside to that market. So,
there's upside to those asset valuations for the ones we have, and we'll continue to participate as things come to the
market. But other entities have placed a slightly higher value on them that we can see getting out of them.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Okay. That's great. Thank you, Chris. And then, can I just – on the sort of wind question
in the Midwest, either this is Ken or Joe. Is there a way of giving us a sense – you see that forward curve but obviously
it's made up of expectations around hourly pricing. As you look out into 2014, 2015 and 2016, how much of an impact
does sort of incremental hours of potentially negative pricing have on the sort of aggregate calendar year strip that we
look at? Is there any help you can give us on that?
<A - Joseph Nigro>: Yeah. We've seen negative prices at some of our nuclear plants up to call it 15% of the hours.
When we looked at the modeling that we do, we see that there's constraints on the system and congestion, and we take
that into account when we're building the value of the disclosure up from the bottoms up, I would call it. So, we're not
marking the generators to a NiHub price. We're marking the generators to a busbar price that has an expectation of
what the congestion and marginal losses will look like at each of those plants for each of the years. And that included in
that is the expectation of what the wind development will be in that time period and the impact that it has.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: So, is there – are you saying that you'll have more wind but more infrastructure and it's
kind of a wash?
<A - Joseph Nigro>: Yeah. We continue to grow the wind development in the Midwest, and we've continued to see
degradation in the basis value of some of our plants. And that degradation is reflected in the buildup of our disclosure.
We do expect as you get out past the period that we've disclosed with some transmission changes, you could see
possible improvement. But that's not reflected in this current disclosure. This current disclosure reflects the degradation
that we've seen.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Is that 15%, is that specific to sort of like history and it's going to get worse from there, or
is that what you're expecting it to become?
<A - Jonathan W. Thayer>: Yeah. Let me bring it up, and then summarize, then I'm going to have Joe Dominguez
talk about project we've got in the short term to mitigate it. So, what we've taken in the model is the most conservative
with the RPS standards and the state's being fully met. Then we have that with a lot of inflow coming from MISO into
the system and the negative impacts of the worst-case scenario of meeting the full RPS standard is in the models. So,
that's – we're not betting on something better to happen with that. But in the meantime, Joe, why don't you cover the
project that you have in place there?
<A - Joseph Dominguez>: Sure. And just, as Joe said, we're seeing 14% to 15% of off-peak hours at the power facility
that is most exposed to the problem. It is not a problem that we faced at every one of our nuclear units. In fact, the
problem really exits where you would imagine it would geographically more located to where the wind is coming
across the seam. We have been working – I think this has been reported in the press and by some of you – we've been
working with PJM to ramp our nuclear assets down at night when we're seeing a negative pricing event or when PJM is
seeing a negative pricing event. We work with PJM, the market monitor, to formulate a program that allows us to start
doing that on a pilot basis. We've experienced the first couple evolutions of that.

It is difficult for us to capture all of these events because the events are ultimately as unpredictable as the wind itself,
but that's one method that we're working through. The other thing that we've accomplished is some rule changes in
MISO where the intermittent resources now have to have a price bid into the system which will allow for their
dispatchability.
We've seen some improvement in negative pricing events really as a function of that rule change. I think as Joe
indicated, this problem is very much a part of the transmission constraints that these plants face. So, as different plants
get the benefit of our transmission expansion programs and other transmission work that is occurring in Illinois, it
wouldn't necessarily be the case that the problem is going to increase, for example, from 14% to something greater in
the off-peak hours.
It is, however, an issue, and it's an issue that has driven us to take positions on the production tax credit and other
incentive programs that are distorting the margin. And that really explains the company's position over the last couple
of years when Chris talked about the ongoing policy where it's going to continue to evolve across all of these areas, the
subsidy work as well as the regulatory response to the subsidies, so that we can try to clear up this problem as best we
can.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Can you quantify the offsets?
<A - Joseph Dominguez>: Well, I don't think so yet. But I think it's fair to say that for example the plant that we
experienced the 14% impact in 2012, that impact is significantly less. I'm going to call it a 4% to 6% lower in 2013 as a
result of some transmission expansion. We'll see now how the market reacts to this. It's hard for me to differentiate
between the dispatchable intermittent resource rule that was accomplished in MISO and the transmission work, but I
think we could marginally improve it.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Thank you, guys.
<A - Joseph Dominguez>: That said, it's a continuing problem.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Thank you for all the detail.
<A - Joseph Dominguez>: Yeah. Sure.

Our next question comes from Hugh Wynne.
<Q - Hugh de Neufville Wynne>: Hi. I wonder if you might comment on the demand assumptions that underpin your
outlook for the power market recovery. And in particular, what are your expectations for energy efficiency gains just
looking at page 19 of your slide deck, it seems like we're seeing declines in power demand across the regulated utility
system, so that's the first question. And the second question is what are your assumptions for the shape of the load
going forward? And in particular, will there be a flattening of demand as demand response gets bid into the energy
market in PJM?
<A - Joseph Nigro>: Hugh, it's Joe. A couple of things. From a demand perspective, we forecast about 0.008% load
growth in our $2 to $4 of modeling across the PJM footprint. So, historically, you've seen a conversion rate of, call it,
0.006% versus a 1% change in GDP. We're down to about 0.003% conversion and it's on the back of what's you're
talking about, energy efficiency and demand response.
In addition to that, we've run a sensitivity that if we were flat over the five-year horizon with zero load growth, the
impact to that $2 to $4 is about $1 a megawatt hour just to give you some frame of reference of what the load growth
value represents. I think to your question on the shape of the load flattening, I think it's safe to say we have seen that
already, given the fact that we have seen a substantial amount of demand response, and we have seen the impact of
energy efficiency. I think the element that I would add, though, in our $2 to $4 of modeling, we don't include any
upside associated with the rule changes in PJM as it relates to demand response bidding into the energy marketing.

For frame of reference, we saw a couple of times this summer where the first energy market went to $1,800 a megawatt
hour on the back of demand response bidding. And I think, just as importantly, from the Exelon perspective, in
September, during the heat wave, given some generation outages and transmission outages, they implemented about a
6,000 megawatts demand response, that, if you're bidding in the energy market, would have had a price associated with
it that would have made this LMP look very different than it actually did.
So, yes, it does flatten the load but I think there is an ancillary benefit when you think about what price that demand
response will be bid in at and it could set the locational marginal price.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Great. Thanks very much.

The next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Good morning. Most of my questions have been addressed but I wanted to just go back to the
retail business a bit and Ken, I think you said that the margin outlook is unchanged. I wondered if you might be able to
just talk a little bit about just competitive dynamics in the business, any trends you're seeing in terms of degree of
competition or changes in the business over time?
<A - Joseph Nigro>: Stephen, it's Joe Nigro. Good morning. Our retail business is – the market environment overall
still remains extremely competitive. And it's extremely competitive both on the commercial and industrial side and on
the mass market side.
What I would say to you is we've seen some stabilizing effect on our margins, meaning, we've talked to you that our
margins on the C&I side for power have been sub-$2 and they remained so, but they've stabilized slightly below that
and our expectation in our plan as we look at next year is not to see much improvement in that area. We have seen
consolidation with what went on with the Hess book with Direct Energy and the process of buying that but the market
is still highly competitive.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Okay. Thank you. And then just hitting on the heat rate outlook, you had spent quite a bit of
time on the Midwest. As you look at it, PJM East and West, what's your general view from where we stand now in
terms of the heat rate outlook in the East and West?
<A - Joseph Nigro>: I think Ken mentioned this earlier, we still hold the view of $2 to $4 of upside and $2 when we
reflect it is on the Eastern side of PJM and it's driven – really when you look at the changing composition of the
dispatch stack and the locational marginal price model, there are still hours that the Eastern units benefit from that
change to the dispatch stack. So, we have seen the degradation in basis as we talked about the gas basis that market
basis is reflected in our analytical modeling and we're using those prices. And with all of that, we do see the $2 of
upside expected in the Mid-Atlantic.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Great. Thank you very much.

<Q - Brian J. Chin>: Just a point of clarification on the gross margin comment earlier. When you said that the gross
margin, generally, is unchanged year-over-year in 2016, were you referring to only the open gross margin row or were
you talking about the total gross margin, the $7.6 billion?
<A - Kenneth W. Cornew>: Brian, the open gross margin's unchanged. Most of our disclosure lines like power new
business, non-power margins, those elements are largely going to be unchanged. We are hedging so we do have
positive value in the mark-to-market of hedges. We will disclose exactly what that is in a couple of weeks. So, I was
referring to a similar 2015 to 2016 outlook except for that we have had less hedging, so somewhat less mark-to-market
of hedge value.
<Q - Brian J. Chin>: Okay. Great. And then just as a reminder, the open gross margin includes capacity revenue, so
the drop in 2016 capacity revenues is obviously being offset by something else in your open gross margin comment?
<A - Jonathan W. Thayer>: That's correct.
<Q - Brian J. Chin>: Okay. Great. And then just my second follow-up question, we've seen other competitors out
there where they've used a yieldco structure to tap the lower cost of equity for consolidation purposes. Can you just
comment a little bit on to what extent does that present either challenges or opportunities for you and how you think
consolidation can progress as far as Exelon's concerned?
<A - Jonathan W. Thayer>: So, Brian, this is Jack. Where you've seen a yieldco, particularly at NRG, have success,
they really have a shareholder base that values and owns those shares on the basis of exposure to power markets and on
an EBITDA multiple basis. They had a modest dividend but they had an opportunity to carve off assets into a
yield-oriented vehicle to optimize that. I think people own us for both our upside in the power markets but also our
dividend. And certainly, our renewables assets and the contracted nature of them as it factors into our ability to pay a
dividend and drive value and reduce volatility in the earnings profile of the company, we think create value.
That said, we do look at many structures and we certainly have assets that align to those types of structures. And to the
extent that the price of capital for those structures and the need to acquire assets drives the markets higher, then the
implied value of our renewables fleet should improve along with that.
<Q - Brian J. Chin>: Does the renewables fleet that you own now more merit a closer look towards a yieldco structure
so that way you can compete on a similar cost-of-equity footing?
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: I think it has us look at more project financing for the credit quality that it gives us and
then bringing that cash back in for investment.
<A - Jonathan W. Thayer>: And the reality is, Brian, as you know, we can tap many markets to secure capital to
grow our business. And if you think about who the investors are in those yield-oriented names, whether they're pension
funds or insurance companies or other elements, we're tapping similar capital, as Chris mentioned, through the project
financing side. We could through other means secure capital as well from those entities at a lower cost of capital. And
there are opportunities in a non-public vehicle to form relationships with entities to benefit from that lower cost of
capital. So, rest assured, we're looking at any and all ways to optimize the cost of capital for our company as we look to
deploy capital for growth. And the implied yield or cost of capital on certain of those yieldcos is not lost on us.
<Q - Brian J. Chin>: Thank you very much and see you at EEI.
<A - Jonathan W. Thayer>: Thanks. I think we have time for one more call?

this space. Does your cash flow outlook also assume a scenario where EDF may put the nuclear assets to you as early
as 2016 in what could potentially be a pretty challenging quark spread environment? And I have a follow-up.
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: Yeah. We do stress the balance sheet for any potential commitments that have to be
made. If you look in the disclosure, we have the like-kind-exchange issue in the out years that we feel that we're going
to prevail on but there was a probability shift and we had to put that in the disclosure and we stressed the balance sheet
to make that commitment. Before we agreed to the EDF potential put, we made sure that that was stressed. So, we are
very comfortable where we're at right now with the balance sheet.
<A - Jonathan W. Thayer>: And remember, as part of that contract, there's a baseball arbitrage type of valuation
approach. So, to the extent we're in a challenged quark spread market then that should show up in the implied value of
those assets, thereby reducing the put value.
<Q - Shar Pourreza>: And then let me just – just one more question is under an assumption that the power price for
heat rate recovery doesn't materialize and you find yourself in a scenario where you're rationalizing your fleet. A couple
of the assets in those put options could also face cash flow challenges. I'm kind of curious on how the change in
outlook could impact that transaction, do you have like a clause where you can back out of the transaction or is it
essentially the flexibility is going to come where the economic value of the assets are?
<A - Jonathan W. Thayer>: Yeah. That's where the flexibility comes and if their negative NPV and then a negative
cash flow would be in the valuation, and so they're really not worth anything in a baseball arbitration. And so, we don't
feel stressed over the deal. We think the upside we're getting from driving the synergies, the cost savings out of it is the
real focus of this.
<Q - Shar Pourreza>: Terrific. Thanks so much.
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: All right. Thanks.
