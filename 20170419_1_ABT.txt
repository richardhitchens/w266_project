MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Abbott's first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. All
participants will be able to listen only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. [Operator Instructions] This
call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participants' questions asked during the
question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by
Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's express written permission.
I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice President, Investor Relations.
Scott Leinenweber
Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Miles White, Chairman of the Board and Chief
Executive Officer; and Brian Yoor, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Miles will provide
opening remarks and Brian will discuss our performance in more detail. Following their comments, Miles, Brian and I
will take your questions.
Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2017. Abbott cautions that these
forward-looking statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially
from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other
factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to our Annual Report on Securities

On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand
Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable
GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today which are available on our
website at abbott.com.
Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to comparable operational sales growth which adjusts
the 2016 basis of comparison to include results for St. Jude Medical and to exclude the impact of exchange as well as
current and historical results for Abbott's Medical Optics business and St. Jude's vascular closure business, which were
divested during the first quarter of 2017. Comparable growth also reflects a reduction to St. Jude's historic sales related
to administrative fees paid to group purchasing organizations in order to conform with Abbott's presentation.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles.
Miles D. White
Okay. Thanks, Scott. Good morning.
Today we reported ongoing earnings per share of $0.48, exceeding our previous guidance range. Sales increased 3% in
the quarter, which is at the upper end of our expectations. Our full year 2017 adjusted earnings per share guidance of
$2.40 to $2.50 remains unchanged and reflects double-digit growth at the midpoint.
As you know, we completed several important strategic steps during the quarter to shape our company for sustainable
long-term growth including the acquisition of St. Jude Medical, which establishes Abbott as a leader in the medical
device arena. The combination with St. Jude positions Abbott with one of the strongest new product pipelines in the
industry, including several recently launched products that are setting new treatment standards and contributing growth
today. The combined portfolio had the depth, breadth and innovation to help patients restore their health and deliver
greater value to customers and payers.
In terms of the integration of St. Jude into Abbott, the team has made tremendous progress over the first few months of
the year and we're on track to meet our objectives. The newly-formed leadership team reflects a blend of Abbott and St.
Jude leaders, and importantly the team has remained focused on achieving its new product milestones, synergy targets
and financial objectives for the year.
Additionally, last week, Abbott and Alere announced that the companies have agreed to amend the existing terms of
our agreement to acquire Alere. Point-of-care testing remains an attractive growth segment within the in vitro
diagnostics market, and the acquisition of Alere will significantly expand our diagnostics presence and leadership in
that space.
I'll now summarize our first quarter results before turning the call over to Brian, and I'll start with Diagnostics where
we achieved sales growth of nearly 5% in the quarter, in line with expectations. Growth in the quarter was led by
continued above-market performance in core laboratory and point-of-care Diagnostics. During the quarter, we initiated
the launch of our new Alinity systems in Europe with the ongoing roll-out of four new instruments in the areas of
immunoassay, clinical chemistry, blood screening and point-of-care. Later this year, we plan to launch two additional
Alinity instruments in Europe in the areas of hematology and molecular diagnostics, which will be followed by the
initial roll-out of the Alinity suite of instruments in the U.S. during 2018.
In Nutrition, sales declined 1% in the quarter. As expected, challenging market conditions in China impacted the results
of our international pediatric business. As we previously discussed, we expect these market challenges to persist
throughout the year, but continue to hold a favorable outlook on the Chinese infant formula market on a longer-term
basis. With the pending new regulations in China, we remain confident that our supply chain and product portfolio is
well positioned to meet evolving customer preferences and purchasing channels.
In the U.S., we continue to achieve above-market performance in pediatric nutrition with a portfolio of innovative
product offerings for infants and toddlers. And in adult nutrition, where Abbott is the global leader, high single-digit

international growth in the quarter was led by continued expansion of Abbott's market-leading brand, Ensure, across
many international markets.
In Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, sales growth of roughly 6% was led by double-digit growth in key emerging
markets, including above-market growth in Latin America, China, and several markets in Southeast Asia. Our
continued focus on enhancing local capabilities and expanding our product portfolio within core therapeutic areas,
targeted specifically to address local market needs, continues to strengthen Abbott's unique position in these markets.
And in Medical Devices, which comprises our new cardiovascular and neuromodulation business along with our
diabetes care business, sales grew 4.5% in the quarter. Sales growth in cardiovascular and neuromodulation was led by
double-digit growth in electrophysiology, structural heart, and neuromodulation.
In electrophysiology, we initiated the U.S. launch of our EnSite Precision cardiac mapping system, which provides
physicians with improved automation and three-dimensional images to better treat irregular heartbeats.
Growth in structural heart was led by continued double-digit growth of MitraClip, our market-leading device for the
repair of mitral regurgitation. And in neuromodulation, growth was led by recently launched products, including Burst
for the treatment of chronic pain and deep brain stimulation for the treatment of movement disorders such as
Parkinson's disease.
During the first part of the year, we also achieved several important new product milestones across the business,
including U.S. FDA approval for our MRI-compatible pacemaker, the European launch of our Confirm implantable
cardiac monitor, and submission of our MRI-compatible ICD device for FDA review.
In diabetes care, international sales growth of 29% was driven by FreeStyle Libre, our innovative sensor-based glucose
monitoring system that eliminates the need for routine fingersticks. Now available in more than 30 countries outside the
U.S., we continue to see strong demand as consumers, healthcare professionals, and payers recognize the cost, comfort,
and convenience advantages that Libre offers.
So in summary, our first quarter results reflect a strong start to the year. The integration of St. Jude is going well, and
we're on track to achieve our projected synergy targets. And as we continue to execute on our key business priorities,
we expect to deliver on our double-digit ongoing EPS growth target for the full year.
I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results and our outlook for the year in more detail. Brian?
Brian B. Yoor
Okay. Thanks, Miles. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise
noted, are on a comparable basis, which is consistent with the guidance we provided back in January.
Turning to our results, sales for the first quarter increased 3.2% on an operational basis. Exchange had an unfavorable
impact of 0.6% on sales, resulting in reported sales growth of 2.6% in the quarter.
Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 59.2% of sales. Adjusted R&D investment
was 8% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was 32.5% of sales. The over-delivery in the first quarter EPS compared
to our guidance was primarily due to timing of spending and certain non-operating items. I'd note that while exchange
rates eased somewhat since our call in January, the fall-through impact on our first quarter results was fairly modest,
taking into account our hedging program and the lag time that it takes for rate changes to work through our product
costs.
Before I review our financial outlook, I'd note that our sales and adjusted EPS forecasts do not include any contribution
associated with the Alere acquisition, which is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2017, subject to certain
closing conditions. We will provide an update regarding the expected financial impact of this transaction at a later date.

So, turning to our outlook for the full year 2017, we continue to forecast operational sales growth in the mid-single
digits. And based on current exchange rates, exchange would have a negative impact of around 1% on our full-year
reported sales. We continue to forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 60% of sales for the full year, which
reflects the profitability mix of Abbott and St. Jude as well as underlying gross margin improvement across our
businesses. We continue to forecast adjusted R&D investment of somewhat above 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A
expense of approximately 30% of sales, which includes expense synergies associated with the addition of St. Jude.
Turning to our outlook for the second quarter of 2017, we forecast an adjusted EPS of $0.59 to $0.61. We forecast
operational sales growth in the low to mid-single digits, and at current rates, expect exchange would have a negative
impact of around 1.5%. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio around 60% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of
around 7.5% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense of approximately 30.5% of sales. Finally, we project specified items
of $0.55 in the second quarter, primarily reflecting intangible amortization and expenses associated with acquisitions.
Before we open the call for questions, I will now provide a quick overview of our second quarter comparable
operational sales growth outlook by business. For Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast high single-digit sales
growth. In Nutrition, we now forecast low single-digit sales growth for both the second quarter and the full year. In
Diagnostics, we forecast sales to increase mid-single digits.
Turning to Medical Devices, in diabetes care, we forecast double-digit sales growth. And lastly, in our cardiovascular
and neuromodulation business, we forecast relatively flat comparable sales growth in the second quarter, which
includes a difficult comparison versus last year when sales were favorably impacted by the resolution of a third-party
royalty agreement in our vascular business. Excluding this third-party royalty comparison, underlying sales growth in
the second quarter would be low single digits.
With that, we will now open the call for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan. Your line is
open.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Good morning, everybody. And, Miles, I was hoping I could start with Alere. You didn't
update on the potential financial impact of Alere, but I was hoping that you could talk about your view or the math on
the company's earnings power today versus the time that you announced the transaction and how we should think about
that assuming that we go forward to a deal closing here.
<A - Miles D. White>: I don't think I'm prepared today to give you a lot of detail on that, Mike, but I can say this.
Look, the company had some challenges, we all know that, and it's a bit of a fixer-upper and we know that. I'd say
we're pleased to have the resolution of this matter behind us. We want to go forward and close this deal. We want to
close it in the next few months. It's going to be a little unpredictable because they still got to file their 10-K and they
need that in order to do a proxy statement to do a shareholder vote and so forth. So there are some steps to get through
here before we can close and we've got to finish the divestiture of a couple of businesses that we'll have to divest
because of the regulatory approvals or antitrust approvals.
And what I would say is we're committed, all of us, to get all of that done in the next coming months here. So I'm
looking to close this hopefully – and this is just a guesstimate – by end of summer, allowing for enough time for what
Alere has got to do with shareholders and so forth. But I'd say, look, it remains on strategy. We really like the space, we
like this point-of-care space, we like the expansion to our Diagnostics business, we like the businesses, we will divest a
couple of pieces. When we first announced the signing of the deal, that wasn't clear and wasn't known, and they had
issues with a couple of pieces of businesses as we know.

So I wouldn't say that the same sales will be there. Obviously, the businesses that have had problems will either be
gone or smaller and the ones we divest won't be in the portfolio. So the amount of sales and profits that we add to our
models will change. As far as earnings power and all that sort of stuff, I'm just not prepared to give at this point. I'd tell
you that I think that the resolution of the matter between us is fair and is behind us and we move forward.
And beyond that, I think we're going to have to wait till – first of all, we're in possession of the company. And
obviously, it's going to take us a bit to get our hands around that, so I'd say we're not going to really be in a good
position to give a lot of detailed guidance until minimum fourth quarter and probably normal guidance time, and I
know you're going to – all of our analysts and investors are going to want guidance before that at some level. And I
think we'll be able to give it at some level within ranges, but I can't do much detail today.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Okay. Let me switch to St. Jude. And naturally, the question people have is relative to the
Sylmar warning letter. So can you give your thoughts on how that warning letter impacts the business, any guess at this
point on how long you think it will take to resolve? And I assume that that means that the MRI-compatible ICD
approval timelines push out. So given that, are you able to stabilize the business while you're waiting for the warning
letter to lift and for those devices to get approved?
<A - Miles D. White>: I want to be careful not to make assumptions about things that the FDA gets to decide. I would
say this. First, the warning letter, clearly a disappointment, but not unanticipated. We've been aware of the
circumstances here for some time and we've been working with our St. Jude colleagues for some time even before close
on GMP matters at the site. So we've had a pretty good head start here on the issues and a fair amount of dialog with
the FDA about the issues.
So having said that and being clearly disappointed in the outcome, I'd say the impact will depend a lot on our response,
how thorough, how effective that response is, and I can tell you we've got an excellent team of people on that. We've
basically taken everybody that is expert in the field in our company, and then we have a lot of very good people in the
area focused on and working on not only Sylmar, but we're doing a full evaluation across all the sites and to make sure
that we understand everything here in detail. We've got a very strong track record ourselves in GMP, performance, et
cetera. The FDA is aware of that.
So I'd say the effectiveness of our response, the thoroughness and so forth will determine a lot of this. Now, in the
meantime, how fast to resolve? I can't really predict, but I'd say we've gotten a pretty good-sized head start on this. It's
not like we received the letter and said go. We've had a pretty good visibility to all the issues and matters at the site
starting, gosh, last year, and so I think we're well along here.
And with regard to the timing of approvals, the new products that we have under review with the FDA remain under
review. We know that they're continuing to review those submissions, so that's a good thing, and so I don't think we can
draw any conclusions from that that are negative or positive. I think that it's going to depend on the quality of our
response here, and I'm very, very confident in our team.
So, at this point, I'm not going to change our launch dates or our assumptions on approval dates and so forth because I
don't see a reason to do that yet or a direction to do it in. So I think, right now, I'm just going to leave it where it is, and
we know that there is some uncertainty around that. We know that this will depend on our actions at the site, and we'll
see how that progresses, and then I'll have a stronger position or point of view about that probably later this year, but
right now, we're focused on what needs to be done in terms of corrective actions and improvements at our site. And
that's where the focus ought to be, and then as that makes clear progress and shows clear effectiveness, then I think it'll
be time to try to figure out what impact it's going to have on launch dates of new products.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Okay. Let me ask one last question, if I can, Miles. The discussion on the Street right now,
really, I would put it in two buckets. It's a question of okay, what is ultimately Abbott's earnings power post this
deployment of capital in the acquisition of St. Jude and ultimately Alere here, and what does that look like, and okay,
what does it mean for the company?
And then the second discussion is really what I was hoping to have you comment on, which is, okay, what do we pay
for Abbott going forward, and the discussion essentially ends up centering around this question of, well, is Abbott's mix

of assets today, post the acquisition of St. Jude and Alere, and the change to the outlook for the Nutrition's business, as
good as it was two to three years ago, and effectively what should we be paying for Abbott today. Can you give us just
your own thoughts on that in terms of the overall quality of the portfolio today versus two to three years ago?
<A - Miles D. White>: I think the quality of the portfolio today is clearly strong and improved and better. I think that's
an easy one. Jeez. Did you tee that up on purpose? If I look back two to three years ago at – I'll just run through the
portfolio. I love the Nutrition business. Yes, it has its ups and downs occasionally, but it is a strong, solid grower driven
today, obviously, by emerging markets in a lot of cases, but it's been a great profit and cash flow generator, a solid
business, et cetera. Challenges occasionally in China notwithstanding.
The pharma business, our branded generic business, I think, is in a much stronger position than it was several years
ago. We're focused on the markets where high-double-digit growth exists. We're seeing it. We're seeing the execution
of that strategy being, I'd say, beautifully executed by our team. The only headwind we've seen in that is exchange, and
when I can control exchange and predict it for you, we'll do even better, but I think the EPD business has been a true
gem among branded generic pharma companies, and it's proving it with its growth rates and its performance. We just
keep expanding the product lines, expanding our footprint in countries, and we keep growing at strong single- or
low-double digits there. I got nothing but good things to say about that business.
Diagnostics is in the process of launching the biggest range of new systems and new products that's ever been done in
the entire space in history. I used to run the R&D in that business years ago, and I know the challenges and the
complexity of developing big mainframe systems for diagnostic laboratories, and this team has just launched four of
them into the market at the same time. These are new systems with full menus and it will be a rolling rollout, but I think
when you look at two more systems coming, six systems across the board, a complete redo of the entire product line, I
think the strength of that to drive the growth of our Diagnostics business, gosh, for the next decade is unprecedented,
absolutely unprecedented, and designed not only for their size, their efficiency, their cost. I think there is nothing but
good there, and nobody has done that. So I'm extremely enthusiastic about that.
And then, Mike, you yourself have challenged on the breath of our Medical Devices business for a number of years,
and I think that the addition of St. Jude here is powerful. I mean, arguably we've got the best stent in the world, and it's
challenging for everybody in this space to incrementally improve on the efficacy and quality of stents today. We have a
lead position in the stent business, and now we broadened that across six other major cardiovascular categories.
And I look back at the last few years in the Medical Optics business, which frankly I think J&J has acquired at a
particularly opportune time, because it's taking share in the intraocular lens space at a pretty nice clip. They've got
leading technology. And that business had its own struggles when we first acquired it. So if I look at Alere and St. Jude
or even parts of Abbott that need improvement or whatever, I think we've got a very strong track record of improving
performance in businesses that need some improvement.
And I look at AMO. We are very proud of how AMO has performed over these last six years. And I think that was
proven in the sale and value and so forth that J&J saw in it. And I think they're very happy to have that business, we are
very out of it, and we wish it well because we're pretty happy with how well it did. So I look back three or four years
and I think we are much stronger today and have a much more robust and strong portfolio across the board. You can
say, now, aren't there challenges to fixing the business? I think any large company with a diverse set of businesses is
always going to have some to fix. We are always going to have something that's not up to our standards or that we want
to improve on, and then there's always going to be currency or something going on somewhere in the world. If you are
in 130 countries, there's always going to be somewhere and something.
So I look at it and I think yes, I am very pleased with how we have done, and I think that the growth prospects going
forward are stronger than they have ever been. And to be honest, we start every year with a target of double-digit
earnings growth. I mean there have been, gosh, in the last 10 or 11 years, maybe two years that were high-single digit,
but otherwise we target double-digit earnings every year, almost without exception. And that's unusual in our space,
and I think you know that.

So at some point, I'd say we are the same company, but with much better portfolio, and we live to the investment
identity that we've been and created, and that's our intent. That's why we've made the moves we did with both St. Jude
and Alere. And even though we've got to put some time and investment into these businesses to help achieve the
growth aspirations we have, you just look at the strength of the portfolios across the board. I don't think we've ever had
rich new product portfolios coming like we see across these businesses today. So, thanks for the question. That was
kind of an easy one.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Thanks, Miles.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Matt Taylor from Barclays. Your line is open.
<Q - Matthew Taylor>: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. A couple of areas of the portfolio I wanted to ask about.
First was on diabetes. You had a really strong quarter. We actually saw some acceleration in that business outside the
U.S. And I was hoping you could make some comments on, I guess, A, how FreeStyle Libre is doing and what your
expectations are for that in the U.S., if you could give us an update there.
<A - Miles D. White>: Yeah. No problem. Look, I can tell you we're pretty excited about FreeStyle Libre. It's doing
very well, doing really well across Europe. As I mentioned, I think, in my opening remarks, we're in about 30 countries
now. The expansion within those countries is going well. I think we're at about 300,000 patients. You can compare that
to a like competitor, and I think that stacks up really favorably. We are getting reimbursement across European
countries. That's unprecedented. And even within Germany and other countries, the reimbursement is expanding. That's
helping.
In some cases where it's patient pay, we're still growing very well, patients accepting it. So we've got both great patient
acceptance, great value proposition. And then as we said, payers, governments, sick funds and so forth all giving a lot
of support to the product because of not only what it does, but the value proposition it represents relative to what
patients can do today. And it makes a heck of a difference in the care and treatment of diabetic patients and their care
for themselves. So I think we're pretty excited about this product and the pace at which it's growing and expanding;
nothing but good.
As far as the U.S. goes, still working with the FDA to get approval in the U.S., and submitted, waiting, excited,
anticipating, impatient.
<Q - Matthew Taylor>: Okay. Great. And then just on the St. Jude side of things, there's a few areas that were pretty
strong, but you continue to have some negative growth in rhythm management and heart failure. I guess my question is
can you stabilize that business before you get ICD approval and what are the things that will help that? Maybe you
could comment on the pacemaker launch and how that's going.
<A - Miles D. White>: Well, pacemaker launch is going fine. We've got about – 75% of our accounts are contracted,
about 25% to go. And because it's a new product, new leads, there's a little bit of training and re-contracting involved
because it's not the same old product. So, yeah, I'd say that rollout is going well. It's interesting, you always want it to
be instantaneous, and it takes a little time to roll it in. So I actually expect to see improving sequential quarters in terms
of its growth or decline. We're comparing to last year when, as you know, it lost some share while it waited for
approval. So I expect to see that improve steadily through the year. Obviously, it will be helped when our high voltage
is approved. But as I said earlier, I can't make predictions about that right now. We're hopeful that we'll be able to
resolve matters sufficiently or show enough progress with the FDA that we can stay on track with that, but I can't
predict that just yet. But I think that will make a difference as well, but I'd say everything is going very well with low
voltage.
<Q - Matthew Taylor>: Okay. Great. And one last follow-up. I just wanted to clarify on the Alere timeline. There are
a few steps here. Do you think that is going to basically take through the summer? What's the soonest it could close?
And what are the key uncertainties in that timeline around FTC?

<A - Miles D. White>: I don't know. I don't want to speak for Alere because right now they and their auditors are
working on their 10-K and so forth. I can tell you they're just as anxious to get finished as we are. So that aside, I think
we just arbitrarily say end of 3Q, our third quarter, but it's an arbitrary date. Do I think it will take longer than that? No,
and I would tell you that both companies will get there as soon as they can. We've got a couple of pacing items.
Obviously, we've got our divestitures to finish up, but they will not, I don't think, be the long pole in the tent here. I
think it will be the shareholder vote, but I don't know that. I just think that we've both got actions to finish up here in
parallel, and we're going as fast as I think we practically can.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Rick Wise from Stifel, Nicolaus. Your line is open.
<Q - Rick Wise>: Good morning, Miles.
<A - Miles D. White>: Good morning.
<Q - Rick Wise>: Let me start with China and China nutritionals, no surprise the issues you called out. Maybe help us
– maybe talk us through some of the steps you're taking now to set the stage for a better 2018. How confident are you
that 2018 will be better? Obviously, you're going to have some easy comps. Whether it's product or management or
other initiatives, help us frame the outlook as we look ahead there.
<A - Miles D. White>: I'm thinking how to characterize that because we're talking about one of the most dynamic
markets of any market I've ever seen in the world. We do have new management, like the management a lot, very
impressed with the experience, the background, the understanding of the markets, the actions taken, et cetera. I'm
pleased with the actions that we've identified.
We're not completely in control of what happens in China, as you might guess. So we know that there's a lot of
inventory in that market. We know there's a lot of channel shift happening in that market. That takes time to play
through. We believe we've refocused on the appropriate channels. The digital channel in particular has exploded and
sucked a lot of the activity and energy out of traditional modern trade channels and so forth. And that's been a pretty
big shift to us because we have historically been heavy modern trade, but we've reacted to that, I think, now well. I
wish we'd been quicker, but we weren't. So I think that the team there is making all the right adjustments in terms of
where we promote, how we promote, where we ship, how we ship, product benefits, and value propositions. Literally
across the board, I think our Nutrition business has put a lot of attention on adjusting to what is frankly a fascinatingly
dynamic changing market.
We still like the long-term prospects of China. We look at the growth rates and so forth, and there are not any big
underlying detriments to how strong that market's been. It's been a lot more the reaction of competitors and all of us to
pending regulation, changes in what the government will allow in terms of the number of SKUs, competitors in the
market, and so forth. We're actually in a very strong position for that given the number of different plants we have,
different products and so forth, but we're focused on only a few very strong products. And we're focused on, let's say,
the differentiation that moms in China want in their products. Some of them want European products. Some of them
want New Zealand products. Some of them want American products. Some of them want local product, and we
actually have that and all of that.
So I think it's an adjustment to a lot of channel, a lot of digital, and a lot of product, and then on top of that, a lot of
government regulation. And so in this particular case, there are so many competitors in China. A lot of them have
pushed a lot of inventory into that market in anticipation of a lot of that, and we have to see that play through.
So it's made this year hard to predict. We think we're in a good position thus far. I hate to be superstitious. I'll knock on
wood and say, right now, China has not been a surprise or an issue for 2017, but I felt that way last year at about this
time too. So I want to see a lot more of this year play out before I can predict how the year is going to finish or even

how 2018 will be, but I think we feel pretty good about China for the long term. But as the government transitions
through these new regulations, I think that's going to be a little bumpy, and it has been. Otherwise, I like the
management team and the actions we're taking right now, and that's about all I can tell you.
<Q - Rick Wise>: Okay. Turning to guidance, you obviously beat the first quarter, chose not to raise the full year. I
think you talked about timing of spending and some other issues. And when we look at the second quarter, you
basically framed current consensus as I understand it with your EPS guidance anyway. Help us understand a little more
behind your thinking. Is it simply caution as you look at the many moving pieces in terms of the outlook for the full
year? And for second quarter specifically, can you perhaps walk us through the bridge from first quarter to second
quarter, $0.48 to $0.60, the puts and takes that get us up to that kind of ramp in the second quarter?
<A - Miles D. White>: I may have to phone a friend for that last part, but let me address the first part. You'll recall –
first of all, we set our target for the year at healthy double digits. Now, we've got St. Jude in the mix there, so there's
extra healthy double digits. But even on top of just last year on a comparable basis, there's a double-digit earnings
growth target here, which again I would point out, is not typical across our peer group or competitors, et cetera, or even
the companies that our investors compare us to, many of which are not healthcare.
And so we start the year with healthy double-digit target and guidance, and then the gating of that guidance over the
quarters – as you may recall, in the first quarter, the issue was, gee, it looks backend-loaded. And our fourth quarter is
always strong and our first quarter is always the low quarter of the year, and so you look at that and you say, okay, an
investor tends to think that last quarter, gosh, that looks like such a big hill. So we have a strong first quarter. That
tends to be the case. We tend to have lower guidance then and we tend to beat it each year. It tends to be a pattern.
And then there – I look at each year a little superstitiously. I guess if you have been around long enough, you get to see
this. But every year exchange or something happens later in the year where there is a change. There's a political change.
There's an exchange adjustment of some kind or whatever. So I am reluctant to adjust guidance in the first quarter for
almost anything because I'd like to see the year play out a little more first because I don't like to whip around the
shareholders particularly when we are already looking at a double-digit growth target, which is annual for us. And so I
look at it and say, okay, we are off to a nice strong start. We have had a bit of favorable exchange. We do know there is
some timing in there and there's also some strength in there.
And I'd like to see that strength sustained and I'd like to see the exchange sustained. I would like to see more than three
months to play out here. So in the meantime, my view would be let's take some of the gating off the back part of the
year. Let's re-gate this a little bit more gently, call it a little smoother, and let's wait to see another card played in the
second quarter. I just don't think it's prudent at this early point in the year to make adjustments to earnings that are
already double-digit targets until we see more cards played. That's basically my thought process, Rick. we can
second-guess me all you want, but that's how I thought about it. Scott, do you want to – or Brian, Brian is going to help
me with your second question on the quarter.
<A - Brian B. Yoor>: The question going from Q1 to Q2, we talked a little bit about this on our first call. I mean as
Miles talked about China, while we anticipate pressures to be there through the year, we are expecting some relief as
we move through the year, not a lot, but obviously, that comp becomes a little bit easier for us as we move through the
year. That's one area in Nutrition. One area, Rick, and we talked about this, we expected lower branded generic sales in
Q1. And some of that was around the anticipation around what they were going through with a process known as
demonetization, Established Pharma and also it was our last quarter of sales in Venezuela. It just so happened, and we
talked a little bit about that too. This is their last quarter. Established Pharma would have grown 11% to 12% this
quarter, had we adjusted for that comparable on Venezuela.
So we expect that to flow through in Q2. We also saw it in Diagnostics whereas Diagnostics came in the 4% range,
they would be closer to 6.5%, but for Venezuela. So we anticipated all these moves when we projected our Q2
earnings. And, also, I would note, too, we expected a very modest contribution from St. Jude in Q1. You have the
dilution from the shares, but it takes time to ramp the synergies. So as we move into Q2, you're going to start to see
those synergies ramp in St. Jude, as we move through the year. And that's really the bridge to take you from what you
saw the $0.48 to $0.60.

<Q - Rick Wise>: Okay, thanks so much.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
<Q - Glenn John Novarro>: Hi, good morning, guys.
<A - Miles D. White>: Good morning.
<Q - Glenn John Novarro>: I wonder if you can provide a little bit more detail on your CRM performance in the
quarter. U.S. was down 18%. Can you break it down between pacing and ICD? I would imagine pacing did better given
that you have the MRI-safe for approval and it seems like, from the numbers, ICDs came in worse. So a little bit more
clarity on CRM performance in the first quarter. Thanks.
<A - Scott Leinenweber>: Sure. This is Scott. As Miles mentioned, we did make some progress there in the U.S. on
the CRM side during the first quarter. We are off to a good start with the pacer, particularly as we exited the quarter
and started to add it to more and more contracts and we think we'll wrap up that process here in the second quarter and
do better with the pacer throughout the year. So the pacer sales were down in the mid-single digits and the remainder
would've been obviously the performance of the defibrillation business. We did make some progress there as well with
respect to filing. We filed the ICD in March and we expect to file the CRT-D here in the second quarter. So we made
progress in terms of approval milestones on that front as well.
<Q - Glenn John Novarro>: Okay. And I guess from Miles' commentary, you're assuming pacers throughout the year
get stronger as it fully gets launched, as doctors get trained. So this is a business that will go from down 5% to flat to up
throughout the year. Is that a fair assumption? And I guess we should assume ICDs continue in this downward trend
until MRI-safe gets approved. Is that fair?
<A - Scott Leinenweber>: I think you got it there, Glenn. Definitely, pacers will improve throughout the year.
<Q - Glenn John Novarro>: Okay, thank you, and then one quick follow-up for Miles on China. We talked about the
challenges in 2017. Once we get through the regulations, as you go into 2018 and beyond, what's the new norm in
terms of market growth for China? When Abbott and AbbVie split up, Miles, you talked about China being a
double-digit growth market. So what's the new norm in 2018 and beyond for growth in China in Nutritionals? Thanks.
<A - Miles D. White>: This is just a stab in the dark, but I would tell you I'd probably for right now forecast it at
mid-single. I think we're going to have to see some – it's a big number. I mean first of all, you've got to remember, it's a
big market. So we're talking about growth on top of a big number. So you've got the law of big numbers working
against us there, but I'd say mid-single for now is a safe assumption. And beyond that, I think we're going to have to see
how it goes.
<Q - Glenn John Novarro>: Okay, great. Thanks. Thank you, guys.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
<Q - Larry Biegelsen>: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Let me start with capital allocation and
then a product-related question. So I think, Brian, when you announced the St. Jude deal a year ago, you talked about a
goal of getting down to 3.5 times debt to EBITDA in 2018. Is that still a realistic goal given the Alere deal now? And
how should we think about your usage of cash priorities? One of the concerns investors have is that with the debt you
have right now that – or post the Alere deal that you'll be constrained and you won't be able to do even small tuck-in
deals to augment, let's say, the St. Jude business or other businesses. So can you talk a little bit about that? And I had

one follow-up.
<A - Brian B. Yoor>: Larry, we see a path to the 3.5 times for 2018 and closing Alere. I think something to keep in
mind and remember is we divested a couple businesses, and we received full and fair value there. And so that gives us
some optionality such that the debt we would take on under Alere is less than what you might have originally modeled
in your deal model. So at a later point in time, we'll come back and help you reconcile that.
And as you know, when we talked about this, cash flow has been a focus for us. We projected very strong operating
cash flow and free cash flow as a percent of net income for this year, and that remains on track, I'd say, in the first
quarter. Let's wait till the 10-Q comes out, but we may even be a little bit ahead here in terms of our efforts here to
make improvements in our working capital process and also to just further strengthen what was already strong process
around our capital expenditures. So we feel good about that. Our priorities go back to strategic flexibility, and nothing
changes about those commitments we made some time ago.
<Q - Larry Biegelsen>: That's helpful. And then on the product side, just two, one is on EPD. You touched upon the
demonetization, which doesn't look like it's had much of an impact based on your Q1 results. But how are you thinking
about the impact of the Goods and Services Tax in India later this year?
And just lastly, on the heart failure results this quarter, which were a little weak, I think that's primarily the Thoratec
business, which has been strong in prior quarters. Can you talk about the outlook there and why it might have been
weak this quarter? Obviously, you have HeartMate 3 coming in the U.S. later this year hopefully, so that should help.
Thanks for taking the questions.
<A - Scott Leinenweber>: Sure. Thanks, Larry. This is Scott. With respect to the monetization, yes, it did have a little
bit of transitory choppiness on the overall economy, quite frankly, in India, and we saw a modest impact on our results.
That impact is diminishing and will continue to diminish we think going forward.
With respect to the Goods and Services Tax, as you know, the government is looking at implementing a new tax
scheme. They have been looking at this for quite some time. The date has moved once previously. So we are certainly
going to monitor that situation. At current time, the expectation is that they would implement on July 1. If they do, that
could have an impact potentially on the way distributors manage inventory before and after that implementation. So we
didn't bake that into our guidance per se because the timeline has been a little bit fluid here. But if we go through the
quarter and that solidifies, we'll update you at the appropriate time.
<A - Miles D. White>: I think it's important to stress though. It's hard to predict what distributors will do to manage
inventories and so forth based on this, but they will at some level. So we could see some less predictable numbers
between the second and third quarter if the timing is what Scott said, but I don't think it's going to affect our overall
business, and it's going to affect all players in the market, all manufacturers or all retailers, et cetera. And at the end of
the day, I think it will stabilize, but we're just going to go through a lumpy start. And then I think it also depends on
whether or not people recover this tax with price or other things, so we'll just have to see.
<A - Scott Leinenweber>: With respect to your question on LVAD, so the heart failure bucket, as you know, that
market can be a little bit choppy from time to time. There's some interplay between LVAD procedures and the heart
transplant procedures, so we saw some of that. We did see as we exited the quarter growth rates start to improve, and as
you mentioned, we do expect to see acceleration in the second half of the year when we bring HeartMate 3 to the U.S.
here. So we're well positioned in that market. We have the market-leading product. Albeit on a smaller base, we are
continuing to see some nice strong growth on CardioMEMS as well.

<Q - Joshua Jennings>: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I was hoping to start just to follow up on
your comments, Miles, on the FDA warning letter. Can you just refresh us on whether or not there're any non-CRM
products that come out of the Sylmar facility? And then also you mentioned that the warning letter wasn't completely
unanticipated. How are you feeling about some of the other St. Jude facilities? And just, I think, if you could comment
specifically on the neuromodulation facility in Plano where there were historic tribulations with an FDA warning letter.
<A - Miles D. White>: Okay. I don't have any comments about Plano. I don't have any update for you there. I would
say anytime you get a warning letter or even observations – 483 observations on GMP at any facility or any plant, it
behooves us to go back and look not only at that plant but all of our plants across the board so that the corrective
actions we take, whatever they may be, are consistent, and our systems and processes are consistent across all facilities.
So anytime you get an observation like this or any observation at a single facility, our practice is to go back and look at
all facilities, and I'm comfortable that we're not sitting here at risk in our other facilities, but that said, we always go
back proactively and preemptively and look at every facility to make sure that whatever we're correcting in one is
something that we've looked at, checked out, assessed, evaluated, whatever you want to call it, in all of them. So, that's
standard practice.
And, frankly, I think that's one of the reasons we have the track record we have in GMP in our facilities and the
reputation we have with the FDA. So I think that's a good thing. So I don't – I'm not sitting here with a lot of
nervousness about other facilities. We've had a chance to look at all of St. Jude's facilities. We've had a chance to assess
that. Right now, I don't see an indication of something like this elsewhere. But that said, we're all over everything with
this warning letter everywhere. I'm trying to remember what I missed in the question because it was a long question.
<A - Scott Leinenweber>: I would say with respect to the products, the most significant products there are the
defibrillator and the CRM products. There are others that are smaller that go through generally a 510(k) process, but the
biggest ones are the defibs that you pointed out.
<Q - Joshua Jennings>: Understood. I was hoping just to ask a follow-up question on just the CardioMEMS product
line. Are there any updates on the interactions with CMS and the path to national coverage determination? And just
your outlook on that asset, whether it had been one of the growth drivers, I believe, when the deal was announced last
year, and any update would be fantastic. Thanks for taking the questions.
<A - Scott Leinenweber>: Our longer-term perspective on CardioMEMS is unchanged, and we've said that since we
announced the St. Jude acquisition quite frankly that we think that there is a lot of long-term potential here. Near term,
we've pointed to the fact that there's more work to be done. We have had interactions with the respective bodies with
respect to CardioMEMS and what it will take to get in a better position from a reimbursement standpoint, and those are
ongoing. I don't want to get into too many specifics.
But with what we have today, the product's growing nicely, growing 20% – above 20%, quite frankly, albeit again on a
smaller base. So we are making that progress with it. The real world results that we're seeing, physicians are seeing
with it, are strong, probably better than expected in terms of what most physicians give us feedback on. So we're happy
with the way the product's performing, we think there's great long-term potential, and we'll work through the process
here and generate the data we need in the near term. Operator, we'll take one more question.
Operator
Thank you. And our last question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
<Q - David Ryan Lewis>: Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. I'll be quick. Brian, just a quick follow-up on
Alere and two fast ones. So is it safe to assume as it relates to Alere – I know you're not giving a specific accretion – a
way to think about it is we probably have some less synergies based on operating performance and some of the
divestitures, but you've got a lot more financing flexibility that helps to make up the difference. Is that a decent
paraphrase of what we'll see?

<A - Brian B. Yoor>: It's a decent paraphrase over the coming year. Once we bring this business under us, that's a fair
assessment, David.
<Q - David Ryan Lewis>: Okay. Thank you. And then two quick ones. The first is, Miles, maybe for you. You talked
a lot about India and some on China. I wonder just for this new two-invoice policy in China, as it relates to your EPD
business and device franchise, any disruption we should be thinking about this year, any changes to distributors
regarding the two-invoice policy. And then if there is any update on the PHP product within heart failure, that'd be
great. Thanks so much.
<A - Scott Leinenweber>: This is Scott. Within China, we don't see any disruption. In fact, our EPD business
continues to perform extremely well in China, as does our Diagnostics business, double-digit growth on both fronts. So
we expect strong growth going forward there as well.
With respect to the PHP, we did temporarily pause the trial and commercial implants. We continue to investigate that
and we'll give an update at the appropriate time, very modest financial impact, though. It's a smaller product.
<Q - David Ryan Lewis>: Thank you.
