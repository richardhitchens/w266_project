Unless otherwise noted, in our discussion today we will be excluding the impact of restructuring charges and Baker
Hughes acquisition-related costs taken in the fourth quarter of 2014.
In our prepared remarks today, Dave will provide a brief update on our progress related to the pending Baker Hughes
acquisition. However, the purpose of the call today is to review our quarterly financial and operational results and our
outlook for 2015. We ask that you please keep your questions focused on those matters.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave?
David J. Lesar
Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. While the market is certainly tougher out there today, and I will
discuss that in a minute, I do want to begin with a few of our key accomplishments in 2014.
First, I'm very proud to say that we delivered industry-leading total company revenue growth and returns in 2014. We
finished the year with revenues of nearly $33 billion and operating income of $5 billion, both of which are new records
for the company. Leading the improvement was North America with revenue growth of 16% and profit growth of 23%,
followed by the Eastern Hemisphere with revenue and profit growth of 10% and 12%, respectively.
This was also a record year for both of our divisions, where 12 of our 13 product lines set new all-time highs. From an
operating income perspective, we achieved new full year records in our Completion Tools, Multi-Chem, Drill Bits and
Baroid product lines.
I highlight this performance because you want to head into any industry downturn starting from an extremely strong
financial and operating platform, and that's certainly is where we are performing today.
And finally, during the fourth quarter we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Baker Hughes. We believe this
combination will create a bellwether oilfield services company; a stronger, more diverse organization with an
unsurpassed depth and breadth of services. We are excited about this transaction and the benefits it will provide to
shareholders, customers and other stakeholders of both companies.
Similarly, employees at all levels in both organizations are excited about creating a new industry leader and the
opportunities they will have as part of a larger company. We've also heard from many of our customers who have
expressed enthusiasm about the combination; those who see the broader, cost-effective offerings that we will be able to
provide and especially those who are looking for a compelling alternative to their current incumbent in parts of the
world where individually, ourselves and Baker, have only a small footprint. We are continuing to highlight for our
customers the benefits this combination will deliver to them.
We have formed an integration team, led by Mark McCollum, which includes representatives from both companies.
Mark and his team have already hit the ground running to develop a day-one strategy and an ongoing integration plan
which we believe will deliver the nearly $2 billion in annual cost synergies we discussed in our previous
announcement.
Now, I'm not naive how hard it is to put two companies together. It's damn hard. But you know Mark and you know his
excellent track record on delivering on the commitments that he makes to you, and I am confident that we will achieve
our integration goals with him in the lead.
On the regulatory front, we filed the initial Form S-4 with the Securities and Exchange Commission and are proceeding
expediently with all the antitrust filings. We continue to expect that we will complete the transaction in the second half
of 2015. We look forward to realizing the strategic and financial benefits inherent in this combination to create greater
value for our combined shareholders.
I want to be clear that we remain committed to seeing this deal through despite the current macro headwinds facing the
industry. In fact, as we continue to analyze the potential value creation opportunities of the combination, we believe the
transaction is even more compelling today than when we announced it.

I would also like to congratulate the Baker Hughes employees for delivering on an outstanding quarter with record
financial results. This is clear evidence to me of the capabilities of this organization and their continued focus on
supporting their customers during this period of transition.
So all in all, 2014 was a historic year for Halliburton as we stayed focused on our returns, executing on key strategies
around unconventionals, deepwater and mature fields. Our strategies have worked, are working, and we intend to stay
the course.
Now, let me discuss what we're seeing in the market today and our prospects and challenges for the coming year. Later,
Christian will cover our fourth quarter results.
Obviously, commodity pricing has dropped dramatically over the last several months, with oil prices now at levels not
seen since early 2009. The North America rig count and activity levels held up through most of the fourth quarter as
customers executed against the remainder of their 2014 budgets.
However, over the last 60 days, the U.S. land rig count has fallen by 250 rigs, or close to 15%. Capital expenditure
budgets from our customers remain fluid, but so far on average have been reduced 25% to 30% as they adjust their
spending to operate within their cash flows in response to a continued drop in commodity prices. As a result, we expect
activity declines for North America land to accelerate further in the first quarter, impacting all of the key liquids basins.
What is creating even more uncertainty for the service industry is that many customers have continued to revise down
their capital budgets to further capital reduction announcements. This makes it difficult to size your business in today's
U.S. market in particular because it is such a fast-moving target. So while we did not experience price weakness during
the fourth quarter, price discount discussions with customers did begin in the fourth quarter and have accelerated over
the past several weeks and price reductions are now occurring across all product lines.
Now, we expect pricing concessions to be less severe when compared to previous cycles and, therefore, believe our
decremental margins should be lower. That is because our margin improvement this cycle was largely driven by our
focus on gaining efficiencies and getting increased labor and input costs recovered more quickly, not through net
pricing increases. This upcycle did not last long enough for us to see the kinds of net pricing that would have enabled
margins to recover to historically strong levels. Therefore, less pricing erosion will be needed to eventually reduce
service capacity if market weakness persists.
Based on our experience in previous downturns, we expect it will take a couple of quarters to see how the interplay of
pricing declines, volume reductions and equipment efficiency deterioration plays out relative to our ability to lower
labor and input costs and to right-size the organization and, therefore, reach an equilibrium in the market.
The first quarter of any severe downturn is almost always the most challenging quarter to predict because pricing
concessions usually impact our results in real time. Volume declines can be erratic as customers' rig plans are uncertain
and can change daily. Then, there is typically a delay in realizing input cost savings from our suppliers.
There's two reasons for this. One, discussions with vendors are dependent on them truly believing we have a reduction
in ongoing activity levels before we can have the kinds of tough renegotiation that results in significant input cost
reductions.
Second, there's a timing issue as to the expenses that flow through inventory, like sand, proppant, chemicals and
cement. It takes a while to see lower input pricing fully reflected in your average inventory costs because you have to
work off your higher-priced inventory.
Next, head count adjustments don't follow directly from pricing concession as you still need the crews to do the work.
Headcount adjustments do, however, follow volume reductions. Therefore, there is a lag in getting labor cost out as
activity declines.
And finally, the impact of a large rig count reduction on 24-hour operations and its inherent efficiency is hard to predict
as customers slow down activity in many different ways. But eventually, these moving parts all settle out and we reach

some sort of equilibrium. In this environment, we would expect to see most of our margin degradation occurring over
the first couple of quarters and more margin stability in the back half of the year.
Now, in this very uncertain environment, we believe Halliburton's more efficient crews and differentiated technologies
are best suited to outperform. Additionally, being aligned with the right customers, those with assets in the sweet spot
of the reservoir, becomes more important as we expect to see those customers continue to work through the cycle. But
we have to be real about it. The North America market is going to see volatility and pain for a few quarters; however,
in this scenario I like our chances.
Now, moving to international, we started to see the impact of lower commodity prices during the fourth quarter.
Declining oil prices have caused our customers to reduce their budgets and defer several of their new projects,
particularly around offshore exploration. In 2015, we anticipate headwinds across all of our international regions.
Middle East/Asia will likely be the most resilient, followed by Latin America. And finally, Europe/Africa/CIS is
expected to see the sharpest declines.
Let me talk about each individually. Middle East/Asia is expected to be the best performing region for the company in
2015 as recent project awards in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, the UAE and Kuwait are all anticipated to move forward.
However, we expect Malaysia and Australia, and other markets across the region, to be impacted by reduced customer
spending and delayed projects.
In Latin America, we currently expect to see unconventional activity levels in Argentina continue to grow, along with
the startup of our new Integrated Asset Management project in Ecuador. However, we believe lower activity levels in
Mexico and Colombia will more than offset the higher growth in these markets.
Europe/Africa/CIS is expected to experience significant activity declines across the entire region, with the most
vulnerable areas being the North Sea, Russia and Angola. In addition, Russia and Norway also are experiencing
significant currency weakness.
So when you net out the international regions, we expect to see year-on-year decline, but we believe we will
outperform spending predictions indicated in the third-party surveys that are out there today.
Later, Jeff will discuss some of the specific actions we are taking to adjust our cost structure to the market conditions. I
can tell you that we will do what we have to do. We know what buttons to push and levers to pull, and we will do so. I
will say that similar to previous cycles, we will protect our market share and expect to see customers focused on our
highly efficient service model.
As our customers struggle with cash flows, they will be very focused on optimization and gaining higher levels of
efficiency, and I expect that this will bode very well for Halliburton. Our management team has been through previous
downturns and we intend to emerge from this cycle a much stronger company on a relative basis.
During the fourth quarter, we took a $129 million restructuring charge as a first step in preparing for these market
changes and, as Jeff will cover in a few minutes, there is likely to be more in the first quarter. Now, for competitive
purposes, we're not going to lay out a detailed strategy for addressing this business environment. However, in the short
term, we are putting initiatives in place not only to temper the impact of the activity decline on our financial
performance, but also to ensure that we are in an optimal position to take advantage of the market's eventual recovery.
The length of any downturn is very difficult to predict. But as you know, we are in a great financial position right now,
with strong free cash flow. We will make adjustments as activity declines, and our intention is to look beyond this cycle
and continue to execute our strategic initiatives. I believe that this is the right thing to do for the health of our business
over a complete business cycle.
As I stated, we've been through these cycles before and we know what to do, and we will execute on that experience.
The bottom line, we have historically outperformed the market in North America during downturns and we have no
reason to believe that this downturn will be any different.
Now, let me turn it over to Christian to provide more details on our financial performance. Christian?

Christian A. Garcia
Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. It's been a while, but I'm glad to be back on the call and looking forward
to be working with all of you again. Let me begin with an overview of our fourth quarter results and, later on, let me
discuss our financial outlook.
Total company revenue of $8.8 billion was a record quarter for Halliburton, with operating income of $1.4 billion. We
achieved record quarterly revenues in both of our divisions, and our Middle East/Asia region set a new record for both
revenue and operating income.
From a product line perspective, we had record revenues in the fourth quarter in Production Enhancement, Completion
Tools, Drill Bits, Artificial Lift and Consulting & Project Management while new operating income records were set by
Multi-Chem, Drill Bits and Landmark.
North America revenue was flat sequentially, in line with the average quarterly rig count. Operating income was
modestly higher over the same period despite the impact of seasonal fourth quarter weather and holiday downtime.
Fourth quarter margins benefited from the continued rollout of our Battle Red and Frac of the Future initiatives, as well
as efficiencies we're seeing from recent enhancements to our logistics network. Service pricing was stable during the
fourth quarter as activity levels remained robust but are expected to deteriorate in the coming quarters.
In the Eastern Hemisphere, we experienced a modest level of sequential revenue growth which resulted in a new
quarterly record despite the headwinds experienced in our Europe/Africa/CIS region. Operating income came in flat
compared to the third quarter.
In the Middle East/Asia region, revenue increased by 10% compared to the third quarter and operating income was up
29% over the same period. Our fourth quarter margins came in just under 21% as a result of seasonal year-end software
and equipment sales, as well as higher integrated project-related activity in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, India and Indonesia.
Switching to Europe/Africa/CIS, fourth quarter revenue and operating income declined 8% and 35%, respectively,
compared to the prior quarter as we experienced significant reduction in activity levels in the North Sea, Russia and
Angola. Declining oil prices and project economics caused our customers to reduce activity levels and defer several of
their new projects. Russia and Norway results were also significantly affected by currency weakness.
In Latin America, revenue increased 3% sequentially while operating income declined 4% compared to the previous
quarter. The revenue increase was a result of year-end software sales, increased artificial lift activity in Venezuela and
the higher activity levels across the majority of our product lines in Colombia. Operating income was negatively
impacted during the quarter from mobilization costs in Brazil and budget constraints in Mexico.
Now, I'll address some additional financial items. As a result of the market decline that has primarily impacted our
international business, we incurred $129 million of restructuring charges in the fourth quarter, consisting of
severance-related costs as well as asset write-offs. The majority of these adjustments related to our Eastern Hemisphere
business.
Our corporate and other expense totaled $83 million for the quarter, excluding $17 million in costs related to the Baker
Hughes acquisition. We anticipate that our corporate expenses for the first quarter will be approximately $90 million,
excluding acquisition-related costs, and this will be the new run rate for 2015.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was approximately 27%, which was lower than expected as a result of Congress
approving the Federal Research and Experimentation Tax Credit in late December. As we go forward in 2015, we're
expecting the first quarter effective tax rate to be approximately 28% to 29%.
Currently, we anticipate that our capital expenditures for 2015 will be essentially in line with 2014 and expect
depreciation and amortization to be approximately $2.4 billion for the year. I know this may surprise some of you, but
let me lay out our approach.

As Dave mentioned, our objective is to look beyond the cycle and continue to invest in certain strategic technologies,
such as the Frac of the Future, while retiring older, more costly equipment. As we have previously discussed, our Q10
pumps support our surface efficiency strategy that will enable us to lower operators' costs while, at the same time,
protect our margins against deteriorating industry conditions. As you know, we manufacture our own equipment, which
gives us the utmost flexibility in this market and can adjust our spend accordingly based on our visibility.
Turning to our operational outlook, the severity of the activity decline in the coming quarters continues to be unclear,
preventing us from providing specific guidance. But let me give you some thoughts around the first quarter of 2015.
For the first quarter of 2015, our results will be subject to the same type of seasonality that you've seen in previous
years. Landmark, Completion and direct sales activities typically fall off in the first quarter as those businesses benefit
historically from customers' year-end budgets. Our business will also be impacted by weather-related seasonality that
occurs in the Rockies, North Sea and Russia.
In the first quarter of 2014, this seasonality impacted our results by approximately 22%. However, this year we believe
the decline will be exacerbated by the macro headwinds currently faced by the industry.
In North America, the U.S. rig count is already down 9% from the fourth quarter average and the rate of decline has
accelerated in the last two weeks. We expect to see activity levels continue to drop throughout the first quarter,
accompanied by price reductions.
As Dave mentioned, the beginning of a down cycle is typically the most challenging, but we believe that our sequential
decrementals in the first quarter will be less severe than what we have previously experienced in the prior downturn.
We finished 2014 in a solid financial position. We continue to have the best returns in our peer group. We reduced
working capital by seven days since our Analyst Day and gave back 33% of our cash flow from operations to our
shareholders in 2014. In 2015, we will continue to focus on working capital and returns and we will live within our
cash flows. We will also continue to adjust our cost structure and currently anticipate that we will be incurring
restructuring charges for severance and other actions that we are contemplating in the first quarter.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for an update on our strategy. Jeff?
Jeffrey Allen Miller
Thank you, Christian, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'd like to begin my comments by discussing the current
market environment and what we plan to do.
Although oil demand growth expectations for 2015 have weakened, it's still growth. Demand is forecast to increase by
an estimated 900,000 barrels per day. Keep in mind that steep decline curves are still at work. We estimate the average
annual production decline rates for unconventionals in North America are in excess of 30% and much higher in some
areas. Depending on the ultimate trajectory of the rig count declines and the backlog of well completions, we believe
that North America crude production could begin to respond during the back half of the year.
Internationally, decline rates have become more pronounced in several key markets over the last couple of years. In
areas like Angola, Norway and Russia, historical growth has given way to net production declines in the last year,
while decline rates in markets like Mexico and India have actually accelerated.
Consequently, we believe that any sustained period of under-investment due to reduced operator spending should lead
to an increase in commodity prices, and this largely ignores the possibility of short-term disruptions due to geopolitical
issues. So the long-term fundamentals of our business are still strong, but it's clear we're heading into an activity
downturn. We can look at previous cycles for insight, and while history doesn't always repeat, sometimes it rhymes.
In North America, we're looking at the rig count decline relative to past downturns. After a plateau through much of the
fourth quarter, the rig count has dropped sharply over the last two months and is already down 15% from early

December. This trajectory is similar to both the 2001/2002 cycle and the 2008/2009 cycle, and in those cases we
experienced a rapid correction to the rig count going from peak to trough over a three-quarter period.
Over the past several years, we've taken key steps to reduce our underlying cost profile, steps such as deploying Frac of
the Future equipment, streamlining our field operations through Battle Red and vertically integrating portions of our
logistics network. For these reasons, we're confident that we're better prepared than our competitors to execute through
this coming cycle.
In the international markets, our projects and contracts tend to be longer term in nature than in North America.
Historically, this has resulted in reduced year-on-year volatility. However, nearly all of our customers are currently
reassessing their priorities and looking for efficiencies, and even more so in the offshore space. It's important to note
that this group has been quick to react to declining commodity prices, with the first moves being made in mid-2014 at
sub-$100 oil. Although projects already underway are continuing to move forward, generally speaking, we're seeing
significant reductions in new work being tendered and projects that can be delayed are moving to the right.
As we evaluate service intensity for our international markets, we keep a close eye on revenue per rig, which helps us
understand the overall health of the business. Although this metric took a step backwards during the 2009 economic
downturn, we've seen consistent improvement over the last four years. In fact, we're in a better position now than going
into the last cycle. Our 2014 revenue per rig is more than 20% higher than in 2008.
For Halliburton, this expansion represents not only the value of technical content in complex wells, but also our ability
to expand our footprint in under-served geographies as well as in under-utilized product lines. We believe this
demonstrates the success of our growth strategies – deepwater, mature fields and unconventionals – and positions us to
outperform through the next cycle.
As Christian said, the midterm outlook is unclear, but whether this cycle ends in a sharp V or takes time to recover, our
strategy will be consistent. First things first; we'll control the things we control. We've already taken initial steps to
address head count internationally, and as activity in North America begins to fall more sharply, we will make similar
adjustments here as well. Between actions already taken in the fourth quarter and actions we anticipate taking by the
end of the first quarter, we expect our head count adjustments to be in line with our primary competitors.
We intend to minimize discretionary spending in our operations. As operators have requested price discussions with us,
we've opened dialogues with our suppliers around both volume pricing and anticipate reducing our input cost profile.
We'll continue to manufacture our Frac of the Future equipment and plan to take advantage of the opportunity to
accelerate the retirement of older fleets, which operate at a higher cost, especially in 24-hour operations. The value we
have seen from the rollout of our Q10 pumps has truly exceeded our original expectations, and despite the current
market conditions, we feel it's the right decision for our shareholders to move forward with this initiative.
Frac of the Future not only gets the job done with 25% less capital and offers maintenance savings of up to 50%, an
optimized Frac of the Future spread running under the right efficiency model can complete a well more than 50% faster
than legacy equipment; and it does all this with 35% fewer people on location. Frac of the Future represents about 30%
of our North American fleet today and we expect that number to be closer to 50% by year-end.
Second, service quality really matters, and even more so in this environment, and our ability to execute more efficiently
lowers non-productive times for our customers and reduces their effective cost per barrel. Due to the nature of the work
that we do today, large, complex shale wells in North America, increasingly technical offshore work and a growing
base of integrated projects on the international stage, we believe that our superior execution and best-in-class technical
solutions will allow us to maintain utilization and outperform our peers.
As a management team, this isn't our first downturn. We're talking to our customers every day and it's safe to say that
budget expectations are a moving target. Accordingly, we've given ourselves flexibility inside of our capital budget to
right-size quickly to whatever the market gives us. I'm very pleased with our management team and the strategies we
have in place, and believe that we are well-positioned to outperform in the downturn and to ensure that we take
advantage of the recovery upcycle and come out a much stronger company.

Now, let me turn the call back over to Dave for his closing comments. Dave?
David J. Lesar
Thanks, Jeff. Industry prospects will continue to be weak in the coming quarters and the ultimate depth and length of
this cycle remains uncertain. However, we are confident that our management team is prepared to meet the challenges
that are forthcoming, and we will take the opportunity to strengthen the long-term health of our franchise. We will
selectively cut costs and, at the same time, continue to invest where we can improve our competitive position.
Whatever scenario you think may happen, we have the people, technology and experience to outperform the market.
We have demonstrated this to you for the past several years. Whatever the level of industry activity, we expect to get
more than our share of it.
Now, before I open it up for questions, I want to let you know that due to other business commitments I will not be
participating in our first quarter conference call. Jeff will be providing market comments on my behalf and I will return
for our second quarter call.
Now, let's open it up for questions.

<Q - J. David Anderson>: So, Dave, first off, you must be very happy to see the strong numbers posted by Baker this
morning. Hopefully, they can keep it up as you close this deal by the end of the year. But as we all kind of stare out of
the unknowns of the next couple of quarters, I'd love to hear your perspective of what you've seen so far from your
customers in North America. We're getting the sense this is happening a lot faster we've seen in past downturns.
Perhaps because E&Ps are struggling where the oil price will settle out. So I don't know if you agree with that
assessment, and perhaps you could give us some insight into their thinking and how that's shaping your view on how
this market responds over the next couple of quarters.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Yeah, let me let Jeff take a shot at it and then I'll comment as necessary.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Yes, thanks, Dave. I mean we're talking to our customers every day and, of course,
initially the discussions had been around reductions in the 25% to 30% range. However, as commodity continues to
move, they're all revisiting their budgets. I mean, inarguably for the next couple of quarters, North America will look a
bit like [ph] a chocolate mess (34:50) in terms of where it winds up, but most customers are living within their cash
flows and similarly that's what we're going to do. But we're confident that we're positioned in the right places and in the
fairways of the right place to where we'll be very effective as we work through this with them.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Now, Dave, let me just add a little bit to that. I think your question about sort of the speed of the
pullback by our customers is a bit unusual and I think, first of all, they're worried about their cash flow because lower
of commodity prices and I also think they're worried about where their next dollar might come from if they start living
outside of their cash flows. So in my view, it sort of exacerbates the speed by which this is happening, but I also think it
accelerates the time where they sort of know what they can spend this year, they know how they're going to spend it,
they know who they're going to spend it with, and we can get to that equilibrium point that I referenced in my remarks.

<Q - J. David Anderson>: So now, Dave, a key part of your strategy over the last several years has been aligning with
the strongest customers. You clearly did that in the natural gas downturn, and this is the same strategy here with oil.
Now these are the customers have the best economics in their acreage. I was wondering if you could talk about some of
the steps that you think these stronger guys are taking. Are you seeing kind of high grading of drilling yet? Is it CapEx
shifting amongst their product lines? Are you starting to see them use their scale to get more pricing concessions to the
supply chain? Can you just help me understand how maybe – your customer base is clearly differentiated – how are
they responding differently or are they yet?
<A - David J. Lesar>: Yeah, I think good question. In terms of what they're doing, and we are – let me just confirm –
we are aligned with what we call the fairway players, particularly in North America. And our view of a fairway player
is one who is in a strong financial position and has a low leasehold cost or are in the sweet spot of these various
reservoirs.
So the discussions with them today are, okay, let's high-grade back to the places where we can produce the lowest cost
per BOE even in this pricing environment; let's – have to remain, service company and operator, very flexible in how
we're approaching this market in terms of where we're going to put rigs up, how many rigs we're going to have there;
we want to partner with you in terms of the service capabilities you have, but be essentially aware that we're still in a
commodity-driven world and we may have to be flexible and change. We can do that. We got a good management
team. We got a good footprint. We got good technology. And it's not a fun environment to be in but it's one we can
easily handle.

Our next question comes from the line of Jud Bailey with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
<Q - Judson E. Bailey>: Thanks. Good morning. You talked about how quickly your customers are moving much
more quickly than in prior cycles. Could you maybe talk a little bit about how that's impacting your discussions? I
mean you talked about it a little bit, but how it's impacting discussions with your vendors and maybe how quickly you
think you could get price concessions and do you think you can get price reductions on the supply chain side in line of
what you're giving to your customers?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Yeah, thank you, Jud. Those discussions have already begun. But I think as Dave
referenced in his early remarks, there's a bit of a disconnect in the timing of seeing price concessions with customers
and working that both through the vendor community and also through our inventory, and I think that's one of the
reasons I say we look out a quarter or two.
That said, we've got a terrific procurement organization and we're already in discussion with a number of vendors and
we continue to see this progress. Again, these are steps that we've taken before and it's really a matter of connecting
sort of what's happening in the marketplace to the vendor community, but I think that happens initially quite quickly.
<Q - Judson E. Bailey>: Okay. And then just to kind of switch gears and look internationally – and Christian
commented a little bit on this but I want to make sure I'm thinking about it correctly when I think about
Europe/Africa/CIS and the types of revenue declines you experienced in the fourth quarter, you take away some of the
seasonality in your typical year-end product sales. Can you help us think about that market in terms of revenue
progression in the first quarter or second quarter, and what are the moving parts on what's going to be the biggest
weakness in that market?
<A – [07MNW5-E Christian Garcia]: Jud, let me approach it internationally in total. As I had mentioned, we're not
going to provide specific guidance but to kind of give you some help here, if you look at the seasonal decline that we
see in our international markets, it usually declines – typically declines about 10% -- 9% to 10% for Q1. Clearly, there's
going to be macro headwinds that would push that at a higher decline rate. If that is the case, then we will basically see
a steeper decline in the operating income. As an example, last year we saw a 300 basis points decline from Q4 to Q1
for our international markets, and we expect to see a little bit higher than that this time around. Now, not going to

higher decline than the Middle East or Latin America.

Our next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert was Simmons & Company. Your line is open.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Thanks. Good morning. Dave and Jeff and Christian, so I think it's plausible that given the
rationale that you laid out that your decremental margins are going to be less severe than they were in 2009. I'm just
curious if we can bracket sort of a plausible targeted range. I mean you did close at 60% decrementals in 2009. I'm just
curious as to what you guys envision as a reasonable target as we come in to 2015 with regard to decrementals in North
America. I mean should they start with a four, just to throw that out there?
<A - Christian A. Garcia>: Right. So, Bill, to be honest with you, we don't know, because the reason is we don't know
the depth and the length of the cycle, okay? So what we can tell you is in Q1, right, if you look at 2008/2009, the rig
count drop in Q1 of 2009 was about 30%. Our revenue decline was 25% at that time.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Right.
<A - Christian A. Garcia>: We had 1,000 basis points decline in Q1. We just don't think it's going to happen in Q1, at
least given the visibility that we have currently. So, that's the only visibility we have. We're going to do it quarter by
quarter, and we'll update our guidance as we go along throughout the year.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Okay. And then secondly, more of a conceptual question for Dave. Dave, if you could put
your oilfield historian cap on and compare and contrast, if you will, what you expect to be this downturn in terms of
duration versus what we've seen kind of 2008/2009, the late 1990s and the mid-1980s. It sounds like from a duration
aspect, although you guys had taken pains to say you don't know whether this is U-shaped or V-shaped, your capital
spending budget would seem to indicate that you don't necessarily view this as a protracted, multi-year adjustment.
<A - David J. Lesar>: I think, Bill, that's right. I mean, if you look at the 2008/2009, that was really a gas-driven rig
count decline. What we're seeing today is more of an oil-based decline. If you go back to the late-1980s and 1990s,
those actually were probably more oil-driven declines at that point in time.
And so, I don't have a crystal ball that would allow me to absolutely predict it. I know on my experience that you have
to invest through these things. You want to keep your business franchise strong. And as Christian indicated, we're
looking at basically a flat capital budget for next year, but the reality is is that a lot of that is going into building out our
Q10 pumps system because, frankly, you guys would shoot me if I didn't continue to invest in that technology. It's a
great technology. It's a differentiating technology. It saves not only customers' money but it saves us operating costs, so
we'd be crazy not to push through with the deployment of that and retire the older assets.
The reality is if we had pulled back there, our capital expenses for next year likely would be going down. But generally,
my experience has been stay flexible, stay nimble, stay strong financially, and I think that when we come out of this
thing, especially when we execute the transaction with Baker, we're going to be a heck of a company and I'm really
looking forward to that.

<Q - James West>: Hey, Dave or Jeff, on the international side, obviously you're going to have conversations, you're
having conversations about pricing, but my sense is this cycle we never saw that big inflection point for international
pricing. It was more of a market share game. So do you actually have that much pricing to give up, or am I misreading
this because a lot of the CapEx costs are coming offshore where pricing is better?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Thanks, James. This is Jeff. No, you're reading that correctly. I mean we really never saw
net pricing throughout the last cycle internationally. In fact, as you described, most of the margin gains were
volume-driven and, really, cost absorption over that period of time.
That said, we are working with our customers around efficiency, approaches, how can we lower total cost of operations
for them, and this really gets back to our basic strategy which is around reducing uncertainty and increasing reliability
in operations. And we've made terrific gains in non-productive time over the last couple of years, and that's a
differentiator for us.
<Q - James West>: And is there an urgency on the part of your customer base? Are they expressing urgency for you to
go ahead and get the Baker deal closed so that you can provide even better efficiencies?
<A - David J. Lesar>: Yeah, I think, James, as Kelly said at the beginning, we really don't want to and can't answer
any questions related to Baker other than what we had in our prepared remarks.

Our next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita with UBS. Your line is open.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Christian, could you – I mean you gave us the color on
Q1 on the international markets if you looked at it seasonally Q4 over Q1 on a normal year. Can you do the same for us
on North America?
<A - Christian A. Garcia>: Yeah. So North America, as I mentioned, rig count is already down 9% so far.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Yeah.
<A - Christian A. Garcia>: So I don't know, it may reach a decline of in the mid-teens for the whole quarter. Well,
assuming that projection is correct, we would expect a revenue decline to probably slightly less than that percentage
based on our past experience. And as I had mentioned, the decrementals in 2008/2009, we don't think we're going to do
better than that.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Okay, okay. Fair enough. And then, Dave or Mark, can you talk about the steps you're taking,
both internationally and in North America, to protect your market share given that your largest peer has been quite
vocal on your proposed merger and the opportunities that they see?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Yeah, let me answer that one, Angie. I've heard the word, distraction. I've heard other
comments about what's going to happen. You've got to remember, we've been through asbestos. We've been through
Macondo. We've been through the Iraq war, and none of those distracted us from making sure our business franchise
remains strong. We've been through ups and downs. That didn't distract us.
So I guess my view is you know us. We're the execution company. We're not going to get distracted through this. This
is a tough market, but we've been through these kinds of things before. I've got a really strong management team. We
are going to focus on maintaining our market share. We're going to focus on improving our business franchise. And
clearly, we're not going to get distracted. I'm not going to permit it to happen. So, I guess that would be my sort of
editorial comment on it.

Our next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Hey, good morning. Thanks for all that color. I just wanted to dive in a little bit deeper into
Brazil. For example, given a lot of challenges that are going down there with the corruption scandal, I know you guys
have a contract shift taking place down in Brazil. I want to get a sense as to – you mentioned Mexico – what's your
outlook for Brazil as you go into 2015?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Yeah, thanks, Kurt. The outlook is we'll do those things that we've described. We expect
to have drilling contracts signed in the first quarter. We should have a wireline contract sort of re-upped in Q1 and our
testing contract mobilized into Q1. The broader outlook, however, is we still see that market declining to a certain
degree in terms of activity. And beyond that, really, don't want to give any guidance except to say that we've described
some of those markets as looking a little bit stronger and, certainly, Brazil and Mexico are likely to be headwinds.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Right. And then beyond – the next follow-up, say, beyond the ruble depreciation dynamic in
Russia, what kind of activity changes have you seen there?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Yeah, in Russia, I mean, obviously we still got a couple of things going on. First, the
sanctions are in place, and so that's having an impact on our business. I mentioned currency. And then, around mature
field activity, there may be some improvement there. But overall, the issues around sanctions and whatnot I think are a
bit of a drag on the business, overall.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Tillery with Tudor, Pickering. Your line is open.
<Q - Jeff Tillery>: Hey, good morning. Could you give us just some color – as you see on the domestic completion
activity, there's been increasing anecdotes around wells being drilled but not completed. Could you just talk about is
that noticeable, yet, and how do you see that playing out over the coming quarters?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: What we worked through last year, we saw tightening in capacity, things that I described,
so there's some amount of that out there. But I would really take a broader view to say that our customers are managing
within cash flow. And so, I think that behavior may be different for different customers, but broadly there will be a
drawback to the best parts of the plays, a focus on efficiency, and really those strategies that we talk about and that
we've built our franchise around, which is lowest cost per BOE, custom chemistry and delivering subsurface insight. So
I think those things are at play, but I don't necessarily see a large inventory building of uncompleted wells.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Yeah, I think – this is Dave. I mean, you just got to think through – put yourself in the
operator's mind, especially one who is concerned about cash flow. It'd be crazy to drill a well and then put it in
inventory, because you've got cash flow out but no cash flow coming in. So I think the decision is very quickly going to
go to: do you drill a well? If you drill a well, you're going to complete it. If you're not going to complete it, there's no
sense in drilling it. And that's the dialogue that's going on now.
<Q - Jeff Tillery>: And then, my second question is unrelated. You talked a lot about – there's a lot of questions
around North American supply chain. Europe/Africa/CIS, you talked about that being likely the worst region in 2015.
Could you just talk about cost structure and flexibility in that region and things you're doing to address that?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Yes, thanks. So we've taken some steps early in Q4 around head count, so we're reacting
quickly to what we see there. As we've described, the timing around supplier cost reductions and getting those in place
don't sync up perfectly. But for the visibility that we have, we're taking actions to address that.

<Q - Jim K. Wicklund>: Good morning, guys.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Hey, Jim.
<Q - Jim K. Wicklund>: You guys always gain market share in a down market and you've done a fabulous job this
morning explaining why. But I just kind of have an industry question. I remember when I was running an operation in
Africa – granted, it was a long time ago – and I had to cut everybody by 15%. And I didn't really care what their
margins were; they just had to cut their prices to me by 15%. Their margins, their costs were their problem. Has that
changed, Jeff? You alluded to the fact that since we – some of these companies don't have the margin to give up, that
pricing won't go down as much?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Gee, Jim, I'm glad you're not my customer anymore. I think the reality is that a customer
may take that approach, saying we want to cut our costs by 15%. But in today's world, and really today's shale world in
the U.S. and, let's say, the offshore market in Africa, differentiated technologies still make a difference. And having
that technology, having the efficiency, having the people on the ground ends up being sort of what you sell to that
customer. Customers also know that in reality – in reality, they know who they want to use for particular products and
services in various parts of the world, and generally they move to make sure that when they go through a cost reduction
effort like this, that they keep the strong players strong.

Our next question comes from the line of Waqar Syed with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<Q - Waqar M. Syed>: Thank you very much. Dave, my question relates to service intensity in U.S. shales. You were
seeing strong service intensity increase throughout last year. Do expect that trend to continue? Do you expect people to
have more frac stages and then use more sand per frac stage, or do you see that abating with where the sand price –
sand costs are right now?
<A - David J. Lesar>: Yeah, thanks, Waqar. The behavior around the wells, we expect to continue. I mean what we've
seen is consistently improving productivity based on things we talk about all the time, so custom chemistry, the
application of our technology like AccessFrac and RockPerm. And then also, sand volumes. So while overall activity
likely falls off, the activity that's executed is going to be executed with absolutely the best technology and wellbore
design and frac design to deliver the lowest cost per BOE. So, I expect that continues.
<Q - Waqar M. Syed>: And so, previously you were seeing about 15% per quarter kind of change in sand volumes
used per well, if I may say. How do you see that trending going forward?
<A - David J. Lesar>: Well, we actually saw in Q4 a year-on-year increase of about 46% sand on a per-well basis. So
that was up sequentially another 5% or 6%, again, on a per-well basis. So I expect that at some point, better design,
better frac design will moderate the volume of sand. It's not infinite. But nevertheless, would expect the demand – not
the demand, but on a per-stage basis, volumes to remain high.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Yeah, and let me just make sort of one last comment on sort of the increasing volumes, is
that more and more of our customers are now looking at what is the impact of these large volume jobs on offset wells.
And this concept of well bashing is what it's called, where basically pumping enormous volumes into one wellbore, is it
bashing adjacent wellbores and actually declining or decreasing the volumes you're getting out of it in total.
So I think as the volumes continue to increase, customers and the service industry, Halliburton in particular, are starting
to look at sort of the science of what's happening downhole, too, to make sure that what you are ending up with is an
optimal outcome and not just accelerating greatly production from one well but impacting that in adjacent wells.

Yeah, thank you, Kate. I'd like to wrap the call up with just a couple of comments. And as we've said, there's a
tremendous amount of uncertainty in the market, but we've seen this before. We always take basically a two-pronged
