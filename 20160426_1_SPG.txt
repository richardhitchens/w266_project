For our prepared remarks, I'm pleased to introduce David Simon.
David E. Simon
Okay. We had a strong start to 2016. We completed several significant redevelopment projects; started construction on
others; announced more that will further enhance the value of our real estate. We completed the acquisition of The
Shops at Crystal, extending our presence in the Las Vegas marketplace. And we continue to achieve strong operating
and financial results, which were highlighted by FFO of $2.63 per share, which is an increase of 15.4% compared to
prior year.
We had strong key operating metrics. Mall and premium outlet occupancy was 95.6%. Leasing activity remains
healthy, which we – the mall and outlet business had releasing spreads of $10.24 per square foot, which is an increase
of 17.5%, and our base minimum rent was $49.70, up more than 4% compared to last year. Total sales per square foot
for our mall and outlet business was $613 compared to $621 in the prior year period.
We measure our success through growth of operating income and cash flow. We have a unique ability to drive growth
through not only increases in comparable property NOI, but also through disciplined capital allocation for new
development, redevelopment, acquisitions, and investments. In our press release and supplement this quarter, we had
provided additional new metrics summarizing the composition of our total portfolio NOI.
These new metrics provide further detail on the profitability generated by our portfolio and we have broken them out
into four categories: comparable property NOI; NOI from new development, redevelopment, expansions and
acquisitions that are not included in comp NOI; NOI from our international properties, which is our premium outlets
and designer outlets; and then our share of NOI from investments, which includes Klepierre and HBS Global
Properties; and then below the property NOI line, you have the corporate sources of NOI. And importantly, for the first
quarter of 2016, our total portfolio NOI increased 7.8%, of which comp NOI increase was 5.1%. Please see the
supplement.
At the end of the first quarter, redevelopment expansion projects were ongoing in 33 properties across all three of our
platforms; our share approximately $2 billion. We finished the two-year transformation of Roosevelt Field, including
comprehensive enhancements throughout the mall, the addition of two-level fashion specialty store expansion with
being anchored by Long Island's first Neiman Marcus store.
We also are nearing completion with Stanford Center, including the new Bloomingdale's as well as reclaiming that
space for specialty stores. Transformations like these are examples of what's adding to our overall profitability. We
started construction on several new projects, including the important expansion at The Outlets at Orange. And
construction continues on other major redevelopment and expansion projects at some of our most productive properties
and some of the best properties in the country: The Fashion Centre at Pentagon City, King of Prussia, Woodbury
Common, The Galleria in Houston; most of these projects will be completed in the next 12 months.
Construction continues on two new domestic outlets in Columbus and Clarksburg, both are scheduled to open later this
year; as well as our designer outlet in Provence, France which is scheduled to open in the spring of 2017. We also
started construction during the quarter with our partner, Ivanhoé Cambridge, on our fourth outlet in Canada in
Edmonton, Alberta, which is scheduled to open in fall of 2017.

Construction continues on to two full new price developments, one in Miami at Brickell City Centre and the other in
Fort Worth at The Shops at Clearfork which is scheduled to open in 2017. Brickell will open in the fall of this year. We
also completed the acquisition of The Shops at Crystal; purchase price was $1.1 billion. We plan to place a $550
million mortgage on the property in the next two months, and we are a 50/50 partner with Invesco, and we look
forward to building upon a high quality asset with its successful foundation.
We acquired a majority interest in a leading outlet center in Ochtrup, Germany with our partner McArthurGlen. And
during the first quarter, we sold interest in two residential properties and one non-core retail property. As you know,
gains and losses on our non-retail assets, including investments, are included in our FFO per share, which we believe is
consistent with the white paper. This resulted in a quarter-over-quarter benefit of approximately $0.06.
Capital markets, we completed a notes offering of $1.35 billion, weighted average interest rate of 2.97% and 8.2 years
of duration. Our liquidity stands at $6 billion. We announced our dividend at $1.60, which is a year-over-year increase
of 6.7%. We increased our guidance to $10.72 to $10.82, reflecting a very good performance. And we're very pleased,
frankly, with our overall performance given an overall lackluster US economy.
And we welcome your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Christy McElroy from Citibank. Your line is open.
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: Hey, David. It's Michael Bilerman with Christy. I just wanted to go first and then
Christy will have one. And I was wondering how the market should think about Simon strategically going forward. It's
about two years to the day when you spun off WPG, all the assets under $10 million of NOI and arguably lower sales
productivity. And now you're left with this immensely high quality mall portfolio, a global outlet portfolio, the mills
portfolio and a stake in Klepierre and some other sort of ventures around. Should we think about potential spins of any
of those businesses going forward or do you think you're still going to own assets across the price spectrum of retail
real estate?
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah. We have no intention to spin off any other assets. We think they're absolutely
synergistic across – with our retailer relationships. We have the lowest overhead, lowest cost of capital given the
portfolio. We've got, historically, the best comp NOI growth. So, as long as we can continue to do what we're doing, I
don't see any reason why we would want to spin anything off.
And they all fit nicely together. They're all in major metro markets. All the assets are producing great cash flow, and
our results speak for themselves. I think the WP spinoff was really a focus on – we were a little – we weren't focusing
as much on the smaller properties as probably we should have, and we thought that was in the best interest of the
shareholders. But we don't see any other reason to take any other corporate restructuring beyond what we did.
<Q - Christy McElroy>: Hi, good morning. It's Christy here. Just wondering if Aéropostale and PacSun stops paying
you rent at any time during the first quarter and if reserving for that might've impacted your bad debt at all in Q1? And
maybe you could give us an update on your overall outlook for retailer bankruptcies and store closings for the balance
of the year and whether or not you're more or less cautious versus a quarter ago?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look, I think a quarter ago, we were cautious. We continue to be cautious. I don't want to
mention specific retailers, whether they paid rent or not paid rent. The only one that's filed bankruptcy thus far is
PacSun. I'm sure there were some pre-petitioned amounts that we wrote off in the quarter. It's not overly material. And
that's part of what we have dealt with for 60 years, retail bankruptcy.
So, we remain cautious. Our biggest reason we're cautious is that the U.S. economy continues to flatten out, there's not
a lot of growth. I suggest you look at a lot of industries beyond real estate to see what's going on in the U.S. economy,

and it is what it is.
<Q - Christy McElroy>: Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: But we've been cautious on those couple of retailers, but we'll deal with it.
<Q - Christy McElroy>: Thanks, David.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt from Bank of America. Your line is open.
<Q - Craig Richard Schmidt>: Thank you. I notice other income and consolidated properties was up significantly.
Was that related to one specific area?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, I would suggest you look to page 21 on our supplemental. Our corporate – this is after
our property – portfolio NOI, corporate and other sources were up roughly $20 million, and that was a function of the
residential interest that we had that flowed through our corporate NOI number.
<Q - Craig Richard Schmidt>: Okay. And you've been doing a great job touching on some really big redevelopments.
I just wonder, as you start to touch more and more of your top properties, will the shadow pipeline start to consider and
include maybe a second tranche of redevelopments to continue that path of growth?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, if you look at our 8-K, you can see all the stuff that we've been working on. I just spent
an hour and a half with my guy that does residential, which, by the way, he just made us $20 million, which ain't bad.
We sold those at a lower cap rate than what we bought Crystals at, which I thought was a pretty good interesting
dynamic in our industry.
He's got – the meeting was longer than I wanted it to be, because my attention span is decreasing as I get older, but the
fact is, he's got 20 things going on across the portfolio. If you look at our 8-K, all the stuff they're doing, I think we're
touching a lot. We just opened Dick's Sporting Goods at Independence Mall just to give you one small example of kind
of a solid middle-market mall that produces a lot of cash flow year after year, but continue – we think continue to get
better. And so the answer is we're touching everything.
<Q - Craig Richard Schmidt>: And just bringing up Crystals, is there an expansion opportunity, I guess, with the
Harmon Towers on that property?
<A - David E. Simon>: Yes.
<Q - Craig Richard Schmidt>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Spector from Bank of America. Your line is open.
<Q - Jeffrey A. Spector>: Great. Thank you. Just wanted to ask about the retail landscape; I feel like all the years
Craig and I have been covering the sector, this past year, we've seen some real dramatic changes. I guess how have
things changed, in your view, just from a year ago in your planning? Whether with the lease contracts or your approach
with retailers? What are your latest thoughts?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, honestly, I think maybe you're getting caught up in a lot of the media discussions. Our
business is as solid as it's ever been. We've had comp NOI increase of 5.1%. Our earnings grew 15.4% per year. We're
projecting to have $10.72 to $10.82.

So, I think our simplistic view is it's not as bad as people want to write about. And I think the biggest issue out there,
frankly, is that we have a U.S. economy – we don't – we'll never use excuses, but I think you have to look at our
performance in conjunction with what's going on in the U.S. economy. And the fact of the matter is the U.S. economy
is flat lining, and yet we're holding our own and gaining market share with a lot of our properties.
And obviously, we've got great tourist-oriented centers that have had a tough year. I think, after this first quarter, we'll
probably anniversary the stronger dollar here coming up. But we've seen the tourism sales decrease, not necessarily the
traffic. But the media about the death of this and the death of that, we don't see it. Demand is fine. Properties are getting
better. We got supply and demand in our favor. No one is building Class A outlets or malls to any degreeable issue.
Certainly, there will be retail space that gets repurposed, which will help us, obviously, in supply and demand
equations, and I don't view it beyond that. The Internet is not the panacea. A lot of CapEx that has been spent there's
not showing the returns for retailers. So I think they're going to – their biggest and best opportunity continues to be
bricks and mortar, and we keep plugging along. I don't know if that answers your question, but that's how we view it
from here.
<Q - Jeffrey A. Spector>: Okay. Great. Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Yeah. Hey, good morning, David. First, thanks for page 21. The NOI breakout is
helpful. A quick question. Maybe you commented on the resi upfront, but can you just give a little bit more color which
projects they were? And then, as we go through the rest of the pipeline, obviously, you got the tower that you
announced down in Houston, but how much sort of embedded potential is there in the portfolio? And is each project
that you guys undertake something that you're going to harvest and sell, so we should expect over the next several years
more of these $20 million quarterly benefits?
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah. Look, I think we tend not to be long term. We look at these things more as investments
than we do operating properties. That's been our point of view. Just like in Q1 of 2015 we had a gain from a
development site we decided to flip in Europe as opposed to staying involved in. So the good news is that we are able
to create – we've had a few mistakes, so we're not perfect.
But we are able to generate additional income in this company through all of our activity, and that's been proven. In Q2
of last year, as you know, we had a big sizable gain in the sale of marketable securities. So please remember that when
we report Q2. So we are able to do that and we do look at investments in whether its hotels, residential, we do look at
them as investments.
And we do tend to look at those as ones that we're not going to own for 30, 40, 50 years like we do the vast majority of
our retail holdings, and that will flow through the P&L as rightly so. That's GAAP accounting, by the way, which –
happy to explain anybody that forgets GAAP accounting.
And I do think, with the list of all the activity, you're going to see that episodically, but certainly consistent with how
we're going to drive our cash flow growth. Now, specifically, we sold Firewheel Residential, and we also sold
SouthPark, which – additionally, which goes to show you how things can change.
We actually did SouthPark as a condo development. The market crashed. We actually wrote off our investment in that
and that went through FFO. And then – now, our investment in that was not big, so I think it was like $3 million or $4
million of equity. And then it turned into a residential, not a condo, but just a multi-family project, and we just sold it.
The two of them, as I said to you, we thought the cap rates were very aggressive. Our partners wanted to sell. We view
those, like I said, as investments, so we decided to sell them, and the results flowed through this quarter. And I do think

we'll have a pipeline of other investments that we don't consider core outside of retail always flow through our P&L.
And hopefully, as I said, we haven't batted a 1,000, but hopefully, there will be a lot more income and gains just like
our Simon Venture Group.
Anything that is profitable will flow through FFO. Anything that's a loss will wash out. And, in fact, we had – don't get
panicky, but we've actually written off a couple of investments that have just – we don't see the value. They're still may
be plugging along, but we took a conservative approach to go ahead and flush those through and those are through
FFO.
So that's how we do it, but I'm hopeful that we'll continue to create value in all sorts of different ways, including
building and selling residential. When we do Copley and part of that project will be condos. Those will flow through
the P&L as you would expect that those would happen. And they will flow through FFO because that's how we view
the definition of the FFO white paper, which, as you know, we adhere to stringently.
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Yes. You guys have been quite vocal on that point. On Crystals, can you just talk –
you guys, obviously, have basically unlimited capital. So can you just talk about your decision to JV that, especially, if
there's development upside, and how, especially, in that market, given how it bookcases The Strip, your decision to JV.
And then, other investments, how you figure out if you want to do it wholly versus bringing in a partner.
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, in this case, it was relatively simple. We were approached to partner and we liked who
approached us, and we felt it would be beneficial to do a joint venture. The asset's been – has a great foundation. It's
been well leased. It does high sales productivity. And we're hopeful that we could add value to it over time and we have
a great partner to do that, and maybe some other things.
So, in this case, the opportunity really came from them, and so it was natural to just partner in it. That doesn't mean
each deals a little bit separately. We may or may not partner. It depends on the circumstances. But, in this case, they
really approached us and we liked who approached us, and it's a very good asset that's been well leased and managed
and operated by the owners and their manager ahead of time. And we hope they'd be able to add value to it over time.
And look, it's not cheap, but given where A-quality assets are being priced in all sectors, I think it's going to be a good
deal for us in the not-too-distant future. I think it's a good start, and it will get better over time.
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: Are you guys able to hear me okay? Because we're getting comments that you can't hear me.
But it sounds like you can hear me fine.
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Yeah. You're coming through clearly.
<A - David E. Simon>: All right. Appreciate it.
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Have a good one.
<A - David E. Simon>: Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<Q - Caitlin Burrows>: Hi. Good morning. I was just wondering, again, on those non-retail gains that were included
in the first quarter results, was that $0.06 gain that you referenced included in your prior guidance?
<A - David E. Simon>: Yes.
<Q - Caitlin Burrows>: Okay. And then, if you look ex that $0.06 impact, the growth is still over 10%, but it doesn't
look like your full year guidance is quite that high. So I was just wondering is there anything else driving the first
quarter to be especially strong or just trying to see to what extent you might be being conservative for the rest of year

versus actually expecting a slowdown, albeit from a pretty high level.
<A - David E. Simon>: Good question. First of all, I believe our growth would have been 12%.
<Q - Caitlin Burrows>: Yeah.
<A - David E. Simon>: 12% if you wanted to. It's up to you. And I understand why you would want to. Just say, okay,
the $0.06 – or the $0.06, but it's actually 12%. And, look, I think we are – as we started – I think it's consistent with
what we described when we did our year-end call, is that we're still being conservative in how we are looking at the
business because, primarily, not because of the Internet, not because of department stores, not because of I don't know,
but there – we do have exposure to tourism, that's obviously effecting our overage rent. You can see that as plain as day
on the P&L. And the U.S. economy, even though it feels like it should be growing, is more or less flat lining. I don't –
what does Goldman think the first quarter GDP is going to be this year? What is your guidance?
<Q - Caitlin Burrows>: You asked me last quarter, so I looked it up. 1.8%
<A - David E. Simon>: All right. Well, I take the under. Okay? So, we'll see. That's not constant, is it?
<Q - Caitlin Burrows>: I'm not sure who exactly it's from.
<A - David E. Simon>: All right. Well, we know you have like 10 of them, so you'll get it right no matter what. But –
so we're just being – I'd say we're being overly conservative and just because there – you've got the election year. By
the way, I hear – it's very interesting, we have essentially no exposure to the U.K., but the U.K. is softening. It's just –
there is a general softening worldwide in the worldwide economy.
And as much as I'd love to be immune to that, we can't be. We're not. We're a consumer-oriented company, and it is –
we are – basically, the worldwide economy is flattening. There is a lot of stuff out there, and we're just being a little bit
cautious. And obviously, we all know there's a few tenants out there that may or may not go bankrupt and may or may
not close a bunch of stores. We've got to be judicious in how we model their future.
<Q - Caitlin Burrows>: Got it. Okay. And then also just if you could – I know you mentioned, as we all know, tourist
sales are not so great. If there is any comment you could make just on the malls versus outlets versus mills, either in
numbers or just a general feeling.
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, I'm happy to say that our comp sales were up nicely in the mall business and down in the
outlet business and down in the outlet business 100% due to our high producing tourist centers and the fact that the
consumer – the traffic is not down, the traffic is up in the outlet business, but the fact of the matter is the spend is less
because of the stronger dollar. And we're going to anniversary that at some point this year, but we didn't anniversary it
yet in the first quarter. It's safe to say.
<Q - Caitlin Burrows>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum from UBS. Your line is open.
<Q - Ross T. Nussbaum>: Hey, good morning. I'm here with Jeremy Metz. Hey, David, I thought the fact that you
guys put up nearly 4.5% base rent growth in the quarter was pretty impressive despite the sluggish sales environment.
But I guess it leads to the question of realistically how long can that continue?
The occupancy cost is up year-over-year from 11.7% up to 12.5%. So I guess, realistically, if in fact mall sales are at
similar levels for the next year, do you think we're going to be looking at occupancy cost for your portfolio that's
pushing 13.5% a year from now?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, again, we could argue ad nauseam and I've lost the argument, so I will admit defeat.
Okay? I will admit defeat publicly. We've lost the argument on the correlation or lack thereof of between retail sales

and our ability to drive rents, which happens, I believe, tied more toward supply and demand than retail sales, because,
as you know, if a retailer is not producing results and their lease happens to come up, we have the ability, certainly, to
replace them with a retailer that's going to be more productive.
Now, as I also said, in the mall business, our comp sales are actually up. It's in the outlet business where we're seeing
the reduction in comp sales, and that is absolutely unequivocally tied to what's going on with the tourism picture. And,
as I said, hopefully that will anniversary, and then that base will move.
Now, the comp NOI growth was outstanding for the whole portfolio, but it was particularly good in the outlet business.
So it is a very profitable category for our retailers and we have the ability to drive rents and drive NOI. So, at this point,
we can argue ad nauseam about the correlation. I'd rather not. We'll do the best we can and, like I said, we're going to
grow our comp NOI better. Maybe one day we'll revert to the mean and I am not guaranteeing that we won't.
But we have grown 200 basis points comp NOI above and beyond the GDP growth because of – I think because our
portfolio skews toward the better customer. And I'm hopeful that that trend will continue, and I actually think it's more
tied to what's going to go on in tourism and what's going to go on in the general economy than it is one particular
retailer sales. That does not necessarily mean anything about the property. But I've lost the argument. I admit defeat.
We'll do the best we can.
<Q - Ross T. Nussbaum>: All right. My follow-up question is on your guidance. If I focus in on the comment you
made, which was, I think, $0.03 of the beat this quarter was not related to the asset sales, you only raised guidance for
the full year by $0.02. So, I guess the question is, if I annualized the non-asset sale beat during the quarter, it's
obviously a bigger number than what you raised guidance by. Are you being conservative or was there anything else
going on in the quarter that's not necessarily recurring?
<A - David E. Simon>: There is absolutely nothing going on in the disclosure. You see the comp NOI, you see all of
that. Ross, we continue to just be relatively conservative given what's going on in the general U.S. economy. And,
again, I'm not using that as an excuse, but there is a level of – there is just a level around the world about consumer
spending, growth in wages, election year, we still have certain retailers that may or may not impact us. Maybe we
budgeted them right; maybe we didn't. All of that, none of it really is all that material for us, thankfully.
We built this company to sustain ins and outs of certain retailers. All of this affects us on the margin, as you know.
Whether you slice this by product type, by geography, by retailer, you cut, slice, bake, Europe, whatever, I just think,
generally, we're operating appropriately given the growth in the economy, and again, our year-over-year – if you didn't
hear, our delta in quarter-over-quarter, Q1 2015, Q1 2016, was really $0.06 because of the opportunity that we sold in
Q1 of 2015 of last year. Okay? So if you're going to look at the delta, don't look at $0.08, really, look at $0.06, if that's
important to you.
<Q - Ross T. Nussbaum>: Appreciate it. Thanks, David.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah. No worries.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste from Mizuho. Your line is open.
<Q - Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste>: Yes, good morning. Thank you taking my question. A first one for you, David, I
guess on the acquisition market. I'm curious on what you're hearing and seeing these days in your conversations with
potential sellers. Are you getting approached a bit more? Are you getting a sense that more people are willing to engage
in conversations than maybe a year or two ago, given some of the concerns about the broader macro that you laid out
earlier?
<A - David E. Simon>: That's interesting. I would have thought maybe but not really. Not really. As you know, we're
not actively scouring the world for new deals and, as I've stated to you before, the big deal business is not something on
our drawing board at this time. And there's a selective thing here or there, but it's not as if – and maybe it's my

personality, but it is not a – I'm not getting a lot of phone calls.
Rick, are you getting any phone calls?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: I'm not and I have a better personality.
<A - David E. Simon>: Rick certainly has a better personality, but – so the answer is not really. But our business is not
easy. It's not for the fainted heart. And it is – when we have a slow economy, it really requires a lots of patience, a lot
of grinding, a lot of focusing on the detail. Sometimes that creates opportunity in itself. But, at this point, nothing really
jumps out at me.
<Q - Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste>: Got you. And I appreciate that. And one more, if I might ask, it might be
redundant, but I was having a little bit of trouble hearing you earlier. But did I hear you say that you'll be putting a
$500 million mortgage on Crystal shops? And if so, just curious on thoughts for the use of capital. Is it effectively
earmarked for maybe the redev or how should we think about any excess proceeds from that?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, no. Simplistically, it was a $1.1 billion deal. We're going to put a $550 million
thereabouts mortgage on it, which will have positive leverage, which we think is very important, just using good old
real estate 101 fundamentals. And the balance of the equity required will be split between us and our partner, Invesco;
simple as that. And so there is no excess financing proceeds. The financing is really part of the purchase price
financing; sources and uses.
<Q - Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste>: Got it. And then one last one, more of an accounting one, but the other day,
obviously, there was a big block floated by you guys on behalf of the DeBartolos of 4.4 million shares. Just curious if
Simon bought any of those shares. Certainly, again, maybe not an attractive a price of few months back, but just
curious if the company at all participated in buying down any of those shares.
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, just to be technically accurate, we didn't float it. It was part of the DeBartolo family
estate. And we did not – Simon Property Group did not buy any stock. But, as you know, the shares were placed in a
relatively quick and straightforward manner. We had nothing to do with the sale of those shares. That was all between
DeBartolo and their – the DeBartolo family estate holdings and their advisor. And they've been a great limited partner,
very supportive. They're still a very, very significant owner. And those are the facts.
<Q - Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste>: Wonderful. Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Donnelly from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
<Q - Jeff J. Donnelly>: Good morning, guys. Actually, first question just for Rick, I was curious as we're headed into
ICSC, if, broadly speaking, there was any themes maybe you're thinking about as we head out to Vegas? And maybe
more specifically any projects that are more mission-critical for your team?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Well, it's interesting because, as David has said, our portfolio has never been stronger, and
we still have significant demand for our properties. And where we are totally focused is maximizing the rents and
productivity of our properties, and so our themes going out there is making sure we get the right retailers in the right
spaces in the right sizes so we can maximize our revenue.
And we, obviously, are spending time doing that. But, frankly, for us, ICSC is relevant, but we have retailers coming in
here all the time. We have a major retail in here coming in tonight and here for the next three days going over the
whole portfolio. So, we are going out there optimistically. We've gotten a lot of good reverse inquiries as to our space.
And we've got a great portfolio across all of our platforms to try and market.

<Q - Jeff J. Donnelly>: And maybe just a follow-up or two. I guess maybe, David, somewhat related to that, how do
you think about the pursuit of omni-channel ultimately plays out for retailers down the road? Because while bricks and
mortar, as you said, is the biggest and best channel today for retailers, consumers do like to buy online irrespective of
whether or not it's weighing on retailer margins.
So, I guess, I'm curious, if you think forward a few years, do you think lower margins are just a new normal for
omni-channel retailers and that's all she wrote, or do you think retailers ultimately have to effectively price in the
convenience aspect of buying online or take it to the extreme? Do you think there's going to be a time when retailers
need to restructure and that gives them an opportunity to sort of reset their cost basis and their online business and shed
the weaker stores?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, again, I think the fallacy in what is talked about is the fact that even if the stores don't
have high sales per square foot, they could generate a lot of operating cash flow for them. So I don't – look, if the store
is losing money, they're going to close the store. That's for sure. The issue is if the store – the sales metrics that we all –
except us, but many, let's say, let me restate it, many focus on does not necessarily tie to profitability, because a lot of
these stores could have very low rent, could be fully depreciated, could be in markets that aren't great, exciting markets
that are growing, but they produce a lot of operating cash flow. They need that operating cash flow to make
investments in whatever they want to make investments in, whether that's omni-channel or technology or new stores or
whatever.
So the statement they're less productive, therefore, they're going to close stores is not how I think they look at it. I think
they look at whether the store has a four-wall profit. And whether or not, if they close it, what does it really do for the
organization. So what is this all going to mean? I think at the end of the day, all retailers have to be profitable. All
e-commerce players have to be profitable, unless Wall Street and other investors are going to fund those investments.
And I don't have a crystal ball as to how it's all going to shake out. Could it put pressure on bricks and mortar?
Certainly, it could. But I think you've got to keep in mind, a lot of these are cash cows that they're using, maybe they're
not investing in them like the way they should or we as owners of real estate would like to see them do it, but I don't
think that equates to store closures necessarily.
Now, if they become unprofitable, they're going to close the store, simple as that. Have to weigh that against what they
charge the store in terms of corporate allocations and overhead and all that and all that. And I think, certainly,
investment in technology is putting pressure on the retailer and we have to be sensitive to that. But I think they're going
to look at, carefully, what services they're going to need to provide to the consumer, because at the end of the day, they
chase that and they can't create profitability out of it, that's not doing anybody any good.
<Q - Jeff J. Donnelly>: Helpful. And just one last question. There has been a lot of ink spilled by folks in our seats
estimating the implication of the spinout of REITs in the S&P under the new sector classification. I'm just curious, as
the largest REIT, how are you guys thinking about that prospect and anything you intend to do differently going
forward to maybe position yourself maybe differently in the eyes of that sort of newer larger pocket of capital?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, I think we're going to be explaining the company and what we do and how they all look
at us. The good news of that group is they look at cash flow growth. They look at earnings growth. They look at
balance sheet metrics. They will compare us to other industries as opposed to just within our sector. They won't be
thoroughly focused on NAV, which, again, we can argue about. They won't worry about a quarter here or there of our
retail sales. They're going to look at what kind of growth we have in our cash flow and our earnings.
And I think that plays perfectly well with us, given the kind of earnings growth that we've had over many, many, many
years and many different cycles. So we're very focused on trying to solicit them, whether or not they're going to be
interested and whether or not that's going to be a whole new category, we have no particular crystal ball on that front.
But if they do look at us, I think we've got a great story to tell, and they're going to look at earnings and cash flow
growth and know that we have hard assets, which never hurt in any cycle to have hard physical assets.
<Q - Jeff J. Donnelly>: Thanks, guys.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Morgan from Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.
<Q - Paul B. Morgan>: Hi, good morning. David, I guess, maybe in light of kind of all your caution on the macro and
the consumer, I'd see if Rick could offer a little sunshine and give some of the concepts where we're seeing expansion
and maybe kind of particularly in kind of the mall expansions and redevelopments that you're doing, number one, and
kind of number two, for anchor spaces, where you might be looking to replace a department store?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Well, first, on the department store side, it is important to note we have one vacant
department store in the entire portfolio and we have like 441 of them. So, again, the narrative out there would have you
believe something very different. And when David opined earlier just as to what we think is going to happen with these
department stores that was a very informed opinion, because we meet with these guys all the time. And that's what
they're telling us. If you look at the activity that we put in the K, we have a significant number of anchors that are
coming into the portfolio. David always makes fun of me when I list them, so I won't.
<A - David E. Simon>: No, please do. Please do.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: But there's a lot going in and they're across the portfolio quality-wise in terms of the
smaller properties, the more productive, the slightly less productive, and they're all getting better. And if you just
follow our momentum, we had 19 added in 2015. We're now up to 35 in 2016. And it's across the gamut of restaurants,
Neiman Marcus, Bloomingdale's; a brand new Saks is opening this week in Houston Galleria in what is a spectacular
state-of-the-art store.
And as we add new space, that enables us to accommodate the new cutting-edge retailers that otherwise we would not
be able to accommodate, and they are still looking to expand at productive properties. And so that is ongoing. And
there's basically, if you step back, we're seeing demand from international retailers coming to this market from new
retail concepts like Suitsupply and ALEX AND ANI and Tesla from e-tailers opening stores that's been talked about a
lot, brand extensions...
<A - David E. Simon>: Restaurants.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: ...of our existing retailers that White Barn Candle is growing aggressively. Victoria's
Secret is growing 4% this year. We're adding restaurants, as David said, throughout the portfolio, and all of this is just
making the portfolio stronger and stronger.
<A - David E. Simon>: And again, we put in page 21 to show you what the fruits of our efforts produce. And I believe
the portfolio NOI, which doesn't include our corporate activities, increased 7.8% for the quarter. As my favorite guy
that I love to quote, Adam Sandler, would say, that ain't too shabby. So we're conservative, but it's not getting in the
way of producing the results we want to produce.
<Q - Paul B. Morgan>: And then, just on the team segment, if we do get a ramp up in closings, obviously, closings for
a lot of these chains have been going on for years. But, let's say, it ramps up. A lot of the chains themselves don't seem
to be producing sales at the volume on a per square foot basis that your portfolio averages. Is there a pretty strong
positive mark-to-market on that space? Would we expect spreads to be consistent if you get hundreds of closings that
can bring in more productive retailers or is that not the way to look at it?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Well, I think if you look at our activity generated last year, where we had Wet Seal and
Cache and Body Shop go out, we have been able to re-lease a very significant amount of space at positive rents and
positive productivity contributions because there are more productive retailers coming in. So is there going to be
downtime? Certainly. Will that have an impact on short-term results? Of course. But, at the end, we certainly
demonstrated an ability to replace those retailers that go out with better retailers and, frankly, that hasn't changed for
decades. That's the business.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies. Your line is open.
<Q - Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya>: Hi. Yes. Good morning, everyone. Just two questions from us. First of all, on
the development and the redevelopment side of the business, just noticed a couple of yield change. The yields for the
new development and the premium outlets went down a little bit, and also expected yields on the mills redevelopment
went down a little bit. Is that purely due to mix?
<A - David E. Simon>: Yes.
<Q - Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya>: Okay.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah. So in the outlets, we added our Canadian deal, which changed the mix, and then there
were a couple of changes in the mills mix. But no budget blows, no income blows, all just mix changes.
<Q - Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya>: Okay. That's helpful. And then, second of all, in regards to Sears, Kmart, some
announcements this week or last week that they're accelerating closures. Just wondering what you think the implication
of that would be going forward, either for your portfolio or also in regards to your JV with Sears?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, as far as we – no, and I think it's a pretty safe statement. None of those closings are in
any of our assets. So that has no impact. And if it makes Sears a healthier retailer, we're all for that. And it really
doesn't impact our Seritage JV or our relationship with Sears. I think it's – we're still doing business as usual there.
<Q - Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya>: Okay. So it doesn't accelerate the ability for you to make a couple of changes
in regards to Sears moving out of some of the Seritage space and you guys redeveloping and leasing that space?
<A - David E. Simon>: No, nothing's changed given that recent announcement. We have no Kmarts in our portfolio.
So I'd say its pretty much business as usual there. We're still, obviously, spending a lot of time going through our JVs to
redevelop some of those boxes. So that's not – no different sense of pace or not given the recent Sears announcement.
<Q - Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya>: Okay. Great.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: And I would just point out the vast majority of those stores that Sears announced as closing
were Kmarts and freestanding stores. I believe there was only one or two mall-based stores in that entire list, none of
which were ours.
<Q - Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya>: Great. Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: You're welcome.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Carol Kemple from Hilliard Lyons. Your line is open.
<Q - Carol L. Kemple>: Good morning. Earlier in the call, you all mentioned that you think some of the best
opportunities for many of the online retailers are opening physical stores. What kind of feedback have you received
from the online retailers who have already opened stores in your malls?
<A - David E. Simon>: Positive, very positive. The cost of customer acquisition – we'd encourage you to read the L2
study that we produced. The cost of customer acquisition for a pure online retailer at a certain level, if they don't have
physical stores, is so high that they all view the physical stores as a way to really reduce their customer acquisition

costs, extend their branding, extend their reach. And so far, it seems to be producing what they're looking to get out of
that. So, so far so good there.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust. Your line is open.
<Q - Ki Bin Kim>: Thank you. So, I just wanted to ask you a couple of questions on occupancy cost. For new leases
that you're signing, what do the occupancy costs look like? And I think when I asked this question last time, you said
around 14% to 15%. I was curious if that needle is moving closer to 15% or 14% lately?
<A - David E. Simon>: It's so retailer space specific, but I think the important thing is to look at our average base rent.
It's still under 10% – well under 10% of what the sales are. Our averages mean a lot because we have this vast
portfolio. You can see the rollover schedule. There is no one – there is just no way I can really answer that question.
And so it's so specific on location, mall, retailer, use, so on and so forth. But we're increasing our average base rents
and our spreads are our spreads and our comp NOI are our comp NOI.
<Q - Ki Bin Kim>: Okay. Well, I guess I was asking if there were any more general trends you were noticing if things
were changing at all. But I guess my second question is how will you treat Tesla sales in your reported stats if they're
going to be in there at all?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, if they report sales, they're in, if they don't, they're not. We have that policy with every
retailer; the good, the bad, the indifferent.
<Q - Ki Bin Kim>: So would that mean that their sales would eventually be included?
<A - David E. Simon>: I just said if they report sales, they are in, if they don't, they're not. And just as every retailer
under 10,000 feet, again, and I think they report in a couple, I think they don't report in most of them. And again, given
the size of our portfolio, it's immaterial.
<Q - Ki Bin Kim>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: As you know, we have 100 and how many – I forget. How many – Tom, how many malls do
we have – 100 and?
<A - Thomas Ward>: 107.
<A - David E. Simon>: 107 and how many outlets that we...
<A - Thomas Ward>: Seven.
<A - David E. Simon>: Seven. So none of these one particular retailer is going to change it all that much.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
<Q - Vincent Chao>: Hey, everyone. Just a couple of cleanup questions here. In terms of the other income, which I
know we talked about inclusive of the resi gains, if we take out that impact, it seems like it's about $52 million or so for
the quarter, which is similar to fourth quarter, but up quite a bit year-over-year. Just curious if that's a decent run rate
going forward, if there was some other – there's a bunch of things in that line item? Just wonder if there's other
one-times in there?
<A - David E. Simon>: I just think you're going to have to get used to the fact that we're going to have ups and downs
in that number over the year, it kind of balances out. We generate a lot of additional income from our portfolio, and
we're hoping that that will grow. I'd say, overall, that number is around $200 million, but it could be higher in one
quarter, lower in the next. It could be higher over the whole year, little lower over one year, and it's just a number that
is going to be volatile. Again, our total revenue base is, Steve, when you include our share of the JVs, $8 billion of
revenue. We're a big company. So it's not – these things are going to go in and out a little bit. But the good news is, it's
income, it's not losses. Okay?
<Q - Vincent Chao>: Right. Okay. And just, maybe another question, apologize if I missed it from earlier. On the
5.1% same-store NOI comp for the quarter, it was quite a bit stronger than last couple of quarters that you reported.
Again, obviously, we just talked about the ins and outs on a quarterly basis. Just curious though if there was anything
surprising here in the first quarter for you guys relative to your initial outlook? [indiscernible] (01:03:07).
<A - David E. Simon>: Not really. We don't update our comp NOI quarter-over-quarter. We told you what we thought
we would do. We're always trying to achieve better than that. Last year, we didn't. We came in a little bit under what
we had wanted to see in comp NOI. That was all related to the unanticipated, at least to the degree, in our overage rent
due to the decrease in tourism spending, yet we produced our good earnings despite that headwind. All of that's
explained in my shareholder letter. But we don't update it. We're hopeful to do better than that than we guided to early
in the year and we'll see.
<Q - Vincent Chao>: Okay. Thanks. And maybe just one last question on the anchor openings, I think there was about
four Backstages that opened this quarter. Just curious if you could provide some color on what you're seeing from that
particular concept.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Well, those Backstages that opened were done in existing Macy's stores, and if you look at
how they're integrated into the store, they're basically taking one façade and one parking field and branding it Macy's
Backstage. And it's, I think, too early to say what kind of sales impact it has, but it is another reason for consumers to
come to that store. And hopefully, it will contribute the kind of positive sales impact that they're looking for. But the
physical presentation of it is, basically, a dedicated entrance and a dedicated portion of one floor of an existing Macy's
store.
<Q - Vincent Chao>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.

<A - David E. Simon>: $65 million, somewhere in that, including the outlet that we sold.

<Q - Michael W. Mueller>: Okay. That was it. Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: No worries.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up from Jeff Spector from Bank of America. Your line is open.
<Q - Jeffrey A. Spector>: Great. Thank you and I appreciate hearing some additional comments. It helped answer my
first question as to how things have changed in the last year. I guess thinking about it, David, would you consider
disclosing the latest occupancy cost of sales for the outlets just to demonstrate the ability to continue to push rents
further or, at this point, you're just combining it with the malls?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, we've always – we've combined them for the last several years. Look, I think all of these
metrics manifest itself in their cash flow and comp NOI, and we are not as obsessed with metrics as maybe the analytic
community. That could be good or that could be bad, but that's just the way we look at things. We also take a
longer-term view of the real estate than we do on a quarter-by-quarter and even a year-by-year view.
So, I don't think that data is going to do you any good, frankly. It's not something we're like obsessed with. Oh, what's
the occupancy cost going to be in this particular deal with this particular tenant? It's not how we run the business. We're
looking at retail mix for the primary purpose that the retailer does well and the consumer likes it. And then if that works
together then, hopefully, it will create the environment that we're trying to do, which, by the way, we're not – we're
decent at, good at, we're not great at, we can always do better.
So another metric is just – it's just not where we want you to think about us. We want you to think about our cash flow
growth, our investing in our assets over the long term and so on. But all I can tell you is the outlet business comp NOI
growth is doing very well, and we don't see a change in that even with the tourism slowdown that we're currently
experiencing. We are – our portfolio NOI grew 7.8% with tough tourism spend and a slow growth economy. That's
pretty good work. I can't guarantee we're going to do it every quarter, but I think that's pretty good work. That's what I'd
like you to focus on.
<Q - Jeffrey A. Spector>: Okay. Sounds good. And then my last question is just on retailer CapEx tenant allowance,
any change there as we think about whether – how you're signing deals or some of your competitors? Is that increasing
for some, decreasing? Is it similar to what we've seen in the past?
<A - David E. Simon>: If you look in the Q, our allowance has been flat year-over-year, and, frankly, all that
allowance is just for new tenants. We have minimal allowance for our renewals.
<Q - Jeffrey A. Spector>: Great. That's helpful. Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: No worries. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy from Citibank. Your line is open.
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: Yeah. It's Michael Bilerman. David, I'm curious, as you think about all the
investments you're making in the mall of the future, how do you think effectively the return on that capital will come?
Do you think it's going to come direct from the consumer to you or do you think it is going to come in the form of
better sales, better productivity, better margins of your tenants and, therefore, higher rents that are able to be paid to
you? And maybe just talk about where we are in sort of your view about how close we are to this mall of the future that
you envision?

<A - David E. Simon>: Well, I think we're still in the very early stages. I wish we were more along that curve, but it's
not easy. I would say to your first – but there's lots of things we're experimenting with and I continue to think that as we
do those investments that the consumer will appreciate them and will lead to more traffic and more visits and more
browsing, which is very important.
I would say to you that I don't necessarily see – I see it more as creating a better environment, which will lead to all the
benefits of that as opposed to the consumer is going to pay us for it. The consumer, frankly, as we all know, is getting a
lot of stuff subsidized right now, because of what is going on in the broader world: delivery, returns, just to name a
couple.
So I see it more as creating an environment that's going to drive traffic and lead to more demand from retailers wanting
to be in those places where traffic is. And more demand, I think, relates to, for us, hopefully, we'll be able to generate
more cash because supply and demand is important in every industry and, obviously, very important in the real estate
industry. So I think it's more that, but I wouldn't rule out the consumer. But I think it's more creating the appropriate
environment, to give you a simple answer today.
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: Right.
<A - David E. Simon>: And I'd say we're early days in that, but we're hopeful and we're hopeful to continue to
improve the environment.
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: I'm curious how much buy-in you have from the retailers to start experimenting and
bringing more experience-based things to their stores. And, clearly, you're doing all this stuff in terms of parking and
direct on the consumer side to get them to come to the mall, but is there some retailers that are being better partners in
terms of just trying to drive that increased traffic?
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah. I think they're all very focused on it. I think the relationship on that front is excellent.
We're getting a lot of cooperation, buy-in. It obviously depends on the sophistication of the retailer. And frankly,
they're very busy, too. But the good news is, when we describe to them what we're trying to achieve and how they can
play a role in, they're all very receptive, but they're also all very busy as well.
So, for us, it's prioritizing the biggest bang for their buck, making it easy as possible in terms of plug and play almost to
use a technology terminology. We can deliver that to the retailer. That's a lot easier. It gets a little gruesome with the
details, which I'll spare you and me and everybody else on the call to go into that level. But I think they're being
excellent, they're being very cooperative, and we all want to drive traffic to the physical world. And we all see the
benefit of that and we'll continue to experiment and plug along here.
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: Great. And thanks for the NOI disclosure.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Floris van Dijkum from Boenning. Your line is open.
<Q - Floris van Dijkum>: Thank you. David, could you – your gross international NOI exposure is 8% today. What is
your net exposure? And would you consider expanding your international NOI based on low interest rates on offer in
both Europe and in Japan? And in particular, when you look at your European outlets platform, do you think you can
expand that by another 3 million square feet over the next five years?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look, I think we do want to expand our Asian premium outlet portfolio, but we only
want to do it when there is supply and demand. We don't want to do it because of low interest rates. And we feel
strongly about our McArthurGlen relationship as well. And the good news is, having been back and forth to see the
MGE folks twice in the last – I don't know – four, five weeks, they have a very good pipe.

So, the answer there is, yeah, we want to build out their pipe in Continental Europe and the U.K. And we certainly want
to – we certainly got a handful of opportunities in Asia as well. And, listen, the low interest rate certainly makes it
easier in a sense, but it's always supply and demand. Can we lease the building? That's it. Can we lease the building and
at what rent?
On your next question, are you asking from a hedging point of view? I wasn't really sure what you meant by the gross
versus the net. So, maybe if I could ask you again that.
<Q - Floris van Dijkum>: Sure. Yeah, it's both on an asset and, obviously, you're partly hedged through local debt, but
also on an FFO contribution in terms of your interest expense in local currencies. What's your interest – sorry, what's
your currency risk in that income on both the asset as well as the income side?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, we certainly hedged – we're in the high 90s% in terms of our investment, and so that's
hedged. But, given – you can see the NOI contribution. It's not – its real dollars once converted, obviously. So there is
risk there, and we're not overly leveraged. So we'll make some of it on the interest expense as we mark that to dollars
on a weighted average quarterly basis. But we've got – they're extremely profitable. Our debt service ratios are
extremely high.
So we will never be able to hedge the profitability of that and never be able to – we don't want to hedge over our
investment, because then you will have that run through the P&L every quarter and I don't want to do that. We will
have the earnings run through the P&L, but I don't want to go outside of currency hedges that would have to be
mark-to-market if we're over-hedged. And so we've always hedged up to our investment, and I think we're in the 90s%,
some-odd percentile. I hope I answered your question.
<Q - Floris van Dijkum>: Yes, partly. So, the other question I had was regarding your Seritage JV and, in particular
maybe, Rick, you can talk about, do you and your partner have similar views on the capital required to redevelop those
boxes?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Certainly, we have the identical vision as to the potential for those boxes. Each of us are
going to have to deal with the funding of that when the time comes through their own sources, but they fully recognize
that and we do not perceive that as an issue.
<Q - Floris van Dijkum>: And when do you expect you're going to start your first project there?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: We're working with Seritage, but also working with Sears, because we need to go through
the pretty complicated process of downsizing these stores, and that's not a straightforward enterprise.
<Q - Floris van Dijkum>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - David E. Simon>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. That is all the time that we have for questions for today, so I would like to turn the call back over to David
Simon for closing remarks.
David E. Simon
Thank you for your questions and your interest. We really appreciate it, and we look forward to talking to you in the
future.
