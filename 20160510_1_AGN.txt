Earlier this morning, we issued a press release reporting Allergan's earnings from continuing operations for the first
quarter ended March 31, 2016. The press release and our slide deck which we are presenting this morning are available
on our corporate website at www.allergan.com. We're conducting a live webcast of this call, a replay of which will be
available on our website after its conclusion. Please note that today's call is copyrighted material of Allergan and
cannot be rebroadcast without the company's expressed written consent.
Turning to slide two, I'd also like to remind you that during the course of this call management will make projections or
other forward-looking remarks regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. It's
important to note that such statements and events are forward-looking statements and reflect our current perspective of
the business trends and information as of today's date. Actual results may differ materially from current expectations
and projections depending on a number of factors affecting the Allergan business. These factors are detailed in our
periodic public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Allergan disclaims any intent or obligation to
update these forward-looking statements except as expressly required by law.
Turning to slide three and our agenda this morning, with us on today's call are: Brent Saunders, our CEO and President,
who will provide an overview of our first quarter business highlights; Bill Meury, our Chief Commercial Officer, who
will provide an overview of our commercial performance in the quarter; David Nicholson, our chief R&D officer, who
will provide highlights from our pipeline achievements in 2016 and upcoming milestones; Rob Stewart, our Chief
Operating Officer, who will provide a few highlights on our Global Generics business; and Tessa Hilado, our Chief
Financial Officer, who will then discuss the Allergan first quarter continuing operations results in more detail. Also on
the call and available during the Q&A are Paul Bisaro, our Executive Chairman; and Bob Bailey, our Chief Legal
Officer.
With that, I'll turn it over to Brent.
Brenton L. Saunders
Thank you, Lisa, and good morning, everyone.
Beginning on slide five, Allergan remains the most dynamic and exciting company in our industry. And in my mind,
that makes us the best pharmaceutical company in the world. You can see it in our results this quarter. You can see it in
the way our team has pivoted to focus on our future as a standalone leader in Growth Pharma. You can see it in the
operational excellence on display in teams across our company. You can see it in the way we focus on building
therapeutic area leadership in the categories where we choose to compete. You can see it in the way we are using open
science to build an industry-leading R&D pipeline to sustain our leadership in those therapeutic areas. And you can ask
our customers about our highly responsive service-oriented approach to customer intimacy. Those are just a few
reasons why we are especially excited about our future.
As we considered our options for deploying cash following Teva's planned $40.5 billion acquisition of our Global
Generics business in the second quarter, we realized that there was no better investment than owning our fast-growing
company. So our board has authorized the company's first share repurchase program at a value of up to $10 billion.
We'll start with $4 billion to $5 billion during the rest of 2016, buying as much as [ph] prudently possible (3:58) in the
open market. If favorable market conditions persist, we will have additional capacity to consider buying more after
satisfying the first part of the program.
In addition to the stock repurchase program, we will have the ability to pay down debt to maintain our
investment-grade credit ratings and preserve significant capacity to invest for growth.
Given the strength of our current business and the opportunities we see ahead, we remain focused on running one of the
finest companies in our industry. Tessa will talk more about the share repurchase program in just a few minutes.
Turning to slide six, Allergan's first quarter performance reflects our continuing execution on each element of our
Growth Pharma strategy. First, top line growth. In the first quarter we powered another fine quarter, with total revenue
up 48% and branded growth up 71% versus prior year. On a pro forma basis, branded revenue was up double digits

again this quarter.
Second, we maintained leadership positions in our seven core therapeutic areas. And with the recent launches of new
drugs like Viberzi, Vraylar, and Kybella, we have added significant muscle and growth potential to our GI, CNS, and
aesthetic therapeutic areas.
Third, our R&D engine continues to produce at record pace. We delivered two new branded FDA approvals and four
FDA submissions just in the first quarter. In Europe, we also received a positive opinion for Zenpep ex-U.S., née
Enzepi, to enhance our cystic fibrosis and pancreatic insufficiency offering. Our open science model is helping us build
a sustainable R&D pipeline by bringing us novel assets like Xaf5 for under-eye bags, and from Heptares, a portfolio of
selective agents for major neurological disorders like Alzheimer's disease, where we are the market leader. Our
best-in-class generics R&D engine continues to perform well, and Rob Stewart will highlight this later.
Fourth, our focus on operational excellence helped us simplify the operating structure, streamline our IT systems, and
drive more than a 500 basis point improvement in our operating margins versus prior year. Our operational excellence
also has been on display with the launch of our generic Crestor in the U.S. Our generics team together with Anda
executed flawlessly to get product onto pharmacy shelves fast in order to take advantage of this first-to-market
opportunity.
Now let me turn to continuing operations business performance in the first quarter on slide seven. Our first-quarter net
revenue grew 48% on a year-over-year basis to $3.8 billion as a result of the Allergan acquisition and strong global
growth within all of our key therapeutic categories. Branded revenue was the key driver, up 71%. Strong sales in key
products and operating margin expansion across our business drove a 15% increase in non-GAAP earnings per share to
$3.04.
Meanwhile, non-GAAP operating income rose to $1.8 billion, an increase of 68% versus prior year. And cash flow
from operations was $1.45 billion excluding R&D asset acquisitions, restructuring, and integration payments. These
results illustrate the strong long-term growth profile of Allergan.
Turning to slide eight, our strategy is based on utilizing all of our Growth Pharma assets together, including our
best-in-class commercial engine, to bring life-changing medicines to patients around the world. As we look at our
product portfolio, our branded business continues to thrive in the first quarter, with 10% pro forma revenue growth
excluding the impact of currency and the Namenda IR and divestitures. Our top [ph] global growth (8:15) products,
which represent more than 75% of total branded revenue, grew 13% excluding the impact of currency and Namenda
IR, with over half those products growing at double-digit rates. This quarter performance is a true testament to the hard
work of our team and the success of our Growth Pharma strategy and mindset.
Moving to slide nine, as we near the conclusion of the Generics divestiture, I have been carefully considering how to
streamline our management structure to better align our resources as a focused branded Growth Pharma business with
many leading global brands. We have announced a streamlined executive team to lead Allergan going forward.
In this new leadership structure, all of our commercial businesses will be combined under Bill Meury, who has been
appointed our Chief Commercial Officer. There will be three major business segments under Bill. The first segment is
U.S. Specialized Therapeutics, which includes eye care, medical aesthetics, medical dermatology, and Botox
Therapeutic. The second segment is U.S. General Medicine, which includes CNS, CV, GI, women's health, AI, and
urology. The third segment is International, which includes all of our businesses outside the U.S., organized in multiple
regions. Anda, our fourth segment, will continue to report to Rob Stewart.
We remain focused on driving growth by building therapeutic area leadership in our seven core therapeutic areas: eye
care, aesthetics and medical dermatology, CNS, GI, women's health, Botox Therapeutic, and anti-infectives. We will
continue to be a drug development powerhouse and utilize our open science model to invest in innovation and propel
future growth in these therapeutic areas. I believe this new commercial structure will further enhance our global focus,
speed decision-making, and align resources and priorities with our R&D priorities.

We are also appointing Rob Stewart to the position of Chief Operating Officer. In this role, Rob will make sure our
manufacturing operations run smoothly to meet our sales goals, oversee harmonization of our IT systems and
processes, and finish previous integrations.
With that, I will turn the call over to Bill Meury, our new Chief Commercial Officer.
William J. Meury
Thanks, Brent, and good morning, everyone.
Two hallmarks of Growth Pharma are category leadership and customer intimacy. They're true differentiators for
Allergan, especially within our commercial team, which consists of a worldwide sales force of more than 7,500 strong.
I'm looking forward to leading the Allergan commercial organization, which has a great portfolio of products, as you
know, and an industry-leading team with deep knowledge and expertise of key therapy areas.
All the talent we needed for the future organization was here within our four walls. And with this new integrated
structure, we can begin to leverage resources globally and across product lines in lockstep with our R&D organization.
We're squarely focused on leadership in each of our therapeutic areas and on having a unique connection with our
customers, both of which are competitive advantages.
Turning to slide 11, the fundamentals of our business are strong. Overall basic demand, market share growth, and sales
performance were robust in the first quarter. And we're well positioned to sustain the growth for these franchises for the
remainder of 2016 and beyond. In all seven of our therapeutic areas, our teams delivered high single or double-digit
sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange versus the prior year.
In eye care, sales increased by 11%, powered by continued strength from Restasis, Combigan, and Ozurdex. U.S. sales
for Restasis, our flagship product, increased by 22%. We're preparing for the launch of Restasis MDPF, Multi-Dose
Preservative Free, in the second half of the year, and looking forward to the approval of Oculeve, our nasal
neurostimulator, in early 2017, which will significantly strengthen our product offering for ocular surface disease.
Behind these two products, we have a cortisol analog and a mucin secretagogue. We are, as you know, an eye care
company, and we look forward to building the deepest and broadest portfolio for ocular surface disease.
In CNS, we delivered 21% growth, with Botox Migraine, Namenda XR, and Vraylar. These were the key growth
products in the quarter and are expected to continue driving growth in 2016 and beyond.
In aesthetics, sales increased by 7% with Botox, fillers, and Kybella. All three businesses are in an excellent position,
and we expect to sustain high growth rates in 2016 and beyond too. Sales in aesthetics increased at an impressive rate
of 16% excluding medical dermatology. Medical derm revenue, however, was impacted by a one-time harmonization
for allowances in the quarter. However, prescription trends were relatively stable, and we expect growth in the back
half of the year.
In GI, Linzess, our flagship, continues to exceed expectations and post exceptional growth, and the launch of Viberzi is
off to a very strong start. We expect sales for this franchise to increase at a double-digit rate in 2016 and beyond despite
a decline in the Asacol/Delzicol product line. We also see strong growth and continue to be excited about our future in
women's health, urology, and anti-infectives.
On slide 12, we have eight products in launch phase across each of our leading therapeutic areas. This is important as it
provides new products for our sales forces, new products to deliver to our customers, and new innovation to solve
unmet medical need for patients. Let me talk a little bit about three of our newest launches, Vraylar, Viberzi, and
Kybella, all of which have blockbuster potential.
Turning to slide 13, we launched Viberzi, our treatment for IBS-D, right at the end of 2015, and we're off to a strong
start. Based on sales, Viberzi is trending at approximately 80% of Linzess IBS-C during the same time period
post-launch, which is in line with our expectations. More than 8,000 physicians have prescribed Viberzi to date, and
about 65% of the physician base are repeat prescribers. And we're seeing a nice boost to scripts following the start of

our DTC campaign in April.
Linzess, our treatment for IBS-C, continues to experience strong growth four years post-launch. We've seen
incremental growth following the launch of our long-term care focused detailing program and DTC advertising
campaigns. We now have two products that can cover a range of IBS needs to treat these patients.
Turning to slide 14 and Vraylar, Vraylar was launched in mid-March in the United States and is tracking strongly with
competitive products, including Rexulti and Latuda at the time of their launches, exceeding our internal expectations.
Vraylar has higher script trends versus Latuda at launch, and Vraylar's volume is similar to Rexulti without a current
indication in MDD. The future of this product is very promising. Vraylar could potentially be the only approved
treatment with five different indications or claims. That would be a significant advantage for the product and would
make it a potential blockbuster in the marketplace.
Now turning to slide 15, Kybella, our product for submental fat reduction, or double chin, is off to a strong start. Since
we acquired the product from Kythera in October of 2015, we've accelerated the training of targeted accounts. So far
we have trained over 4,000 injectors, or almost 50% of the potential user base. And importantly, 3,000 of those trained
have already begun ordering.
In the back half of the year, we plan to launch a DTC campaign for Kybella. The campaign will greatly enhance the
current promotional effort, which are really laying the groundwork in the creation and development of this new market
for injectables. We continue to believe this product has a very strong future potential, and our R&D team is exploring a
number of new indications. We're also continuing to develop and prepare for the launch of the product ex-U.S. in
various markets, including the recent launch in Canada and other international markets later this year and in 2017.
In summary, our Commercial business continues to perform well, and we plan to continue to focus on our core therapy
area leadership and in leading the industry with launches and ultimately in double-digit top line growth.
With that, I'll turn the call over to David.
[06GLXP-E David Nicholson]
Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone.
Let's move to slide 17. This presents our late-stage development pipeline. In Q1, we continued to make very significant
progress, 2016 being another extremely busy year for our R&D team. We expect more than a dozen approvals and
regulatory submissions, and we are on track to achieving these milestones.
I'm not going to talk about everything on this slide, but I would like to talk about a few of the key highlights, first,
approvals. We received U.S. approval of Aczone Gel 7.5% for the treatment of acne, providing a new concentration of
dapsone for once-a-day application. And we received FDA approval of Dalvance single-dose as an antibiotic for skin
and skin structure infections. The single dose allows for delivery of this IV antibiotic in 30 minutes in the emergency
department and infusion centers, and will provide selected patients the benefit of receiving a complete course of
parenteral treatment, which may avoid hospital admissions.
Regarding submissions to regulatory authorities, we submitted an NDA for oxymetazoline as a treatment for rosacea.
Also, we submitted an sNDA for Linzess low-dose 72mcg for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation, or CIC,
which provides another important dosing option for physicians and patients, and could accelerate the conversion to the
OTC market. We also filed an sNDA for a single-handed inserter with optimized packaging for Liletta, our intrauterine
device.
Our partner, Serenity Pharmaceuticals, submitted and the FDA has accepted an NDA for Ser 120, a potential new
treatment for nocturia.
Turning to development programs, earlier this week we announced positive top line results from VENUS I, one of two
Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of ulipristal acetate for the treatment of uterine fibroids. In the
trial, both 10mg and 5mg treatment arms met all co-primary and secondary endpoints over placebo, and there were no

treatment-related serious adverse events.
This is important progress for our Esmya program and for patients. It is estimated that uterine fibroids contribute to
more than 200,000 hysterectomies annually in the U.S. It's about one-third of all hysterectomies performed in the
United States. Esmya has the potential to offer the first and only non-surgical oral treatment option for women
suffering from uterine fibroids in the United States. The results are very exciting, and we continue to anticipate a 2017
submission for this product.
In addition, in Q1, together with Gedeon Richter, we initiated a Phase 3 trial for cariprazine in bipolar depression. Two
parallel studies will be conducted at approximately 85 sites in the U.S. and Europe. Bipolar depression is one of the
most difficult mental illnesses to treat, and response rates vary greatly from one patient to another. So it's important to
continue to explore new therapies and increase the number of options which are available to help patients manage their
symptoms.
Turning to slide 18, as Brent mentioned, Allergan's R&D pipeline continues to be innovative and productive, and it is
continuing to grow through our open science model. In 2015, we acquired, in-licensed, or entered into collaborations,
providing more than 10 new pipeline opportunities across our key therapeutic areas. We achieved registration for four
NMEs in the United States.
In 2016, we have already added two additional development programs through open science. First, our development
and commercialization partnership with Heptares adds a broad clinical and pre-clinical portfolio of muscarinic M1, M4,
and dual M1/M4 agonists, including HDL9936 and HDL18318 for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. These
muscarinic agonists have the potential to improve symptoms of this disorder such as cognition and psychosis.
Muscarinic agonists have previously been demonstrated to improve cognition in Alzheimer's. The development has
been hindered due to off-target side effects. We believe that the Heptares compounds have selectivity advantages,
which should result in maintenance of the beneficial effect without the deleterious side effects.
Our acquisition of Topokine adds Xaf5, a potential first-in-class treatment for steatoblepharon, or more easily known as
undereye bags.
We've had a great start to 2016 in R&D. We have many more milestones ahead for the remainder of the year. Our
pipeline continues to validate our approach to R&D innovation through our open science model. I thank our more than
2,000 Allergan R&D colleagues around the world for their tremendous work and dedication in deriving innovation, in
achieving these results, and for their commitment to the work ahead.
I will now turn the call over to Rob Stewart to briefly discuss a few highlights of the Global Generics business. Rob?
[0D2HLP-E Rob Stewart]
Thanks, David, and good morning.
Turning to slide 20, our generics business remains a best-in-class asset, and I could not be more proud of the
accomplishments of our entire organization. The R&D team continues to achieve an incredible number of filings both
in the United States as well as in key international markets. More impressive than the numbers are the quality of the
assets filed, including first-to-file applications for generic Abraxane as well as generic Xifaxan. Out of all of the
first-to-files published by FDA in 2016, our generic team holds 50% of those accepted. They've done this year after
year, and now have amassed over 90 first-to-file applications pending at the agency. Outside of the United States, we
have filed over 1,000 marketing authorizations, so the performance remains strong not only in the U.S. but across the
globe.
Price erosion is always a headwind in the generic industry, and 2016 is no different. Companies that invested in
developing high-quality assets and invested in their supply chain capability are able to counter price erosion more
effectively with new product launches, strong quality, and reliable customer service. This year we've launched 13 new
products in the United States, including generic Crestor last week. Internationally we launched 62 products, including
pemetrexed. We continue to see erosion within expectations, around mid-single digits, different from the more
commoditized generic models out there.

Moving to slide 21, our entire organization remains focused on closing the transaction with Teva in June. We are
operationally ready to close once we receive the antitrust clearance. We have regulatory approvals in all countries with
the exception of the U.S., but both teams are working diligently to complete that process.
In closing, our performance remains strong. Our team continues to execute, and most of our leadership team at
Allergan Generics is continuing on with Teva, so we expect to see continued strong performance post-close.
I'll now turn the call to Tessa to review our first quarter financial results. Tessa?
Maria Teresa Hilado
Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Please note this discussion of results reflects continuing operations, which
we have been reporting since Q3 2015 following the announcement of the divestiture of our Global Generics business
to Teva.
Turning to our overall results for the first quarter of 2016 on slide 23, in the first quarter we delivered strong
year-over-year performance. On a non-GAAP basis, consolidated net revenue for the first quarter of 2016 was $3.8
billion, an increase of 48% versus the first quarter of 2015, with branded net revenues increasing 71% to $3.4 billion,
primarily driven by the Allergan acquisition. Sequentially, results were impacted by lower Anda revenues and the
impact of anticipated seasonality on top promoted branded products.
Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 80.1%, an increase of 8.9 percentage points versus first quarter 2015,
which reflects our revenue mix following the acquisition of Allergan and the impact from Anda. While Anda's revenue
has declined versus prior year, the lost revenue was at a very low margin.
Non-GAAP R&D investment for the quarter was $277 million compared to $172 million in the prior-year period.
Non-GAAP SG&A was relatively flat compared to last quarter at $1.01 billion as a result of continued spending behind
our new product launches, including Kybella, Viberzi, and Vraylar. SG&A increased from the previous-year period as
a result of the acquisition of Allergan.
Non-GAAP operating income for the quarter was $1.75 billion, an increase of 68% versus the prior year, driven by
higher revenues and higher gross margins across our business segments, mainly as a result of the Allergan acquisition.
Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share for the quarter increased 15% to $3.04 compared to $2.65 per diluted share in
the first quarter of 2015.
Our non-GAAP tax rate was 9.7% in the quarter. This rate was driven in part by the entire interest expense being
included in our continuing operations earnings.
Cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $1.2 billion, impacted by recent R&D asset acquisitions and
integration expenses. Excluding these items, cash flow from operations was $1.45 billion.
Turning now to our U.S. brands results on slide 24, the business continued to deliver strong performance year over
year. U.S. brands revenue was $2.3 billion for the quarter, up 27% versus the prior-year period, driven by the addition
of the Allergan business and strong growth across other key branded products, offset by a decline in Namenda IR with
the loss of exclusivity for that product and lower revenue of the Asacol/Delzicol franchise. Adjusted gross margin
within U.S. brands continued to show improvement with margins of approximately 89%, up 0.8 percentage points
versus the prior-year quarter.
SG&A as a percentage of revenue decreased to 21.7% versus 23.8% in the year-ago quarter, driven by our continued
ability to maximize our commercial infrastructure post the Allergan acquisition.
And now turning to slide 25, our U.S. medical business, first quarter revenues were $450 million. There's no significant
prior-year comparison for U.S. medical, as it was acquired as part of the Allergan acquisition in March of 2015. On a
pro forma basis, U.S. Medical business revenue grew two percentage versus prior year and 14% excluding medical

dermatology. Growth was driven by key products, including Botox at 12%, fillers at 14%, and Kybella. Sequentially,
revenue was impacted by typical seasonality. Our med-derm business net revenue declined versus the prior year on a
pro forma basis, attributed to a one-time harmonization of allowances versus Q1 2015. Prescription trends for the
products were stable, and we expect strong full-year performance from this business, driven by Aczone.
First quarter gross margins continued to be stable at 93.1%. Sequentially, SG&A increased slightly as a result of
continued Kybella promotional spend and sales force expansion related to the launch of this product.
Turning to slide 26 and our international brand results, first quarter revenues were $673 million versus $119 million in
the prior-year period, largely due to the Allergan acquisition. Excluding FX on a pro forma basis, international
revenues in the first quarter grew 16%, driven by continued strong growth of Botox Cosmetic, fillers, and Ozurdex.
Gross margins were 85.3% in the quarter, and segment SG&A increased two percentage points to 31.9% versus fourth
quarter 2015, due largely to new product launches, including earFold and Constella in various markets.
Turning to our Anda business on slide 27, revenues decreased 34% to $365 million versus $554 million in the
prior-year period, driven by anticipated lower retail business, primarily from the CVS acquisition of Target in-store
pharmacies. Gross margins increased 2.3 percentage points to 16.9% due to product mix. Results in all periods include
third-party revenues and related expenses of generic products manufactured by the company and distributed through
Anda.
Slide 28 details our debt capitalization. We ended the first quarter 2016 with total debt of approximately $42.6 billion
and equity of $77.5 billion. At quarter end, our leverage ratio was 4.43 times debt to adjusted EBITDA versus 4.07
times in the prior-year quarter. In April, we made approximately $1.2 billion in debt payments, bringing our adjusted
leverage ratio to 4.3 times debt to adjusted EBITDA. We remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade
ratings. Following the close of the divestiture of our Generics business to Teva, we anticipate paying the remaining
term loan balance of approximately $8 billion, which has no prepayment penalties.
Turning to slide 29, let me make a few comments on our 2016 guidance, which we are reiterating today. We continue
to expect full-year net revenues to be approximately $17 billion, including branded business revenues of approximately
$15 billion, reflecting double-digit growth, driven by strong sales of key products and new launches in 2016. Note that
revenues will be back-half weighted as a result of contribution from launches being greater in the second half and
typical pharma seasonality. Our revenue forecast reflects lower year-over-year revenue expectations for Anda of
approximately $500 million due to the CVS acquisition of Target in-store pharmacy.
We continue to expect our gross margins to remain strong, with no material change from current levels in each
segment. We continue to anticipate SG&A as a percentage of non-GAAP revenue to be approximately 25% of total net
revenue. And we expect the SG&A as a percentage of revenue to trend downwards throughout the year naturally as
revenue is increased and as we continue to see the impact of our anticipated business simplification activities following
the divestiture of our Global Generics business to Teva.
As part of the business simplification plan, we announced a new streamlined senior leadership structure. This new
structure will allow us to leverage resources across therapeutic areas and product categories and focus on the key
attributes of Growth Pharma, including strong top line revenue growth and operational excellence, which will result in
industry-leading operating margins.
R&D spend is expected to be approximately $1.5 billion as a result of the many important late-stage programs
advancing in our pipeline, including the commencement of Phase 3 programs of Rapastinel and Ubrogepant in the back
half of this year.
Our tax rate should begin to trend gradually toward normalized levels, in the range of 14%, following the close of
Teva. We will provide an updated forecast for 2016, including our expectations for earnings per share following the
close of the Teva transaction, most likely on our second quarter earnings call in August.
And now starting on slide 30, I would like to spend a few minutes on our capital deployment expectations following the
close of the Teva transaction. To echo Brent's comments during his introduction, we have great conviction in our

Growth Pharma strategy and in the strong future prospects of our company. Our strategy for capital deployment will
involve a three-pronged approach with options that are not mutually exclusive, with a goal of providing the best value
and return to our shareholders.
On slide 31, the divestiture of our Global Generics business provides us with significant liquidity. As mentioned by
Rob previously, Teva has done a great job working through a very intricate process. Working together with our
colleagues at Allergan, Teva is ready for a successful day one following the close, which is on track for June.
Moving to slide 32, as you saw this morning, we announced our board's authorization to repurchase up to $10 billion of
our own stock following the close of the Teva transaction. We realized that there was no better investment than in our
own fast-growing company. We expect to execute $4 billion to $5 billion over a four to six-month period, buying as
much as prudently possible in open-market purchases subject to favorable market conditions. If favorable market
conditions persist, we will have more liquidity to consider buying more after satisfying the first part of the program.
In addition to the stock repurchase program, we are also committed to maintaining our investment-grade ratings and
will pay down approximately $8 billion of debt following the close of the Teva transaction. This leaves us with
significant capacity to invest strategically in the growth of our company.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brent for closing remarks.
Brenton L. Saunders
Thank you, Tessa.
Now to finish, let me provide some comments on the overall environment. Over the past six months, we have seen a
particularly tough environment for companies relying on a strategy of high leverage and buying low-quality non-core
assets, significantly raising prices, and drastically cutting lifeblood investments in R&D and commercial infrastructure.
When the strategy is flawed, the outcome will be bad, even if it takes time.
What is left will be high-quality companies that continue to invest in R&D and those that come up with new ways to
speed introduction of medical innovations. The best of those high-quality companies will not rely only on what their
teams discover in-house but will also have an open mind and use open science to attract innovations from across the
entire ecosystem. They will have excellent R&D capabilities to bring those innovations through the rigors of clinical
trials and regulatory review around the world. And the most dynamic of those companies will have commercial engines
that are resilient, persistent, and effective at driving growth.
Allergan is one of those high-quality, dynamic, growing pharmaceutical companies. That is how we are running this
company. I am proud of our team doing this great work at every level and honored to be their CEO.
What that, let's open it up for questions. Lisa?

<Q - David R. Risinger>: Yes, thanks very much. Congrats on the news today. I wanted to ask a number of questions,
but I'll just keep it to one to start and then I'll circle back into the queue.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Thank you for setting a good tone.
<A - Lisa M. DeFrancesco>: Thank you, David.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: With respect to capital allocation, obviously investors are focused on how you're going to
use the proceeds once the Teva transaction closes, and so I was hoping that you could talk a little bit more about capital
allocation. Specifically, slide 32 says tuck-in deals, so I think that's what investors are looking for. They're not looking
for large deals, but if you could provide a little bit more color on the M&A that you're focused on. And also, if you
could comment on any thoughts on a potential dividend. Thank you.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Sure, I'll take the question, David, and maybe Tessa will jump in as well. So look, I think
you're exactly right. As you look at the slide 32 that Tessa had up, we are currently looking at three areas for capital
allocation: one, the share repurchase that we announced today, up to $10 billion; paying down debt and maintaining our
investment-grade credit ratings, and we'll pay down about $8 billion without penalties immediately upon receipt of the
proceeds from Teva; and then continuing to look at advancing our Growth Pharma strategy.
And we believe today that the best way to advance our Growth Pharma strategy is to bolster our therapeutic area
leadership both with tuck-in product acquisitions and with intellectual property R&D asset acquisitions. And I think we
have, as David pointed out, we did about 10 of those last year. We've done two in the first quarter, and they've been I
think highly productive and potentially very successful for us.
So we're going to stick to the knitting of what's created Growth Pharma. If there was a transformational deal like
Allergan where there's a – which was a bit of a one-in-a-million type of opportunity to be a white knight to buy a
once-in-a-lifetime kind of asset like Allergan, certainly we're going to stay open-minded to that. But our core focus is
on running the best pharmaceutical company in the world and supporting that growth through this three-pronged capital
deployment strategy.
<A - Maria Teresa Hilado>: On dividends, our long-term, our capital deployment philosophy actually really centers
on what is in the long-term good for our shareholders from a value perspective, and we do believe longer term that
dividends presumably could be part of that strategy.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Thank you.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Thanks, David.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you. Brent, on the back of the $10 billion authorized share buyback program, obviously it's
very good news from my perspective and I'm sure many investors. But why not announce a buyback through an ASR
or a Dutch auction rather than waiting over a six-month period to buy back $4 billion to $5 billion through the open
market? Is there a limitation because of the structure of your business? Why not accelerate that process? And also, can
you speak to market conditions that would prevent you from doing the entire $10 billion buyback? Thanks very much.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Sure, I'll start and maybe Tessa then can jump in. Look, I think in fairness, Jami, we
would have loved to have bought in an ASR at the current prices. But to be fair, restrictions in Irish law make an open
market structure our best course of action. And if you look at Irish companies, there is no Irish company that has ever
done an ASR. And there are certain reasons for that, which would probably take the rest of our time on the call to walk
through. But, Tessa, do you want to jump in there?

<A - Maria Teresa Hilado>: Yes, we also obviously evaluate the various structures that could satisfy and would look
like an ASR, but currently there are really no structures that could provide us the benefits of a traditional ASR without
legal or accounting complications. As Brent pointed out, there has been no Irish company that has actually executed an
ASR, really largely due to the limitations in Irish law.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: I'm sorry. Go ahead, Jami, did you have something...
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Yes, the second question was can you speak to the market conditions that would prevent you from
doing the entire $10 billion buyback?
<A - Maria Teresa Hilado>: At the end of the day, it really depends on volume on a regular basis because we
obviously want to buy prudently. And then secondly, as we look going forward in terms of other capital deployment
options and how the stock performs, that could potentially affect our thinking. In reality, the reason why we announced
a $4 billion to $5 billion share buyback program is because really that's the only thing we can buy in the next four to six
months. That doesn't mean that we won't go up to the $10 billion. Before we actually end the $5 billion program, we
will then assess putting in additional 10b5 grids to execute up to the $10 billion.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: And so just to be clear, Jami, because I think that this question could be out there, to
reiterate what Tessa said, doing the $4 billion to $5 billion over the next several months, in our view, is about the
maximum we can buy given the volumes of what our stock has historically traded at. If we could buy more, we will,
and we'll update you at that time. We would like to execute the full $10 billion, but we can only commit to what we can
commit to at this time, and we will keep all of you updated, probably on our quarterly calls, as we go forward. Our
board was very committed to the buyback, and that's why it was $10 billion. And right now, we can execute what we
can execute for the foreseeable future, and we'll continue to update you as we go.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Just a quick follow-up, obviously, your desire is to do tuck-in deals to help grow the pipeline, but
there may not be tuck-in opportunities or tuck-in opportunities present themselves throughout year, throughout the
course of the year. Are you limiting yourself to $10 billion because based on my numbers you could go even higher
than a $10 billion buyback? Is this something that you're constantly balancing and assessing, or is $10 billion as far as
you'll go on a buyback?
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: To be fair, we're constantly evaluating all of the opportunities, including debt repayment,
and maintaining our investment-grade rating is incredibly strategic to us. So that is at the top of our list as well.
That being said, if we execute the full $10 billion and market conditions continue to look very favorably, I would
certainly bring to our board with a lot of advocacy to continue and authorize more. But at this point, $10 billion holds
us over for the next several months or perhaps more, so we're in good shape. We will be in the open market buying our
stock for the foreseeable future, and we'll keep everybody updated. And to be fair, if we could have done it through an
ASR if it were available to Irish companies, we would have done it. It's just not.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Right, thank you very much and congratulations.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yes, thank you.

And our next question comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Thank you. So I guess there are some drawbacks to being Irish.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Not many. They have good beer too, though.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: So, Brent, you could spend years bolstering your positions in those seven therapeutic areas.
Assuming they're all core, is that your intention, or what would it take for you to stray from that? And within that, are
you globally or geographically where you want to be within those seven? Thanks.

<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: So I think you're right, Gregg. We could spend years bolstering our position in those
seven therapeutic areas. And in fact, at R&D Day last November we showed a lot of the whitespace opportunity in each
of those therapeutic areas. And those that want to go look at it, I think that presentation is still up on our website.
And you know what? That's the foundation of our strategy, Gregg, is that there is so much opportunity for years to
continue to bolster our position, and so we will. We like every one of the seven therapeutic areas that we're in. We
think there's huge unmet medical need, huge opportunities to help patients with cures and treatments, and tremendous
scientific advance. So we're going to continue to deploy open science and opportunities to bring in selected marketed
products to bolster our position and become number one globally in every one of those therapeutic areas.
With respect to a new therapeutic area, I think the bar would be high for us to consider de novo a new therapeutic area.
It would have to be an area with strong growth potential, lots of whitespace, and limited competition for assets in that
category. There are a few that we evaluate that meet those goals, but we're not focused on doing that at this time.
I think in terms of global expansion, I think that was a huge opportunity for us in the Pfizer transaction. We talked
about that as probably our most compelling revenue synergy. And as a standalone Allergan, it remains a compelling
opportunity for us. I think as you look at the growth that Paul Navarre and the international team put up this quarter and
in previous quarters, it's a strong proof point in our interest in growing appropriately ex-U.S. We're going to focus on
eye care. We're going to focus on aesthetics and dermatology, and we're going to focus on GI and women's health. And
those are the areas that we're going to stay focused and looking at going into new markets.
I think, Paul, we've expanded and taken back some distributor rights. Perhaps you just want to comment on one or two
of those markets.
<A - Paul Navarre>: Yes, so we have expanded in Eastern Europe. We went direct into 10 new markets, including
Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary. And we also went direct in Greece and Israel. And we are now entering – or this summer
we're going to enter Iran, which is a significant opportunity for us for the medical aesthetics business. So we are
continuing our expansion internationally.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Thanks, Brent.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Randall Stanicky with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Randall S. Stanicky>: Great, thanks. Brent, Allergan is a very big company now. What do you define as a
tuck-in?
And then a quick one for Tessa, just thinking about SG&A and that 25% of revenue, after the restructuring post-Teva,
as you leave 2016, what percent of revenue do you think you're going to be at? Thanks.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: It's hard to define tuck-in by size, Randall. I think it's more the characteristics of tuck-in.
So think about a tuck-in being limited to the seven therapeutic areas we're in. That would be a criterion. It would have
to be a growth asset to support the seven areas. We'd only need to add limited additional capabilities to support the
product or the R&D asset. And so that's how I think about tuck-ins. I think within size, obviously it's going to be
anywhere from $50 million to something – a few billion dollars, but there are exceptions to each one of those rules as
well.
<Q - Randall S. Stanicky>: Okay. Tessa?
<A - Maria Teresa Hilado>: Basically for SG&A as a percentage of revenue, as we indicated, we'd be roughly at
25%. And as we previously discussed, the first quarter is really the low revenue quarter for us because of typical
seasonality. So we would expect coming out of 2016 in the fourth quarter for SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be
lower than that.

Having said that, I think what we need to take into consideration as well is the important launches we have for 2016.
And actually the other metric that I would guide you to is probably looking at operating margins as well, which as you
know, we're at the top of the industry. Just looking at SG&A as a percentage of revenue would be a little deceiving
because it would fluctuate through the quarters because of seasonality. But we would trend lower as revenues grow for
2016.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: So, Randall, maybe just to come back to the first part of your question, if I could for a
second, maybe the better way to think about it instead of tuck-ins is really stepping stones to growth. There would have
to be a path from our existing position in a therapeutic area, and a stepping stone would be to drive growth or
leadership in that therapeutic area.
<Q - Randall S. Stanicky>: And that includes pipeline as well?
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: That includes pipeline, absolutely, because our growth has to be sustainable. And I've
always said innovation is our lifeblood, and R&D is a critical element to that.
<Q - Randall S. Stanicky>: Okay, that's great. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Marc Goodman with UBS.
<Q - Marc Goodman>: Yes, good morning. Just to continue on the expenses conversation, what amount of expenses
do we need to take out for next year, just as a starting point? And I guess the context of the question is there has been a
lot of consolidation into this company. There was a lot of cost-cutting and synergies that [ph] was promised (53:47)
previously. And a lot of that went away when you were going to be acquired by Pfizer, but now we're back, so we're
curious. How much on an absolute basis are we definitely taking out? And then how much will expenses just trend up
but revenues trend up higher such that you get some benefit on the margin?
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Let me just start. So, Marc, just to kid you a bit, the synergies we've committed to with
respect to our previous integrations never went away. They may have from people who follow us. But internally, we
have maintained an incredibly rigorous and disciplined process of tracking and executing against those. There were
some that we put on the shelf related to both Actavis-Allergan integration and some related to the Teva divestiture, and
we did that appropriately so. But they didn't go away. We have taken them off the shelf and have started to focus on
achieving those throughout the remaining part of this year and into next year. But all of the work that we have
committed to we will deliver.
<A - Maria Teresa Hilado>: Right. And I think just to remind everyone, we will provide more clarity post the Teva
transaction in terms of EPS and more granular details for the back half of 2016. And then in 2017, as we plan to look at
2017, we will provide guidance in the normal course, which would be in early 2017.
<Q - Marc Goodman>: I guess if you don't want to answer that, maybe we could ask one other question, which is
Botox was extremely strong in the quarter in constant currency. Can you just give us a little more color on what's going
on there?
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Bill, do you want to take that?
<A - William J. Meury>: Yes, there are two sides to that business. There's the therapeutic side and then there's the
aesthetics side. And then of course, you can look at it through both a U.S. and an international lens. On the therapeutic
side, the main drivers continue to be chronic migraine and overactive bladder. We also got a new indication for a neuro
rehab condition, lower limb spasticity. Just yesterday at the National Urology meeting in San Diego, there was a
head-to-head study published that was actually conducted by the NIH comparing Botox for overactive bladder to
InterStim, Medtronic's product, which I think the urology community found very, very instructive. And so that side of
the business is very strong.

When you turn to the aesthetics side, as you know, it's the leading brand in the world. It has a world-class e-commerce
and customer loyalty program which continues to sustain sales levels. If you think about it geographically, the
international business sales for Botox were up almost 20%. And so this is just a rock-solid product. It's got 11 different
indications. It's got a unique injection pattern that users understand. It's highly economical. And of course, we have a
whole series of new indications in development on both the therapeutic and the aesthetics side. This is a pure demand
story.

Our next question comes from the line of David Amsellem with Piper Jaffray.
<Q - David A. Amsellem>: Thanks. So I just wanted to ask about the memantine franchise and just focus on that
business. I guess the question here is, are you disappointed with how Namzaric is tracking? And then secondly, what
are your thoughts long term in terms of the portion of the memantine market that you think you'll be able to retain?
Thanks.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: It's a good question. I wouldn't say disappointed with Namzaric. I just think it's a timing
matter. The original indication for Namzaric included patients who were on essentially the non-fixed combination, but
it didn't include patients who were only receiving Aricept. And I think for physicians, that's an important indication,
which we expect to get in the second half of 2016. It's clear among neurologists and primary care physicians that
Namzaric is superior to anything on the market, whether it's Namenda XR or Aricept. Once we get that indication, we
will essentially launch it, and I think you'll see a very different trajectory.
Overall though, whether it's Namenda XR or Namzaric, this is a very stable business, and we have a heavy promotional
effort. We're the only one in the category that is active. Neurologists and primary care physicians know that. Our
formulary coverage in 2016 and in 2017 is very, very strong. And I believe that we're going to at least maintain the
business that we have today in the launch of the new indication for Namzaric for new patients; that is, patients only on
Aricept, could restore growth to this business. And so I'm very confident about the next 12 to 24 months.

Our next question comes from the line of Ken Cacciatore with Cowen.
<Q - Ken Cacciatore>: Thank you. Bill, congratulations on your new role. Maybe ask about the payer environment in
general, if there have been any meaningful changes or actions in general, so if you could, just discuss that. And maybe
with some specificity to Viberzi first vis-à-vis Xifaxan, can you talk about coverage there, and Vraylar as well, the
coverage as you're pursuing that launch or continuing that launch? Thank you.
<A - William J. Meury>: Good question. Naturally, the formulary coverage for Viberzi is developing, but the majority
of the claims for Viberzi during the first several weeks of launch have been approved, and so I'm very encouraged by it.
ESI [Express Scripts] and CVS Caremark placed Viberzi on formulary in an unrestricted position, which I thought was
a terrific development this early in the launch. I expect that over the next nine to 12 months, the formulary coverage for
Viberzi is going to look just like the formulary coverage for Linzess.
Speaking about Linzess, it was added to CVS Caremark formulary; and then in the Part D space, WellCare and Aetna.
And those are very significant formulary wins for the product and really shore up 2016 and I think into 2017.
There's nothing really in my view at least as it relates to our product line that is going to surprise us. We already have a
line of sight to 2017. The products that our most important to our growth are first, economical. Most of their growth is
coming from volume and single-digit price appreciation. And so I think as long as we continue to communicate with

payers and we're predictable and transparent about our future pricing decisions, I think we're going to be able to
maintain access across this entire product line.
As then as it relates to Vraylar, the product is off to a terrific start, and we know psychiatry very, very well. The
feedback that we're getting is exceeding our expectations in terms of the actual experience with the drug. Formulary
coverage is developing as expected. This is a category where, while there are a lot of products, there's a great deal of
trial and error. And so health plans are inclined to place the product on formulary, even if it's behind the use of a
Seroquel or a Risperdal or a Zyprexa.
And I think that essentially what's going to happen in this category is there will be a changing of the guard between the
older atypicals, the ones I just mentioned, to newer atypicals like Vraylar or even the two others, Latuda and Rexulti.
Because when you look at the benefit/risk ratio of the newer ones, including Vraylar, it's clearly better than what you
see with the older antipsychotics. And we're very encouraged by what's going on with Vraylar in the first eight weeks.

Our next question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan.
<Q - Christopher Schott>: Great, thanks very much. I just had a question just coming back to price, given all the
focus these days. Can you just comment at all just across the entire business, when we think about the mix of price
versus volumes maybe relative to new launches, we think about your 1Q sales and particularly your 1Q pharma
growth? And how much of this is price versus volume?
And then just a quick second one, coming back to business development, given the focus, which seems to be more on
tuck-ins at this point, is it still fair to assume that you're going to deploy the majority of the cash that you're going to
receive from the Teva deal over the next 12 to 18 months, or could that take a longer period of time to redeploy into
your business? Thank you.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: So let me quickly touch on price and then ask Bill to comment more specifically because
I think this holds true, since you asked, Chris, across the entire portfolio. I think both in the branded and in the generic
business, there has been a lot of debate and concern I think amongst the community around pricing. I think the reality is
when you have innovative products that meet unmet need that can distinguish themselves from older products, pricing
really isn't the central issue. It's the ability to commercialize and support your drug with data.
On the generic side, it's a very similar story. When you invest in R&D, as Bob Stewart pointed out, when you have a
team that has 90 first-to-files waiting at the FDA, when they go after complex generics and higher-barrier products, you
get a better pricing environment. And so I think the net-net is there are others that have reported weakness in price, but
that's because their portfolio lacks innovation. It lacks differentiation. And even in highly innovative areas on the
branded side, where there are multiple entries into the same market with very similar mechanisms of action, it drives
price down. When you stand alone with your drug like we do with Viberzi, as an example, you tend to have better
pricing dynamics in the environment. It's really that straightforward. Bill, do you want to comment specifically on our
portfolio?
<A - William J. Meury>: Yes, I would just first comment that our pricing strategy stems from the intellectual property
surrounding these products. And we have exclusivity periods that extend well into the 2020s, and so we price for the
long term. If you want to look at the business overall in the United States, the split was roughly 50:50, with the price
appreciation of course being in the mid-single digits. If you want to look at those products that are responsible for the
majority of our growth and sales, our top almost dozen products, the growth is coming 70% from volume and 30%
from price.
So it's just a solid business. And again, it goes back to the fact that we're playing for the long term here. These are
categories in which we have deep product offerings and strong customer relationships. And it's not – we don't have a

short-term outlook as it relates to price, and we haven't built in anything to 2016 estimates or even beyond that's
unrealistic given the current market dynamics.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: I think with respect to business development, to the second part of your question, perhaps
tuck-ins isn't the right way to think about it. I like the analogy that came up earlier of stepping stones because we're
really looking at supporting the path to growth. We're not just looking at random tuck-ins to support non-core areas or
the like. So it's a very focused strategy, more on a pathway. That's why I think a stepping stone approach is probably
the right way to think about it.
And look, we have enough shots on goal. There are enough opportunities out there that we believe that the current
capital allocation as described is the right way to think about it for the moment. But we will update you quarterly of our
thoughts. If we think that the opportunities either don't work because we don't like the science, we don't like the product
profile, or it's too expensive, then that could free up more money for additional share repurchase or additional debt
repayment. But right now, we think we've got the right balance based on our view of the world as we sit here today.

Our next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal with Bernstein.
<Q - Aaron Gal>: Hi, good morning, congratulations on the quarter and thank you for taking the question. If I could
start with Bill for just a quick clarification, first, this harmonization of allowances that you mentioned for a couple of
products, what exactly is it? It sounds a little bit like – I just want to make sure it's not essentially a reversal of
overstocking the channel or something like this.
<A - Maria Teresa Hilado>: I'll address that, Ronny. So basically it's really just harmonizing all of our accounting
policies, and this relates specifically to Aczone. The number in terms of an increase in allowance, not a decrease in
allowance, is less than $20 million.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: And just to be fair, Ronny, it's one time, and on the overall business it's really not
significant, as Tessa pointed out. The reason we call it out specifically, one is our commitment to transparency. But
two, it is meaningful to the growth rate for the U.S. medical segment, and people do follow medical aesthetics very
closely. So we wanted to bifurcate and show that that business is incredibly strong at 16% growth, and that the
dampening of the overall segment was really a one-time event.
<A - Maria Teresa Hilado>: And just to clarify, it had nothing to do with inventory or channel-stuffing at all.
Prescriptions specifically for that product is very stable.
<Q - Aaron Gal>: Okay, and then one for David. David, you put out the results on Esmya a couple of days ago. Can
you put the quality of life measures in context for us? It was very, very strong in terms of statistical significance. But
can you describe essentially what is the benefit that patients have experienced in terms of how the scale is constructed?
And essentially, how much relief are the patients getting on that?
<A - C. David Nicholson>: Yes. So we do have a patient-recorded outcomes scale [PROS] as part of the Phase 3 trials.
And we have discussed with the agency to what extent we're going be able to use the data from the PROS in our label.
In terms of activities of daily living, we got a very positive result in the first Phase 3 trial, where the patients saw
significant benefit in their daily activities. So we're also very happy about those results, not just – the trial wasn't only
positive because of changes in the bleeding profile.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: And maybe, Bill, commercially, you want to just touch on Esmya for a second related to
its position vis-à-vis [ph] Adebo (1:09:35) as an oral and as substantially ahead?
<A - William J. Meury>: Yes, listen, pharmacologically it's different than a GnRH modulator, and I think that's going
to flow right through to the benefit/risk profile of Esmya relative to another option. This is the first study in the United

States where an oral compound has shown excellent efficacy for the treatment of uterine fibroids. The impact on tumor
size and bleeding is going to be really, really important. This is a large category. Over 10 million women suffer from
uterine fibroids. This will be the flagship of our women's health business in a few years. Outside the United States,

$400 million. And so this first trial was significant not only in terms of important for the community of OB/GYNs and

Our next question comes from the line of Liav Abraham with Citigroup.
<Q - Liav Abraham>: Good morning. Brent, can you comment on your commitment to double-digit underlying
revenue growth over the medium term with your current asset base given some of the potential pressures over the near
term – near to medium-term situation for lifitegrast to Restasis, and to what extent will this commitment inform your
business development strategy? So in other words, do you have a preference for assets that are on the market or close to
the market versus pipeline assets in early to mid-stage development, or are you agnostic? Thank you.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Our commitment to double-digit revenue growth is sincere. It's strong. We look at our
ability to execute on that over the next few years. And we think given our current assets and current pipeline, on a
risk-adjusted basis we think we can get there. Obviously, there are always puts and takes that come to that. We have a
high degree of confidence that we could do no other deals and deliver that growth over the next few years.
I think as we think about tuck-in or stepping-stone deals, as I've been calling them, the intellectual property type of
deals, the R&D deals are designed to get us into the 2020s or well into the 2020s with double-digit growth because
that's the name of our business. It's about new product launches, it's about innovation and looking for medicines that
support treatment or cures for unmet need. And so we're going to continue to do that, but we're really thinking about
well into the 2020s where we have to support the deal – our business to get – to maintain the double-digit growth.
I think with respect to our stepping-stone approach to the marketed product, we're really looking for innovative
products that we think really do provide a meaningful differentiation in terms of unmet need and that fit neatly into our
current therapeutic area so that we can get more leverage out of our infrastructure, whether that be G&A or selling and
marketing. And so that's really how we see it. We have this great commercial engine both in the U.S. and outside the
U.S. that we want to continue to leverage and make more of. And frankly, it makes our representatives, it makes our
medical affairs teams, it makes our managed care teams more relevant when we talk about those therapeutic areas.
So there are multiple reasons why we like our therapeutic area leadership approach with multiple products across the
entire broad spectrum. So I think we're in pretty good position to continue to deliver double-digit or about 10% top line
growth. I don't know, Bill, anything you'd add?
<A - William J. Meury>: Liav, we're focused on it if you think about 2016 and how does that happen. In addition to
Vraylar, Viberzi, and Kybella, which are true new product launches, we have new indications or combinations or line
extensions which also can support particularly healthy businesses. And so for example, Byvalson will launch in 2016.
Then of course, we have the new indication for Namzaric. We'll launch the multi-dose preservative-free form of
Restasis. And in early 2017, we will launch low-dose or 72mcg of Linzess. Each of those product improvements is
against a fairly significant and important part of our sales stream, and that's how we think about the next 12 to 24
months.

Our next question comes from the line of Louise Chen with Guggenheim
<Q - Louise Chen>: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I just have two quick questions here. First, we often get asked
with respect to Allergan what your strategic vision is for the company longer term. Do you want to be a specialty
pharma or growth pharma company? Do you want to be a large-cap pharma or biotech? I was wondering if you could
give us more color here.
And then secondly just on SG&A leverage, I was just curious if you plan to improve that over time. And if so, what
gives you confidence that you can achieve this objective? Thanks.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Thank you, great question. It's interesting. The spec pharma label, which is how I think
most people describe us, is purely a creation of many of you in that you're spec pharma analysts, not all of you but
many, and so that's a Wall Street designation. We have a few years ago designated ourselves as Growth Pharma, and
that's strategically what we want to be known as. We want to be focused on top line growth, therapeutic area
leadership, and a sustained R&D investment through our open science approach.
And so that's our strategy. We articulated it now for a few years. I think post-Teva, it becomes even clearer that we are
a focused, research-based, growth-oriented company with strong therapeutic area leadership in the seven areas that we
compete in, with strong pipelines to support each of those areas, and a commitment to being open-minded around
opportunities to enhance our leadership and enhance our growth through a stepping-stone approach to M&A. Do you
want to talk about SG&A?
<A - Maria Teresa Hilado>: On SG&A, as I mentioned earlier, we have a very efficient operating structure, as we
noted in one of the charts. We think we'll be at roughly 25% exiting the year in the fourth quarter, with higher revenues
at a lower rate than that. And as I also mentioned, I think a good measure to look at as well is operating margins, given
the fact that we have a good number of launches this year. And on operating margins, we continue to improve that
sequentially quarter over quarter, and we believe we are in the top of the industry.
<Q - Louise Chen>: Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI.
<Q - Umer Raffat>: Hi, thank you for taking my question, first perhaps for Bill. Bill, there has been a bunch of
feedback online about sales force disruption in Botox urology, so I thought it was good to see you report Botox
overactive bladder as a key driver in urology growth. Could you just please clarify where things stand in that division?
Then also a second one on Generics division. So I saw the 10-Q just hit. It was about $1.3 billion in generic sales
versus about $1.7 billion in 1Q last year. I understand there must be choppiness from product launches and stuff. I just
wanted to understand that trend as well. Thank you.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Look, I think our Botox Therapeutic franchise, I think the proof point is in the numbers
that were delivered and the team is focused. Obviously, there were some issues in our urology area that were related to
following company policy. We take that very seriously. We have a very strong compliance and internal audit process
inside our company. Internal controls are at the forefront of what we do. And when people violate that, we deal with it
very strictly and severely. And so that's what happened there. I wouldn't get too caught up on online chatter. You could
drive yourself crazy looking at some of those message boards and think the world was coming to an end, not just at
Allergan but across the entire world if you believe most of the stuff you see on those things. But suffice it to say the
business is incredibly stable, resilient, and growing.

<A - William J. Meury>: I would just add. I was at a recent sales awards trip that the management team that's in place
and the majority of that field force was focused on our customers and naturally increasing the use of Botox in OAB,
which is one of the fastest growing segments of that product. And so it's in our rearview mirror at this point.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: On the generic side, Bob, or?
<A - Robert A. Stewart>: So what I would say on the generic side, this business continues to perform in line with our
expectations. You can't necessarily go look at historical year-over-year comparisons in this business as we're preparing
for this business to merge with Teva. There's also a number of cyclical things within the business with product launches
and timing of things like that. But the underlying business is performing incredibly strong. We continue to see price
erosion, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, as mid-single digit, and overall it continues to fire on all cylinders
with respect to R&D as well as commercial execution of launches.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Umer, this is Paul. Just remember, revenue is never a good view of the generics business
performance because I can assure you in the second quarter with the launch of generic Crestor we're going to have
blowout numbers on the revenue side. And I agree with Rob that our business is performing very, very well. And I
think the Teva folks are going to be very happy to close the transaction and continue that strength.
<Q - Umer Raffat>: Got it. But, Paul, just to be clear, versus 4Q, the $300 million drop in revenue, is there like a
known launch that faded away?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: No, there are also cyclical issues in the generic business as well. The first quarter is always the
toughest quarter. We've seen it year over year. That continues to be the same trend that we've always had.
<Q - Umer Raffat>: Thank you very much.

Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gerberry with Leerink Partners.
<Q - Jason M. Gerberry>: Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking my questions, and congrats to Bill for the change
in role. So my question for Brent actually, just thinking about the change in tone regarding a transformational M&A
deal from July when you announced the Teva deal to the present where it seems like maybe there's a little bit of a
de-emphasis but still keeping an open mind to transformational deals, I guess what I'm wondering is what's changed in
that period of time given that valuations have pulled back?
And then secondly, with the change in the Treasury notice and the look-back rules, if you can, just walk us through the
restrictions in terms of using equity until say the Warner and Forest deals and even Allergan deals hit their three-year
anniversaries. Thanks.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: So I think that perhaps if you picked up a slight change in tone, it's because as we've
gotten more comfortable with the current business that we have and operate, as we've gotten more comfortable with our
pipeline, it goes to how I opened the call. We have the best pharmaceutical business in the world. It's growing at pro
forma 10% branded sales. It has a deep pipeline of plus 70 mid to late-stage pipeline opportunities. We have a strong
capital deployment opportunity, both with share buybacks, debt repayment, and stepping-stone deals, and we have an
investment-grade rated balance sheet.
So we are in I think the pole position, and our focus is going to be on operating and running our company and
continuing to put up quarter after quarter performance. If we can support that or turbo-boost that with opportunistic
deals that may come along, like Allergan came along in a very unique situation, then I think this is a bold management
team that's going to look at what's in the best interest of our shareholders to drive shareholder value creation, and we'll
do it. But the reality is, and I've been saying this for a long time, 99% of our focus, the management team sitting around
the phone right now is running our business. And we're going to continue to put up executional excellence as our top
goal. And we're going to continue to support the business with growth-oriented stepping-stone deals, but really our

focus is on running the business.
<A - Maria Teresa Hilado>: With regards to the...
<Q - Jason M. Gerberry>: I'm sorry, Tessa.
<A - Maria Teresa Hilado>: Yes, so with regards to the Treasury rules, which you can imagine we analyzed that
extensively, and based on our analysis two things have come out. One is we don't expect any material change in our tax
rate. And then two, the new Treasury rules actually also affirm our status as an Irish domiciled company.
With regards to a transformational deal, we believe we can continue to maintain our Irish domicile. As you know, the
new rules provide for a three-year look-back in terms of determining what we call good shares for purposes of
calculating inversion. October 2016 is the three-year anniversary date for the Warner Chilcott acquisition, which then
gives us more capacity to issue shares to a target company. The one thing that you have to note, though, that we always
have the flexibility to issue shares for cash without actually affecting our status as a foreign company. So there's really
nothing in the Treasury...
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Or sell in the open market.
<A - Maria Teresa Hilado>: Or sell in the open market, right. And so there's really nothing in the current Treasury
rules today that preclude us from executing on our strategy, whether that's tuck-in in or transformational deals.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: And just to be clear, Jason, I would say two things. One, the Treasury rules had no
impact on this small shift in thinking. As Tessa just outlined, with perhaps just some minor maneuvering, we could
execute any transformational deal we wanted to do. I'm not worried about that. The reality is, why would we issue our
stock at this price considering we just announced up to $10 billion of buyback? We think our stock or that currency is
too inexpensive to issue to a target at this point anyway.
<A - Maria Teresa Hilado>: Plus, even if you look at it from a liquidity perspective, even with a $10 billion share
repurchase authorization and if we execute up to that amount and the payment of debt, net-net we still have sufficient
liquidity to pursue deals.
<Q - Jason M. Gerberry>: Got it. Okay, thank you.

And our last question comes from the line of David Maris with Wells Fargo.
<Q - David Maris>: Good morning. Brent and David, on the pipeline, I see the one biosimilar for Avastin on the
pipeline chart that you state will file in the second half of 2016. Can you update us on the status of the others?
And, Brent, what role do biosimilars play in the branded Pharma model? Is this another asset that you could trade or
that you'd consider trading, or is it core to the Growth Pharma model?
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: So let me answer the back part, and David then can talk about the status of the programs.
Look, I think the way I think about biosimilars, at least over the next few years, is that for us, for Allergan, we've made
most of the investment already, and we've seen good success with most of the programs in collaboration with Amgen.
So for us at this point, we've made the investment and we should participate in the commercialization and/or sales of
those products through our partnership with Amgen.
Long term, I don't think biosimilars will necessarily be a core part of our strategy. We may decide to continue to invest
in the partnership with Amgen because it's been a good collaboration and a successful partnership. We may look at
selective opportunities to participate on a one-off basis. And we do have capabilities in our own organization in
Liverpool, where we will look to do some unique things. But I think in fairness, we are focused on supporting our
seven therapeutic areas with the vast majority of our R&D dollars, with the vast majority of our investment to make
sure that we can continue to innovate around unmet need and to support our Growth Pharma agenda.

David, do you want to touch on the science?
<A - C. David Nicholson>: Sure, yes. Just briefly, so the other biosimilars that we're working on together with Amgen,
as I'm sure you're all aware, are biosimilars for Herceptin, Rituxan, and Erbitux. We anticipate getting the Phase 3 data
for Herceptin later in the year. Obviously, Rituxan and Erbitux are earlier in the pipeline. Erbitux is still in pre-clinical
development and Rituxan is moving into the early stages of development this year if the cell line development proceeds
according to expectations.

time. Obviously, we remain very focused on executional excellence, on continuing to deliver our goals and agenda with
respect to Growth Pharma. We do look forward to probably our next call with respect to second quarter earnings in
