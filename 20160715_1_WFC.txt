I will now turn the call over to Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf.
John G. Stumpf
Thank you, Jim. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Our diversified business model and continued focus
on meeting our customers' financial needs drove our performance in the second quarter, our 15th consecutive quarter of
generating earnings greater than $5 billion. We produced strong performance during a period that has included
persistent low rates, market volatility and economic volatility. And we did it by focusing on the core building blocks of
long-term shareholder value creation, that is growing relationships, loans, investments and deposits. Our loan and
investment and deposit balances are all at record levels, and we've maintained our strong risk discipline.
Let me highlight our results for the second quarter. We generated earnings of $5.6 billion and earnings per share of
$1.01. We grew revenue compared with a year ago by 4% with growth in both net interest income and non-interest
income, and our pre-tax pre-provision profit grew 5%.We generated positive operating leverage while we continue to
make investments throughout our businesses. Average loans grew over $80 billion or 9% from a year ago. Average
deposits increased $51.4 billion or 4% from a year ago, and we grew the number of primary consumer checking
customers by 4.7%. Net charge-offs remained near historical lows at 39 basis points annualized, reflecting the benefit
of our diversified loan portfolio and continued underwriting discipline.
We returned $3.2 billion to our shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases in the second
quarter, the fourth consecutive quarter of returning more than $3 billion. We continue to increase stockholders' equity
which now exceeded $200 billion for the first time, and we are pleased to have received a non-objection to our 2016
capital plan for the Federal Reserve. Incidentally, when the former Norwest, which where I came from and Wells Fargo
merged 18 years ago, our total assets at the time were slightly less than $200 billion. Now our stockholders' equity
exceeds that, remarkable results over that period of time.
Turning to the economic environment, Brexit has added to global economic uncertainty and could result in rates
remaining lower for even longer than expected, putting pressure on reinvestment opportunities. However, compared to
our large bank peers, it should have a much lower direct impact on our long-term business drivers, because as you
know, we largely a U.S.-centric company and many indicators point to continued relative strength in the U.S. economy.
After a couple of lackluster quarters, we estimate real GDP grew at 2.5% rate in the second quarter, up from 1.1% in
the first quarter. Most of the improvement came from consumers where drivers were broad-based. Spending on big
ticket items was especially robust, and sentiment surveys show that consumer confidence remains strong. Home sales
continue to rise with the second quarter on pace to have the strongest quarterly sales volume since 2007.
Price appreciation remains steady at the 5% to 6% rate nationally and appreciation isn't just restricted to coastal states.
Every state and 90% of all metro areas have experienced an increase during the past year. And job gains remain solid
with 69 consecutive monthly increases, the longest on record, including the strong June report released just last week.
Before I conclude, I want to highlight the announcement we made earlier this week. Carrie Tolstedt, Head of
Community Banking who has been with Wells Fargo for 27 years, has decided to retire at year end. She and her team
have built an extraordinary franchise, one that meets the needs of millions of customers nationwide and has served
investors very well for decades. Mary Mack, who currently serves as President and Head of Wells Fargo Advisors, will
succeed Carrie effective July 31. Mary is a 32-year veteran of the financial services industry and has diverse mix of
experiences including retail banking which will serve her well as she takes the reins of this key business.

This transition highlights our commitment to stable long-range succession planning and our belief that our team
members are our most valuable resource.
I will now turn the call over to John Shrewsberry, our Chief Financial Officer, who will provide more details on our
quarterly results. John?
John R. Shrewsberry
Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. My comments will follow the presentation included in the quarterly
supplement starting on page two, then John and I will answer your questions.
Our results in the second quarter were straightforward and demonstrated momentum across a variety of key business
drivers. Compared with the first quarter, we had strong loan and deposit growth. We increased net interest income by
growing earnings assets. Many of our customer-facing businesses generated strong fee growth. Our efficiency ratio
improved. Credit quality remained solid and our capital position remained strong while we returned more capital to
shareholders through common stock dividends and share repurchase. Our net payout ratio was 62% in the second
quarter.
On page three, you can see the strong year-over-year growth John highlighted including increases in revenue, pre-tax,
pre-provision profit, loans and deposits. While our earnings were down $161 million from a year ago, our results in the
second quarter last year included a $350 million reserve release, while this quarter we had a $150 million reserve build,
primarily due to loan growth in commercial, auto and the credit card portfolios.
Turning to page four, let me highlight a few balance sheet trends. With the expectation of rates remaining lower for
longer, we grew our investment securities portfolio by $18.5 billion with $38 billion of gross purchases in the second
quarter, significantly higher than the $5 billion of purchases last quarter and higher than the $26 billion of average
quarterly purchases last year. We completed these purchases before the rate decline late in the quarter driven by the
Brexit vote. We also added to duration, as we've done in the past with interest rate swaps that convert a portion of our
variable rate commercial loans to fixed rate, a $13 billion increase in swap notional from first quarter. Even with these
actions, we remain asset sensitive.
Long-term debt increased $16 billion with $24 billion of issuances including $10.7 billion issued by the holding
company which we expect to be grandfathered as TLAC-eligible. As we highlighted at Investor Day, we expect that we
will need to increase our portfolio of qualifying TLAC by approximately $50 billion in order to be compliant, including
the 100-basis point buffer which we plan to complete through measured issuance over the phase-in period of
approximately five years. However, this year, we have a high level of debt maturing, so some of our eligible TLAC
issuance this year will be used to offset these maturities.
Turning to the income statement overview on page five, revenue declined $33 million from the first quarter as growth
in net interest income was offset by lower non-interest income. I will highlight the drivers of these trends throughout
the call, but let me discuss how the businesses we've sold and acquired impacted our results this quarter.
As I mentioned at Investor Day, for several years now, we've been focused on reducing non-core businesses,
simplifying our organization and improving our risk profile. In the first quarter, we sold our crop insurance business
and our results included a $381 million gain from that sale. While the impact to our ongoing earnings from selling this
business is negligible, the sale did reduce insurance revenue and related insurance expense this quarter. In the second
quarter, we sold our health benefit services business for a $290 million gain. The go-forward effect of the sale of this
business is not material to our financial results.
Our results this quarter also reflected the acquisition of the GE Capital businesses that we completed in the first quarter,
including the full quarter impact of the $26.7 billion of commercial and industrial loans and leases that closed on March
1. As we stated at Investor Day, the quarterly benefit to net interest income from the GE Capital acquisition was
approximately $300 million. Lease income also increased this quarter from the operating leases acquired along with
corresponding higher operating lease expense.

The acquisition of the Asia segment through GE Capital's commercial distribution finance business was completed on
July 1, and the remaining international assets of approximately $2 billion are expected to close later this year. We're
pleased with the overall integration of the GE Capital businesses and we still expect the GE Capital acquisition to be
modestly accretive to our results this year.
As shown on page six, we had continued strong loan growth in the second quarter, up 8% from a year ago and 1% from
the first quarter. Period-end commercial loan balances grew $6.3 billion from first quarter. Remember the GE Capital
acquisition only impacted average loan growth this quarter. Consumer loans increased $3.6 billion linked quarter as
growth in first mortgage loans, auto, credit card and securities-based lending was partially offset by declines in junior
lien mortgages and seasonally lower student lending. Our total average loan yield was stable at 4.16% as the full
quarter benefit from the GE Capital acquisition was offset by lower consumer yields.
On page seven, we highlight our broad-based year-over-year loan growth. C&I loans were up $39 billion or 14% driven
by the GE Capital acquisitions and broad-based organic growth. Commercial real estate loans grew $10.7 billion or 8%
primarily in our real estate mortgage portfolio.
Real estate 1-4 family first mortgage loans grew $9.3 billion or 3% with strong growth in high quality non-conforming
mortgage loans. As a reminder, we sell our conforming mortgage loan originations to the agencies. This portfolio also
reflected the continued runoff of the Pick-a-Pay portfolio.
Auto loans were up $4.1 billion or 7% with origination volume up 2% while we maintained our underwriting and
pricing discipline. Credit card balances were up $3 billion or 10%, reflecting new account openings and increases in
active accounts. Other revolving credit and installment loans were up $2.1 billion or 6% with growth in
securities-based lending, personal lines and loans, and student loans.
As highlighted on page eight, we had $1.2 trillion of average deposits in the second quarter, up $51.4 billion or 4%
from a year ago. Consumer and small business banking deposits increased 8% from a year ago, and primary consumer
checking customers grew 4.7% from a year ago. Our average deposit cost was 11 basis points, up 1 basis point from
first quarter and 3 basis points from a year ago, reflecting an increase in deposit pricing for certain wholesale banking
customers.
Page nine highlights our revenue diversification. Our revenue continued to be relatively balanced between net interest
and non-interest income. While the drivers of non-interest income have varied, fee income was also 47% of revenue a
year ago and last quarter.
Market sensitive revenue, which includes trading and gains on debt and equity securities, can vary based on market
conditions during the quarter. Our market sensitive results in the second quarter, which included strong gains from
trading and debt security gains, was partially offset by lower equity gains. The sum were only $85 million higher than
the five-quarter average.
We grew net interest income $66 million from the first quarter, primarily driven by loan growth including the full
quarter benefit of the assets acquired from GE Capital. The benefit from loan growth was partially offset by reduced
income in our investment securities portfolio, reflecting accelerated prepayments primarily on our mortgage-backed
securities. We also had higher interest expense from the long-term debt issuances that I highlighted earlier on the call
and lower interest income from trading assets.
The net interest margin declined 4 basis points from the first quarter primarily due to growth in long-term debt and
deposits and reduced income from investment securities. All other balance sheet growth, mix changes and repricing
was beneficial to the NIM. We grew net interest income in the second quarter by 4% from a year ago, even with an
11-basis point reduction in NIM, and we continue to believe that we can grow net interest income on a full year basis in
2016 compared with 2015 in the current rate environment.
While total non-interest income decreased $99 million from the first quarter, we had growth in many areas that reflect
our focus on our key business drivers, including increases in service charges on deposit accounts, brokerage fees, trust
and investment management, investment banking, card fees, gains on mortgage loan originations, trading gains on

higher customer accommodation activity and lease income, reflecting the full quarter benefit from the GE Capital
acquisition.
Total mortgage banking revenue, which includes both the gain on sale from originations and servicing income, declined
$184 million from the first quarter. Production revenue increased $306 million or 41%, reflecting higher originations.
Origination volume was $63 billion, up 43% from the first quarter, due to the seasonally stronger purchase market and
increased refinancing due to lower rates. Applications were up 23% from first quarter and we ended the quarter with a
$47 billion application pipeline, up 21% from first quarter and up 24% from a year ago.
Since Brexit and the related decrease in mortgage rates, we've seen refinance activity increase with our retail
application volumes up approximately 15% to 20% in recent weeks. And we currently expect origination volume to be
somewhat higher in the third quarter compared with the second quarter. Our production margin on residential
held-for-sale mortgage originations was 166 basis points in the second quarter, down 2 basis points from the first
quarter. Releases of our mortgage loan repurchase liability increased $69 million from the first quarter which also
contributed to higher production revenue.
Servicing income declined $490 million from the first quarter, primarily driven by changes in MSR valuation
adjustments which were positive last quarter and slightly negative in the second quarter. These MSR valuation
adjustments are outside the scope of our hedging and vary over time as MSR valuation assumptions are updated.
Overall, we're pleased with our hedge results in the second quarter given the increased rate volatility late in the quarter.
Servicing income also declined from higher quarterly unreimbursed servicing costs, primarily related to FHA loans.
Other income declined $392 million from the first quarter. The reduction was driven by a decline in hedge
ineffectiveness income from $379 million in the first quarter to $56 million in the second quarter. The decline also
reflected the gain from the sale of the crop insurance business recognized last quarter and the gain on the sale of our
health benefits services business in the second quarter with a net impact from these sales of $91 million lower other
income compared with the first quarter.
As shown on page 12, expenses declined $162 million from the first quarter driven by lower personnel expenses which
are typically higher in the first quarter due to higher payroll taxes and 401(k) matching as well as annual equity awards
to retirement eligible team members. Expenses also declined from lower operating losses, down $120 million from the
first quarter on lower litigation expense. Insurance expenses declined $89 million, reflecting the sale of the crop
insurance business in the first quarter.
Partially offsetting these declines was an increase of $186 million from outside professional services after typically
lower expenses in the first quarter. Operating lease depreciation expense was up $117 million from the first quarter,
reflecting the full quarter impact of the leases acquired from GE Capital. As a reminder, beginning in the third quarter,
we estimate that our total FDIC assessment will increase by approximately $100 million per quarter, reflecting the
temporary FDIC surcharge which became effective July 1.
Our efficiency ratio was 58.1% in the second quarter and we currently expect to operate at the higher end of our
targeted efficiency ratio range of 55% to 59% for the full year 2016. While we're already operating at one of the best
efficiency ratios in the industry, we remain focused on managing expenses while actively reinvesting in the franchise
for future growth. While total expenses have increased, we've reduced expenses in many categories even as we've
grown the balance sheet by acquiring businesses and adding new customers. The increase in expenses has primarily
been related to risk, compliance and technology spending, reflected in higher personnel expense, outside professional
services, and contract services. We've also continued to invest in innovation to better serve our customers.
Let me give you just a few examples. During the second quarter, we launched the FastFlex Small Business Loan, an
online fast decision loan that's funded as soon as the next business day. This was an innovation we built in-house. In
addition, we launched yourFirst Mortgage, a new home loan program to help more qualified first-time homebuyers and
low-to-moderate income consumers become homeowners. Early reaction to this program has been positive with over
$1 billion of applications in the first 30 days.

In wholesale banking, we introduced biometric authentication by piloting eyeprint image capture technology in our
Commercial Electronic Office mobile channel. This slide highlights just a few examples that we've recently announced.
We're working on additional products and services within our innovation group that are scheduled to be released over
the coming quarters that we believe will add tangible long-term value for our customers and shareholders.
Turning to our business segments, starting on page 14, Community Banking earned $3.2 billion in the second quarter,
down 1% from a year ago and 4% from the first quarter. We remain focused on providing outstanding customer service
and achieved record store customer loyalty scores during the second quarter and the highest year-to-date retail banking
household retention in four years. We continually work to enhance customer satisfaction and transparency and ensure
customers are receiving the right products to meet their financial needs because the key to our success is long-lasting
customer relationships built on trust.
For example, an hour after opening a new deposit account, our customers are sent a customized welcome email,
including a summary of accounts and ways to get the full value from their accounts. We're also focused on using
innovation to enhance our customer experience. Mobile banking is our most frequently used channel and we have 18
million mobile active users. Beginning August 1, our mobile customers will be able to make real-time person-to-person
payments. P2P payments are not new to Wells Fargo as our customers conducted over $10 billion in P2P volume
through our SurePay service in 2015.
We're the number one debit card issuer by transaction volume which increased 9% from a year ago, while dollar
volume was $76.4 billion, up 8% from a year ago. Credit card purchase volume was $19.4 billion, up 10% from a year
ago, benefiting from 8% active account growth. Credit card penetration of retail banking households increased to
45.6%, up from 44.6% a year ago.
Wholesale banking earned $2.1 billion in the second quarter, down 5% from a year ago and up 8% from the first
quarter. The decline from a year ago was driven by higher provision expense related to the oil and gas portfolio.
However, charge-offs for wholesale banking are still historically low with only 27 basis points of net charge-offs
annualized in the second quarter. Revenue grew 10% from a year ago and 5% linked quarter as net interest income and
non-interest income both increased on a year-over-year and linked quarter basis. Loan growth remains strong, driven by
acquisitions and broad-based organic growth, with average loans up $65.2 billion or 17% from a year ago, the seventh
consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth.
Spreads on new originations were slightly better than the existing portfolio. Average deposit balances declined $6.6
billion from a year ago, driven by lower international deposits from market volatility and our pricing discipline in the
competitive rate environment.
Wealth and investment management earned $584 million in the second quarter, stable from a year ago and up 14%
from the first quarter. Our diversified revenue streams provided stability during a period of market volatility. Second
quarter revenue of $3.9 billion was up 2% linked quarter and down 1% year-over-year. Our continued emphasis on
meeting our clients' financial needs through plan-based relationships resulted in record high WIM client assets of $1.7
trillion, up 2% from a year ago with growth resulting from both existing client relationships as well as new client
acquisition.
Net interest income was up 12% year-over-year, driven by continued strong balance sheet growth. Average deposits
were up 9% from a year ago and loans were up 12%, the 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year loan
growth. Loan growth was broad based with strong client demand across a number of product offerings.
We're very excited to welcome Kristi Mitchem, who became the Head of Wells Fargo Asset Management on June 1.
She has strong industry experience and will lead this business into the next phase of strategic expansion and growth.
Turning to page 17, credit results continue to benefit from our diversified portfolio with only 39 basis points of
annualized net charge-offs. Net charge-offs increased $38 million from the first quarter including an increase of $59
million from our oil and gas portfolio which was partially offset by $46 million of lower consumer real estate losses.

Non-performing assets decreased $433 million from the first quarter as lower residential and commercial real estate
non-accruals and foreclosed assets were partially offset by higher oil and gas non-accruals. As I mentioned earlier, we
had a $150 million reserve build during the quarter, primarily related to loan growth in the commercial, auto and credit
card portfolios.
Slide 18 highlights our oil and gas portfolio. While oil prices have risen from where they were a year ago, there
continues to be pressure in the oil and gas sector. We had $263 million of net charge-offs in this portfolio in the second
quarter, up $59 million from the first quarter with approximately 94% of losses from the E&P and services sectors.
Non-accrual loans were $2.6 billion, up $651 million from the first quarter on weaker financial performance, the runoff
of borrower hedges and less sponsor support. Approximately 90% of non-accruals were current on interest and
principal. Most of the losses we've taken were for non-accruals that were current but we recorded losses based on our
judgment of not being repaid in full.
Our oil and gas loans outstanding declined 4% from the first quarter and were down 2% from a year ago. Oil and gas
loans of $17.1 billion are less than 2% of total loans outstanding. Our oil and gas loan exposure which includes
unfunded commitments in loans outstanding was also down 4% from first quarter and down 10% from a year ago,
primarily driven by borrowing-based reductions. We had no defensive draws in the second quarter.
And as in every challenging cycle, we're also seeing opportunities and we originated new loans during the second
quarter to well qualified borrowers.
Criticized loans which include non-accrual loans were down $1.7 billion or 17% from first quarter reflecting pay
downs, borrowing-based upgrades and net charge-offs. And for the first time in past six quarters, we did not have a
reserve build for our oil and gas portfolio and reserve coverage was stable at 9.2% of total oil and gas loans
outstanding.
Our reserves declined from $1.7 billion to $1.6 billion, reflecting the increase in energy prices, the slower pace of
deterioration in credit quality, improved criticized asset levels and the smaller loan portfolio.
Overall the performance of our oil and gas portfolio in the second quarter was consistent with our expectations and our
experience of managing through many cycles will continue to benefit us and our customers as we move through the
remainder of this cycle.
Turning to page 19, our capital levels remain strong with our estimated Common Equity Tier 1 ratio fully phased in at
10.6% in the second quarter, well above the regulatory minimum and buffers and our internal buffer.
We reduced our common shares outstanding by 27.4 million shares through share repurchases of 44.8 million. We also
increased our common stock dividend in the second quarter to $0.38 per share. Our net payout ratio was 62% within
our targeted range of 55% to 75%.
In summary our second quarter results demonstrated the benefit of our diversified business model. We had solid returns
with a 1.2% ROA, 11.7% ROE and our return on tangible common equity was 14.15%. We've continued to benefit
from executing on our vision with success in growing customers, loans and deposits. The headwinds from a flatter yield
curve and lower-for-longer rate environment creates challenges for all financial institutions, but we'll continue focus on
what we can control, earning lifelong relationships with our customers which drive our long-term growth opportunities.

<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Good morning.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Just taking a step back, John, I think you said in your prepared remarks that investors own
this company given your ability to grow earnings regardless of what's happening in the markets. If this flatter yield
curve persists and we don't see rate hikes the Fed, I'm wondering what you think are your strongest levers for
supporting EPS growth from here. Is it continued balance sheet growth? Is it even more disciplined expense
management? Is it growth in fees in businesses where you don't have scale yet? Just trying to figure out, Wells always
has a reputation for pulling on levers to support EPS growth and I'm wondering, as we look out within the next 12
months, what you think the most impactful ones are.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Well, I think it's all of the above, Erika. You mentioned, in broad terms, the likely
sources. If rates are going to remain lower, we will work hard at earning asset growth. And the first call on our capital
and liquidity is to serve customers. So we'll be looking for loan growth and we've had great success in organic loan
growth in commercial categories as well as in consumer categories. So that would be job one. I think we're seeing nice
momentum across a variety of the fee streams that we have. I mentioned some of them in my remarks, but there are
many. And we've – some of them are businesses where we already have complete scale and some of them are
businesses that were – where we're under indexed and continuing to grow. So maybe the long-term opportunity is even
bigger.
I think we're working hard at expense discipline in this environment to accomplish all that we're trying to accomplish in
compliance and risk management, but innovate at the same time and stay within our range which we've managed to do.
And we're, as I also called out, we're sort of, we're comping over periods where we had been releasing excess
allowance. And now because our loan portfolio's growing, we're building some allowance. So we're muscling through
that headwind, but we're accomplishing our goals.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Let me just drill down a little bit on the expense side, Erika. We operate within our 55% to
59% range on efficiency ratio which is, you know that's either at close to or at the top of our industry, surely for our
large bank peers. We've spent a lot of money in the last couple years around things like compliance and risk
management and so forth. And as you build those, you spend more money. Once you get into a rhythm, there's an
opportunity to get more eloquent. Start to take some of those front end costs out and build it in as part of your process.
John also mentioned that we continue to look to simplify our business to get more standard. And frankly, a lot of the
investments we're making on customer service and customer convenience has a front end cost component, but a back
end benefit. So those things are all on the table. We continue to look at those. And in a lower-for-longer environment,
pennies and nickels and dimes matter.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Got it. And as we think about balance sheet mix management near-term, I'm wondering if, I
guess what it would take to maybe extend, even more aggressively, extend duration and sort of protect the margin
near-term? Or you're not going to manage your asset and liabilities based on, sort of, how the market's thinking about
the curve near-term?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yeah. So it's a good question. And the things that we're balancing are, and re-adjusting
constantly, are our expectation for what rates are going to do next and whether today is a better or worse entry point
than waiting a quarter or waiting longer. We're balancing the capital sensitivity of what happens when you
meaningfully add duration at what might be a cyclically low point in rates. We're saying we think it's going to be
lower-for-longer, but we have to sensitize ourselves to what happens if we get much more invested here and rates move
up and that destroys capital. So that's a limiter in some sense. And then we've got our liquidity constraints of how we
might deploy, what we might use and what it means in terms of available liquidity. So there's a delicate balance going
on all the time. But I would say that we're relatively convinced that we may not be this low forever, but like we said a
year ago, our expectation is lower-for-longer at the curve and we're going to keep putting money to work.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Got it. Thank you.

Your next question will come from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: Hi.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Hey, Mike.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: This is going to be a very short-term specific question, but it'll save us work later today. So you
had a $290 million gain on the sale of the health benefit services and that added I guess about $0.04. So if we strip out
that $0.04 from your $1.01, it would mean you fell short of consensus. Are there any other items and expenses or
anywhere else that might have mitigated that gain? In other words, when you look at the results, do you think they met
consensus? And if so, what offset that $0.04 gain?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yeah. I don't create a detailed reconciliation back to the consensus versus our numbers.
We're looking at the total output every quarter. We've got a laundry list of things that might be seasonal, that might be
episodic. There could be gains from securities portfolio. We've been selling a handful of non-core businesses and some
of them have given rise to gains. So there isn't that type of a reconciliation. I would look at those categories of revenue
that come through and look at the multi-quarter, the five-quarter average and think about how far above or below we
are in any quarter versus that longer-term average and model it or manage it that way.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: Could you give us some of your laundry list? Yeah.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Some of our laundry list?
<Q - Mike Mayo>: Yeah, like what would you [ph] put in (36:26)?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Well, my laundry list is what you guys feedback which are market sensitive items that
you often call out as unreliably different from quarter to quarter, some of the mortgage activity which can be a little bit
more episodic, mortgage hedging activity. This is what some analysts refer to as things that they'd have a hard time
modeling. I mentioned gains on the sale of debt, our equity securities. There's seasonal impacts on things like
investment banking fees that happen at certain times. All of those things, ebb and flow, and I would look at the
longer-term either calendar-adjusted or multi-quarter averages and think about it that way.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: All right. And then just one more follow-up then. Just when you look at mortgage revenues this
quarter, were they where you thought they'd be? And what do you expect going ahead? You said the mortgage
pipeline's up quite a bit.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yeah. I'd say on the origination side, they're where we expected them to be. And as you
heard, the pipeline is full. I think margins are in a good place, and we anticipate having a good third quarter on the
origination side. Our mortgage hedging results in the second quarter and the net economic impact of mortgage
servicing was lower than, for example, the five-quarter average. It was higher in the quarter before, so the difference is
even more stark. But I think we're – we think it's a great time to be the leader in the mortgage business right now
because homes are selling and also because people are refinancing.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: All right. Thank you.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: So we're expecting good things.

<Q - Bill Carcache>: Thank you. Good morning. We've seen loan growth outpacing deposit growth for several
quarters at both Wells Fargo and the industry in general. In a post-LCR world where HQLA levels are a factor, how
high do you think we can expect loan-to-deposit ratios to rise? And with loan growth continuing at a healthy clip, can

you envision a scenario where competition for deposits begins to heat up among banks, and basically, it causes them to
start raising rates possibly even before the Fed as competition for deposits intensifies? Can you just speak to that?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Well, I suppose it could. I think we're probably in the – at the higher end of the range of
loan-to-deposit ratios ourselves in the high-70%s I guess at this point. And of course, there are a lot of other sources of
liquidity that are coming in as a – at least for G-SIBs is a result of TLAC, et cetera, and some reliable sources of
non-deposit wholesale funding that are part of a healthy liability management mix. So funding never really seems to be
the problem.
We've imagined, frankly, since LCR was first proposed, that people would be competing for deposits, especially
smaller firms who have less of a value proposition for customers and they really have to pay for deposits in order to
attract them. And it really hasn't seemed to come to pass. I don't know whether aggregate credit creation is outstripping
aggregate deposit generation by so much that it's going cause firms at the margin to raise prices, compete for deposits
and drive up the cost for the rest of us. It could happen. We haven't seen it. What we're seeing among assets is a lot
more things changing hands, so a big part of our loan growth are loans coming out of GE and coming onto our books
and loans coming off of other people's books and onto our books as opposed to the aggregates being impacted in the
way that you described. So...
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Bill, I agree with John. In fact, I don't know this, but my guess is aggregate credit generation
in the private sector, forget public debt for a second here, but I doubt that that's growing faster than deposits. I look at
the last seven, eight years here since our merger with Wachovia, the time of the merger we had something less than
$800 billion of deposits. Now we're over $1.2 trillion, so we've grown deposits even after a runoff of those high priced
CDs by $400 billion, $500 billion.
We're up maybe $100 billion on loans during that period of time, so deposits have far outstripped loans. In fact, if you
believe lower-for-longer, there's going to be a hunger for earning assets, and while a quarter or two might look different
recently, if we look at, in our last year, the growth of $51 billion of deposits versus $80 billion of loans, if you strip out
some of the loans that we've purchased, if you look at an organic basis, we're still growing deposits faster. So it's – I
would – I'd doubt. I don't see pressure from that perspective.
<Q - Bill Carcache>: That's great color. Thank you. If I could ask a follow-up on the consumer credit side of your
business, how do you think about the appropriate level of reserve coverage in auto and card? And do you think the
current environment is supportive of a path where charge-offs and reserves and those businesses can grow in line with
loans such that the consumer credit provision is not a headwind to your earnings growth?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: It's a good question, and it'll be different for every bank depending on what type of
consumer credit they have on their books. As we mentioned, we added a little bit to our allowance this quarter and in
part it was from consumer credit, but that's based on the growth in the portfolio, not because of any meaningful change
in underlying behavior. My sense is that if those loans are priced properly for their risk, and given the way that we
provide for them as those portfolios grow, that it shouldn't become too much of a headwind. Now we've said earlier that
we're happy to provide more reserve, more allowance when we're growing our loan portfolio, that's because it was
going to happen as we came out of a period of releases and are moving into a period of net provisioning and growth.
But it's going to [ph] feel (42:53) different for everybody based on the quality of the loans that they put on their books
based on the pricing related to the quality of the loans they put on their books, so it's hard to generalize. I think we feel
pretty good about it.
<Q - Bill Carcache>: Understood. That is very helpful. Thank you for taking my questions.

still improving and some that are starting to normalize? And do you have any kind of short-term outlook on credit
staying stable, benign?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Well, if you set aside oil and gas for a moment from our aggregate results, I think our net
charge-offs were something like 28 basis points on the portfolio overall. Just for analytical purposes, that's an
interesting number that would suggest that they've continued to improve, and obviously, 39 basis points when
considering oil and gas. I think it's a reasonable expectation that consumer credit performance normalizes somewhat.
So that we've had the best of times, it probably gets a little bit more average while things being equal. As Bill asked, I
don't know that that makes it a real headwind. I think that means the expected case is probably a little bit lower ROA
than the existing case for most people who've been benefiting from the best of times in credit, but not so meaningfully
that it causes us to want to curtail growth based on the way we approach the market whereas I mentioned we're happy
with our auto growth. We've maintained our pricing and our risk discipline.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: And, John, the 28 point points John just mentioned to you – there's a lot of Johns here – but
for this quarter, ex-oil and gas is equal to what it was a year ago. So there's some movement within those categories,
but as you know, housing is getting better everywhere and that hugely benefits us. So while there might be some more
normalization in one part of the consumer and might be offset by another part of the consumer.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yeah, a couple of callouts are on the consumer real estate side of things, and second
mortgages I think we're down below 50 basis points in charge-offs which for home equity loans is...
<A - John G. Stumpf>: [indiscernible] (45:23).
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: It can't get much better than that
<A - John G. Stumpf>: [indiscernible] (45:26) live long enough to see that number.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: And on 1-4 family first mortgage loans, I think we're in the two-basis point charge-off
range right now which is something to celebrate when it's happening, but it doesn't feel like a permanent state of affairs.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And then a quick follow-up on net interest income. Assuming the rate
environment doesn't change much, can you talk a little bit about the puts and takes for growing net interest income?
Maybe size up the degree of difficulty of growing that going forward? And then just on the liquidity cash on the
balance sheet, when we look at that fed fund sold like roughly $300 billion, is there any way for us to kind of get a
sense of how much that might be redeployable versus how much is needed to meet the requirements of LCR and other
kind of regulatory needs to hold liquidity?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yeah. So there's not much limitation on the redeployment of that into HQLA while still
satisfying the liquidity coverage ratio. So it really gets back to the, when is the right time and how much at that time if
you're, just for example, buying treasuries because of the capital implications that it creates by putting more AFS
securities on the books. You're that much more exposed to a backup. So there's a trade-off there.
For non-HQLA, the limitations are different because you're losing the benefit of that liquidity. And [ph] we'd continue
(46:47) to mention the ability to move out of cash or HQLA and into risk assets, all things being equal based on the
snapshot as tens of billions of dollars of activity.
You saw what we did last year when we were – or earlier this year as we were sizing up taking the GE assets onto their
book – our books. We actually went out and did a little bit of incremental funding in the marketplace to have that
liquidity set aside. And now we're allowing that to runoff. It was relatively short-term. But it makes sense for us to have
ready access to something, call it, $200 billion worth of instant liquidity at any point in time. That's given our size,
given our risk profile and given our stress cases. Is that helpful?
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Yeah. Thanks, John. Just the broader comment about just kind of degree of difficulty
growing NII overall in this environment, yeah. Thanks.

<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yeah. Well, it is harder to grow net interest income in a lower rate environment than
otherwise, which is obvious. The short end of the curve is one thing, but this move down in seven years and out is just
as hard and just as meaningful because of the redeployment. So it's still our plan and our goal and what we're telling
you is that we intend to grow net interest income, even if there are no rate moves. And we're doing it by adding – by
redeploying cash into HQLA and other earning assets, by looking everywhere for customers where we can make
quality loans. And those are the big items. So it's our plan. It's our effort. It's what we're all working toward, but it's
harder.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: And, John, the biggest influence that Brexit had on our company was not on, frankly, a direct
impact on the way we do business or customers or anything like that, it really was the big move down in long-term
rates.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Yeah, got it.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: One other thing to say is it's a great time be a borrower. It's a great time to be one of our
customers. The mortgage business is one obvious place to look for the origination fee generation or gain generation.
But across the board, I would expect more. Everything is more affordable on a financed basis. So it helps.

Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kevin J. Barker>: Thank you. In regards to your servicing results within the mortgage bank, were there any
changes in the way you hedged that asset this quarter? Or was there something specific around the rate curve and the
movement in the yield curve in the second quarter versus the first quarter that would have caused the hedging gains to
be less than expected?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yeah, it's a good question. There wasn't really any change to the hedging approach in
our hedging results, strictly speaking, accomplished what they were intended to. There were just – there were a handful
of items that went, call it, in our favor in the first quarter that were negatives in the second quarter. And some of them
are [ph] just (50:10) model inputs in terms of how the MSR valuation calculation works. Some of it, obviously, was
just lower servicing fees. That's not a hedging outcome but it contributed to the net servicing benefits. Things speeded
up. Of course, we're getting more servicing called away from us. Even as we originate at this pace, there's more
servicing getting called away from us as others originate rapidly as well. So I would expect that to normalize. And I
would think about that also as something more along the lines of a multi-quarter average. One other item I'd point out is
the unreimbursed servicing costs was a net drag, an incremental net drag this quarter as well. That's mostly around
FHA activity.
<Q - Kevin J. Barker>: In regards to the FHA activity, what is the headwind that you're seeing from unreimbursed
insurance claims this quarter? Or how would you look at it as like the run rate from that line item?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Well, I think we're talking about a couple hundred million dollars of unreimbursed direct
costs in the second quarter and the run rate is probably half of that, looking back over the last several quarters.
<Q - Kevin J. Barker>: Okay. And then regards to the introduction of your first mortgage, have you seen an
incremental increase in your overall mortgage originations from the introduction of that product? Or would you expect
that to accelerate on a go-forward basis?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Well, so there's an increase, all things being equal, on the agency side of things but many
of those borrowers might have been FHA eligible borrowers prior to the introduction of that program. So, in some
sense, we're shifting origination from one program to another. We think it's a very high quality program. It's – the way
we've described it and constructed it, it's never worse for a customer, it's often then better for a customer because it's
got a different approach to MI that's more borrower friendly. So there should be more availability for it. And it should

help grow originations over time. And as we mentioned, it's particularly valuable to us because it gives access to
mortgage credit to low and middle income borrowers and first-time homebuyers who are people that we're really trying
to serve.

Operator
Your next question will come from the line of Paul Miller with FBR. Please go ahead.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Yeah. On the follow-up to Kevin's questions on your first mortgage, is this very similar to an
FHA product but outside of the FHA arena to a Fannie and Freddie product, i.e., is it low FICO, low down payment
type loans?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Well, it's lower down payment. Actually, the first part of your question is, this is an
agency program. This is a Wells Fargo and Fannie program. It is geared to serve the first-time homebuyer and the low
and middle income homebuyer. So there is some overlap with people that the FHA might be serving as I mentioned.
And it is built around a lower initial down payment to make it easier for those people to access credit. I wouldn't
describe it as a, predominantly, as a lower FICO, lower credit quality but more of a – structured for people who have a
lower down payment available.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Yeah and, Paul, it really looks at those first-time homebuyers especially. So it really looks to
serve that market, who many times have a lower down payment available.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: And this product will be sold – I mean either sold or wrapped by Fannie Mae guarantees?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yeah, it's agency mortgage production. So it doesn't look any different in our books. It
goes right into agency security. So there's no different risk profile on our books, and frankly, one of the reasons that the
program makes so much sense for us is because we have such a commercial relationship with Fannie in terms of
knowing what our risks are, what their risks are and when those risks pass. And it's very helpful.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Okay. And I don't know if you disclosed this or not, but do you guys know what your recapture
rate is on your refis right now on your book? You have one of the biggest books out there under MSR. Are you able to
recapture a lot of those refis?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: So we do capture a lot of our refis. I don't think we disclosed the capture rate. We
probably do disclose our market share both in origination and in servicing. I don't have them at my fingertips, but we'll
come back to you with the most recent specifics and that relationship will help you to – I mean there's obviously other
things going on there because a lot of mortgage origination is not refi activity, but that might be helpful.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Hey, guys. Thank you very much. Yeah?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: But, Paul, just one quick thing. We are recapturing less today, as John mentioned, because
some products were no longer in. So some of that refinance is refinancing away from us where we would have captured
more in the past.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Okay.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Some of the high risk categories.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Yeah. Okay. Hey, guys, thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Good morning.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Hey, Matt.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: To follow-up on expenses, a lot of talk earlier about the investment spend, the risk,
the compliance, obviously, growth areas and then eventually getting the payback on that. As we think about just the
pace of investment spend and that relationship of kind of getting it back on the other side, what inning are we in, in
terms of still ramping on the investment and still waiting on the payoff?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Well, I'd say we're in the middle innings of the investment. We'll be doing – we've been
doing it for a few years and we'll be doing it for a few more years, I'm sure. And we'll always be innovating. But in
some cases, we're getting the payback. You saw at Investor Day the moves that we made toward more of a paperless
store. And we talked about the specifics in terms of what the benefit is of taking paper, labor, storage, transportation out
of stores. That's happened, that's in our run rate. A lot of the digital and mobile migration that we have of customer
activity is taking personal interactions out of those types of transactions. It's taking paper out for sure. And those
benefits feed right into the run rate as they happen.
John was mentioning the initial investment in build to create some of these new programs in compliance and risk
management for example. And the fact that once they're highly effective and repeatable, then there's an opportunity to
automate, to streamline, to learn from how we got there and to make them more efficient. I'd say those opportunities are
– we're always learning, but they're probably a little bit more in the future. And then who knows where we'll be going
with the increase in mobility, et cetera. My sense is, we're just going to keep benefiting – customers benefit on the one
hand, but from an expense perspective, we'll keep benefiting as well. I'd point out the P2P activity as another place
where we're taking checks out, taking cash handling out, increasing customer service but doing it at a lower cost to
serve. So there's a lot of that.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Are you still at the point where you're increasing overall investment spend? Or are
you able to remix some of that so that it's still at a high level but not necessarily going up?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: I think it's still going up a little bit. We've been doing that while taking expense out of
our standard run rate in order to accommodate it while staying within our 55% to 59%. So – and as the nature of mobile
first and technological solutions first occurs, we're always going to be spending at a high level. We'll just keep – at least
for innovative types of activities, and we'll keep doing what we're doing of taking expense out of our business as usual.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: And then just separately, you mentioned in the press release about the higher
amortization on the mortgage bond book, which makes sense given the sharp drop in the rate, but do you have the
figures in terms of how much it was this quarter versus last? And remind us how your strategy or approach there is. Is
there like a mark-to-marketing or is there a smoothing effect? One of your peers has what feels like a mark-to-market
impact, so they take their hit upfront. Some of your peers smooth out a little bit more. Remind us how your approach is.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yeah. What I would point out is that we're amortizing premiums on mortgage securities
in particular that are highly prepayment sensitive. And in this quarter, the net interest margin or net interest dollars
negative impact of getting premium book value bonds called away at par was, I think the number's $100 million. I'm
confirming, it's $100 million. So that's one way of thinking about it. So we put a mortgage security on at a premium.
We amortize that premium over an expected life with an expected CPR. Things come in faster and we have to write off
the remaining premium when it happens. This quarter, that impact was $100 million.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: And do you have that for last quarter?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: I don't think I do handy, but it wasn't $100 million, so less.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Got it. Okay. Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brian D. Foran>: Hi, how are you? Maybe just two quick ones on credit. First in auto lending, you mentioned
the Manheim's up a little bit but severities are up a little bit as well. What's driving that? I know it's not [indiscernible]
(01:00:14). What's driving that disconnect?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Manheim is up a little bit and was up in each of the last few months, and I think as we've
said there's an expectation that that can't go on forever. And that's part why we would say that we expect future losses
to be a little bit more normal in that business than what's been happening. Any change in severity is really just a change
in the mix, the repo activity, the circumstances of what's been coming in. I don't think there's a systematic reason for it.
<Q - Brian D. Foran>: And then on...
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Brian, I would just add, Brian, just add that there's been really strong new car sales the last
couple years. Some of those go out in lease programs, and they come off lease. So our guess is that they'll be more late
model used cars on the market, put pressure on Manheim, the other hand which could cause a normalization in losses.
On the other hand, that's really where we play and where we have a lot of market expertise. So it's a bit of an offset.
<Q - Brian D. Foran>: Thank you. And then on commercial real estate, I mean I guess as I think about both your
commentary and data as well as like what the OCC is saying, et cetera, there's just kind of general concern around
underwriting standards, but at the same time, the current data around loan growth is pretty good. And on charge-offs,
kind of bouncing between zero and net recovery, so it's about as good as it can get. How are you thinking about the
commercial real estate cycle now? Is it just kind of pockets of concern, or is there a concern that there's maybe a more
broad-based turn on the horizon? Or how you kind of think about the concerns around underwriting standards versus
the very good numbers today?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yeah. So I would say that our underwriting approach to commercial real estate tends to
be at the conservative end of the spectrum, and we're really of a reputation often for better, sometimes to the chagrin of
customers for approaching it that way which helps us well through cycles. As you're alluding to, this is a very cyclical
business. It is regional and local. It is property type by property type.
There are some areas and some property types where values have been elevated because people have been willing to
accept really, really low returns on their invested capital, and that creates one sort of outcome. And then there are
others where there's just a lot of supply that's coming on and has come on, has to be absorbed. That creates a different
dynamic. We're seeing that. We have seen that in some multi-family or luxury single family from market to market,
and that in that market those dynamics have to play out where that gets absorbed at some clearing price.
We're taking the same approach that we always have. We're sort of a relatively low loan-to-value lender. We look very
hard at in-place cash flow. We have a lot of incremental borrower guarantees and supplemental protections in our
bigger commercial real estate types of financings, and that's – it's always been true.
So I'm sure when the cycle turns, there'll be either property types or geographies where – that do better or worse, but
we're not taking a big change. We're not seeing a big sea change. Our originations have actually – have been slower.
Certainly, we're slower before we bought the seasoned GE portfolio. The organic activity because of the competitive
environment and because of the market circumstances caused us to slow down there somewhat.
<Q - Brian D. Foran>: Thank you very much.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yeah.

<Q - Ken Usdin>: Thanks. Good morning. A question on the investment portfolio. John, you'd mentioned that you'd
added a lot of securities this quarter before the rate change, and looks like you did it mostly in the agency MBS and the
held to maturity. And I'm just wondering, given it looks like that average yield was [ph] one nine year (01:04:33) below
given that's where the average are, how are you thinking about continuing to build the securities book versus potentially
keeping more of your originated production where you can get a free handle still versus maybe a [ph] one-and-a-half
(01:04:45) in the securities book? So what's your trade-off on interest rate risk versus credit risk I guess? And does
your philosophy change given where we are in the environment at all?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yeah. It's a good question, and it's analysis that we conduct. As I had mentioned earlier,
we've been still continuing to sell all of our conforming production. There are limited but some benefits – limited
liquidity attribution but some benefit agency mortgage securities but less so or not so with loans. So that's part of that
determination. There's a different risk profile for carrying loans on the books, obviously versus guaranteed
pass-throughs, that's part of the analysis. We have a reasonably large allocation to single family whole loan real estate,
residential real estate today because of our jumbo portfolio which we continue to want to make room for as we serve
those customers going forward.
So all those things sort of fit together in our risk appetite and have, setting the ALCO considerations aside, but just
from how much is enough and what type of risk do you need on your books, we follow the path that we followed which
isn't to say that if circumstances changed or persisted and the allocation opportunities look a little bit different, we
wouldn't modify our conclusion, but that's where we've gotten thus far.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Okay. And then just second question on commercial real estate brokerage just within the other fees
category, it's been a good business for you historically, looks like it's gotten a little softer. Is that purposeful change in
how you're doing the business, or is it just the environment? Any color there would be great.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: It's cyclical. It's a great business for us. We're the best frankly in that business. There's a
lot of knock-on benefit in terms of the financing we do, investment banking that we do for those customers, but it is
cyclical and it will follow patterns like the ones that we just talked about in terms of what's going on in different
markets. That business is interesting because it's got something for bullish times in commercial real estate and it's got
something for bearish times in commercial real estate because the same team is involved in helping to find liquidity for
properties and financing for properties when things aren't going well in markets, and when investors are going the other
way. So we like it. But it's a little bit harder to forecast because it doesn't just trend up over time, it moves around. But
it's been a great performer for the last couple years.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: There's no change in terms of how you're approaching it, it's just a little bit of an air pocket?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: It's just the normal volatility in what's happening in that business. No change.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Okay. Thanks a lot.

<Q - Joe Morford>: The C&I growth seemed a bit softer this quarter, particularly relative the pace you saw through

<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: I'm not sure what would inspire marginal business owner confidence in this
environment. I mean it's about the same as it has been recently, probably a little bit less certainty given what's going on
around the world. But I would – I don't think of that as having a meaningful Impact on the quarter's organic C&I loan
growth. It's competitive and we're out there competing. There's some amount of capital formation around CapEx and
expansion and other projects. Not as much as there would be if we were in a more vibrant overall economic
environment. There's actually a little more happening in energy today than there was over the last several quarters,
more capital being raised, more assets are changing hands which is giving rise to some financing opportunity. So I
would think of it more as a season or a short period of time to measure against. Nothing, no story there.
<Q - Joe Morford>: Okay. And then you also talked earlier about being disciplined on expenses and getting paper and
transactions out of the stores, but kind of more broadly speaking, how are you currently thinking about the overall retail
distribution network, particularly given the growth in mobile banking? Are you considering moving more aggressively
or transitioning to the smaller neighborhood stores or perhaps maybe you don't need as much density in certain markets
to reduce the overall footprint. What's the update there?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Yeah, Joe, I think that's an interesting question. We continue to look at that and we're not
oblivious to the changes going on, as you suggest the mobile offerings are our fastest growing channel now. 18 million
of our 20 some million households now have – use that and sometimes as their – most times as their dominant channel.
So we continue to think about that. Our philosophy has been or will continue to be, we want to serve customers when,
where, and how they want to be served. We don't want to drive them some place to our benefit. We want to provide for
their benefit. That being said, that's a big area we continue to look at as we innovate and we see customers change their
behaviors.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: We're going to make it easier for them to do business with us in other channels as well.
And if they change their behavior then we'll react to that.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: We'll react it to. And those could have some meaningful impacts on it.

<Q - John Pancari>: Good morning.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Hey, John.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Good morning.
<Q - John Pancari>: I'll try to be quick given the length of the call here, but I am going to beat a head horse here on
the expense topic. But I know and I appreciate the color you gave on the levers that you can pull given what we're
seeing on the top line side here. Now what I'm trying to just understand is what do we need to see, maybe it's in terms
of where rates go or overall top line pressure, for you to start to really pull those levers more aggressively? And, again,
maybe it's around expenses. And also longer-term, is the goal just to keep the efficiency ratio? Are you okay with that
high end of that range even through 2017? If this top line pressure persists from the curve or do you, at some point,
look to get to the middle of that range again? Thanks.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Here's how we look at expenses. We look at this company, in fact on Wednesday, we had our
one 164th birthday, and we look at this company from a long-term perspective, we've always been thoughtful about
how we spend our shareholders' money. We're the stewards of your capital and their capital. And surely a longer,
lower-for-longer scenario puts pressure on everything that we do, but we're going to continue to make those
investments that we believe are good long-term investments to help customers succeed financially. That being said, I
do think we're at a point in time where there are some opportunities that, because of changing customer behaviors. So
we will – but we're not going to do something that's going to be short-term bright and long-term dull, if you will, just

Your next question will come from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Thanks. One narrow question and then perhaps one broader one. On your servicing income,
and I'm looking at the data on page 40 of the release, your servicing fees are down year-over-year by, in order of
magnitude, something like 20%, but your servicing portfolio is only down about 3%. What's the dynamic there on the
servicing income?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: So there are older categories of loan product that are running off that might have
different per pound fees associated with them. There's different categories of unreimbursed servicing expense that get
netted against those servicing fees. And I mentioned we're up $100 million, I think in this quarter which contributes to
the delta between last year and this year or a quarter a year ago and this quarter. But the servicing book has been getting
smaller as we've walked away from higher risk activities, et cetera, and focus more on today's core agency mortgage
origination. So that phenomenon is something to grapple with when thinking about how that performs over the coming
couple of years as augmented by how successful we are on the origination side and growing new servicing assets as
well.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: But does the pace of change – I guess does the pace of change, change at all because of the,
presumably, many of the legacy assets are now being refi-ed away and newer assets may look more like legacy assets
in terms of servicing rate?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Well, I think what changes is the cost to service because we're working through the –
we've had higher foreclosed and work out expenses over time. There's labor. There's extra compliance. There's a lot
going on. The standards are still – the new standards are as high as they've ever been but the incidence will be going
down over time. So my sense is that that should improve. There should be some scale there. And perhaps it's true also
that the per pound revenue, per loan revenue scales into today's run rate. And with each new $1 billion worth of
servicing that we add to the book, it doesn't pay the same servicing revenue as a legacy $1 billion. But you'll watch that
move slowly over time.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: And then if I can just step back for a moment. Your earnings power for the past several
years now has been running just above $4, and of course, this current quarter it sort of affirm that run rate. And the
consensus for next year is closer to $4.30. And I'm not asking you to specifically forecast, but could you help us
understand like what bridges that increase in earnings power? Presumably rates might be some of it, but is there – and

the balance sheet continues to grow. But in the absence of rates, would that figure be achievable or are we more in a
trend line?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Well, there's a lot of unknowns in that question and we're not giving guidance on next
year. But as was mentioned earlier by Erika in terms of what might happen or what has to happen as we grow in the
future, some – it'll be earning asset growth, loans and investments. It'll be what – how efficient we are on the expense
side of things, and then the whole spectrum of non-interest income generating possibilities. There's a lot of strength in
the number of those line items.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: General Electric.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yeah. The GE portfolio added not just the $40 billion-odd worth of loans but over
200,000 commercial relationships that for – most of whom weren't meaningful relationships of Wells Fargo already. So
it's doing more with customers and generating more lending opportunity, more non-interest income opportunity and
executing along those lines. It's a lot of work.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: But if you think about the way we do business in our operating model, it's a great model to
have for this economic environment. Really, when you think about it, we're in a real economy. We do have 90 different
businesses. We serve customers broadly and deeply, and I don't think I'd want any other model for this environment.

Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: Thanks for taking the question. John, [ph] when (78:45) I was – wanting to kind of drill down to
is if you think about mortgage refinance, the way you've got accounting set up where you recognize at close and the
way that servicing valuations get hit almost instantaneously when rates fall, you typically have a pressure quarter when
refinance kicks in, followed by more favorable outcomes as you move forward. So I just wanted to focus on that kind
of contrast and make sure that I'm still thinking about that right as it's been kind of built in the past.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: I think you probably are.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: And then the only thing I was going add and follow-up is if you think about what you were just
responding to, the one thing that I think you left out was the fact that share repurchase will reduce the shares
outstanding by about half of that growth that was just highlighted. So capital announcements has a big part of what
would generate any incremental growth if net income was absolutely flat from this point forward.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: We have been benefiting and we'll continue to benefit from taking net share repurchase
as a result of our capital plan. It is a driver for people who are measuring in earnings per share. Thanks for pointing that
out.

<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: At least I think it's still morning. Anyway, one larger question and two small ones. The
commentary on the oil and gas portfolio and the trends there, seems to be a little bit different than what we heard from
JPMorgan Chase yesterday and U.S. Bancorp earlier this morning, where they seem to be a little less equivocal in the
trends. And it looks like you had a big addition on non-accruals but you didn't add to the reserve for the portfolio.
Yesterday, Jamie Diamond talked about the companies and their portfolio having greater access to other financing, that
seemed to be, your trends or commentary was a little different than that. Can you just – I mean are there differences in
your oil and gas portfolio? Or you're just being cautious here?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: I'd say both. There are probably differences. We have a big broad spectrum of upstream,
midstream and services companies that includes a lot of middle market companies which our entire wholesale portfolio
does. So the portfolios are probably different. We are generally cautious however. I guess I'd point out that our
criticized assets and some in energy are down by $1.7 billion within that. We moved more into non-performing in the
quarter which we had expected to do in our outlook as we sat here a quarter ago which is why our reserve didn't have to
go up in connection with that.
I think we're just a little – it's a little premature to declare victory because prices are hovering in crude in the 40s and
who knows what the next couple of quarters brings and we don't want to get ahead of ourselves there. We're performing
great with 39 basis points of loss, all in, with these levels.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Right.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: And so there's no point in declaring victory. We would agree, if I didn't mention it, that
was an oversight. There's a lot more access to capital among energy companies today, all forms. Loans, high yield, high
grade and equity were busier in the second quarter than they have been in a while. There are more assets changing
hands, things are freeing up a little bit, and that's going to help with resolutions. We've captured the benefit of that in
our analysis for what our exposures are, but it's true. And it was less true a couple quarters ago.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: And, Nancy, the other thing I – John mentioned that I just want to remind or say it again, even
though we added to our non-accruals, we tend to be conservative. Over 90% of our non-accrual oil and gas customers
are still current on principal interest payments. Think about that. I mean that's...
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Almost all the losses that we've taken are from loans that are still paying.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Yes.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Okay. So we're sort of harkening back to the performing, non-performing era of a couple of
decades ago.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Yeah. I remember that. That's right.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Yeah, I remember. Secondly, mortgage banking gain on sale, can you just give us the
current margin and how that stacks up and if it's strengthening, I mean if refi activity goes up, I'm assuming that gain
on sale margin will strengthen? Can you just affirm that or not?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: It was sort of [ph] 165 or 166 (01:23:38) in quarter and about the same from the first
quarter. I think you're right that the industry's probably going to have some capacity constraints at this level of
application activity. And that's probably – it's at least supportive for the levels that we are today. I don't know if it
moves up from here. But it feels supportive because people are working hard to accomplish the throughput that these
applications create.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Okay. And just one final question. John Stumpf, you raised the dividend, what $0.02 I
guess, what last quarter and you're sort of at the 37% payout ratio, et cetera, et cetera. When would be the next regular
dividend meeting where you would consider a more meaningful dividend increase and given that your stock is one of
the highest yielding in the group, is that necessary at these point?

and you just suggested that if you take $0.38 and divide that by $1.01 you get a number that is – that we're proud about.
We just went through our CCAR process and I hope you would agree and I know our investors appreciate the fact that
we are shareholder friendly. We have – of the big banks, of the G-SIBs, we are a leader in returning capital. So
dividends are important. Speaks to the confidence of our – of how we run the company and the earnings momentum

look at the kind of on the liability side of the balance sheet, if you look at it year-on-year, you've seen deposits up $60
billion where most of the funding is coming from short-term borrowings and long-term debt. So is there something
changing in the depositor base? Or are depositors becoming more rate sensitive, and that's why you're not seeing the
deposit growth that you once were especially this quarter where it's only been $4 billion on end of period for total
deposits? Yeah, just wondering if there's a change in the depositors there?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yeah. If there's anything specific, I'd say it's among wholesale customers. I think retail
deposits grew by 8% year-over-year, and the total grew by 4%. And the balance is coming from wholesale customers
who are a little bit more price sensitive, and in the wake of the 25-basis point move in December, there are some
deposits that we paid a little bit more for on wholesale and some that we didn't and some that have better liquidity value
and some that have worse. And this is how that's shaken out.
You pointed out that there's been some more wholesale funding on the liability side. We went out and put on some
shortish-term, I think it shows up as long-term because it's beyond a year, but shortish-term financing to make sure we
had funding in place for the GE assets as they came on. Some of that will roll off. Some of it, we might hang onto for a
while, but it's a mix. And then as you also pointed out, we are out there marching along the TLAC implementation
path, and we will be over the course of the next several years. And that will add to that portion of the liability stack.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Brian, we love all of our deposits and depositors, but if you look at, as John mentioned, if you
look at the most core of our core deposits, that would be retail. And especially retail transaction deposits, savings
accounts, checking accounts, and if you look at our net primary which where people live out of those accounts, you
look at that growth and you look at the growth on the retail side, it's been world class for us. So – and that continues to
march along.
<Q - Brian Kleinhanzl>: Okay. Great. Thanks.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Thank you.
