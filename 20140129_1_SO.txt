We have a full agenda for today's call. We'll begin with a brief recap of 2013 operational highlights followed by an
update on the Vogtle and Kemper projects. We'll then discuss fourth quarter and full-year 2013 financial and sales
results. Finally, we will update our forecast of sales, capital spending and financing, which support our earnings and
dividend forecast for the next two years. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning.
Thomas A. Fanning
Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. 2013 was a year of operational, regulatory and financial challenges for
Southern Company. And apart from our difficulties with Plant Ratcliffe in Kemper County, Mississippi, we achieved
tremendous success in meeting these challenges. In what was arguably our busiest year ever from a regulatory
standpoint, we saw an unprecedented level of activity across all four states. The results in each of our jurisdictions
demonstrate that our continued focus on the customer help support constructive regulatory engagement.
In Alabama, minor adjustments were made to the RSE mechanism that will serve customer interests well. In Georgia,
the PSC approved another constructive three-year agreement for Georgia Power. Georgia Power also completed
another successful integrated resource plan. And in the third regulatory proceeding in Georgia, the VCM 8 report was
approved unanimously. Bringing the aggregate total of cost approved for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to $2.2 billion with
no disallowances.
In Florida, the PSC approved a settlement agreement reached between Gulf Power and all of the interveners in its rate
case.
And in Mississippi, we reached a settlement in January 2013 that paved the way for Kemper-related rate increases in
2013 and 2014, and a subsequent rate increase in 2015 for the securitization of certain project costs, combined these
steps are projected to stabilize the impact on customers for at least seven years.
Even with the backdrop of the regulatory proceedings in all four of our retail jurisdictions, Southern Company and its
four traditional operating companies occupied the top five spots in the 2013 customer value benchmark survey, which
compares our customer satisfaction ratings with those of peer utilities.
We experienced the best year in our company's history in terms of transmission and distribution reliability, continuing a
trend of improvement over the past decade.
And most importantly, we completed our safest year ever. For the third consecutive year, Southern Company achieved
a new all-time record low in recordable incident rate and also saw reductions in lost workday cases and preventable
vehicle accidents. This continuing commitment to protecting the health and safety of our workers is a key component
of Southern Company's workplace culture, and I'm extremely proud of our most recent results in this area.
Let's now discuss our two large construction projects. Progress at the Vogtle 3 and 4 construction site is remarkable.
We've included photos in our slide deck that indicate how much the site has changed over the course of 2013.
Also included is a recent photo of CA20, the auxiliary building module for the Unit 3 nuclear island. The photo, which
was taken inside the on-site module assembly building, shows all of the structural walls assembled. Prep work
continues to ready this module for placement in the nuclear island next month. We overcame early issues with the sub
module fabrication and documentation in Lake Charles, Louisiana. Our demonstrated ability to work through
challenges is indicative of the strong collaborative relationship we have with Chicago Bridge & Iron and
Westinghouse, as well as a testament to the rigorous oversight we have in place for this project.
As we look ahead to 2014, the site will continue to change shape in dramatic ways. Progress on the turbine island and
cooling tower for Unit 3 will continue, and the nuclear island for Unit 3 will really start to come out of the ground.
After the placement of CA20, we are scheduled to see two of the containment vessel rings stacked on the bottom head,
the large CA01 module placed inside the containment vessel, and the six-foot thick walls of the nuclear island will
come all the way to ground level. Progress on Unit 4 will also continue and a year from now, we expect that many of

the unit's components to be further along than Unit 3 is today.
We're also pleased to announce that after extensive negotiations on loan guarantees, Georgia Power has delivered its
documents to DOE. Now, there remain a series of steps that must be taken prior to closing. And while we can't disclose
final terms, we do believe that our earlier estimate of approximately $200 million of present value benefits is still
representative of the loan's value to customers. Combined with other customer benefits, including production tax
credits, for which we qualified after the completion of the concrete basemat pours in both nuclear islands, we project
approximately $2 billion worth of additional benefits to customers relative to the amounts originally certified by the
PSC. We will continue to provide more color on these savings and other aspects of the project in the next Vogtle
construction monitoring report, which is scheduled to be filed in late February.
The Kemper IGCC project also continues to make progress and we are still working towards a fourth quarter in-service
date. During 2013, the transmission infrastructure was completed, the pipelines were all completed, and the lignite
mine was placed into service. At this stage, more than 75% of the piping has been installed and testing of the combined
cycle is underway. In fact, we produced electricity using natural gas throughout most of January, generating
approximately $1 million to offset project costs. We will move towards testing of the gasifier in the second quarter,
which will mark the first heat-up of a gasifier at the facility. The key milestone expected prior to commercial operation
is a reliable supply of syngas to the combined cycle.
Recognizing that there are risks associated with start-up activities, we have recorded an additional charge for the
project of $40 million pre-tax, $25 million after tax, in the fourth quarter of 2013, to increase the contingency for those
risks. Overall, we continue to anticipate that Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and Plant Ratcliffe in Kemper County will benefit
customers with clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy for decades to come. I'll now turn the call over to Art for a
financial and economic overview.
Arthur P. Beattie
Thanks, Tom. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we had strong results for the fourth quarter
of 2013, which positively influenced our results for the full year. For the fourth quarter of 2013, we earned $0.47 per
share compared to $0.44 per share in the fourth quarter of 2012.
For the full year of 2013, we earned $1.88 per share compared with $2.70 per share in 2012. Our results for the fourth
quarter 2013 include after-tax charges of $25 million, or $0.03 per share, and earnings for the full-year 2013 include
after-tax charges totaling $729 million, or $0.83 per share, related to increased cost estimates for construction of the
Kemper Project. As a reminder, Mississippi Power will not seek recovery of estimated cost to complete the facility
above the $2.88 billion cost cap net of Department of Energy grants and exceptions to the cost cap.
Results for the full-year of 2013 also include an after-tax charge of $16 million or $0.02 per share for the restructuring
of a leverage lease investment recorded in the first quarter of 2013. Earnings for the fourth quarter and full-year 2013
include $12 million or $0.02 per share, and earnings for the full-year 2012 include $21 million, $0.02 per share of an
insurance recovery related to the March 2009 litigation settlement agreement with MC Asset Recovery, LLC.
Excluding these items, earnings for the fourth quarter and full-year of 2013 were $0.48 and $2.71 per share respectively
compared with $0.44 and $2.68 per share respectively for the same periods in 2012.
Year-over-year results were positively influenced by revenue effects associated with new generating capacity at our
traditional operating companies, as well as reductions in interest expense and AFUDC. These positive effects were
offset by significantly milder than expected weather, increased depreciation and amortization and non-fuel O&M
expenses, and an increase in the number of shares outstanding. A full listing of earnings drivers for both the full year
and the fourth quarter is included in the slide deck.
Our full-year 2013 results are perhaps best understood, however, by examining the response of our traditional operating
companies to unexpected headwinds in revenue. Weather in our territory was especially unseasonable in 2013,
resulting in one of the mildest summers of the past 20 years, and rainfall during the third quarter of 2013 was the

heaviest in nearly 100 years. The impact on our base revenues equated to negative $0.14, at the same time retail sales
growth in 2013 was slightly less than anticipated. 2013 therefore marks yet another year in which our flexible spending
plans have proven effective in offsetting unforeseen shortfalls in revenue. Each year, as part of the development of our
financial plan, we build flexibility into our operations and cost to serve as a mitigation for revenue variances.
Since 2010, with the economy struggling to recover, and with two very mild weather years back-to-back, our O&M
spending has been down $500 million compared against our plan, helping us to deliver on our short-term financial
commitments, while adding more than $7 billion in capital assets. All the while, our operating companies have been
keenly focused on safety, reliability and customer satisfaction, with a view towards maintaining the long-term
sustainability of our business model.
Moving now to an economic and sales review of 2013. As expected, economic growth in 2013 was slow during the first
half of the year, but picked up considerably during the second half of the year. This trend is reflected in our retail sales
results, which showed improved growth in the second half of the year in all customer classes.
For example, industrial sales, which decreased 0.7% in the first six months, increased 3.6% during the second six
months, and 4.8% during the fourth quarter. Bringing us to seven consecutive months year-over-year of industrial sales
growth. The strongest segments included paper up 11%, primary metals up 11%, and pipeline up 6%.
Housing related industries improved as well, with stone, clay and glass up 9% and lumber up 5%. Commercial and
residential sales were essentially flat for the year, although we did see a noticeable increase for residential in the fourth
quarter.
Meanwhile, our economic development pipeline remains robust, growing nearly 20% in 2013 compared with 2012. Our
traditional operating companies are currently supporting some 350 potential projects, representing 35,000 jobs and $15
billion in capital investment.
Earlier this month, we reengaged our economic roundtable participants. As a reminder, this group consists of several
regional economists and executives from a handful of our largest customers. The viewpoints of our roundtable
participants are well aligned with Southern Company's economic forecast. The momentum experienced during the
second half of 2013 is expected to carry over into 2014.
With anticipated GDP growth of between 2.5% and 3%. Industrial activity and exports are expected to be the key
drivers with growth expected in chemicals, steel, auto manufacturing and transportation.
The housing market is improving, but likely has a long way to go before returning to pre-2007 levels. Multi-family
customer growth is 10% higher – is a 10% higher share of our growth than during the pre-recession period, consistent
with many antidotes about robust in multi-family housing. Building permits were up more than 25% over 2012, but are
about 50% below normal levels.
The dynamics of supply and demand in this sector are returning to historical levels, which should translate into an
increase in single-family home starts. This continued recovery of the housing sector will support stronger residential
customer growth and further support the rise in activity we saw in housing-related sectors in 2013, with expectations of
continued growth in 2014.
Much of the feedback we have heard from our economic roundtable participants is consistent with the factors that drive
our electric sales outlook for 2014. Overall, our forecast reflects 0.7% growth from our 2013 weather normalized
results. As one looks at how the forecast breaks down by a customer class, the expected trend is similar to that of the
past several years, in that industrial growth leads the way. Specifically, our forecast of 0.7% overall growth assumes a
1.1% growth for industrial sales, and about half that rate for both residential and commercial.
Now, let's focus on the other elements of our new forecast, including our three-year projection of capital expenditures
and the associated financing plan. Based on our CapEx forecast for 2014 to 2016, it totals $14.5 billion. More notably,
the forecast reflects a slowing trend in the rate of capital investments by our regulated subsidiaries. The main drivers of
this trend are expected completion of Plant Ratcliffe in Kemper County, Mississippi, the transition to start-up activities
for Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and the expected completion of compliance investments for EPA's MATS rule.

In addition, we have outlined potential Southern Power investments for the three-year period, which total $1.4 billion.
These placeholders represent potential acquisitions or new build capacity projects consistent with Southern Power's
long-standing capacity contract-oriented business model, as well as potential opportunities to invest in additional PV
solar projects over this timeframe.
As always, we will provide the details of any specific opportunities as they arise to an appropriate level of certainty.
Overall, our three-year CapEx total is expected to be $15.9 billion. As we turn to the financing plans for the next three
years, there are several things to note. First, the only equity issuances we are forecasting over the three-year period are
the same $600 million in 2014 that we highlighted late last year. This is primarily driven by our desire to preserve our
target equity ratios in light of the estimated Kemper losses recorded in 2013.
Our current forecast anticipates that all this equity will be issued through our various internal plans. We currently
project zero equity needs in 2015 and 2016. Secondly, we have highlighted the appropriate size and timing for Georgia
Power's draws under the DOE loan guarantee program, and an estimated total for securitized bonds to be issued by
Mississippi Power to fund a portion of the Kemper Project. As our cash flow profile continues to improve over the next
several years, our three-year financing plan reflects very little new capital market issuances, which may increase with
potential new investments by Southern Power.
However, it is important to note that our forecast would still reflect zero equity needs for 2015 and 2016, even if we
spend the entire amount reflected in our CapEx forecast for potential Southern Power growth projects. We have
provided a more detailed financing schedule in the appendix of our slide deck, which breaks these out by subsidiary.
All of the forecast elements we discussed, sales, CapEx, equity and cash flow, factor into our earnings guidance, which
I would like to share with you now.
First, let's focus on 2014. As noted earlier, our 2013 earnings per share result of $2.71 excluding charges came in a year
of extremely mild weather, heavy rainfall and a still sluggish economy. However, we largely overcame the financial
impact of those external factors by demonstrating an ability to mitigate revenue shortfalls with lower spending.
As a result, it's fair to consider $2.71 a normalized earnings per share result. Using $2.71 as the starting point, we then
adjust for the additional share dilution resulting from the estimated Kemper losses, which total $0.07. As we have
shared previously, this step change is simply a function of the new shares we're issuing to preserve our target equity
ratios at both Mississippi Power and Southern Company.
Growing 4% to 5% from this adjusted starting point establishes a midpoint for our new 2014 guidance range. To
establish a reasonable range for the year, we then add plus or minus $0.04, a very modest 1.5% to this midpoint to set a
range at $2.72 to $2.82, excuse me, $2.80 per share.
Now let's transition to expectations for 2015 and 2016. In our last earnings call, we shared very distinct – we shared a
very distinctive trend where we're beginning to see – which we're beginning to see in our long-term forecast. More
specifically, we highlighted a slowing of EPS growth in the middle of the decade. This slowing is largely a function of
a slowing level of capital spending, especially relative to a capital base that has grown significantly in the recent years
with new generation and environmental investments.
Combined with the increased operating cash flow associated with these same projects, the rate of growth in total
invested capital slows over the next several years. Consistent with these trends, our estimates for earnings per share
growth for 2015 is 3% to 4% from our 2014 guidance range. And our estimate for 2016 is another 3% to 4% above our
estimate for 2015. As we look beyond 2016, we continue to see potential for the growth rate to reaccelerate.
For instance, we are likely to see new generation investment opportunities later this decade for both Southern Power
and our traditional operating companies, as well as new environmental spending.
Additionally, beginning several years ago, we raised our equity ratio by several hundred basis points to preserve our
financial integrity during a period of increased construction risk. As our major projects are completed, there may be an
opportunity to unwind some of that equity ratio cushion and maintain our credit quality at the same time.

This would also have a positive impact on earnings per share growth. In assessing our earnings estimates for 2014
through 2016, we have also reconfirmed our belief that continuing with dividend increases of $0.07 per year is
sustainable. While dividend increases are subject to board approval, the implied payout ratios associated with a $0.07
per year increase are reasonable within the context of our strong cash flow, business model and constructive regulatory
jurisdictions.
So to summarize, we estimate EPS growth of approximately 4% to 5% in 2014 off of an adjusted 2013 base. Our
growth estimate for 2015 and 2016 is 3% to 4%. Beyond 2016, we see potential to reaccelerate that growth. Based on
our level of confidence, we expect to continue our current dividend growth strategy.
As a side note, our earnings estimate for the first quarter of 2014 is $0.56 per share. I'll now turn the call back over to
Tom for his closing remarks.
Thomas A. Fanning
Thanks, Art. Earlier Art highlighted something that I want to take a minute to reinforce. Namely, our track-record of
delivering regular, predictable, sustainable earnings, along with that, a consistent dividend growth trajectory. We are
extremely disciplined in how we approach earnings guidance and dividends at Southern Company. We provide
guidance once a year during our fourth quarter conference call in January, like this one, and we have never changed our
guidance range during the remainder of the year.
Additionally, our ranges tend to be small relative to those of other utilities. On the average, over the past decade, our
guidance range has been the smallest relative to the other 19 companies in the Philadelphia Utility Index. And as an
affirmation of Art's earlier point on effectiveness of our spending flexibility, we have been inside or slightly above the
narrow EPS ranges every single year over the past decade, and we were inside those ranges other than excluding items.
Combined with the fact that we have had sustainable dividend growth every year for more than a decade, even through
the toughest of economic times, we believe the risk return profile of Southern Company remains an unmatched value.
We are now ready to take your questions. So operator, we'll now take the first question.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please
proceed with your question.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Steve.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Hi, Tom, how are you? I don't think I'm ever first on a call. I'm surprised. Just when you
look at the growth in 2015 and 2016 in terms of earnings growth, it doesn't totally match the growth in the capital that
you show 2015, 2016. So 2015 has higher capital growth and it slows in 2016, but the earnings growth is kind of
consistent. Can you maybe explain just those differences?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Steve, are you saying that earnings growth is slower than the CapEx growth, is that where
you're going?
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Well it isn't – CapEx growth in 2015 is about 5%, the invested capital growth, and 2016,
3.5%, but then the earnings growth for both years are kind of consistent. So the 2015 growth in theory should've been
higher if it matched the capital growth. And then slow down in 2016.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah. So, I got a lot of things going on there. But you've got invested capital actually
expected to grow, but it's being offset with some cash as well. And Southern Power is also an element of that as well.

The growth rate we include there assumes some expansion at Southern Power and some of that could be in the form of
new solar projects, which would be more productive to income in those time frames.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And let me add a little bit to that. So we've often talked about kind of how we put a risk
premium on tax-advantaged investing. It's clear that if we invest in solar projects, you get a big pop to ITC. You know,
those pops are not sustainable. And so in order to provide a growth trajectory, you've got to continue to add to add to
add. And it also adds to your risk of being able to recognize the economic value of those tax benefits. For example, if
you had a hurricane, you'd expense all the hurricane expenses in the current period and it pushes out the economic
consequence of the tax credits. What we see in 2016, for example, is kind of the aggregate effect of not so much
tax-oriented investing, but a return to kind of base-load investing at Southern Power, which in the very near term looks
a little dilutive. In other words, you don't earn big returns, it's kind of AFUDC. The returns tend to be more of the
sustainable nature that we like. I think that's shaping – the kinds of investments we're assuming for Southern Power is a
big deal.
And then I guess the last kind of point would be that earned ROE is based on average invested capital, not yearend. So
you've got to account for the deltas in going from one year at 4.9% and another year at 3.6%. You need to average the
consequences, so it won't have the year-to-year discrete impact.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Okay. And then just the commentary that you made on the right side about the long-term
growth drivers.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yes.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Is that the kind of highlight that my sense from the last call was that growth was potentially
going to slow in 2016, 2017 and then maybe get better along long term. Are you trying to say – or do you trying to say
that, look, it is status quo it's set to slow but there's these other things that could pop up that could kind of get us back
up again, more into this 3% to 4%.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, Steve, I think that's worthy a little bit of commentary here. Let me kind of illustrate
some of the thinking. It is kind of a business as usual case that would say, look, 2014 is 4% to 5%, 2015, 2016 is 3% to
4% and we always use that three year period. And then we said, based on these assumptions which we believe will
come true, new generation requirement, and in fact the latest thinking is those generation requirements could
potentially accelerate. Remember, we're retiring a bunch of capacity in 2015 and 2016. So, we're looking at the
adequacy of that. Environmental expenditures, Southern Power, this whole notion of are we overcapitalized during this
period where we have very little construction risk. And one of the charts we showed was a debt chart that shows our
debt requirements for new money is very minimal.
So we're in this cash flow position we talked about before. So the base case is just what we foreshadowed, which was
unusual for us the last call and we're showing you now in a lot more detail, of a shaping of the earnings per share
growth. That is, 4% to 5%, 3% to 4%, 3% to 4%, and then beyond 2016 we expect it to reaccelerate, based on a host of
unknowns. There are other things we could do along the way that would improve the earnings per share growth rate.
But recall, as long as I've been around here, we've been a big EVA shop. And by that I mean, we think we create value
by the joint function of risk and return. And we are exceedingly disciplined in how we evaluate risk. So for us to
accelerate the growth in earnings per share beyond just kind of business as usual case, we would be very careful in
looking at what happens to our risk profile along the way. So there's a host of issues out there. Business as usual
depending on how the unknowns actually occur, 2017, 2018 is when the reacceleration will occur. There are things
along the way. We have ongoing discussions with the board. We talk about it and argue with each other all the time as
to other alternatives that are available to us during this period. But what we're showing you right now is our best guess
as to a business as usual evaluation.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Greg Gordon with ISI Group. Please proceed with your question.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Greg.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Good afternoon, guys. A couple of questions. Just as a follow up to Steve's question is if one of
the factors perhaps affecting the growth rate being slower than the rate of capital growth, you know, contracts or
hedges that you have at Southern Power that are rolling off? That are headwinds that sort of are net against what would
otherwise be normal growth in rate base earnings in the core businesses or is that not something that's a factor?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: It's not much of a factor. Southern Power doesn't swing us that much. You need to look at
this averaging effect that we talked about, if you take average ROE and therefore the generation of earnings per share,
it tends to moderate the discrete year-to-year differences in CapEx. That's where I thought Steve was going. So what
you see is just kind of a moderation effect. I wouldn't attach – and then when you add on what's going on with cash,
what's going on with Southern Power, a variety of other factors, that's what's causing the delta. Don't expect in any
single year a change in invested capital. You've got to average it across a couple of years anyway.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Understood.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Don't expect 4.9% to equal 4.9% and 3.6% to equal 3.6%.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Got it. Two more questions, one is, the amount of Southern Power CapEx that you've assumed
you're going to spend over the next three years is significantly lower than the placeholder you had for the last three year
rolling period.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yes, that's right.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: What's caused you to downsize that? You talked about solar and you talked about baseload, can
you extrapolate a little bit more on what you see as opportunities there and what are the milestones we should look for
to get comfortable that that capital can be deployed at a good IRR.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes, okay, so Greg that's great stuff, and actually I got to give you kudos, you actually – I
bet it was two years ago, you called this circumstance of slowing invested capital growth and therefore what happened
to earnings per share. Like I say, about two years ago you raised this issue and what we said is, we're working on it.
On one hand, if you think about a normal investment [ph] indifference (38:00) portfolio horizon, all we've done is
moved down the growth curve, down the risk curve. Our value creation, we think, is pretty consistent. Now, what we
have in there for Southern Power is based on a reasonable look and certainly part of that look involves the Southeast
United States being in a capacity oversupply situation through the rest of this decade. As you get into the 2020s, you
need to have start building into the late part of this decade in order to make sure you have capacity in place.
What we're watching right now is kind of a couple of factors, and these polar vortex issues are pretty instructive. If you
look around the United States, the United States did fine during these periods of significant load increases, but I think it
illustrates the fact that along with the effect of HAPs MACT and the retirement of a lot of capacity, it may mean that
the value of capacity is higher than what we think it is now, i.e., the equilibrium point may be closer than otherwise we
suggest. So that's thing one.
Thing two, we have also said that Southern Power has turned down business outside the Southeast. And so therefore we
have been looking closer at other opportunities; Texas, MISO, maybe certain other parts of the United States. We're
continuing that. In terms of creating placeholders for those opportunities, my sense is we've been reasonably
conservative. So you should just know that Southern Power has a great deal of interest from us, and every meeting that
we're in there with those folks, we remind them that if they can hit our tough IRR requirements, that they have all the
capital they need to grow. Capital is not a constraint here. And so, we're pushing them as hard as we should. In our
external presentation, I think we're being reasonably conservative. Said another way, there may be upside. I just don't
want to count on it.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jim von Riesemann with CRT Cap. Please proceed with your
question.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Jim.
<Q - Jim D. von Riesemann>: Hey, Tom. Hey, Art. How are you? Stay warm.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Hey, Jim.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Piece of cake.
<Q - Jim D. von Riesemann>: A piece of cake. Lot of snow down there. Couple questions, I'm confused on the bridge
between 2014 and 2013; was weather like $0.14 below normal for 2013 on a weather-normalized basis, so what am I
missing there?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yes, 2013 was down $0.14 below normal.
<Q - Jim D. von Riesemann>: Okay.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: And most of that was in the summer.
<Q - Jim D. von Riesemann>: Okay, so that -
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Versus what, $0.12? I didn't follow your question.
<Q - Jim D. von Riesemann>: So the question is, is if you were at $2.64 on your adjusted base and you're adding back
the $0.14, that would take you closer to the $2.78 range. Why am I looking at a $2.72 to $2.80 range for 2014?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: What we've done is normalized the result for our O&M spending, which really drove us
back. And when you do year-over-year versus against our plan, you get different numbers. But that's – when we look at
our plan, we were down $0.14 on weather. We were probably down about $0.06 on economic growth and offset that
basically with our cost control.
<Q - Jim D. von Riesemann>: One of the things just thinking about, on a second question, is deferred taxes and the
absence of bonus depreciation. Can you give us some guidance as to how you think that line item on the cash flow
statement is going to look going forward?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Well, we still have some bonus in 2013, probably in the $400 million range. Is it higher?
$680 million. But I was talking about 2013. 2013 was probably close to $500 million, $550 million. 2014 is expected to
be $680 million. And then beyond that there's not anymore.
<Q - Jim D. von Riesemann>: No [indiscernible] (42:49).
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: So we go back to a more normalized basis.
<Q - Jim D. von Riesemann>: And then I guess the last question, maybe this is for you Tom is, you've got a little bit
of a dividend payout ratio creep going on. When you get to that 2019, 2020 range, what kind of payout ratio are you
thinking about?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: So, it depends on a host of unknowns, but we think it's south of 75% would be my guess.
You'd be in that neighborhood. Depends on what you do. What we've indicated here is that with the ranges we're
showing you based on how the next three year period goes, I think you're in the 73% to 77% range, that's the way the

math works. To the extent – and remember as you add $0.07 a year, your growth rate is actually dwindling a bit, maybe
from 3.5% to 3%.
So, as earnings per share grows again, and we think we reaccelerate beyond the 3% to 4% to beyond 4%, our payout
ratio goes down. It just depends on what year you want to pick. But I would feel reasonably comfortable saying, of
course, host of assumptions, we're south of 75%.
<Q - Jim D. von Riesemann>: Okay so then that would include all the benefit from Kemper coming online and then
Vogtle coming online, which should be a big rate base add, right, in the latter part of the decade?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Well, we're adding rate base with CWIP remember. It's a big cash flow impact. Those are
big deals.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed with
your question.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Thank you.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hi, good afternoon.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Good afternoon. A couple of clarifications, Tom, just to go into a little bit more insight into your
outlook through 2016. I guess firstly, for 2014 you had mentioned you guys are budgeting 0.7% load growth. Are you
keeping that constant for 2015 and 2016 as well or what's embedded as far as load growth is concerned in those years?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: So, we're doing GDP growth of 2.5% to 3% kind of over that timeframe and you should
use your 50% kind of ratio in round numbers.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Okay. So some pickup.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, there'll be some pickup in 2015. We think just north of the 1% level and then maybe a
little stronger than that in 2016.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And let me just add one more thing. If you look at the momentum in the second half,
which we called, and then you see what happened in the fourth quarter, the numbers don't actually jive. In other words,
the momentum looks stronger than what we're projecting. Here again, we try to be conservative in our estimates. We're
off to a good start.
The other thing you look forward to is the headlights that are provided by our economic development. We think that if
you look at our backlog on a number of different factors, we think we're up 20% on our backlog. In other words, we're
seeing lots of good things coming into the Southeast. One interesting thing you may find is on-shoring. We're seeing
more foreign companies consolidating or adding new facilities in the Southeast. We think that's good labor force. It's
gains in efficiency of modern production facilities, and frankly cheap energy relative to other places around the world.
I've been saying for some time around the United States that if we continue on the right kind of national energy policy,
we can provide America with unassailable advantage in manufacturing, growing jobs, growing personal incomes. I
think we're starting to see some of that.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yes, Ali, let me add to that a little bit. We talked about weather-normal sales growth the last
being 0.4%, but we believe with all the rainfall, we don't normalize for rainfall. It certainly had an effect on residential
sales because the number of days above 100 – above 90 degrees last year was about one day in the third quarter. We

normally have more than 100 days. So you've got this weather normalization effect. We think we've understated real
growth here. When I look at residential class, we added 27,000 new customers last year. About 3,000 more than we
thought. On the commercial side of the house, we added 3,000 new commercial customers. We're beginning to see the
growth in those sectors as well, which is the connecting point between industrial growth, residential growth, and then
following that commercial growth.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Got it. And, Art, second question to you, and you alluded to that a bit, but off the O&M base that you
reported this year, how should we again be thinking about O&M growth? I know there's normalization to be done as
well, but can you just remind us how we should think about O&M growth off this 2013 base?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yes, it's a good question, Ali. In 2014, we estimate that O&M will grow roughly 9% or
maybe $300 million or so. About a third of that O&M is for environmental. The rest will be a return to what we call
normal operating levels that are supported by recent rate cases both in Gulf and in Georgia. Growth for 2015 and 2016,
we think, averages about 3.5% a year, 2.5% of that would be kind of normal O&M growth. And then in 2015, you'll
have to add about another 1% for operations of Kemper County. So that kind of paints the picture for you.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Absolutely. And last question, just to clarify, you know in your financing plans, you've assumed that
DOE loan guarantee comes through and you're drawing down on that, et cetera. So I'm assuming you're obviously
extremely confident you're getting it. But for whatever reason if that doesn't come through and maybe that's 1% or 2%,
if that doesn't happen, does that get replaced by additional debt or would more equity come into the picture in that
scenario?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: No, it would be pure debt. Yes, we would go to the capital markets for the debt.
<Q - Ali Agha>: I got it. Thank you.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yes, sir.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, you know what I just feel compelled to throw one more statistic out because it's
along the lines of this – questions about growth and everything else. And we talked about this a lot at the fed right now.
One of the triggers in the kind of tapering decision that's going on today is what's going on with the long term
unemployment rate. Let's recall that that rate is influenced probably too rosy, if you will, by the fact that more and
more people are leaving the workforce and it includes people that are moving from full-time to part-time. I think a real
instructive kind of statistic that we should be watching now is personal income growth. Recall also there's been this
theory that energy efficiency is driving down electricity sales. We haven't seen that as much of a factor, what we do see
as a factor are things like the cost of electricity and personal income growth. And if personal income growth is flat that
will have more of a dampening effect on sales. So remember to keep all this into account as we come up with our
forward forecast. Thank you. Operator, let's take the next question.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs Asset Management. Please
proceed with your questions.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Hey, Tom and Art, thank you for taking my questions. Embedded within your guidance
how should we think about which of your businesses, which of your regulated operating companies are earning their
authorized levels and which ones might either be under-earning or given what's in your state-by-state demand forecast,
potentially doing better than what the authorized is?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: We pretty much put the challenge on each of our companies to earn at the upper levels of
their range. Remember what we've got to do is, if you compare us against almost anybody in the United States, we do a
darn good job of earning our authorized returns, company by company. That's kind of what you see. Now, there's
always a host of factors there in terms of your ability to kind of think about weather, economic growth, O&M levels, et
cetera. But if you go back and look at history, we challenged folks to get right at the top.

<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it. And I hate to do this, and I want to stay in more the near term meaning 2014 or
2015, because I don't know if the world will change 572 times between now and 2020, so forecasting out that hard,
really hard. But in your demand forecast one interesting thing is, you had really strong industrial demand this year, I
mean up 1.5% a real positive kind of tail wind and yet in your 2014 guidance you're basically saying that's going to
slow a decent chunk. What's the driver of the slowing there?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: So Michael this is so much fun. We beat each other to death on coming up with these
estimates. And I tried to allude to this earlier. When you look at the momentum on the second half, 3.6% in the second
half, 4.8% in the fourth quarter. It looks as if we're light. All I can tell you is, we have challenged each other in very
significant ways in coming up with this. We do bottoms up. We do tops down. We bounce it against other economists.
Our estimates are a little bit lower than what the fed would say right now. Let's just say, it is reasonable and
conservative and we hope there's upside.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And one thing I'll add to that Michael is, is we get a lot of input from our customers. And
some of our very largest customers rotate production around the country at various facilities. Some of it driven by
price. Some of it driven by just location of the need of whatever material they're producing. So we're trying to make
judgments around those kind of issues as well as we prepare forecast in a reasonable band of expectation.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: And finally just real quick on Vogtle, can you – I know it's embedded within the new
generation forecast within your capital spending views or outlook, can you just give us some guidance in terms or
reiterate kind of what the CapEx on Vogtle for this three-year cycle is likely to be?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Well, hey, Michael, if I could just ask your patience there. We're going to file VCM, I guess,
9 and 10 in February. And we're going to give a great deal of illumination around those statistics when we do that. If
you want more general stuff, we can give you that, I'm sure, but we're getting ready to give a lot of detail on that.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it. I can follow up with Dan off line, happy to do that.

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Kit Konolige with BGC. Please proceed
with your question.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: Good afternoon, guys.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Kit.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: Hey. So this is a little bit of a follow up to Andy's question as well, again, sort of housekeeping.
But Art can you just walk through how the dilution adjustment works? So for taking the actual ongoing earnings from
2014 then we subtract $0.07 for future equity issuances, is that what we're doing there?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Well, that's what we have in our guidance, we've adjusted for that. And we certainly have
already reflected that in our forward looking stuff. But the math around the fully diluted assumes certain stock-option
exercises and the shares that would be issued in association with that. And that number could likely move in the future,
as you move forward. So it's kind of hard to give you, I think what we've got right now is less than a penny, but that
could change, depending on the number of options that are outstanding.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes, let's make sure. The way we read the question before, the way we answered the
question was, dilution associated with the stock options and other kind of contingent equity that sits out there. There is
the other question about the $0.07, right? And that is associated with equity underlying the commitment to maintain
financial integrity with Kemper.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: That was clear. That's what I mentioned.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: So when does – I guess what I'm asking is so if when we're looking at what you actually report,
say, in 2014, is it going to be – the guidance is that it will be in the range of $2.72 to $2.80 less some part of the $0.07,
or...
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: No. The $0.07 is completely separate. That's what I was trying to illustrate. The $0.07 is
separate.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: Right, okay.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: The other dilution we were talking about really is just associated with the exercise of
options.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: Right. Okay. That's not a big deal. All right, so what we're looking for is $2.72 to $2.80 and then
these other numbers for 2015 and 2016 that you give out here.

<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Kit, the next, I think we mentioned it in the script a little bit. The first fire to the
combustion turbine, I'm sorry, misspoke. It's really the first gasifier heat-up which we expect to be sometime in the
second quarter. And then beyond that it will be the delivery of reliable syngas to each of the combined cycles. And
those should be achieved sometime late summer, early fall.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: The other thing I just want to point out too here is just to remind everybody, if we had
perfect foresight, the cost increases we've had on Kemper were really kind of entered into the day we send it into a
fixed price agreement with only 10% of the engineering done. That was kind of 2009 and 2010. The construction of the
plant has actually gone pretty darn well. And in fact, in this latest reporting period, we think we're on budget, on
schedule on construction. And respect of the additional $40 million that really is with our best judgment, gee, whiz, we
could have done nothing and waited until a later period with more certainty. But in all of our collective wisdom and we
argued about this a lot, we decided that it was prudent to add $40 million to the contingency around cost expected
around start up. So construction's going great. We'll know more about start up as you get into the June and beyond
timeframe.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Dan.
<Q - Daniel Eggers>: Good afternoon, guys. Hey, just with your power demand looking pretty enormously high so far
this quarter, I was kind of wondering what the fleet dispatch has been, how the plant's been performing and you know
with the run in gas, do you guys see a lot more coal burn coming this year just as you try to recalibrate the fleet a little
bit?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Fascinating stuff. So let me give you the first good answer is the system's running great.
We're very happy with our reliability. In fact, I think we noted our wires reliability is the best in history. So that's great.
The thing that's interesting is, is there a change in the equilibrium point? You know, we've been saying that that may
have pushed off at least in the Southeast early 2020s. With all these spikes associated with the polar vortex, I mean we
actually – we're loaded up pretty well. All of our units that could run were running. So the suggestion is perhaps there
is an acceleration of the value of capacity, at least in the Southeast. The other thing that's fascinating about this, I
commented on it a bit in both CNBC and Bloomberg this morning, there's this whole notion of the dash to gas in the
United States, frankly it's been a big story at Southern Company. We now are the second or third largest gas consumer
in the United States. We made a big shift away from coal to gas. You all have heard, and I've written and spoken about
five points to be cautious about natural gas. The polar vortex has told us that at least point number two is absolutely
true and that is the need for infrastructure. The new gas is in a place that is different than the old gas. And all of a
sudden we find the need to build more pipes, make sure the critical service providers have FT, firm transportation, in
those pipes. And we've got to make sure that we have adequate storage. Now, we have secured all the FT we need for
our business. And we have seen prices $4.50 per million BTU, and I guess they spiked up a little bit. In fact I saw
something before we got on the call that maybe they were in the high $4s to $5. And it's been since 2010 since we hit
numbers like that. In fact, some people were saying that we wouldn't hit $5 again for the rest of our lifetimes. Okay. If
you live at the end of the pipe, particularly you folks in the Northeast, if you don't have sufficient infrastructure, if you
don't have FT, if you don't have sufficient storage, we've seen a blowout in some of those prices up to $130 per million
BTU. One of the suggestions is that the beta of the energy supply of the United States is increasing, as a result of the
push to gas. We've been saying that. It's true. So one of the things you've got to think about is, what is the
infrastructure, what is the availability of FT to assets all over the U.S., and how do we think about storage in this new
environment. How do we think about industrial capacity in this new environment? Big deal. Overall the system is

performing great. At least for Southern, reliability looks good, for the years to come. The only question with us is, what
happens to the equilibrium point?
<Q - Daniel Eggers>: The dispatch on the non-PRB coal plants has been pretty low for a while now. You add that
$4.50, $5 gas number, do you see those plants running a bit more this summer, just with being helpful of gas
inventories down in the region?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: So if you see gas in the – I'm sorry, if you see gas in the $5 to $6 range, you're going to
start running probably your Illinois Basin plants first and then your Central App plants after that. But that's kind of the
range. PRB gas in the $3 to $4, Central App and then Illinois Basin $5 to $6, with Illinois Basin being ahead of that.
The other factor, I just kept coal prices constant. We've seen coal prices come down a bit. The other impact that hit us
last year was the abundance of hydro. So interesting stuff. All this is a little bit influx. Recall again, Southern is
uniquely positioned and that we have huge optionality among – between gas and coal. We can swing gas from I think
it's 35% of energy to 55% of energy, and we can swing coal 25% to 45%. So we'll be able to deliver the best package
we think of energy to our customers based on our diverse portfolio.
<Q - Daniel Eggers>: And I guess the other question, I went back and looked at the fourth quarter presentation from
last year. And the CapEx numbers you guys have for 2014 and 2015 this year are higher than what you guys had a year
ago. And the growth rate was kind of that 4% to 6% range instead of the new numbers now. Is there some deterioration
in earned ROEs or what bridges that gap because I don't know that I saw all that step-down if I put all those numbers
into the model?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, Dan, this is Art. This is probably Kemper. You know, we've written off estimated
probable losses, but we're still having to invest that capital. So that's showing up in the CapEx numbers in 2014.
<Q - Daniel Eggers>: So that's not captured in the $0.07 recalibration? [indiscernible] (65:47) the baseline was and the
growth would be from there?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: It's in the $0.07 recalibration, but it's also in the CapEx.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes.

<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Turn down your radio, Jonathan.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: CA20, I think you've now said, you're hoping to get that in place in February before you
have been saying Q4. Is there enough wiggle in the schedule to mean that that doesn't matter very much or...?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Jonathan, we try to be – let me take exception with that just a little. We try to be very
careful in that, we want to get assembly by year end and we hit it by – we missed it by five days or whatever it was. So,
we assembled by year end in our view. That was much more important. Us moving it into the hole, we've got plenty of
slack time around that. You should not consider moving that as critical path.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Okay. So, what are sort of the next critical path items we should be watching that you're
going to point us to?

<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Jonathan, if you look at the slides, there's that diagram we showed you, there's a CA01
module that goes inside the containment vessel. That would probably be the next item on the critical path list. But
remember that these things, as we move in and out these things kind of change places in critical path. But that is the
next item, big item on critical path.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And that's kind of a third quarter event.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Okay. So most of the sort of progress to this picture on the slide is more back end of the
year?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Well, it's progress throughout the year, but CA01 is in the [indiscernible] (67:59).
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah. In terms of placement in there. So if you kind of look at that picture, you see CA01
is a great big thing and it's got lots of panels and it's kind of complex walls and all that. That will be going on in the
module assembly building. So there will be all sorts of progress throughout the year. Just as there was on CA20.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Okay.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And we believe we'll be able to hit it. The placing of it is almost less important than the
assembly of it.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Okay. That's great. Thank you for the update. And then on – Tom, with this kind of period
of I guess either more conservative outlook or flatter growth, does it change your calculus and interest level in M&A at
all? Can you just talk to your latest thoughts there?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, sure. And remember, again, we're very kind of analytical in terms of how we think
about value creation. Value is a function of risk and return. And you know, I grew up in a period where we decided that
growth was the end-all to end-all. And we chased growth and really I don't think did an effective job of evaluating risk.
If you grow risk faster than you grow growth, then you destroy value. What you've seen with Southern Company, and
especially, we talked last year about getting all of this regulatory wood chopping behind us, we've done that, I think, in
an exemplary manner in 2013. So here's the deal, as that financial pressure associated with the big CapEx plans start to
go away, our risk starts to go down. All we're doing is moving along the risk return curve. We think our value creation
aspects are terrific through this period.
Now we always want to test the business as usual case. And that's where I got long-winded earlier in the call. We can
look at more opportunities at Southern Power. We can evaluate other opportunities we might have to build new
generation, to build out our environmental program requirements. We can look at other opportunities as we are
essentially bound to do as a fiduciary, including M&A. But remember what we say about M&A. In my opinion, the
whole work around mergers and acquisitions is a how, not a what. The what is what it results for us in terms of the
portfolio outcomes on risk and return. The how could be buying assets, building assets, or buying corporate entities.
So, I don't view M&A as a what, I view it as a how. It is a means to achieve something else. We're going to be very
disciplined as we always have been about looking at what happens to the total value creation profile of Southern. The
base case – and in fact we're showing you a lot more clarity in this call than any time in my memory. The reason for
that is we have a great deal of confidence in it. Can we improve it? We're going to work like crazy to see if we can. But
we will not chase growth at the expense of increasing risk so that it destroys value ultimately.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Okay. Thank you, Tom. Can I, one other quick thing?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Sure, absolutely, yeah.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Somewhere back – think this is a little dated now, but the last thing I remember you
giving a range of like $1.75 to $1.90 for earnings out of Southern Power for 2014.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: That's correct.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Is that still a good number for this year?

<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: It's gone down a little bit for a variety of reasons. We would say over this timeframe $1.45
to $1.75. And you say, well what happened there? Well, a couple of moving pieces. One is that the energy margins
have essentially gone down with the rise in gas prices. Interestingly, for us anyway, gas prices have almost tripled.
Remember everybody said it wasn't volatile. Well, it's gone from, I don't know, a $1.85 per million BTU at one time to
now this \ $4.50 to $5 per million BTU. I don't know where it sustains after the polar vortex withdraws. So gas prices
have gone up. Largely our business at Southern Power is largely gas fired. And so therefore, as gas prices go up, coal
prices come down. The pool interchange rate changes and our margins decrease a bit, number one.
Number two, the pace of the economy has slowed based on prior projections. Now, you look at the evidence in fourth
quarter of 2013 and you say, boy, that looks awfully bullish, you look at our economic development stuff; that looks
awfully bullish. The numbers we're showing you I think are reasonably conservative and prudent. So what's the
potential for economic growth beyond what we see? I don't know.
The third, I guess, would be just what's the opportunity for Southern Power to deploy more assets, and will they be
tax-oriented assets like solar to give you the big non-sustainable, though, pops in investment tax credit and net income
or will they be of the nature that give you more of the sustainable earnings picture of baseload generation normally
associated with natural gas. It's all those factors.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Is it fair to say that the earnings projections you've given us for 2014 through 2016 assume
something flattish within that lower range you just spoke to. [indiscernible] (73:54).
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: $1.45 to $1.75 is a decent range.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Through the whole period?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: So things of that kind of potential upside?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes and lots of uncertainty around that.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: All right. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Anthony Crowdell at Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Anthony C. Crowdell>: Good afternoon, Tom.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Good afternoon, Anthony. Hey.
<Q - Anthony C. Crowdell>: Just hopefully two quick ones. One is just housekeeping, really. The dilution from
Kemper, you have minus $0.07. Just how do you calculate that and is there a potential for any more equity in 2014 I
guess maybe dependent upon write-offs of Kemper?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Well, we certainly are very confident in the cost estimates that we put out, but there are risks
as we move through start up and as we finish construction, and we have outlined those pretty clearly. But when you
think about the $0.07, we're issuing about $1.3 billion in total equity. That's really a little bit more than what we need
for Kemper. And what we're really targeting here is a common equity ratio somewhere in the neighborhood of 43.5%,
44%. So we've got a little bit of cushion there. But, again, this is the commitment we made to patch the hole around the
write-offs, so we do have a little cushion as we move forward in time and that's what the $0.07 reflects.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: You know, there's this other discussion we're in now that to my memory we haven't been
in, in, gosh, decades, I don't know. But when you think about it, we did thicken up our equity ratio in anticipation of a

really ambitious construction program that now appears to be finishing up. When you look at our new debt
requirements, they're really modest. So you have all these interesting questions about how do you think about new
equity over time.
On prior calls I've talked about a cash flow posture during some years that could cause us to repurchase equity. It seems
to us it would make more sense not to issue and then not to have to repurchase than issuing and repurchasing over time.
So there's all kinds of shaping about what we're going to do about new sales of equity. Are we overcapitalized for this
exceedingly low business risk environment we appear to be moving into. And then you have the wildcard of Southern
Power and what else may be there in terms of any scale of purchases. And let me remind you all, if we have the
opportunities to invest in value creating ways with Southern Power we will do it. And we will do it even beyond the
placeholders if those opportunities arise.
<Q - Anthony C. Crowdell>: Just if I could jump in, lastly, when you talk about maybe post 2016 and you want to – I
think the term you're using is reaccelerate growth, I mean is the target what you set out maybe two, three years ago of
5% to 7% or is the target 4% to 6%? I mean what is management shooting for, this reacceleration?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Well, we've really argued about what to say about this one. And you know that you're
dealing with a conservative company. So I hope you'll accept this one. All we want to say is we accelerate beyond 4%.
Don't know what the number's going to be. Let's see when we get there. There's a host of variables involved. We think
it'll be better than what we see in 2015 and 2016.

<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Yeah.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hang on just a second. In August of – oh, I'm sorry. The average number of shares for
2014 is almost 900 million shares. The average number of shares in 2014 is about 900 million.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: And you said no new equity at all in 2015 and 2016 including drifts in employee type
programs, is that correct?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: That's correct. Based on all these assumptions in Southern Power and everything else,
that's right.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: And is that kind of linked with your view that you're going to be overcapitalized for a while or
in a while?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: The overcapitalized statement – and remember what we always want to do with that is to
preserve our financial integrity and bond rating. Really goes to kind of how new investment opportunities develop and
kind of the post 2016 timeframe. You know, when we finish Vogtle, certainly as we get to the end of Vogtle, this whole
profile changes completely. Our view is that layering up of equity heading into the big construction program really –
recall in 2008, these guys remind me, we were about 40.5% equity ratio. In 2013 we're 44%. That was heading into, so
we built up the equity ratio during this construction period. Now we're getting down of it. We have not reflected in any
earnings per share estimates we're giving you. We're giving you business as usual. We have not reflected any
de-layering of the equity ratio in any of our estimates. So that would represent upside, but recall we want to make sure
that we're able to preserve our financial integrity position during this timeframe.

<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hi Michael.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Hey, Tom, how are you doing?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Good.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: I apologize if this was already asked before, but just wanted to confirm about it, the
placeholder CapEx you guys have for Southern Power, $1.4 billion, how much of that is solar, can you break it out a
little more like how much of it is thermal quantified, is it all in Georgia?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: No, listen, we're not that fine about it. So we don't have a breakout for you. Listen, we've
been chasing lots of different projects. I can tell you that we've been chasing some that are thermal and we've been
looking at some that are solar. And it seems like you can do as much as you want to all over the place. The real
challenge for us is what makes sense in the portfolio and what is at the end of the day the best value accreting strategy
for shareholders, but we can't give you a breakout in placeholders.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Have you guys talked at all about the prudency review at Kemper? Is that something that
you can make a comment on?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: No, we haven't. We expect that to occur, what in, June, later this spring. May, June.

<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: And we certainly don't want to front run that process. We don't want to front run the
regulator. I mean I can just tell you my opinion when I look at kind of how the construction has unfolded; I think these
guys have done a terrific job.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: And you said before that the delay of CA20 is really not a big deal, right, the movement of
it on site?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: What you got to understand is, one of the ways that we mitigated some of the problems in
the facility that CBI has in Louisiana, was to get product out of there, put it on site and essentially you have a CBI
facility on site now that holds those pieces of equipment, pieces of metal. And then what we do is we have an army of
people on site, both Southern and CBI, Westinghouse, whatever we need, in order to complete the nuclear quality
documentation, before we put those panels up on the CA20 facility. So the real timing factor was to get it assembled.
Now that we've got it assembled there's lots of workarounds and things we can do that take, frankly, the setting of
CA20 in the nuclear island away from the critical path. That activity is not critical path. So we're focused now on
assembly of CA01.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: In fact on that subject, critical path means clearing out Lake Charles the assembly facility,
right, so are you guys happy with the way that things have improved there or...?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Well, we've said this a million times. Look. In any project of this magnitude, there are
always challenges. Your measure of success is not that you have challenges; it's how you work around them. And I
think especially since Philip Asherman and his CBI cohorts have come into play here since they took over Shaw, the
performance, responsiveness, the constructive attitude has gotten better. So we're not depending now solely on the
Louisiana facility. We're moving the fabrication to different points in the United States. maybe shipyards, Oregon even
a couple of facilities – couple of the CA20 modules in IHI in Japan. So what we're doing is we look for what is
practical, what is reasonable from an economic and timing standpoint, and we find the best solutions, and that's what
we've done.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: And just one last question, you said that there were disagreements when you were talking
on the economic roundtable and trying to figure out what the economic growth rate should be and what you should be
assuming and you came out with conservative numbers. I'm just wondering what kind of disagreements did you have?
What were the biggest disagreements over there?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: I think the economic roundtable really didn't have disagreements there. They were
different numbers. I think the lowest number that was out of the group was like 2.25%. The tallest number was around
3%. So we're right in the heart of that range.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: I think he's referring to the disagreements we had. I mean Southern Company had.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Tom made it sound like it was a very tough and arduous process. Just wondering what...?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: It always is. You wouldn't believe how much we prepare for these calls to get the right stuff.
Ultimately when we give you stuff, when we give you an estimate, it is everybody's collective wisdom, their best
judgments and it's after a good food fight. I mean I'll just tell you, I look at the numbers sometimes and I go, wait you
grew 3.6% in the second half, 4.8% in the fourth quarter and you're projecting, what, 1.1% for the year, why is that?
And we go through a giant fight. I mean we just do. What we're providing you is our best judgment, I think. We are
conservative. We don't try and push the numbers in order to achieve a result.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Thank you very much.

<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hello, Mark.
<Q - Mark Barnett>: Good afternoon, guys.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Good afternoon.
<Q - Mark Barnett>: Yes, a lot of questions on some of the specifics and kind of long-term plan, but just curious
maybe to shift to the end of the call towards some of the policy issues that we're facing over the next couple of years,
and there's been a lot of, I wouldn't want to say controversy, but just kind of discussion around the numbers that the
EPA has used to justify the cost analysis that they present with the new source, with the carbon the proposed stuff that
went in, in January. I'm wondering, one of your projects obviously at Kemper is one of the benchmarks that they use,
but obviously with the new engineering and some of the changes in the projects since you initiated, I'm just wondering,
how do you think that those estimates they use and the justification based on those, does that really turn into a strongly
defensible rule, because of course this is going to get challenged and just some thoughts around that, I guess.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Well, rather than give you a legal opinion at this point, I'll just talk about the suitability of
using Plant Ratcliffe in Kemper County. I met with Gina McCarthy and her whole staff along with some other CEOs in
the industry and I told this to her. I've said it on TV. The characteristics of Kemper County are such that they are
reasonably unique to that site. In other words, it's mine mouth lignite. It's our specific technology. It is the ability in an
economic way to do enhanced oil recovery. When you set a standard, you should use a set of circumstances that are
applicable to a broad range of the United States. We don't believe that that is those conditions and as unique as they
may be there, are applicable in a broad sense. So it's that argument first. The second one would go to just kind of is it
commercial? Is it adequately demonstrated, and I would argue, it's hard to find out why you would believe it would be
commercial and demonstrable in a broad sense. Southern Company is probably the leader right now in the United
States in looking at carbon capture technology. Not only are we doing it on a pre-combustion basis at Kemper County,
we are doing it, have done a successful test post combustion at Plant Barry, and we've had a very good outcome there. I
tend to believe the pre-combustion when you have a very concentrated set of gases moving along a process is a more
efficient way to do it than on a post-combustion where all the gases are diffused. But still are we going to be able to
deploy that technology broadly and in a commercial way across the United States, I think those are the hearts of the
question.
<Q - Mark Barnett>: Great. Appreciate it.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: You bet.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Vedula Murti with CDP Cap. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Vedula Murti>: Good afternoon.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Vedula, how are you?
<Q - Vedula Murti>: I'm doing well. Thank you. When you think about the reacceleration possibilities up post 2016,
you referenced very specifically the fact that the balance sheet could be over equitized following the, mostly the
completion of Vogtle, is the whole reacceleration simply tied to letting the equity ratio move back down to 2008 level
that you mentioned or is there something beyond just the re-tweaking of the capital structure that would allow, that
would allow for a higher growth rate at that point?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Oh, heavens no. I would argue that's almost last in the list of potentials. We know,
Vedula, that we're going to have new generation. We know that there're going to be requirements associated with
environmental CapEx. We're watching very closely as with the data we provided to you today what's going to happen
with the economy and recall there's a set of generation that's retiring as a result of the HAPs MACT rule or what's now
called MATS. The confluence of those factors may have some sense of what happens to the equilibrium point of supply

and demand in the next few years. All of those factors are the primary factors. In other words, you'll see this
reacceleration of CapEx. That's the primary factor. Frankly, this thinking about our capitalization really I think has
followed behind the primary facts. We'll just see how all that goes. Those are kind of interdependent, right? In other
words, if you accelerate CapEx, you may need more equity. So the capitalization discussion is a temporal issue.
<Q - Vedula Murti>: Okay. Thank you very much.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Good afternoon guys.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Good afternoon, Paul.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: How are you doing?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Dynamite. Hope you're well.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: I'm managing. Just want to check a few quick things, 2.5% to 3%, that's a national GDP figure,
right, not some regional figure; is that correct?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: That's correct.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. When we look at the 0.7% growth in 2014, I think Ali was asking about this, but I just
want to make sure I understand it, that seems a lot less than 0.5% of GDP. So what's going on there and I think you
guys then see it going back up, if you could just refresh – just sort of help me out there what that is?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Well, I think it goes kind of what Tom mentioned a few moments ago, is we try to put out a
credible forecast that we can rely on. The sticking to a specific ratio to GDP is influenced by a lot of factors, a lot on
the industrial side. I said before, we get a lot of input from our customers, our large customers as to what their outlooks
are for the coming year, and so we have to factor those things in. These are more known [ph] quantibles (83:02) than
just drawing a line on a curve and trying to make an estimate. We have not seen great growth in residential and
commercial over the last four years. So we're very cognizant of the fact that that's true and we're trying to make a
measured approach towards getting the economy back to a full measure and we think that once that occurs then you're
going to have more cylinders working around that ratio of 50% to GDP.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And we are covering some territory that we covered before but maybe in a more concise
way. I agree with you, the industrial numbers look weird. You're going from this big period of growth to something
that's more moderate. But that's what we're projecting? The other one to keep your eye on is just this whole residential
sector. I think the effects you're seeing now are personal income growth has been relatively flat. The growth in jobs has
not been necessarily in manufacturing. The good news for manufacturing is they're more efficient, i.e., less people as
input to the output they produce, therefore they're going to be more sustainable in the long run, but the manufacturing
jobs are the ones that are higher paying, therefore the increase in jobs in Southeast have been more service industry.
There is a shift as a result of a lot of external factors, including the Affordable Care Act to move people or at least to
inhibit companies from adding full-time employees, shifting, rather, to part time employees. So, even though they're
counted in the workforce, they're earning less. And then there are people leaving the workforce. So you get all that kind
of thing going on. The other thing is, perhaps a consequence of the housing bubble. You know, at one time, 70% of our
residential sales came from single-family housing. Now it looks like perhaps it's a function of personal income growth,
perhaps it's a function of banks tightening lending requirements. That 70% may be more like 62% with the delta
showing an increase in multi-family. So it's all those factors?

<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. If for some reason we don't see sales growth or – could you give us a flavor for what's
the sensitivity is around sales growth. So if we don't get – I guess you guys were saying, 1% to 1.5% I think you guys
were talking about, if you get let's say, just if you get a rule of thumb for every 50 basis points of sales growth, how
should we think about that in terms of earnings or can you guys do other things, how dependent are you on sales
growth I guess in terms of meeting your longer-term EPS forecast that you have?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: I'm going to let Art give you the heuristic. I'll give you the other answer. Look, over the
past two years, we've lost $500 million in revenue as associated with weather or slower-than-expected economic
growth, and we've made it all up with O&M. In 2013 those numbers were just under $300 million, lost revenue,
reduced expense. And at the same time we had reduced expense, we had some of the best reliability and customer
satisfaction we've ever had. Art, the heuristic.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Paul, the heuristic on say a 1% change in retail sales equal across all classes is about $82
million pre-tax and we talk about cost control, or cost flexibility and that would represent less than 2% of non-fuel
O&M. So that goes towards some of the mitigations we have around the sensitivity on sales.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: I can't stress it enough and I got to thank the thousands of employees that make thousands
of good decisions every day, the folks at Southern Company know how to run the utility business in an optimal way
and have reliability and serve customers and be safe. And they do a heck of a job of it. We're able to demonstrate
year-in and year-out that we can meet the needs of shareholders and deliver earnings targets, part of that litany I gave
you in the script. And do it exceedingly well and run the business well.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay, so If I hear you correctly, if I understand correctly, if the sales growth doesn't – if it
doesn't work out as well, you guys still have other levers that you can use that you believe in terms of making these
numbers and – because I mean just in general as you know we're seeing a fall-off in a lot of areas around the country.
So we're just trying to figure it out.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: We see the same thing. I sit on fed board and I see all this stuff, too, but you know what,
these results in the Southeast were awfully gratifying in the fourth quarter.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay, I appreciate the help. Thanks a lot and have a good one.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes, sir. Thank you.

Thank you. And our final question is from the line of Greg Gordon with ISI group, a follow-up question. Please
proceed.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: They've answered all the questions. I'm good. Thanks.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Thanks, Greg.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Thanks, Greg.

Thank you. Sir, that was our final question. Are there any closing remarks?
Thomas A. Fanning
Yeah, just very briefly, number one, let me thank you all for staying with us on this rather lengthy call, but it's an
important one. You know, this is a little bit of an inflection point in our growth rates, in our risk profile and a variety of

other things. Interestingly, when you look at the regulatory work that we had to accomplish last year, when you look at
the major projects that were in front of us, my sense is, absent what happened at Plant Ratcliffe, Kemper County, this
company deserves an A-plus. I think they've come through those regulatory processes terrific. The progress on Vogtle
is terrific. And I think we're positioned well for years to come. It will be fascinating to see how we continue to deliver
value to shareholders. Please rest assured that is our primary focus. Thank you very much for your attendance on this
call. And we'll talk with you soon.
