Dr. Paul E. Jacobs
Thanks, Warren, and good afternoon, everyone.
We're pleased to report another strong quarter with record revenues up 24% versus a year ago, driven by broad-based
demand for smartphones and strong semiconductor volumes. In recognition of our strong financial position and the
continued growth in our business, we recently announced a 40% increase in our dividend and a new $5 billion share
repurchase authorization.
In QCT we continue to drive technology and product leadership, saw the first product announcements by our customers
on our new Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 and 800 processors, we launched our new Qualcomm RF360 Front End
Solution, and we extended our support of the industry's widest range of operating systems to include Mozilla's
web-based Firefox OS and innovations such as Facebook Home. Qualcomm is now ranked by revenues as the
third-largest semiconductor provider in the world, up from sixth last year and ninth the year before, according to IHS.
Turning to QTL, total reported device sales came in towards the high end of our prior guidance range, reflecting
continued global adoption of smartphones, particularly in emerging regions. This marks another record quarter of total
reported device sales and QTL revenues. We also continued to grow our licensee base and now have over 230 CDMA
licensees and more than 50 single-mode OFDMA licensees.
Looking forward, we believe our long-term growth drivers remain intact and are increasing our calendar year 2013
3G/4G device forecast in line with this view. Smartphone adoption continues at a rapid pace. Gartner estimates that
approximately 700 million smartphones were sold in calendar 2012, up 44% year-over-year. Further, they estimate that
in 2017, more than 1.7 billion smartphones will be sold, representing an approximate 20% compound annual growth
rate versus a 2012 base.
Smartphones become more than just a technology product, empowering people to connect and interact with the world
like never before and we're working to deliver continuous improvements to this user experience through our
investments in industry-leading innovations in smartphone technologies including the CPU, the GPU, multimedia
subsystem, sensors, displays, connectivity, and of course, last but not least, the modem.
Emerging regions are experiencing the fastest growth for 3G as 3G networks mature and the breadth of affordable
smartphones expand. Wireless Intelligence reports that at the end of the first calendar quarter of 2013, 3G connections
including CDMA 1X in emerging regions increased 34% year-over-year to approximately 1.1 billion. According to
analysts, 3G connections are now more than three times the number of fixed Internet connections in emerging regions,
making Mobile the leading and, in some cases, the only platform for computing and internet access.
Let's take China as an example. Wireless Intelligence reports that there are now more than 1.1 billion wireless
connections, of which only approximately one-third are 3G, including 1X. There's a large remaining opportunity as
consumers migrate from 2G to 3G and 3G/4G multi-mode. SINO-MR reports that more than six times the number of
sub- 1,000 RMB smartphone models were launched in 2012 versus 2011. By the way, 1,000 RMB is approximately
$160.00 U.S.
All three carriers in China reported increased data traffic and revenue, with China Telecom reporting a 47%
year-over-year increase in data revenue for 2012. And beyond the phone, it's important to remember that we're pursuing
multiple incremental growth opportunities, including mobile computing and what we refer to as the Internet of

Everything. We're still in the early stages of mobile computing, but we believe the fundamental benefits of always on,
always connected and sleek form factors will create a more compelling user experience than traditional computing
devices. We're encouraged to see a diverse set of vendors experiment with different form factors and multiple operating
systems as they look to address the evolving computing environment.
Further, as it relates to the Internet of Everything, we're leveraging our core technologies to support a range of
applications for a diverse set of vertical industries such as Automotive, Smart Energy, Security, Healthcare, and the
Connected Home.
As an example of momentum in that space, General Motors recently announced intent to put LTE connectivity into its
entire fleet of 2015 Buicks, Cadillacs, Chevrolets and GMCs, and that's following similar announcements from BMW
and Audi.
We're investing in a variety of solutions to help meet the rapidly increasing data traffic demands that these
opportunities are creating. We refer to this as the 1000x data challenge, and we're making good progress with
technology such as carrier aggregation, LTE broadcast, and new small cell deployment models.
Further advances in 3G network technology such as HSPA+ and new overlay LTE networks are being deployed at
significant rates and, according to the GSA, there are now over 160 commercial LTE networks globally. China Mobile
announced plans to expand its LTE TDD trial network to include 200,000 base stations by the end of 2013, and
Snapdragon and Gobi-enabled LTE TDD devices are starting to achieve China Mobile's network certification.
As you obviously know, George Davis has joined Qualcomm as our Chief Financial Officer and I'd like to welcome
him to his first Qualcomm earnings call. We're off to a great start. I'm looking forward to working with George in the
months and years to come.
So to conclude, we've just completed another strong quarter at Qualcomm and we're pleased to be increasing our fiscal
2013 guidance. We're continuing to execute against our strategic priorities and look forward to addressing the growing
set of opportunities ahead.
Thank you and I'll now turn the call over to Steve Mollenkopf.
Steven M. Mollenkopf
Thank you, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone.
Our QCT business had another excellent quarter with revenues and earnings before tax increasing 28% and 14%
year-over-year, respectively. We shipped 173 million MSM chipsets, up 14% year-over-year and at the high end of our
prior guidance range, reflecting strong demand across our portfolio, including our Qualcomm Reference Design
solutions.
Looking forward, we are expecting another record year for QCT, growing revenue and earnings before tax on a strong
double-digit basis year-over-year. This growth is in excess of the rate of growth of estimated industry 3G/4G device
unit shipments and the year-over-year percentage increase of our expected operating expenses.
Further, the year is unfolding better than we initially expected and we are successfully increasing our share and our
share of content in devices. This strategy is delivering strong revenue and per-unit dollar margin growth year-over-year,
albeit with downward pressure on the QCT gross margin on a percentage basis, as expected.
In total, we are pleased to be raising the company guidance, in large part due to the strength of our chip business.
Flagship devices announced this quarter that contain our chipsets include the Samsung Galaxy S4, the HTC One, the
LG Optimus G Pro, the BlackBerry Z10 and the Sony Xperia Z smartphone and tablet. Our strategy of pursuing a
diversified customer base including all the major OEMs and across all major operating systems uniquely positions us
within the industry.

We also continue to grow devices targeted at mass market prices and emerging regions. Our Qualcomm Reference
Design program continues to build momentum with OEMs now shipping handsets based on our MSM8x25Q quad-core
chipset. And a developing pipeline for our LTE chipsets, which will support the anticipated roll out of LTE in China.
In total there are now more than 850 Snapdragon-enabled devices launched or announced including approximately 200
devices based on our Qualcomm Reference Designs. The pipeline of future Snapdragon-enabled devices also continues
to grow and there are more than 475 additional Snapdragon-enabled designs in development. Devices based on the
Snapdragon 600 chipsets are launching now and we expect commercial devices based on the Snapdragon 800 chipset to
launch on schedule in the middle of this year.
Carrier requirements to support the demand for growing network capacity will increase the complexity and
requirements for modem and connectivity technology and represent a sizable opportunity that aligns with our key
strengths. Our family of 3G/4G multimode chipsets leads the competition in mode and band support as well as the
integration of the latest Wi-Fi 802.11ac. We are already on our third-generation of LTE modems and with the
MDM9x25 and Snapdragon 800 chipsets while others are still working on their first generation.
This quarter we announced our new Qualcomm RF360 product, which addresses the next challenge with global LTE,
OEM SKU proliferation coming from RF complexity and LTE band fragmentation. We continue to execute on the
strategy which we outlined for you in the past. We innovate across multiple technology vectors: CPU, graphics, modem
and connectivity; optimize the design point for the unique requirements of mobile; integrate these technologies into a
tiered chipset roadmap and deliver these chipsets at scale across multiple customers and OSs.
These technology investments enable superior performance, lower power consumption, faster time-to-market and
continually raise the bar for competition. The success of this strategy is reflected in our growing share and the many
OEM flagship devices already announced based on the Snapdragon 600 chipset and the increasing device pipeline of
more than 200 Snapdragon 600 and 800 chipset enabled devices. We believe it continues to position us well in the
smartphone space but also in the growing opportunities of mobile computing, the Internet of Everything and the
connected home.
That concludes my remarks, and I will now turn the call over to George Davis.
George S. Davis
Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. I am delighted to have joined the Qualcomm team and look forward
to working closely with the investor and analyst community in my new role.
We're pleased to be reporting strong financial results today and to be increasing our financial outlook for fiscal 2013.
Fiscal second quarter revenues were a record $6.1 billion, up 24% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. Non-GAAP
operating income of $2.2 billion was up 18% year-over-year and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.17 was up 16%
year-over-year. Sequentially non-GAAP earnings per share were down $0.09 reflecting seasonally lower QCT
shipments and higher operating expenses partially offset by 17% revenue growth in QTL.
As a reminder, this quarter reflects two very different seasonal periods for our main business segment. For QCT our
March quarter is a period of seasonally lower demand following the retail intensive December quarter. Because QTL
records royalty on subscriber device sales on a quarter lag, our fiscal second quarter results for QTL reflect the strong
demand period of the December quarter.
QTL reported strong growth in 3G/4G device shipments by its licensees driven particularly by smartphones in both
developed and emerging regions. Total reported device sales rose to a record $61.1 billion, up 15% sequentially and
18% year-over-year. Devices shipped by our licensees in the December quarter were estimated at 279 million to 283
million units with an estimated average selling price of $214 to $220.
QCT shipped 173 million MSM chips at the high end of our prior guidance range, driven by strong demand across our
portfolio, including QRD chipsets for emerging accounts. Revenue per MSM was relatively flat sequentially and QCT

operating margin was in line with expectations at approximately 17%.
Non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses grew 14% sequentially exceeding the high end of expectations due to
increased patent, legal and employee-related expenses in the quarter.
Operating cash flow was strong at $2.2 billion, up 17% year-over-year and 36% of revenues. During the quarter we
returned $431 million of cash dividends to stockholders.
Let me now spend a few minutes on our outlook for the fiscal year and our fiscal third quarter. We are raising our
guidance for fiscal 2013. We now estimate our fiscal 2013 revenues will be approximately $24 billion to $25 billion, up
28% year-over-year at the midpoint and up $600 million from our previous guidance. We estimate our fiscal 2013
non-GAAP earnings per share will be between $4.40 and $4.55, up approximately 21% year-over-year at the midpoint
and up $0.13 relative to the midpoint of our previous guidance.
Our fiscal 2013 operating margin percentage estimates for QCT and QTL are unchanged. We expect combined
non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses for fiscal 2013 to grow approximately 21% to 23% year-over-year. This is a
modest increase over our prior estimate, primarily due to increased patent and legal expenses and variable employee
costs.
Let me spend a moment on calendar year 3G/4G device estimates and fiscal year device ASPs. As a baseline, we have
updated our estimate of 3G/4G devices shipped in calendar year 2012 upward to a range of 928 million to 945 million
devices. This represents an increase of approximately 18% year-over-year at the midpoint. This is somewhat higher
than our prior estimate led by emerging region demand and provides a strong base for the growth we expect in calendar
2013. For calendar year 2013, 3G/4G device shipments, we now estimate between 1.015 billion and 1.085 billion
devices will be shipped by our licensees, driven by strong global smartphone demand.
At the midpoint of our calendar 2013 guidance and the revised calendar 2012 range, we estimate 3G/4G device growth
will be 12% year-over-year. We estimate that the average selling price of 3G/4G devices for fiscal 2013 will be
between $216 and $224, consistent with the midpoint of our prior forecast. We estimate our non-GAAP annual tax rate
to be approximately 17% to 18% for fiscal 2013, consistent with our prior expectations.
Now turning to the third quarter of fiscal 2013, we estimate revenues will be in the range of approximately $5.8 billion
to $6.3 billion, up approximately 31% year-over-year at the midpoint. We estimate non-GAAP earnings per share for
the third fiscal quarter to be between $0.97 and $1.05, up approximately 19% year-over-year at the midpoint.
We anticipate that fiscal third quarter non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses will increase sequentially
approximately 2% to 4%. In QTL we estimate that our subscriber licensees will report total reported device sales of
approximately $51 billion to $56 billion in the June quarter for shipments made in the March quarter. At the midpoint
of that range we expect total reported device sales to be up approximately 12% year-over-year and down approximately
12% sequentially reflecting post-holiday seasonality.
In QCT we expect to ship between 163 million and 173 million MSM chipsets during the June quarter. We expect a
stronger mix of chipsets targeted for high tier smartphones to drive revenue per MSM higher resulting in sequential
QCT revenue growth of more than 5% despite the reduction in expected volumes. We expect QCT operating margin
percentage to be relatively flat quarter over quarter at approximately 17%.
That concludes my comments, and we'll now turn the call back to Warren.

[Operator Instructions] Mike Walkley from Canaccord Genuity, please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Mike Walkley>: Thank you very much. I was wondering if you could discuss the ASP trends for the total device
market. It seems there was a lack of high-end product introductions during the March quarter, but there's a lot of the
high-end flagship devices ramping into the market during the June quarter. Should – could we expect QTL ASPs
maybe to increase exiting your fiscal year relative to your guidance? And am I calculating it right that your guidance
also implies an uptick in ASPs for the June quarter? Thank you.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Hey, this is Derek. I'll take that one. Yeah, I think we saw a little bit of a downward trend in
ASPs in Q2, although that was in line with what we expected. As we've looked back historically the last couple of
years, we've seen actually ASPs kind of trend down in Q2, but then they've tended to trend up in Q3 and Q4. And so as
we look out at the back half of the year, we are expecting kind of a rebound in ASPs as compared to the Q2 ASP, and
that's including offsetting effect from FX. So I do think, both in the March and the June quarter, we should see some
improvement in the ASP compared to Q2.
<A - George S. Davis>: Again – hi, it's George. As a reminder, again, our range for the full year is still – we've
narrowed it a little bit, but it still has a midpoint at 220
<Q - Mike Walkley>: Okay. Thanks. And then, Derek, just on the FX, was there any impact to FX in the short term or
any impact from the yen in particular? And then just longer-term, with the stronger mix from low-end markets, how do
you see the ASP trends? Is it still, kind of, single-digit annual decline is a good way to think about it? Thank you.
<A - George S. Davis>: Why don't I – this is George. I'll cover the near-term impact, and maybe Derek, you can cover
your views on the longer-term impact. Actually we did experience some impact from the yen in the second quarter and
really for the full year. But in both Q2 and Q3 the net effect has been minimal, in Q2 in particular, because of the
favorable impact from other currencies. So for the full year we see FX being about $1.00 impact on ASP, so not much
of an impact and virtually no impact in Q2.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: So back on the longer-term trends, I think really the trends that we've been seeing and that we
highlighted back at the Analyst Day in November, two quarters in, are really holding, and we see them remaining
intact. In particular, in the emerging regions, the ASPs have continued to increase and in fact when we talk about, sort
of, the tiers, the interesting thing is, although the volume is continuing to grow there, the percentage of the units coming
from the mid and high tier has kind of been holding. And so I think both of those trends are consistent with what we
expected at the beginning of the year and will continue. But as you said, over the long-term, as more volume shifts to
emerging regions, in terms of our internal plans, we've got baked-in assumptions that there'll be single-digit declines in
ASPs over the longer term.
<Q - Mike Walkley>: Thank you.
Operator
Tim Long from BMO Capital Markets, please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Tim Long>: I just wanted to go a little further into detail into the QCT gross margin. Steve, you mentioned it
down, as expected. I just want to put that together with a few things. First, last quarter, Bill had mentioned a positive
contribution to gross margin from QCT, so I think it went up two or three points. Doing the math, it's looking like it
went down about six points or so, five or six points this quarter into March, so it seems like a little bit of a reversal
there. You are saying as expected, I'm curious what that means. And what do we think about, from the market drivers,
for this change in gross margin? Meaning, is it QRD and MediaTek competition? Is it new LTE devices from
competitors finally starting to hit the market? And at some point, do we start to see a floor in this gross margin number
for QCT? Thank you.

<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: Tim, this is Steve. So in Q1, kind of Q1 from – excuse me, Q2 from Q1, a couple things
happen. One is you get the normal calendar year price reset which hits in this quarter. We also had a bit of a weaker
mix from the perspective of more units coming in from emerging markets versus developed markets. The December
quarter tends to be pretty heavy in terms of build up in the developed world so you probably saw a regional mix move
away from the developed world. We also mentioned on the last call that we were in the middle of doing some – we also
think about how we do our pricing strategy which I think comprehends not just short term but also long-term views of
the competitive landscape.
One thing that I should mention, we really are not seeing significant competitive threat in the LTE areas as you
mentioned. I think it's just more of a mix issue and some of the calendar items that you've probably seen over the past
years as well.
<Q - Tim Long>: Okay. Forgive me, but I thought ASP looked pretty much flat December to March? So the mix
couldn't have been that bad if it was flat, right?
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: What you saw is you probably saw a little bit less mix from the high-end and a little bit
more from the emerging market area versus the quarter before.
<Q - Tim Long>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - George S. Davis>: And hey, Tim. This is George. I would just add, when we look at Q2 even though the volumes
of MSMs were up relative to our expectations, the mix issue did have an impact of neutralizing the benefit of those
higher volumes and so the outperformance in Q2 is more of a QTL story.
<Q - Tim Long>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Simona Jankowski from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Simona K. Jankowski>: Hi. Thank very much. I just had a question on the chipset side and then one on the
royalty side. Starting with chipsets, can you just kind of go over the puts and takes on the volumes expected in the June
quarter considering there are some significant major launches that you are participating in in the June quarter? I
would've thought you'd see some better sequential performance there than what you're guiding for.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: Simona, this is Steve. I try not to get into kind of the mix of different customers. The
one thing that I would say is that throughout the year we're probably a little bit diversified from big changes in the
customer base and we are seeing kind of some customer mix change move around and you see that in our numbers and
probably in our mix a little bit. But I don't think that quarter has traditionally been the strongest quarter relative to some
of the other ones that we've had. I don't know if there's anything ominous in there that you should be able to pick up or
think about picking up.
<Q - Simona K. Jankowski>: So you're not assuming any kind of inventory correction or anything like that?
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: No. If anything I think you would probably see a little bit of an increase in our
inventories, which probably you should think of as confidence in shipping some of the higher-end chipsets into the
market.
<Q - Simona K. Jankowski>: Okay. And then on the royalty side, a question there. So you're ASPs declined about 4%
sequentially and that's despite the fact that in the December quarter, volumes in North America and other mature
markets were actually quite strong and I would've thought that with that being the higher ASP region that would have
helped the mix for QTL and then conversely we're now seeing in what was reported by AT&T, Verizon and others, that
North America volumes have really come down quite significantly in the March quarter which is being offset by
substantial growth in emerging markets around the Lunar New Year and so forth. And so that would've suggested to
me that the mix actually would get better and benefit your ASPs in the royalty segment in the March quarter for you to

report in June. So could you just kind of dig a little bit more into why that logic is not playing out?
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Yeah, this is Derek. So I think as I was trying to explain before, we have seen actually more
volatility I would say in the quarterly ASPs with more kind of iconic high-end devices and the timing of the launches.
What we've seen is actually the ASPs moving around quite a bit. Like if you look last year, we were slightly down in
Q2 but then ASPs jumped up by like $15 in Q3. So we are seeing more volatility. I think the December quarter is
obviously a very competitive dynamic. A lot of things going on in pricing and it's a quarter where we have less volume
coming from some of the higher ASP regions like Japan.
But as I said, as we look out and we have a certain amount of information already from our licensees and based on
publicly available data, we do expect ASPs to increase in Q3. And then as you suggested, there are a number of new
higher-end products launching that should have a positive impact on the Q4 ASP as well.
<Q - Simona K. Jankowski>: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator
Brian Modoff from Deutsche Bank, please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Brian Modoff>: Yeah, a couple questions. So one on the QCT margins that are kind of guiding again at 17% in
the quarter. Can you kind of walk through little bit of that? I know obviously volumes aren't as good but you've had
some of your expenses you typically incur in Q1 done. Are there – calendar Q1 – are there incremental expenses,
takeouts, et cetera?
And then can you also talk about you mentioned a couple of times higher legal expenses. Can you talk about, has there
been a shift in litigation or is there some events occurring that outside perhaps that smaller case in Florida that you're
dealing with?
And then last question is around S800. You're talking about launch midyear. How is the design traction on that going
and how do you see that affecting your overall mix in ASPs in QCT? Thanks.
<A - George S. Davis>: Brian, hi. It's George. On the QCT margins, we said for the full-year, as you may recall that
we saw 18.5% to 20. 5% margins for QCT throughout the year. We are seeing spending increase into the last half of the
year, so 17% at Q3 is still going to be consistent with that outlook and in fact, we recommitted to the margin outlook.
So I don't think we've really changed our view it all. I do think we're certainly seeing strength in ASPs for QCT in the
second half of the year. That will help but we're also seeing some ramping in spending.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: Brian, this is Steve. A little bit on the 800 status. It's actually doing well. If you look at
the uptick in the second half, the second half does look quite a bit better than what we would have thought in the
January timeframe. A lot of that is this higher mix product that we've been investing in for some time and I think you're
going to see good growth year-over-year and I think some accretion to the business as a result of those higher-end
products coming in and I think that's really responsible for some of the guidance movement.
<A - George S. Davis>: And just back to your second question on legal expenses and other items. That really was to
explain the delta from our forecast of up 10% to 12% to the 14% growth that we saw in Q2. Litigation and patent are
both up in the quarter, some on settlements. Some of the patents obviously there was the adoption of the first to file
rule, and so there was a lot of accelerated spending on patent filings in the quarter as well. So it's more of an increase.
Obviously the big increases year-over-year and also on an absolute basis, the increase in spending is still coming out of
the core business.
<Q - Brian Modoff>: Okay. Thank you.

Kulbinder Garcha from Credit Suisse, please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: A couple of questions. I just want to revisit the QCT margin question again and maybe
more for the full year for Steve. With the growth that you're seeing and the market share that you're gaining and the mix
improvement that you're seeing in LTE, I'm just surprised that there's just not more leverage in that business, especially
this year of all years. And even in the near-term you're saying you're seeing a higher mix of higher end chips going into
the next quarter but margins aren't going up. So is something just competitive that you're trying to do? Or are you
thinking to try and block sockets for the long-term? Can you speak about why there isn't more leverage this period this
year?
And then for Derek, one of the debates we've had over the years with you is about your ability to license the significant
3G market – smartphone market that's developing out of the MediaTek world, if you like. Is the increase to this year's
addressable market number that you're seeing now any function of your confidence in the ability to license phones
there or is it end demand driven? Many thanks.
<A - George S. Davis>: Hey, Paul (sic) [Kulbinder] (34:48), this is George. Let me just give some perspective on the
full-year on the margin because I think it's hard to see it for a couple reasons. Number one, the margin performance for
QCT [audio gap] (35:00) loaded in the second half of the year, and so you'll see more of that impact in Q3 and Q4, and
we already talked about the fact that even on falling volume you're going to see revenue and operating margin up in our
expectation in Q3. But if you look at, just step back and look year-over-year, QCT revenue will be up, I would say,
more than 35% year-over-year. Operating margin, we think, will be up more than 40%, and that's on, again, OpEx is –
really, it's driving the OpEx growth of the company year-over-year, but it's still at a lower percentage than its revenue
growth rate. So we are seeing some leverage in the margin.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Kulbinder, this is Derek. Really, the short answer is it's end-demand driven. As I've explained
in the past, we're continuing to grow our licensee base in China, and our license agreements require payment of
royalties irrespective of whose chip is included in the device. And I think I've taken folks through a few times the
robust process we have in place of monitoring the market in China and really trying to drive compliance with our
agreement, so no change there, really a demand-driven story.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Okay. Thank you.

Ehud Gelblum from Morgan Stanley, please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Ehud A. Gelblum>: There's a couple. Going to revisit a couple of the issues that we went over already. I may
have missed something, so I apologize if I'm rehashing some concepts. But on the QCT gross margin around 17%-plus,
it's where you had guided it last quarter. Can you give us a sense as to how much of that decline from last quarter's 26%
was gross margin-related and how much was OpEx? And to the extent that there was any gross margin decline in the
business, how does that make sense? Just help us get our arms around it, given that the QCT – the shipment ASP was
flat. So maybe there wasn't a gross margin decline, it was all OpEx. But I just want to understand that. And going back
to a previous question, if it is all OpEx, why wouldn't that improve as you get through the year? But just to understand
that mix.
And then on the QCT ASP itself, I think you had mentioned that it was flat because of the mix, offsetting the
higher-end chips that we know you shipped last quarter. There were also a bunch of lower-end ones that kind of kept it
in step. I think in the last conference call, Bill had mentioned that he expected it to be up. So I guess what I'm asking is,
vis-à-vis your expectations, what geographically happened? Was the U.S. not as strong as you had expected it to be
versus your expectations, and was China just stronger? And if that's the case, are you gaining more share in China than
you thought you were going to?
<A - George S. Davis>: Yeah, Ehud, this is George. On the gross margin and OpEx, we don't guide that by – at the
segment level, but I will say they're in line with Steve's comments about the mix of business. There was some, both

gross margin and OpEx impact to get to that 17% number.
<Q - Ehud A. Gelblum>: Okay. I'm not asking for guidance, but can you just give us a reflection from last quarter, if
the ASPs of the chips were actually the same, how would gross margin have gotten impacted?
<A - George S. Davis>: It's a dilutive effect of the additional volumes.
<Q - Ehud A. Gelblum>: So additional volumes is bad for gross margin?
<A - George S. Davis>: Those additional volumes were bad for gross margin.
<Q - Ehud A. Gelblum>: Okay. So your lower-end chips have lower gross margin than your higher-end ones do?
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: Ehud, this is Steve. Yes, that's correct. In fact, I think what you saw between what we
would have guided at the beginning of the quarter and the end of the quarter is probably a little bit stronger units and
more units coming out of the developing regions versus the developed regions. And so I think that those things do
move around. I mean, we've talked about ebb-and-flowing between developed world and emerging world, and this is
one that is probably a little heavy on the emerging world side.
<Q - Ehud A. Gelblum>: Okay. And then finally, do you expect that when you model going forward and you're
looking especially at the royalty side as well as at the chip side, how do you – with China going very soon, hitting
TD-LTE and ramping on the 3G side, I would have expected more higher-end than lower-end coming out of China. But
is that relative to what is going on? Are you seeing a stagnation perhaps in the developed world as China gets going? Is
that kind of what, the story that we're looking at going forward?
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: I don't know. I'll give my – this is Steve. I'll give my view on it, which is, I don't think
you're seeing anything in terms of stagnation. You're probably a little early in the ramp of LTE TDD and you're still
seeing, I think, significant transition from 2G to 3G, which we're seeing in the low-end chipsets. The developed world
tends to be peaky, meaning that it's dominated in many cases by flagship models and concentrated volumes in
particular quarters. I don't know if Derek or anyone else has any other view.
Operator
Rod Hall from JPMorgan, please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Rod B. Hall>: Yeah, thanks for taking my question, guys. I just wanted to ask one question, Steve on ASP. I
know there have been a bunch but you talked about ASP volatility increasing, which has obviously been the case and
we know that that's due to a bunch of other different things going on in the mix, upgrades from feature phones to
smartphones, et cetera. But I wonder if you could talk about what I noticed is your range of guidance on the ASP really
it's not changed that much. It hasn't widened up that much since a year ago even though the volatility seems like it is
increasing.
So could you talk about whether you think the current range of guidance is appropriate given the increased volatility
and also maybe talk a little bit about things like tablets? How they affect that? Just how predictable you think that ASP
is at this point.
And then the other thing that I wanted to ask you guys this RF360 chip pretty interesting product. Just could you give
us an update on where we are with designs and shipments on products for that and so on, what's the timeline looking
like on that? Has it changed at all since you guys announced the product? Thanks a lot.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: Rod, this is Steve. I'm assuming you're referring to the licensing business guidance
versus the chip guidance. Is that correct?
<Q - Rod B. Hall>: I'm sorry, Steve. I'm sorry. Yeah, I am referring to that.

<A - Derek K. Aberle>: So this is Derek. Let me take a crack at that and I'll see if anybody else wants to chime in. But
obviously trying to estimate ASPs is a difficult process although we get probably more information than most to help
us in that process. I think our feeling is that the range that we have set out is an appropriate range and when we think
about the fiscal year ASP we usually start out the beginning of the year like some of our other guidance with the wider
range and then as we get closer, we go through the year and get closer to the end of the year we'll tend to narrow it up a
little bit because we feel like we have a little more – some of the year is already under the belt so we have less to
forecast.
But again, I think we feel like we have a robust process in place and we're doing a pretty good job. For instance, this
quarter we had a relatively significant drop in ASP quarter-over-quarter yet it was in line with what we expected and
consistent with the full year 220 midpoint that we had last quarter and we still see that as consistent with the guidance
for the year. So I'm pretty comfortable with the process that we have in place.
<Q - Rod B. Hall>: Do you think volatility is increasing, Derek? I mean, just to...
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: I think quarterly volatility has been increasing partially for the reason Steve mentioned which
is, as we get more of these iconic devices launching and they're launching at sort of peaky times throughout the year, it
has the effect of moving the ASP around more than it did in the past.
<Q - Rod B. Hall>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: And then on RF360, we're pretty pleased with it. It's something that you should see in
the second half of this year. I would say, as I've said before, expect us to sort of walk before we run in this product area.
This is a new product area for us and I think we probably have a lot to learn in terms of ramping up a bunch of
customers very rapidly. And of course we have very large volumes now so we'll probably take that one slow in terms of
how we ramp it but pleased with how it's going so far.
Operator
Stacy Rasgon from Sanford Bernstein, please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: ...my question. I had a question on the OpEx. So the annual guide going forward from
this point you took it up about $160 million on a pro forma basis versus where you were last quarter. It sounded to me
from the description actually a lot of it is not R&D, it's legal and some of this other stuff. Can you give us some sort of
an idea of how much of a split of this OpEx increase is actually coming from the SG&A and legal side versus the
R&D? And can we consider or think about those increases on the legal front and patents and everything else as more
one-time or are those recurring?
<A - Donald J. Rosenberg>: This is Don Rosenberg. On the legal side, as George said earlier, one of those is a
settlement which is not material, but it clearly is a settlement is one-time. And as George accurately described before,
as you know, with the new America Invents Act, which was the modification to our patent laws, there was a first-to-file
modification put in and some companies took advantage of making sure that they filed a lot of applications in a timely
way due to certain timing issues associated with that. We did a very good job, as always, of filing patents so that we
could get the kind of protection we want and that was a one-time event in order to meet those deadlines.
<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: And how much was that, I guess, of the increase? I'm trying to get some feeling for how
much of this increase is, I guess, an increase in sort of core investment in the company versus comp increases versus,
like, one-time charges.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: Sure. I think in terms of the increase, you still have a meaningful piece of that that is in
the core business. And maybe it's easier just to step back and look at the full year-over-year. Still, when you think about
a 21% to 23% increase year-over-year, about 95% of that, not to be too specific, but in that area, is really related to
spending increases in QCT and QTL. So this is really about investment in the core business.

<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: Got it, no, I get that. But given the amount of revenue upside you're showing, you're
really not showing the kind of EPS leverage that one would expect, at least we would expect, from the kind of revenue
upside that's showing in the OpEx ratio. This is probably $0.07 or $0.08 of that EPS that's going away. So again, I'm
just trying to get some feeling for how much of this is recurring and how much of this actually is going forward from
here that they can actually drive further growth beyond the 35% or 40% that we're seeing this year, trying to look in
terms of what it can drive into next year and beyond.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: Yeah, the non-recurring pieces would not be a material impact on the year-over-year.
<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: Okay. All right. Thank you, guys.
Operator
James Faucette from Pacific Crest, please go ahead with your question.
<Q - James E. Faucette>: Thank you very much. I wanted to go back to a question on licensing in China. We've
talked about, I think there have been mention of faster growth in the market there, and then some of the other emerging
markets. And I'm wondering, if we can get a sense from you, Derek, as far as where do we feel like the coverage is on
collecting royalties from producers in that region in particular? And I'm just trying to get a sense for potential upside in
growth as you improve the coverage there and add more licensees, is kind of my first question.
The second question is for Steve Mollenkopf. As we look over the medium to long term, I think we've talked a lot
about how there's been some mix that has impacted margins, but yet the ASP has been relatively stable. How should we
think about the ASP development on the chipsets over the long run, particularly as you start to roll in some RF
component, et cetera? Can we remain stable, or should we expect those chipset ASPs to decline at about the same rate
that the handset ASPs are anticipated to? Thank you.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: James, this is Derek. So on China licensing, I think I can probably break it into two parts. I
think generally we feel very good, as I said, that we're continuing to add licensees to the base and grow the number of
licensees in China. I feel very good about the compliance efforts we have there. So I think we are confident we're
collecting reasonably well on the sales there.
The one exception that's pretty well understood, I think, is we have had some struggles with local Chinese companies
not necessarily paying all the royalties they owe on TD-SCDMA units. And although we have a large number of
companies licensed for TD-SCDMA, given the political sensitivities there, that continues to be an issue for us. And
we've got a number of strategies in place to try to address it but as the TD-SCDMA volumes grow at China Mobile,
there could be a gap there between, or there will be a gap to some extent, between what we're collecting on and maybe
some of the numbers you're seeing come out of China, unless and until we're able to resolve the situation.
Having said that, I think there are some trends that should help reduce the size of the issue. One of them is, we do
believe that the higher end of the portfolio is going to have a combination of UMTS and LTE, or at least UMTS, for
global roaming and other reasons.
So as to products that include those technologies in addition to TD-SCDMA, we don't anticipate having the same issues
that we're experiencing on TD-SCDMA. So again though, this has shifted over time, and I think where the volumes
were quite a bit smaller historically and the mix of the supply base in China has also shifted over time to probably favor
more of the local Chinese companies that have been a bit of a struggle. But we're going to continue to work hard to see
what we can do to solve it.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: James, this is Steve. On your question about, I would say, kind of growing content and
what's the trajectory look like, if you step back and look at the business, what I think you're seeing is, as the mix shifts,
kind of the historical mix in our business has been very modem-centric. And it's had a particular gross margin
associated with it. As we go into getting more and more content on the phone which is, first it's coming in the form of
application processor and adding in that functionality, what you're seeing is, I think, a growth in the raw dollars and the

gross margin per MSM, but a reduction in the traditional gross margin percentage.
Now we're still seeing significant growth as a result, and clearly it's been an accretive thing for the company as you
look back. But I think that's what you're seeing and I think that's what people are trying to figure out. And as a
particular quarter has a mix between modem and application processor or different geographies, such as the last
quarter, you tend to see that move around a little bit. And that's probably what you're seeing now. Our view is, this is
actually a very good business for us. We're able to produce a business that grows faster than the market, and now that
it's at scale, it's growing faster than our rate of growth of the operating expenses. We think that's a very good business.
It also, I think, provides the springboard to go into some additional markets such as the tablet market, which we really
have not participated in a great way, primarily because the OS that we put our biggest bet on has yet to sort of develop,
but we think it will. So we look at this as a build scale in the smartphone space, and use that to go into some adjacent
markets as well. We also think, to be successful, you have to have the scale. So that's what you're really seeing in the
business. A bit of an investment period, but we're still producing growth during that investment period.

Tal Liani from Bank of America, please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Tal Liani>: Hi. Thank you. Just one clarification and a question. TD-SCDMA, you don't get paid on single-mode,
but what about TD-LTE? Has this been decided already, or do you still argue with the locals?
Second question is to understand the transition to the next node. First, what are your plans when it comes to the next
node, whether it's 20-nano or 16-nano? How do you manage the transition both on capacity and margin? And do you
expect the same margin decline when you transition, similar to what you had with 28-nano? Thanks.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: This is Derek. On the follow-up on China, just to clarify, I mean, I think we have agreements
in place with a number of companies, and it's really just trying to work some of the issues and trying to get compliance.
We're also getting, still paid some royalties from companies outside of China. So I think that's a little bit of a dynamic.
You can't quite say we're not getting anything on TD-SCDMA, and that's shifting over time.
Our current expectation is we've got more than 50 companies licensed now for LTE, including both TDD and FDD
modes of LTE. And a significant number of those companies are Chinese companies, including ZTE. So currently our
expectation is that we will not have the same type of challenges around LTE that we've experienced in China on
TD-SCDMA. And on top of that, we do think many of the devices at China Mobile, at least in the near-term that
include LTE, will also include UMTS, and for that reason would also be a trigger for royalty payments under our
agreements.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: Hey, Tal, on the node transitions, you're going to see us, consistent with earlier
comments in our OpEx profile, really try to move through the nodes as rapidly as we can. Our view is that that puts us
in the best position to drive technology and to really, I think, set the design point more than folks who can't do that.
Now I would say I don't know if I would make a conclusion that a new node or the 28-nanometer node in particular
was associated with a lower gross margin. It was probably more the mix of products versus anything else. Today, I
think the general view is that the 28-nanometer node is likely to be the node that exists for a long time and will
probably be sort of the mass-market node for some time. We kind of felt that we got on that earlier than anybody else.
That being said, you've probably heard some timing in the market about when companies will go to 20-nanometer and
our product roadmap is consistent with that timing. We're going to be moving rapidly through nodes and across
different nodes at the same time, as we've done in the past. So our general strategy is to make sure that we – at the
low-end we might use the most cost-effective node, and at the high-end performance tier we're going to use the leading
edge.

Mark Sue from RBC Capital Markets, please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Mark Sue>: Derek, just to clarify – a clarification. Much, much longer term, if we go into the world of
single-mode LTE, I guess, just your thoughts on the impact there on the royalties. And then also on tablets, is there
something that we revisit in terms of the royalty rates as it stands today? Anything that proactively can do to kind of
think about improving the attachment rates there?
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Sure. Let me – so the first question on sort of longer-term impacts of single-mode LTE,
obviously there's been a certain amount of chatter around the industry about the timing of some of the early launches of
single-mode LTE devices, and I think there's some room for debate on that. But we still believe that that, in terms of
meaningful volume, is shifted out a ways. You may recall that we made a public statement several years ago at the
time, based on sort of our current patent position, which frankly I think has improved over time, that we expected to
charge about 3.25% for single-mode LTE, just for the essential patent portfolio. And as you know, we generally license
generally our whole portfolio, not just the essential portfolio, so that 3.25% was just for the essential patents.
So while it's possible over time we could see a bit of a step-down in the rate as we transition to more single-mode LTE,
I think we feel very good about the position that we're in, in terms of the agreements we've signed and the potential
impact of that. There's obviously other things in the agreements that could have somewhat of an offsetting effect in that
as well in terms of the total royalties paid, but we'll have to see how that plays out over time. But, sort of, the big
picture is, we still believe it's out in time a ways, and we feel good that we're establishing a value for the portfolio that
everybody should be pretty happy with.
<Q - Mark Sue>: Got it. And your thoughts on tablets or anything that you could do proactively there?
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Yeah, so on tablets, I think I mentioned on the last call that the attach rates obviously have
been not as high as we had expected. They've been trending down a little bit over time. I do think we're seeing some
signs that the trend could be starting to reverse itself going forward. And in particular, as we start seeing more volume
in some of the smaller-screen form factors, like a seven- or an eight-inch that people will end up carrying with them
more often, I think there's more desire to have, sort of, the ubiquitous coverage of cellular.
Also, I think recently I've seen some more subsidies coming in from the operator channel on the tablet products, which
really haven't – they haven't been pushing too much in the past. And then of course, I think the last six months or so we
have seen many of the operators around the world make moves on their pricing plans that are more conducive to
driving adoption. So I think some things are coming together which we hope will start to improve the picture. From a
royalty standpoint, at this point we think we've done our part and there's not really a need for additional changes there
to help stimulate the market.

Ian Ing from Lazard Capital Markets, please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Ian L. Ing>: Yes. Thanks for fitting me in. In terms of these questions on QCT margins and some spending
increases, is there any product roadmap adjustments driving that? I mean intra-quarter we did see TSMC pull in their
schedule on 16-nanometer FinFETs, which is low-power process and obviously you might have had some hand in
driving that.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: You saw us come out with the RF360 during the quarter but, and we continue to invest
heavily both in the modem and in the GPU, CPU and VLSI side. We think we're one of the folks driving FinFET into
the mobile space, so that's pretty consistent with our current plan and our previous statements.
<Q - Ian L. Ing>: Okay. And then, Steve, maybe you could highlight, for the Snapdragon family, how you're going to
differentiate low tier versus high tier? If you look at the low tier there's offerings out there from MediaTek, et cetera,

dual-core, quad-core, et cetera. Would it be graphics where you differentiate at the high end or some other areas?
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: The low tier is pretty difficult to differentiate in many cases, with the exception of I
think two areas. One is you need to have the scale, customer scale, essentially to be able to engage with a number of
different customers. And what we've been building over the last year or two years or so is the ability to engage with a
non-traditional customer. Non-traditional in this sense means a customer that needs a bit more of a complete solution.
That means that from the product side you need to create something like the reference design that we've talked about,
but you also need to expand in the region the sales activity.
So for us in China, what you're seeing is we're building the sales activity to sell into a customer that is not, let's say a
traditional multinational customer that we've serviced. And we're, you know it takes a while to build that alternative
channel.
We also think over time that our IP roadmap from the top tier tends to be meaningful in the low tier, as well. And you
can see that in customers that try to differentiate from their low tier competitors by producing a high tier phone and
trying to offset their brand. You'll see that and that tiered roadmap we think is important long-term.
The other aspect that's happening here, we think over the next several quarters is, as China transitions to multi-mode
4G, that you get a transition, a real turnover in the modem feature set, which we think plays towards our traditional
strength.
So long-winded answer, but essentially, I think you have to have customer scale and you can use, we think, the IP
roadmap from the top in order to differentiate long-term but there are a lot of people who are competing on price right
now and that needs to settle out.

This concludes the question-and-answer session. Dr. Jacobs, you may proceed with closing remarks.
Dr. Paul E. Jacobs
Well, thanks, everybody, for joining us this afternoon.
Obviously we're really pleased with the record revenues and our growth really is continuing strongly with the increased
guidance we put out for the year. If you go back and look at fiscal 2010 through fiscal 2013, we've gone from $11
billion to $15 billion to $19 billion and then we're guiding mid-point $24.5 billion for this fiscal year. And that really
strong growth is due to our ability to drive the market with the new technologies and that's based on our past R&D
investments to really capitalize on the opportunities that we see and we are going to continue doing that and we'll do
that also in a very profitable way.
Look forward to the guidance next quarter in one of the generally, seasonally, softer quarters, we're projecting 31%
year-over-year EPS growth. So we feel pretty good about that. We're able to do that because we're putting our
competitors farther and farther behind. And it's not just the modem, although everybody's quite focused on that, but it's
also we're putting them behind on other areas, graphics, microprocessor design, and that is evidenced by the number of
design wins we have, 850 designs launched or announced, 475 more currently in design, as Steve said.
We've got some great products coming from our partners, we have some great products that we're developing, great
technologies to come and a lot of opportunity ahead. So we expect to be able to continue the kind of growth that we've
had. Thanks very much.
I'm sorry, I meant to say 31% revenue growth, not EPS growth.
