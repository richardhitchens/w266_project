Now it is my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern Chairman, President and CEO, Wick Moorman.
Charles W. Moorman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Leanne, and good afternoon. It's my pleasure to welcome all of you to our Third Quarter 2010 Earnings
Conference Call. Several members of our senior management team join me: Don Seale, our Chief Marketing Officer;
Mark Manion, Chief Operating Officer; and Jim Squires, Chief Financial Officer; all of whom you will hear from
today.
During our second quarter call, I indicated that we were optimistic that the momentum we generated in the first half of
the year would continue into the third quarter as we maintained our focus on strengthening the franchise. Today, I am
very pleased to report that our momentum did remain strong, as Norfolk Southern delivered double-digit percentage
increases in revenues, operating income and bottom line results. In doing so, we produced our fifth consecutive quarter
of sequential volume growth and our second consecutive quarter with a sub-70 operating ratio.
Net income and diluted earnings per share were both up 47% for the quarter, as a 19% improvement in revenues more
than offset a 14% increase in operating expenses. This strong operating leverage resulted in an operating ratio of
69.6%, which represents a 320-basis point year-over-year improvement. We also achieved our lowest ever operating
ratio of 71.4% for the first nine months.
Volumes in the third quarter improved 15% year-over-year and 2% sequentially from the second quarter. We also
posted 52-week highs in several commodity groups and Don will provide more details in a moment. Against this
strengthening economic backdrop, we continued to improve productivity, as we safely handled increasing traffic levels.
As compared to the 15% volume increase, crew starts were up only 8% and total employment up a modest 2%. While
we have experienced significant traffic volume swings over the past two years, our systems continue to provide us with
increased flexibility and service consistency with respect to our operating plan.
The third quarter also marked another significant milestone for our intermodal service, as last month we opened the
Heartland Corridor, which represents the shortest, most direct double-stack intermodal route linking the Port of
Hampton roads to the Midwest.
Mark will review our operations with you in a few minutes and then Jim will provide you with an overview of our
financial results. But first, I'll turn it over to Don for a more in-depth look at our third quarter business.
Donald W. Seale, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer
Thank you, Wick, and good afternoon, everyone. The third quarter marked our fifth consecutive quarter of revenue
growth since the beginning of last year's deep recession. Volume growth across the board and higher revenue per unit
combined to generate revenues of 2.5 billion for the quarter, up 393 million, or 19%, over third quarter of last year.

Each of our business groups produced year-over-year gains for the quarter. Nearly 80%, or 312 million, of our total
revenue gain was driven by higher shipments, while continued growth in revenue per unit contributed 81 million of the
increase. Looking at revenue per unit in more detail on the next slide, we can see that all of our business groups had
higher RPU in the quarter, resulting in a total of $1,401 per unit, up $46 or 3% over last year.
Negative mix within Coal, Chemicals, Agriculture and Intermodal dampened otherwise solid RPU gains across these
business segments, which were driven by improved pricing and higher fuel-related revenue. For example, Intermodal's
RPU growth in the quarter was negatively impacted by increased empty repositionings, which accounted for 16% of
total Intermodal volume in third quarter 2010 compared to 11% last year; this suppressed Intermodal RPU by $13 per
unit.
Coal RPU was effectively moderated by a combination of higher volumes of shorter-haul utility coal to our northern
utilities, heavier domestic met coal shipments to the river and higher volumes of export met coal from Pennsylvania to
the Port of Baltimore.
Chemicals' RPU was impacted by lower RPU shipments of fly ash from Tennessee to Alabama. And Agricultural RPU
was impacted by gains in short-haul grain markets in the Midwest, as well as incremental gains in short-haul phosphate
rock shipments.
With respect to managing yield, as we have stated in previous quarterly meetings, our ongoing objective is to produce
pricing that exceeds the rate of rail cost inflation and we remain confident of our ability to meet that objective.
Now transitioning to volume on Slide 4, our balanced portfolio of business continued to deliver growth as we reached
1.75 million units, up 15% over third quarter of 2009. As with revenue, this was our fifth quarter of sequential
increases. Increased volumes were led by Intermodal, Coal and Metals, which offset a small decline in our Automotive
business resulting from the redesign of the Ford Vehicle Network. As we've noted in prior quarters, this redesign will
impact year-over-year comps through the end of this year.
During the quarter, our Chemicals and Intermodal groups achieved 52-week high loadings and we continue to reinvest
in our network, allowing us to efficiently handle increased business and provide even better service to our customers.
We're also building upon our strong focus of developing new terminals, technology and route improvements to benefit
all customers across our network. During the quarter, we added speed and capacity enhancements with the completion
of one of our biggest projects, the Heartland Corridor, as Wick mentioned, which I will discuss in more detail later in
my remarks.
Now let's turn to a review of our individual business group performances for quarter. Starting with Coal, volume was
up 15% in the quarter, as shown on Slide 5, led by broad gains across the business in domestic met coal, exported
utility coal. And the coal sector continues to recover and it produced its strongest volumes since the fourth quarter of
2008, which I should note was a record year for coal over our network.
As depicted on Slide 6, metallurgical coal, coke and iron ore volumes were up 25,000 carloads in the quarter or 73%
over last year. Growth was led by increased steel demand, resulting from the improving domestic economy. U.S. steel
production was up 29% in the first two months of the third quarter. At the end of the quarter, only seven blast furnaces
were down, reflecting gradual recovery in the steel industry. And domestic met stockpiles remain below target at many
of our steel producers, which bodes well for demand ahead.
As shown on Slide 7, our export coal volume was up 5,000 carloads, or 11%, in the third quarter. Shorter-haul export
volume through the Port of Baltimore increased 94%, driven by Pennsylvania coals moving to the Asian market, which
are no longer exporting coking coals due to strong internal demand. The increase in Baltimore traffic effectively offset
a 14% decline in export coal to Lamberts Point, which was impacted by higher-finish steel inventories in Europe.
Concluding with utility coal on the next Slide, volume was up 21,000 carloads or 8%, the first year-over-year gain
since fourth quarter 2008. Growth in our shorter-haul northern utility network was up over twice as much as
longer-haul shipments to southern utilities. Coal burn increased during the summer during well above average
temperatures in the East and improved economic activity. As shown on this Slide, for August, it was reported by

Energy Ventures Analysis that Eastern stocks in total were only 2.7 million tons above normal. Currently, 20% of the
utility plants in our network have informed us that they are now below targeted inventory levels.
Going into the shoulder months, which we're in now, lower seasonal temperatures and low natural gas prices will
moderate coal burns and slow stockpile declines, but economic growth should raise electricity demand, which is up 9%
in our service region. In this regard, our utility volume strengthened in September, up 16% for the month, compared to
overall third quarter growth of 8% and we expect utility volumes to accelerate in the fourth quarter and through the
coming year.
Now transitioning to Intermodal on Slide 9, third quarter volume was up 122,000 units, or 19% over last year.
Domestic growth led the improvement for the quarter, up 30% due to continued success in highway conversions and
increased trans-loading at Pacific coast ports. Of our total domestic increase for the quarter, we estimate that 54% came
from new local business east of the Mississippi, with the remaining 46% from traditional interline business, such as the
transcon market.
International volume increased by 11%, driven by higher imports and exports. Both in domestic and international
segments, revenue empty movements increased by 21% in the quarter, as tight container capacity prompted
repositioning for loads. And finally our premium volume grew 23% in the quarter, due to increased activity in the
parcel and LTL markets.
Turning to the next slide, our ongoing corridor strategy has been a major factor in growth across our intermodal
network. Our Heartland Corridor officially opened for business on September 9th and we are already seeing the
benefits of this project, as we've shifted over 30% of our overall Norfolk volumes to the new route. We have begun
stacking key lanes, such as Chicago to North Carolina and north to Columbus. When we complete our
Cincinnati-to-Columbus clearances and our Toledo yard improvements in the second quarter 2011, we will shift
another 10% of our Norfolk book to the Heartland route.
As shown on the next slide, we also have the premier route from the Port of New York to the Midwest through
Pennsylvania, which as you might recall, was the first major tunnel clearance project undertaken by Conrail. You'll also
note that business on this high-speed route was up 24% for the quarter and 20% for year-to-date. And the recently
announced tunnel clearances in New Jersey in conjunction with our PanAm southern joint-venture will provide for new
NS double-stack service from the Port of New York to upstate New York and New England. Progress on the Crescent
Corridor continued in the quarter, with the recent groundbreaking for our newest terminal at Greencastle, Pennsylvania,
along with ongoing work in speed enhancements over the route itself.
Finally as shown on Slide 14, the improved Meridian Speedway provides shippers with the most direct and fastest route
between Southern California and points in the Southeast, including Atlanta, Charlotte and Birmingham. And our
Chicago-to-Florida business continues to ramp up using our new Titusville terminal. In sum, we remain very pleased
with our progress and growth over our entire Intermodal Corridor network.
Now concluding with our Merchandise business on Slide 15, volume in this broad set of carload markets reached
588,000 loads, up 11% over third quarter 2009. Metals and Construction led volume growth with a gain of 20%.
Increased global and domestic steel production and growth from intermill business drove the gain in iron and steel
volume. Aggregates volume was up due to increased highway construction, paving projects and a greater seasonal push
to ship before winter months. Project growth, including scrubber stone and frac sand shipments for natural gas drilling
also contributed to gains in the quarter.
Chemicals volume increased 12%, led by gains and strong growth in our Petroleum business, which was up 19%.
Improved chemical production, increased demand for consumer goods and strong project growth drove the
improvement in this commodity sector.
Our Agricultural volumes were up 9% in the third quarter, driven by growth in feed, fertilizer, soybeans and corn.
These volumes benefited from growth to export markets, along with increased volumes to key processors in the
southeast and fertilizer growth was driven by the continued ramp up of the phosphate and potash markets.

As shown on the next slide, Paper and Forest Products volume was up 7% in the third quarter, driven by increased
demand for kale and clay and wood pulp in the export market. In addition, lumber volume was up as a result of modest
growth in a weak housing market.
And finally, Automotive volume declined 1% in the quarter, due to the redesign of our Ford Network. Without this
year-over-year adjustment, which reduced volume in the quarter by 8,300 loads versus last year, Automotive volume
would have increased 10%. We also expect new auto assembly plants now being completed by Volkswagen, shown
here, and BMW, shown on the next slide, to add to our Auto business in the months ahead. These two plants combined
will represent 230,000 new units of production and over 3,600 new jobs in their respective markets. Volkswagen's
outbound rail shipments are slated to begin late in the second quarter of next year. The plant will build a new mid-sized
sedan and have the capacity to build 150,000 vehicles annually. And BMW's plant expansion is now complete and will
increase capacity from 150,000 vehicles to 200,000 units starting in early 2011, with over 50% of production being
exported out of the Port of Charleston.
Now let's turn to our outlook. As we move into the fourth quarter and beyond, we expect to see continued growth in our
core business, which will be supplemented by project growth and our ongoing corridor strategy. We expect Chemicals
will continue to expand, as we marked a record high revenue level in the third quarter. Our outlook for the Agricultural
market remains bright and we expect the September 2010 through April 2011 grain export season to be very positive,
with double-digit growth going forward. Our Steel business, which includes export and domestic met coal, along with
finished iron and steel volumes, will continue to benefit from the slow but gradual recovery in global steel production.
Current dynamics in the trucking industry, including high labor costs and tighter truckload capacity, along with
improving economic conditions coupled with our developing corridor strategy, bode well for continued Intermodal
conversion ahead. And as previously mentioned, projected increased electricity demand from economic growth, along
with lower stockpiles should positively impact utility coal's performance as well. We expect to see growth in all of our
Coal market segments in the fourth quarter and for the next year.
In summary, as shown in the final slide, we now have seen sequential volume recovery in each quarter since the third
quarter of 2009. Third quarter volumes were 33,000 loads, or 2% higher than the second quarter, and 170,000 loads
higher than the first quarter of this year. Economic conditions, while still challenging with respect to housing and
unemployment, continue to show sequential improvement in industrial production and global trade. Our third quarter
volume growth of 15% reflects that positive trend, along with strong project growth across our core markets. We expect
this positive trend to continue through the fourth quarter and throughout 2011, as gradual economic recovery and
targeted business development efforts converge. Finally, we remain confident in our ability to provide safe, reliable and
efficient service to our customers, which supports higher value pricing in the marketplace ahead.
Thank you for your attention. And I'll now turn the podium over to Mark for our operations report.
Mark D. Manion, Executive Vice President Operations and Chief Operating
Officer
Thank you, Don, and good afternoon, everyone. Starting with safety, Norfolk Southern's safety performance through
the third quarter stands at 0.94 injuries per 200,000 employee hours worked, which is a 22-point reduction, or 19%
improvement for the same period in 2009. For consecutive quarters during 2010, we have improved our safety
performance, recording sequential improvement each quarter this year. We attribute this improvement to our ongoing
safety training, which reinforces the importance of effective job briefings, teamwork and communication.
Turning to our operating performance, our road and yard crew starts increased 8.1% over the third quarter of 2009 as
we modified our operating plan to efficiently handle the increasing volumes. Of course this is well below our carload
unit increase of 15% and 14% for gross ton miles for the same period.
Turning to the next Slide, train and engine employment increased by 501, or 4.8% in the third quarter, as we continue
to strategically hire to support traffic growth where we had let attrition decrease employee counts in 2008 and 2009. As

I stated last quarter, all T&E employees have been returned from furlough status. To-date, we have authorized the
hiring of 1,550 conductor trainees, with the first of those trainees now starting to come off the training program ready
for placement.
Turning to our composite service performance on Slide 5, this measure is a composite of train performance, connection
performance and operating plan adherence. We are responding well to the 15% increase in volumes, as our service
improved from the first to second quarters and again from the second to third quarter. We will continue to see
improvements as we align resources to our operating plan in order to meet demand and drive further improvement
going forward.
Finally, turning to our Productivity Scorecard, in light of carload unit volume being up 15% for the quarter, you'll note
that we have been able to very effectively manage the operating plan. Substantially higher volumes have been handled
with only an 8% increase in crew starts. For the quarter, total railroad employment was increased 3% over the same
period of 2009. Gross ton miles per employee continued improvement in the third quarter, while gross ton miles per
gallon of diesel fuel stayed constant. Gross ton miles per train hour declined 1% and car hire days per carload increased
4%, with a slight degradation in train speed and terminal dwell.
Thank you. And let me turn it over to Jim.
James A. Squires, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. I will now review our financial results for the third quarter. Let's start
with our operating results. As Don described, railway operating revenues for the quarter reached 2.5 billion, up 393
million, or 19%, compared to the third quarter of last year. Slide 3 shows our total operating expenses, which increased
by 209 million, or 14%, for the quarter. Income from railway operations grew 33% to 746 million. The generous
increase in revenues, driven by higher volumes and revenue per unit, was partly offset by increased operating expenses.
The resulting operating ratio was 69.6%, only 50 basis points shy of our record third quarter operating ratio set in 2008.
Turning to our expenses, here are the major components of the 209 million net increase. Much like our second quarter
results, compensation and benefits and fuel expenses accounted for over 70% of the variance. Slide 5 reflects the
components of the 14% increase in compensation and benefits. First, volume related payroll increased 34 million,
including 18 million for train and engine employees. Second, medical benefits increased 20 million, largely related to
higher agreement employee health and welfare premiums, coupled with increased retiree medical costs. Third,
incentive compensation was up 13 million, due primarily to stronger financial results. Pension expenses were 8 million
higher and payroll taxes increased 7 million. Finally, increased agreement wage rates and other compensation expenses
were offset by lower stock-based compensation, which reflected last year's strong improvement in performance
metrics.
As shown on Slide 6, fuel increased by 67 million, or 35%. As displayed on Slide 7, nearly two-thirds of the increase in
fuel expense was due to higher prices. Our average price per gallon of diesel fuel was 2.19 an 18% increase compared
with the third quarter of 2009. Consumption was up 14%, one percentage point below the increase in unit volumes.
Slide 8 highlights the 41 million, or 28%, increase in materials and other expenses. Materials usage for equipment and
roadway maintenance increased with higher volume levels. In addition, prior-year results benefited from more
favorable property tax accrual adjustments and more favorable personal injury claims development. Purchase services
and rents increased 25 million, or 7%, reflecting increased equipment rents and other volume-related services.
Slide 10 displays our non-operating items. The majority of the net increase is due to a gain on the sale of land to the
city of Virginia Beach and coal royalties, which reflect a favorable one-time settlement reached during this quarter.
As illustrated on Slide 11, income before income taxes increased 233 million, or 48%, principally due to higher
operating income. Income taxes totaled 269 million and the effective rate was 37.7%. Income taxes last year were 178
million, with an effective rate of 37%.

Turning to Slide 13, third quarter net income was 445 million, an increase of 142 million compared to last year. And
diluted earnings per share were $1.19, a $0.38 per share increase.
Slide 14 presents our year-to-date cash flows. Cash provided by operations increased over 50%, easily covering capital
expenditures, share repurchases and dividends. Share repurchases in the third quarter were 323 million, as we bought
back 5.8 million shares. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter equaled 1.1 billion.
Thank you for your attention and I will now turn the program back over to Wick.
Charles W. Moorman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Jim. As you've heard, our third quarter performance continues to showcase our balanced customer
portfolio, superior service product and ability to generate operating cash flows to fund substantial core and strategic
investments in our franchise.
From an investment perspective, our current estimate for 2010 capital spending is about $1.5 billion. While our 2011
capital plans have not been finalized, we do anticipate that our spending next year will be higher, driven by spending on
positive train control, new locomotives, the conclusion of our implementation of SAP and reinvestment in our coal car
fleet.
In addition, we're also looking at our ongoing equipment strategy as to the advantages of ownership rather than our
current policy of leasing some of our core assets, particularly given current financing rates. At the same time, we are
and will remain committed to returning value to our owners through our industry-leading dividend yield and ongoing
share repurchases.
Looking ahead, we expect that the economy will continue to expand, albeit at the fairly low rates that we have seen
over the past couple of quarters. Our strategy remains to continue to grow our business profitably through a continuing
focus on, and investment in, improving our service and strengthening our franchise. We are optimistic that we can
continue to grow our traffic at a pace that exceeds the growth in gross domestic product and that volume growth,
combined with our focus on improving margins, will drive superior shareholder returns. Our third quarter results
illustrate our ability to execute this strategy and I am confident that Norfolk Southern will build on this quarter's
momentum to drive a superior product for our customers and superior financial results.
Thanks for your attention and I'll now turn the program over to the operator for your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Jon Langenfeld with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead
with your question.
<Q - Jon Langenfeld>: Good afternoon. On your modal side, can you talk a little bit about the pricing there? I
understand the mix impact you described, but even adding that back, I think your revenue per unit would be up only
2%. Can you talk about that in light of the fact that volumes were so strong and your ability to take rate increases
through the year?
<A - Charles W. Moorman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Jon, we are seeing some
improvement in truckload pricing in the marketplace. With respect to our third quarter traffic, as I mentioned in the
comments, about 55%, 56% of our growth in our domestic sector came east of the Mississippi, which is generally
shorter-haul traffic. It's a good business for us, but it generates RPU that is a little less than transcon or longer-haul
business. So that factors into the RPU, as well as the increase in empty repositionings that I mentioned as well. So
all-in-all, we're seeing a gradually improving marketplace for intermodal pricing and we think that will continue based

on what we see right now.
<Q - Jon Langenfeld>: Okay, good. And then the second question: any insight from the ocean liners in terms of the
international import traffic as it relates to intermodal in terms of what sort of signals they're giving you relative to
year-end and into the early part of next year with the Chinese New Year being so early this time?
<A - Charles W. Moorman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I think in general, the consensus is
that we experienced a mini peak, I would call it a mini peak, this year starting in August. That mini peak is already
beginning to top-out and that's not too surprising. So I think that they are seeing slow and steady recovery of volumes,
but it's uneven and it's certainly not in a straight line in terms of volume growth.
<Q - Jon Langenfeld>: Okay. Thank you.

The next question is from Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - William Greene>: Yes, hi there, good afternoon. Wick, I remember at the Investor Day that you had a year,
year-and-a-half ago, you had talked about Norfolk Southern's approach to a downturn being sort of conservative and
that you wanted to maintain resources to be prepared for when the volumes came back. And so clearly, we're seeing
sort of the upside advantage; the incremental margins have come back from that perspective. But what I also thought
would happen was that Norfolk Southern would see materially better incremental margins than competitors and I don't
think we're seeing that. So I'm wondering if there are sort of lessons learned here or any way to kind of think about how
you might approach this differently going forward based on kind of similar performance to the peers at this point.
<A - Charles W. Moorman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well I don't know, I won't
comment so much about performance as compared to our peers. I think that we did have a policy, as we talked about, in
terms of trying to think conservatively going into the downturn. At the time that we were talking about that, the
downturn really had not hit us in the way that it did. As we have recovered, I think that we have shown good operating
leverage. We did keep an eye on being able to recover well. I think that we've seen some extraordinary volume shifts,
as we talked about, and you have seen good operating metrics and good operating leverage, as Mark and Jim have
described. So I think that all things considered, we've come through in a way that we would have expected. And the
other thing that we have continued to do, as you know, is continue to invest in the property and that's a point we talked
about a lot, that we were going to continue with strengthening the franchise, investing in the technology we think that's
important for the future and that's what we did and that's what we continue to do.
<Q - William Greene>: Yes, that's true and that's sort of a good segue to the second question. If I think about what
you're doing with intermodal and the huge investments that you've made there, clearly it's going to deliver volume
growth. But my sense is, and I think Don even mentioned this, that it's truckload conversion that will drive a lot of this
from the highway and I sort of think of that as kind of definitionally being more competitive business. So how do we
guarantee or how do we ensure that the returns there can be as good as some of the other businesses, I'm thinking for
example, like Bulk?
<A - Charles W. Moorman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I think you raised a good
question. It is definitionally competitive, but we think that we are out there competing very effectively for that
business. And we think that as that business develops, the combination of the volumes that we'll handle and more
volume improves margin, as we spread network costs over a larger and larger number of units and the focus that a lot
of our investment has in terms of making the intermodal operation more and more efficient. In terms of technology and
in terms of terminals, we feel confident that we're going to continue to develop business growth and volumes that are at
margins that we're comfortable with and provide a good return for our shareholders. And I think if you kind of think
about it from a very high level, the operating ratios that we are posting, with the large volume increases we're seeing in
the domestic intermodal are an illustration that we're able to do that.
<Q - William Greene>: Yes, okay. Thanks for the time.

The next question is from Tom Wadewitz with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Thomas Wadewitz>: Yes, good afternoon.
<A - Charles W. Moorman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi, Tom.
<Q - Thomas Wadewitz>: I wanted to ask you a bit more on coal. You seem to have a pretty optimistic outlook, I
think, across the board in all the major drivers of your coal volume. How does some of the potential production issues
and greater regulatory push-back on Central Appalachian coal, how does that affect your network; is that a risk or is it
as simple as if you don't source it from Central App, you'll source it from somewhere else? I guess it's really a second
question, but how do we think about natural gas sensitivity? It just seems like natural gas may stay at low levels which
eventually would be a risk for coal. So those two questions on coal outlook.
<A - Charles Moore>: Tom, we certainly are seeing more diversity with respect to coal sourcing taking place,
although I would point out that Central App production's up this year about 4%, even with what's going on in terms of
further environmental restrictions on mining. But we are well positioned to source coal from Central App, Northern
App, the Illinois basin, RPRB and we're participating in all of those flows. And we feel comfortable that demand is
going to be there and the sourcing of the coal is going to be there to match up with it.
With respect to natural gas, we still see gas at low cost levels, but quarter-over-quarter, it was up about 38%, 39%
compared to last year. And coming through this summer, we saw very, very little diversion of coal burn to gas; it took
all the generation capacity there. I think that based on continued economic recovery and the demand for natural gas
right now, it's a little bit below $4.00, but I think depending upon what the winter looks like, we'll see that come back
up over $4.00. And everything that we're being told by our utilities is for us to expect heavy demand for utility coal
restocking for the stockpile replenishment, as well as ongoing generation demand.
<Q - Thomas Wadewitz>: One follow-up on that. Is there potentially a lagged impact from the low natural gas where
you have minimum commitments in your contracts and the miners do as well and then when you start to roll over those
and have lower minimums or the utilities negotiate lower minimums, that you would see kind of a lagged impact if you
do have lower natural gas or you think you've already kind of seen the switching that's likely to take place given current
gas prices?
<A - Charles W. Moorman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I think what we're seeing is the
latter and we've already seen it.
<Q - Thomas Wadewitz>: Okay, great. Thanks for the time.
<A - Charles W. Moorman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Thank you, Tom.

Your next question is from Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Thanks very much. Good afternoon.
<A - Charles W. Moorman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi, Walt.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: My first question I guess is on the pricing. I know it's not something you like to give color
on or guidance on, but I guess, perhaps, you could give us a sense of how your renewals were doing in the quarter and
perhaps what percentage of your book next year is locked in currently.

<A - Charles W. Moorman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: We have, Walter, well over 90%
of the business obviously locked in for this year and we are right at 60% locked in for 2011. With respect to our
ongoing renewals, they're within our target of meeting the overall objective that we have for pricing and yield.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: I guess that's your inflation-plus kind of target?
<A - Charles W. Moorman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Correct.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Okay. My second question is essentially on your capital program. I'm sort of trying to get an
order of magnitude here; there's two components that I'd just like you to address. The first is the condition of your coal
fleet and just looking at that and its condition, what sense of an increase are you seeing in renewing that coal fleet? And
then the second one, the order of magnitude of that switch that you mentioned from a leasing policy to an ownership
policy, just so we can get our head around some of the financial impact of that shift in policy?
<A - Charles W. Moorman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, let me first of all kind of
give you as, again, the caveat that we really haven't made any hard and fast decisions on capital budget to-date. But to
give you some idea of where we are, we were – and we have discussed this in a number of forums, we have a fairly
sizable coal fleet in excess of 20,000 cars that we own and we think that's advantageous for us. In fact, the demands of
our business around export and some of our other business really make it very desirable for us to own our own fleet.
And the majority of that fleet over the next six, seven, eight years will be reaching the end of its useful life. We've
already renewed in excess of 3,000 of those cars, we'll have a program that begins next year that order of magnitude is
probably going to average somewhere between 1,000 and 2,000 cars, maybe a little higher in some of the out years. As
-
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: That's on a per year basis, 1,000 to 2,000?
<A - Charles W. Moorman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: On a per year basis.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Okay.
<A - Charles W. Moorman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: As to your other question, we're
going to look at a fairly substantial portion of our assets that we currently have under lease, we'll look at when those
leases expire, we'll look to determine whether or not we think that those are assets that, because our assets are
long-lived, that if we buy them today, we're going to be using them for the foreseeable future. We own a lot of
equipment, so it is conceivable that we may be looking at assets that cost even up to a few hundred million dollars. But
we're going to do this; this is something we will take a look at, we'll look at financing, we'll think about all the
iterations, we will not do anything that we don't have a very clear view is going to provide positive value for us and our
owners.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Okay, that makes sense. I appreciate the color.

The next question is from Scott Flower with Macquarie Securities. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Scott Flower>: Yeah, good afternoon. Just a couple of questions. One was, Don, you were helpful on Intermodal.
What was the overall drag on your revenue per unit from mix in terms of the aggregate for the book of business?
<A - Charles W. Moorman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Scott, we do not have that for
distribution on the call.
<Q - Scott Flower>: Okay. And then just one clarification on the $13 you did mention for Intermodal, is that just the
empties or is that overall mix?
<A - Charles W. Moorman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: No, that's for the empty
repositioning.

<A - Charles W. Moorman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Correct.
<Q - Scott Flower>: Okay.
<A - Charles W. Moorman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: 13 is just related to empty revenue
repositionings.
<Q - Scott Flower>: Got it. Thank you. And then I'm just curious, for Mark, on the 1,000 or so head count that you
authorized in terms of hiring and training, how many of those are currently on the property?
<A - Mark D. Manion, Executive Vice President Operations and Chief Operating Officer>: We have really just
started to bring in our newly trained conductors. I've got about 60 that are on the ground, on the job and we will add
another 300 by the end of the year. And then we'll continue, with the pipeline we've got built up, we will continue a
pretty hefty rollout of conductors into next year.
<Q - Scott Flower>: But are the 300 folks that I'm assuming are on training that will be on the ground by end of year,
are they already in the head count numbers or are they actually started and they're just going into training?
<A - Mark D. Manion, Executive Vice President Operations and Chief Operating Officer>: The 500 I was
speaking of are in training now and of those, 300 will be actively on the ground working by the end of the year, a total
of about 360 by the end of year.
<Q - Scott Flower>: I'm just curious, were the 500 actually in the third quarter head count numbers or are those
actually going to show up more in fourth quarter?
<A - Mark D. Manion, Executive Vice President Operations and Chief Operating Officer>: That is a third quarter
count.
<Q - Scott Flower>: Okay. And then the other quick question, and just any color you can give, any further update you
can give us on the deployment of Movement Planner across the network?
<A - Charles W. Moorman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes. We have got four divisions
so far underway with Movement Planner and our schedule calls to add another four divisions during 2011.

The next question is from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Kenneth Hoexter>: Great. Good afternoon. Can you, Wick, maybe just talk a bit about the potential cost savings
from the new corridor that you've seen since you've launched Heartland in terms of cutting down maybe mileage or
your ability to double-stack? And maybe just talk about the cost side of that equation.
<A - Charles W. Moorman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, we don't give out the
specific cost figures on any of that. But we predicated the project on the fact that we were going to be able to move a
significant amount of traffic, particularly over the long-term on this more direct route instead of sending it around a
couple of far more circuitous paths. Mark, we've put a couple of extra trains over there already, I believe; what were the
numbers?

<A - Mark D. Manion, Executive Vice President Operations and Chief Operating Officer>: We have, we've added
two trains over there and more importantly, we are filling out the trains that we've got, double-stacking them.
<A - Charles W. Moorman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes, so we are seeing the benefits
of the corridor being opened up now and we expect as business grows that those benefits will become significantly
higher.
<Q - Kenneth Hoexter>: So when you mentioned earlier it was what, you had shifted 30% of – you threw out some
numbers in the intro, 30% you were moving, 20% more. I just want to understand what you were kind of providing
then; is that of the total intermodal or is that within that region?
<A - Charles W. Moorman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Go ahead, Don.
<A - Donald W. Seale, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer>: Ken, in the corridor, there's about
60% of the business that currently moves to and from Hampton Roads and some of the other corridors that feed in to
the Heartland corridor that will be converted. And we have ramped up 30% of that 60% conversion...
<Q - Kenneth Hoexter>: Okay.
<A - Charles W. Moorman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Ken, to give you the color, we
were running one single-stack intermodal train each way through there daily, we were running a couple around that
were double-stack. And that's the traffic that we will, first of all, now be able to load up the train that we were running
and then shift the other traffic. As Don mentioned, we shifted a good amount when we finished the Clearance project to
Cincinnati from Columbus, we'll ship more.
<Q - Kenneth Hoexter>: That's helpful, thank you, Wick. Don, when you were talking, I guess, in one of the answers
before going through the utility coal and kind of your outlook there, you kind of left off on the export side. And it
looked like we've seen that kind of slowing trend on your slide earlier. You talked about Europe having high
inventories; is there an outlook that continues that trend on softening over the next few quarters on the export side or
are you as confident there as you are on the maybe on the utilities side?
<A - Donald W. Seale, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer>: Well, we remain positive on
export, Ken. As I mentioned, our export traffic over at the Port Baltimore is up significantly. We saw some tough
comps at Lamberts Point and the business did soften a little bit in the third quarter. I will tell you that based on what
we're seeing in the fourth quarter in terms of bookings and the look ahead, we see that as a pause as opposed to a
change in market direction.
<Q - Kenneth Hoexter>: Okay. And then just lastly, if I can just throw on the empties, is that – I guess now that we've
seen a bit of a slowdown in the enroll side, is the empty repositioning lightening up or is that something that you're
seeing continue into the fourth quarter?
<A - Charles W. Moorman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: So far in October, we see that
continuing. I would suspect that it would start to mitigate at some point if container capacity, overall capacity
improves.
<Q - Kenneth Hoexter>: All right, great. Thanks for the time.

traffic in the network is presently double-stacked or how much was, say, before you opened the Heartland Corridor and
how much that's changing?
<A - Donald W. Seale, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer>: Well, we were running stacks, so
we could clarify that. We were running stacks, but we were running them up over Harrisburg back over to Columbus
and towards Chicago or over from Norfolk to Knoxville and back up. So the available business that we will be
converting, approximately a third of that has already been converted, another 10% will be converted after we finish the
Cincinnati clearances that we mentioned. And then of course, we'll have market growth with that on top of that shift.
<A - Charles W. Moorman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: To amplify that a little bit more if
you look at our overall intermodal network, which we think is a great network and we have a premier service in a
number of significant corridors. I believe I'm correct to say this was the last one that wasn't cleared for stacked, so the
vast majority of our traffic that we can stack, we're stacking in all of those corridors.
<A - Donald W. Seale, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer>: Well, it's the complete network
after we finish Cincinnati. And the Bergen Tunnel in New Jersey opened up the northern route coming out of the
shared asset area.
<Q - Gary Chase>: Is there a way to think about how much mileage you might be saving? I mean is there a statistic
you can give us to give us some flavor for just how circuitous those alternate routings were?
<A - Donald W. Seale, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer>: 250-mile savings from the Port of
Hampton roads, Port of Virginia to the Ohio valley or Columbus, for example, which is a full day's transit.
<Q - Gary Chase>: And then just one other quick one, Don. You mentioned the coal inventories and I'm wondering if
there's any different flavor between the northern and southern utilities. When you think about what's changing at the
margin, whether we would expect that ramp in utility volume to be more northern or southern-focused?
<A - Donald W. Seale, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer>: We will continue to see the
northern utility coal move. We are seeing increased demand to the south and I think that that will continue to trend up. I
had mentioned that 20%, which is essentially 20 utility plants in our network of 100 utility plants, are now telling us
they're below their targeted inventory levels. And we'll tell you that a good portion of those 20 are not in the northern
utility region.

The next question is from Jason Seidl with Dahlman Rose. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Jason Seidl>: Evening, guys. Don, could you go over some of the mix shift that you saw in the carloads and how
it's going to impact 4Q, so we can start thinking about revenue per unit for 4Q? Are we going to see them all sort of
continue like you saw in 3Q or are some going to abate?
<A - Donald W. Seale, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer>: In terms of the description that we
gave here on third quarter, certainly the coal RPU will continue to see the mix effects that I described, although we will
continue to see a little bit more southern utility coal, as I just mentioned, which will help mitigate some of that. With
respect to the carload business, we're going to continue to see in the fourth quarter some of the dynamics in the grain
market that I mentioned, the Chemical market with the fly ash, we'll actually see a reduction in fly ash, so some
improvement in chemical RPU for the fourth quarter. And everything else in terms of Metals and Construction should
be fairly constant for the fourth quarter.

out your favorable one-time settlement in the coal royalties? And if you didn't, could you please, what it was?
<A - James A. Squires, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Sure, this is Jim. As I mentioned,
the majority of the increase in other income that was first the gain on the land sale to the city of Virginia Beach which
was 35 million and then the settlement portion of the coal royalties increase was 13 million.
<Q - Jason Seidl>: It was 13 million? Okay.

The next question is from Scott Malat with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with you question.
<Q - Scott Malat>: All right, thanks. Just a quick follow-up on the other income. I know it's a bit lumpy, but how do
we think about that line; is the run rate kind of 15 million from here or should we think of it differently?
<A - Charles W. Moorman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, looking back, an average is
somewhat uninformative in the volatility in other income net, but this quarter to compare a recurring item, other income
net, where about [inaudible] and we think that's a reasonable number for other income net going forward.
<Q - Scott Malat>: Okay.
<A - Charles W. Moorman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: For recurring items that is.
<Q - Scott Malat>: Thanks. The other question I had was just a little aside. There's been a small business bill, I think it
applies to you also though in September, that made a provision for accelerated depreciation of assets. I think they can
depreciate 50% of CapEx incurred and placed in service in 2010. I'm wondering if you get a benefit on that?
<A - Charles W. Moorman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes and you saw a large increase
in deferred tax in this quarter reflecting the investment of that deferred tax provision in the three quarters, so that had an
increase in deferred taxes and we'll see a continuing benefit in the fourth quarter.
<Q - Scott Malat>: Is that the same kind of run rate from there?
<A - Charles W. Moorman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Bear in mind that the third quarter
reflects three quarters' worth of bonus depreciation and its impact on deferred taxes, so in the fourth quarter, you'll get
one quarter's worth.

the wrong direction or anything like that?

not providing in this discussion because frankly, I think that everyone understands our position with respect to
discussing price in the marketplace.
<A - Charles W. Moorman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes, let me amplify that. We have
said repeatedly, Don has said and we obviously believe this, that we are very confident that currently and over a
sustained period of time we're going to be able to maintain pricing above the levels of rail inflation. And we have
metrics that we look at, and as I say, it gives us confidence that we are doing that and will continue to do that. But I

it is to our advantage to enter into any kind of detailed discussion about price and that's why we say what we say and

<A - Mark D. Manion, Executive Vice President Operations and Chief Operating Officer>: Our attrition rate
generally runs about 8%, about 1,000 people. So as I've said, in our T&E ranks, we've authorized hiring 1,550 people
this year and we're up about 500, as I said, year-over-year so far. And I would think next year, we will be at least 1,500
and then probably more like authorizing 1,800 or even above that come next year and that's just in the transportation
side.
<Q - Edward Wolfe>: Thank you, that's helpful. And then, Don, just a little bit more on the coal expectation. I think
you said on the export side, there's been a pickup in fourth quarter that gives you confidence the lull in third quarter
was just a lull. Is that both on the steam and the met export side or is it one way heavier than the other?
<A - Donald W. Seale, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer>: Yes, the vast majority of our
export is metallurgical coal, very little steam.
<Q - Edward Wolfe>: So that pickup has been on the met side export.
<A - Donald W. Seale, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer>: Correct.
<Q - Edward Wolfe>: In the U.S., what's your view of met on very tough comps for next year; how do you think
about that?
<A - Donald W. Seale, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer>: Well, as I mentioned in the
comments, and you see our numbers up dramatically in the third quarter in terms of domestic met volume. We're being
told that stocks of domestic met coal for steel production are still below target levels, substantially below target levels,
so we're planning on continued growth in that segment.
<Q - Edward Wolfe>: Okay. And the last question: one of your competitors reduced their PTC capital spending. Are
you doing any of that; is that in the forecast for either this year or next?
<A - Charles W. Moorman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I haven't really seen too much
about what anyone else has said. Our PTC spending next year, we're not planning on reducing it in any way. We
continue to plan and move forward to follow the legislation's mandate and have the system operational where we need
it to by the end of 2015.
<Q - Edward Wolfe>: But what are you planning to spend in 2010?
<A - Charles W. Moorman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Order of magnitude this year, it is
under 100. It will be more than that next year.
<A - Donald W. Seale, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer>: Next year is in the range of 120.

The next question is from Chris Ceraso with Credit Suisse Group. Please go ahead.
<Q - Christopher Ceraso>: Thanks. Good evening. A couple of questions on the incremental margin. First, if I think
about the business overall, this year you've been running on a year-over-year basis in the, call it, 50% range give or
take. As you get into next year and you're starting to hire people and you're starting to add equipment, where does that
moderate to; is it something in the 30% range, more normal for this business? How do you think about that?
<A - Donald W. Seale, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer>: Chris. I think there's still room to
run on incremental margin, especially this year. Getting into next year, it becomes more challenging, but we think that
certainly lower operating ratios, that being one key to improve the incremental margin, are also within reach. But it is
fair to say, we think, that it will become more challenging next year to produce further improvements in incremental
margin.
<Q - Christopher Ceraso>: Well, I mean you'll still earn some incremental margin on revenue growth, right, it just
won't be as high?
<A - Donald W. Seale, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer>: Right, right. When I say further
improvements, I mean in comparison to the incremental margin we've seen this year.
<Q - Christopher Ceraso>: Okay. And then maybe you can help me with the kind of the marginal economics of the
Intermodal business, particularly as you go from single to double-stack. What's the marginal benefit of adding a second
box on top; is that a 90% profit on that or what are the economics of the extra box?
<A - Donald W. Seale, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer>: Well I don't know that I have the
exact numbers in front of me, but I think it's fair to say that it's significant just in terms of it's that many more boxes per
– you're leveraging your train starts, you're leveraging your network costs. You still have costs around lifts, there is
some incremental fuel costs, so I'm not sure I'd be comfortable with 90%. It depends also on type of businesses as to
whether there's drey involved and who's paying for the drey, but it's certainly a significant driver of efficiency to be
able to stack.
<Q - Christopher Ceraso>: Okay. Thank you.

The next question is from Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Newcrest. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Cherilyn Radbourne>: Thanks very much and good afternoon. I think most of my questions have been asked
already, but nobody has asked you about the regulatory landscape, so maybe I'll just ask you for a bit of an update there
and any comments you have on the risk the STB may start to direct its attention to rail-to-rail competition and access
issues, et cetera.
<A - Donald W. Seale, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer>: Well, a lot of folks talk about this
all the time, so I'll be brief. But while never saying never, it certainly looks like this Congress will adjourn without
anything having happened on the legislative front in terms of rail regulation. We'll have to see what the new Congress
brings, but it's an issue that's been out there for 20 years, so we'll obviously be continuing to talk about it.
As far as the STB goes, that's an interesting question, but the STB has as its first mandate to ensure that railroads earn
an adequate return on capital. And I think we are confident that the STB knows that mandate and will be guided by it in
the decisions that they make in the future. But we'll obviously continue to watch that very closely as well.

Next question is from Jeff Kauffman from Sterne, Agee. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Kanchana Pinnapureddy>: Hi. It's actually Kanchana Pinnapureddy for Jeff Kauffman. We had a quick
question on – we wanted to get a better sense of why train speeds were down while terminal dwell is up, just kind of
trying to understand if this something new and unique or what's going on?
<A - Donald W. Seale, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer>: Well, let me address that. Train
speeds are down. The good news is that the railroad is operating well, fluid, good fluidity in the terminals, good
connection performance, which of course is very important to our customers. And as we paddle hard in order to get the
resource level up to where these nice volumes have been, that will improve our train speed. These conductor forces that
are now coming on will give us a lot of help in that area and we're also taking delivery of more locomotives through the
fourth quarter and actually first quarter as well. So those resources will give us a nice boost as we get our train speeds
back up.
<Q - Kanchana Pinnapureddy>: Got it. And then on the terminal dwell side?
<A - Donald W. Seale, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer>: The terminal dwell has really been
the same story. To the extent that we have instances where we don't have crews available to pull a train as timely as we
would like, that of course increase our dwell time. And over these next several months as our crews come available,
we'll see not only the velocity improve but we'll see that dwell time drop back to the historically low levels that we've
had.
<Q - Kanchana Pinnapureddy>: Got it. And you think that will happen next quarter or in two quarters?
<A - Donald W. Seale, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer>: That is something that we will see
as we go on through. As we go on through the quarter, we'll see improvement in November and then even more so in
December as we have more resources available.
<Q - Kanchana Pinnapureddy>: Got it. Thank you so you much. It's been very helpful.

The next question is from Justin Yagerman with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Robert Salmon>: Hey, good evening, guys. It's Rob Salmon on for Justin. You had spoken a little bit earlier
about the Movement Planner software that you guys are implementing. Could you give us a sense what sort of
productivity improvements you're seeing on the four divisions where it's currently running, whether you're talking
about kind of gross ton miles per train hour or gross ton miles per gallon, what that technology is helping you guys do?
<A - Donald W. Seale, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer>: Well, keep in mind it's pretty early
in the game and we like what we see so far. With this relatively modest deployment so far. We are seeing in the
neighborhood of a 2 to 4 mile-an-hour improvement, which in railroad parlance is a pretty big deal. That equates to
about a 10% to 20% velocity improvement. So we'll keep working on that, we'll keep rolling that out and the early
indications are that is the nature of the improvement.
<Q - Robert Salmon>: That's helpful on that front. A couple kind of quick just basic update questions. I didn't see fuel
surcharge revenue in the slide; could you guys provide us with what that was in third quarter?
<A - Charles W. Moorman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Sure. The fuel surcharge revenue
in the third quarter of this year was 179 million versus 99 million in the third quarter of 2009 for a favorable delta of 80

million.
<Q - Robert Salmon>: Thanks. And then finally on the sidelined capacity, could you give us a sense what sort of
locomotives you guys currently have parked that could be deployed as well as rail cars?
<A - Donald W. Seale, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer>: Well, we do not have any
locomotives in storage. We've pulled them into action and we've leased some locomotive power, but more importantly,
we are taking delivery of some new power. As I mentioned, this fourth quarter, we're going to get 42 locomotives and
then another 50 as we go into 2011 during the first half.
<Q - Robert Salmon>: And on the rail car side?
<A - Donald W. Seale, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer>: On the rail car side, we have still
got some storage, but it has dwindled down. Last I looked it was in the 6,000 to 7,000 range.
<Q - Robert Salmon>: I really appreciate the time, guys.
<A - Donald W. Seale, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer>: Sure.

Our next question is from Anthony Gallo with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Anthony Gallo>: Yes, thanks for getting to my question. I guess it's also on network capacity, if I have my
numbers right, it looks like your 2010 carloads will finish up somewhere between 10% and 12% below 2007 levels,
let's call it the pre-recession peak. But it sounds like you've got resource needs now, so I'm just trying to reconcile.
Carloads aren't where they used to be but assets are; I'm just trying to reconcile that.
<A - Mark D. Manion, Executive Vice President Operations and Chief Operating Officer>: Well, in light of the
volume that came on rapidly, that created the resource needs. Like I said, that should rectify itself as we go through the
fourth quarter and on into the new year, so that's good. And then that will help us get our velocity back up to where it
has historically been and as you know, that in itself, that creates room on the railroad; there's a lot of benefit to that. We
both get the benefit of turning the assets more quickly and it frees up capacity on the railroad.
<A - Charles W. Moorman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes, if you look at where we are
compared to those volumes, we're certainly not seeing infrastructure issues in terms of capacity. Locomotives, we had
retired some, so the number had gone down, but as Mark said, we've got a few leased right now because of velocity
issues.
Where we are still substantially below 2007, though, is on the train and engine service head count. And as Mark has
outlined, we've got plans to bring that back up. But if you look at the relative numbers between 2007, 2008 train and
engine service and our current numbers in service today, we're down substantially and that's the issue we're addressing.
<Q - Anthony Gallo>: Does mix play a role; is there just coincidentally less unit train business now then there was in
'07?
<A - Charles W. Moorman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: No, there's no less. Mix does play
something of a role in terms of how we dispatch crews and locomotives. And so we're seeing, as Don pointed out, we're
really seeing some very heavy unit train business right now because in addition to the coal, we're handling a lot more
export grain than we were a couple of years ago and some additional grain for domestic users as well, as we've
implemented our 75-car unit grain train network. So if anything, we're seeing more unit trains rather than fewer these
days.
<Q - Anthony Gallo>: Great. Thank you.

The last question is from Donald Broughton with Avondale Partners. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Donald Broughton>: Good afternoon, gentlemen. The plant expansion for BMW and the Volkswagen plant, only
you serve those plants or do both you and CSX serve those plants? In other words, are you going to be able to capture
all the incremental volume or is there some competition for that?
<A - Donald W. Seale, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer>: Don, we serve the BMW plant
exclusively and the Volkswagen plant will be jointly served and we're confident that we'll get our share of the business.
<Q - Donald Broughton>: I'm sure of that. When is the Volkswagen plant due to open?
<A - Donald W. Seale, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer>: It'll be ramping up production in
the second quarter of 2011.
