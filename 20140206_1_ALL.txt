after the call.
Now, let me turn it over to Tom Wilson.
Thomas J. Wilson
Well, good morning. Thank you for investing your time and money in Allstate. I'll start by covering our 2013 results as
they relate to our strategy and our operating priorities for both 2013 and 2014. Steve will then go through the business
unit results and talk about capital management.
With us today for the Q&A period are Matt Winter, who of course, leads Allstate Personal Lines; Don Civgin, who is
responsible for Allstate Financial and Esurance; Kathy Mabe, who leads Allstate Business to Business operations; Judy
Greffin, our Chief Investment Officer; and Sam Pilch, our Corporate Controller.
So, let's begin on slide 2. Our strong 2013 results demonstrate success in executing what is a broad and comprehensive
approach at creating shareholder value. It includes obviously strong operating income, balancing risk and return,
aggressive capital management, and you see accelerating growth as well this quarter, which are all resulting from
achieving our operating priorities for the year.
Overall, 2013 provides a very solid foundation as we continue to aggressively implement our strategy, which is to
differentiate the value proposition between customer segments.
Starting at the top, revenues increased 3.6% to $34.5 billion in 2013, which reflects 1.5% growth in policies, and of
course, with contributions from all the brands. Net income of $2.3 billion declined slightly from 2012, primarily due to
the $521 million after-tax loss and the pending sale of Lincoln Benefit Life and the impact from repurchasing debt.
Operating income of $2.7 billion for the year was 24% higher than 2012, primarily due to lower catastrophe losses.
Operating income per diluted share increased 30% to $5.68 per share as a result of higher operating income and the
impact of the share repurchases.
Book value per common share also increased over the prior year, both including and excluding fixed income unrealized
gains or losses. Operating return on equity is 14.5% for the latest 12 months.
If you go to slide 3 on the top, we show our five operating priorities for 2013. On the bottom, we show the four distinct
consumer segments we serve through our competitively differentiated strategy along with their respective growth in
profitability. The three brands where we underwrite risk Allstate, Encompass and Esurance all grew net written
premium and policies in force in 2013, compared with 2012. And we achieved all five of the 2013 operating priorities.
Starting in the lower left to the Allstate brand that of course serves customers who prefer local advice, assistance and
want a branded experience. Our policies grew in 2013 by 0.4% in the prior year, and Allstate brand auto policies in
force increased 1.5% versus a year ago and 0.6% versus the last quarter, which reflects both improved retention and
continued strong new business growth.
This growth is a result of one, the retention, but also we've expanded the Allstate agency, exclusive agency distribution.
We have effective marketing and less restrictive risk targets.
We've made substantial progress in improving returns in homeowners; as a result, the decline in homeowners' policies
was down 2.2% from year-end 2012 and flat versus the third quarter. The continued rollout of our house and home
product across the country will support our future multi-policy household focus.
Overall, Allstate brand profitability improved in 2013 with a combined ratio of 89.9 and an underlying combined ratio
of 85.8 due to auto profitability, good underlying homeowner margins, and lower catastrophe losses.
Esurance brand, which serves the self-directed brand-sensitive customer, is in the lower right, generated significant
premium and policy growth in 2013. Premiums written increased by 27.9%, and policies in force increased by 26.7%
compared to 2012.

The combined ratio finished 2013 at 117.5, reflected continued high levels of marketing spend – you'll remember – and
that's where we expense all of our advertising right up front, investments in expanding both geographically and from a
product perspective; continued expensing of acquisition intangibles; and the impact of higher loss ratios on new
business.
Esurance continues to adjust its pricing and underwriting to ensure the growth we're experiencing generates long-term
profitability. These actions caused growth to decelerate a little bit in the third and fourth quarters, and we expect
growth to decline somewhat in 2014.
The Encompass brand in the upper left quadrant serves customers through independent agents that provide a choice of
brands. Our unique package policy represents about 80% of Encompass' total premium. This brand also grew its
policies up 6.5% compared to 2012. The combined ratio for 2013 was 95.9, an improvement of 10.5 points from the
prior-year, which was driven by a significant decrease in catastrophes and improved underlying performance in
homeowners' line. The auto insurance margins in this brand still needs to be improved.
Now, let's move to slide 4. We had a great year. Now it's time to move forward. 2013's operating priorities are
compared to the five operating priorities for 2014 to highlight, the evolution we're going through which is from
focusing and strengthening the core business to positioning for sustainable growth.
The operating priority in 2014 on growth is in units rather than premium, as the importance of market share growth is
now greater than raising average prices on homeowners' insurance.
Secondly, we want to maintain the underlying combined ratio in 2014, this combines the second and third priorities
from 2013 and reflects the significant improvements made in the underlying margin at homeowners.
Proactively managing investment risk and return remains a priority, although the focus will shift. Now that the interest
rate risk has been lowered in the property-liability portfolio, the investment focus will shift from public fixed income
corporate securities to other high-yielding assets, typically in the private market, where returns are not as linked to
overall market performance.
The 2014 priority to modernize the operating model is a broader and more sustainable approach to the 2013 priority of
reducing the cost structure. We'll continue to take a broad look at improving the way we do business, which means, and
that's of course starting with the customer, so we're pursuing continuous improvement, simplifying our processes and
streamlining our technology to deliver faster, better and more cost-efficient service. This will lead to improved
customer satisfaction and fund further investments in growing our business.
To continue increasing shareholder value, focus is being increased in building long-term growth platforms. So, we'll
continue to look at ways to become an even more integral part of our customers' lives, the evolution, of course, is a
connected customer and telematics and there's a number of structural and technological changes that offer good growth
opportunities for us.
Finally, in keeping with our practice to provide you an outlook for our property-liability underlying combined ratio for
the next year, that's 2014, we set a range of 87 to 89, which is 1 point lower than last year's range.
Now, let me turn it back to Steve.
Steven E. Shebik
Thanks, Tom. I'll start by reviewing the 2013 financial highlights on slide 5. Starting at the top, property-liability had
earned premium of $27.6 billion in 2013, which grew 3.3% from 2012 and recorded a combined ratio of 92. The
underlying combined ratio for the year was 87.3, essentially flat to prior year and better than our full year outlook
range.
Catastrophe losses were $1.25 billion, $1.1 billion below 2012 and our lowest year of catastrophe losses since 2006.

Net investment income for the property-liability segment grew 3.7% from the prior year, reflecting very strong limited
partnership performance. As a result, operating income was $2.47 billion for the year; 35% higher than 2012. The
combined ratios on a recorded underlying basis for each brand are shown on the right hand side.
As discussed by Tom, the Allstate brand continued to generate solid profitability as the positive effects of rate changes
and low catastrophe losses, more than offset modest inflationary increases and loss costs.
The Encompass recorded combined ratio also improved from 2012, due to lower catastrophes and improved
homeowners margins. The Esurance combined ratio of 117.5 for 2013 improved 2.4 points from the prior year.
However, it remains elevated, as Tom noted earlier.
Allstate Financial, on the bottom left, had a 5% increase in premiums and contract charges in 2013, reflecting a 5.5%
increase in underwritten products, including a 10% increase at Allstate Benefits. Operating income of $588 million was
an 11.2% improvement over 2012, due primarily to an increase in investment margin, lower expenses, profitable
growth at Allstate Benefits, partially offset by a reduction in spread-based business and a lower benefit spread on our
life insurance. Net income of $95 million for 2013 was significantly lower than 2012, due to the loss in the pending
sale of Lincoln Benefit Life.
On slide 6, we show net written premium and policies in force in total and by brand. The red line shows that total
policies in force began growing in the second quarter of 2013. For protection in total, in the upper left chart, overall
policies grew 1.5% from last year and 0.5% from the third quarter. Each brand achieved growth in both net written
premium and policies in the fourth quarter and the full year.
Moving to the upper right chart, Allstate brand policies ended the year 0.4% higher than both 2012 and the preceding
quarter. The Allstate brand grew net written premium 3% in 2013, driven by higher average premiums and favorable
trends in both retention and in business.
Allstate brand auto net written premium increased 2.2% from prior year, while policies rose 1.5% from 2012. Allstate
brand homeowners net written premium grew 3.8% compared with 2012, while the unit volume decline continued to
slow, with fourth quarter 2013 homeowners policies flat to third quarter 2013.
On the bottom two charts, you can see growth trends for Encompass and Esurance, although remember the absolute
dollar scales are much smaller than the top two graphs. Both brands grew net written premium and policies compared
to 2012
Moving to slide 7, the charts on the left-hand side show the earned premium and underlying loss trends for Allstate
brand auto and home, while the charts on the right show the combined ratio trends. We have continued to maintain
overall margins in the Allstate brand.
With Allstate brand auto, you can see that earned premium and losses, which are somewhat more volatile, tend to move
in tandem over time as we closely manage rates to keep pace with loss development. In the last three quarters, losses
per policy have increased faster than earned premiums, leading to a slight deterioration in margin. Essentially, after
experiencing very favorable loss results at the end of 2012 and the first quarter of 2013, moderate increases in loss
costs have exceeded the increase in earned rates. Despite these increases, the underlying combined ratio for auto is still
within targeted range, and generates extremely attractive returns on capital.
For Allstate brand homeowners, shown on the bottom half of this slide, underwriting loss cost per policy is slightly
higher in 2013 than 2012, while earned premium per policy continues to rise. This improved the underlying combined
ratio by 2.4 points for 2013, to 62.7. The recorded combined ratio for the year was 77.9, 10.1 points better than the
prior year, reflecting the improved underlying margin and lower catastrophes.
The combined ratio trends are shown in the lower right-hand chart. You can see our underlying 12-month average
continues to decline, but at a slower rate as we approach price adequacy.
Our 2013 investment results, depicted on slide 8, reflect actions we have taken to reduce interest rate risk in the
property-liability portfolio, maintain alignment with Allstate Financial's changing liability profile, and actively

managing our equity investments.
As shown in the graph on the top of the slide, investment income before expenses was $1.08 billion in the fourth
quarter and the total portfolio yield was 4.8%. Investment income for the quarter was higher than the first three quarters
of 2013, or was slightly below the fourth quarter of 2012. We reported lower income from the interest-bearing portfolio
due to low reinvestment yields and a smaller asset base, driven by the decline in Allstate Financial's spread-based
liabilities.
The equity portfolio continued to benefit from strong limited partnership earnings, which increased by $92 million in
the quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2012, and partially offset the income decline in the interest-bearing
portfolio. The equity component of our portfolio continues to grow. We expect to earn attractive, but more variable,
returns over time in this component.
Moving to the total portfolio return in the bottom left, our total return for the fourth quarter was 1.1%. Net investment
income was a primary driver. Total return for the year was 1.8%, as higher equity valuations were offset by lower fixed
income valuations, as treasury rates rose during the year.
The level of unrealized gains in the portfolio fell from $5.5 billion at year-end 2012 to $2.7 billion at year-end 2013, as
shown in the lower right. The fixed income valuation decline resulting from the significant increase in treasury rates
was the primary driver of the $2.9 billion decline in unrealized gains for the year.
Our rate risk reduction actions positioned the property-liability portfolio to be less sensitive to rising interest rates and
pull forward future income through realization of gains and the sale of longer term securities, but lowers future
operating income.
Slide 9 depicts the trends in the Property-Liability and Allstate Financial portfolios, each of which comprised of
approximately half of the total portfolio. The Property-Liability on the top left, there's declining earned yield trend on
our interest-bearing portfolio, as seen by the gray line, reflecting the interest rate risk reduction activity during the year
and reinvestment in lower yielding, shorter duration bonds.
The impact of our actions is further illustrated in the scheduled maturity graph at the upper right, with the two declining
red bars at the longer maturities, so that only 10% of our portfolio is due after seven years, versus 32% at the end of last
year. While we continue to evaluate our overall investment portfolio risk exposure, we currently intend to maintain the
shorter maturity profile of our Property-Liability portfolio.
At the bottom of the page, you can see that Allstate Financial's net investment income has been more stable. Over the
past few years, Allstate Financial's investment cash flows have been used largely to fund liability outflows, so the
portfolio yield has not been impacted significantly by the low yields in new investments. Future investment income will
decline as liability outflows outpace new business and the sale of Lincoln Benefit Life is completed.
The last column in the table provides a pro forma view of investment results exclusive of LBL actual results. The
interest-bearing portfolio yield remains essentially unchanged, but investment income is $112 million lower, excluding
the LBL-related assets. The chart on the bottom right shows the ongoing decline in the Allstate Financial portfolio as
we continue to reduce spread-based liabilities.
Slide 10 shows the progress we have made in improving operating income return on equity from an inadequate return
of 8.6% in 2010. We communicated in 2011 our focus on five key drivers to increase operating income return on equity
to 13% by year-end 2014, as shown on the top of the page.
The underlying homeowners combined ratio, which represented over two-thirds of the expected improvement
opportunity, has improved steadily, from 72.9 in 2010 to 62.7 for 2013 and 60.7 for the fourth quarter of 2013. Auto
profitability has remained stable at a combined ratio of roughly 95%, continuing to generate very attractive returns.
When we established our goals in mid-2011, the expectation for the investment portfolio yield in the Allstate Financial
ROE was that interest rates would rise over time. This obviously hasn't materialized as [indiscernible] (19:06) are lower
than they were in 2011.

We have also proactively reduced rate risk in the property-liability portfolio, which has been a right economic decision,
even though; it reduced its operating income.
We continue on our track record of proactive management of capital, providing strong cash returns to shareholders
through dividends and share repurchases. Since 2011, Allstate Financial has returned over $1 billion in capital.
The 2013, 14.5% return on equity reflects favorable catastrophe losses. However, normalizing catastrophe losses and
adjusting for non-recurring charges such as the pension settlement charges, discontinued line of reserve strengthening
and restructuring charges, as well as excluding Esurance results, since we did not own Esurance at the time we
established the goal, still leaves the operating income ROE above 13%.
Slide 11 shows our capital position at December 31, compared to last year. We are in a stronger capital position,
reflecting excellent earnings to debt refinancing, changes in employee benefits and the replacement of higher cost debt
with capital that is longer term and has more flexibility such as perpetual preferred stock.
In the fourth quarter, we returned $565 million to shareholders to bring the total to $2.2 billion for the year. We
repurchased 1.8% of our outstanding common stock in the quarter or 8.4 million shares bringing the total repurchase
for the year to 7.8%. As of year-end, we had $139 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization.
As you know, we typically review our capital plans in the first quarter, following completion of our year-end reporting.
We estimate year-end statutory surplus to be a total of $18.2 billion with $15.2 billion estimated for the
property-liability companies.
During 2013, Allstate Financial company has returned $774 million of capital, including $500 million this quarter.
Holding company deployable assets were 2.6 billion at year-end.
As you scan down the slide, you can see our strong capital position at the beginning of the year is even stronger today.
Overall, in 2013, we made good progress in the execution of our customer-focused strategy and achieved all of our
priorities. We are well-positioned to aggressively implement our differentiated strategy, while delivering strong returns
to our shareholders.
Now, let's open up the call for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Bob Glasspiegel from Janney Montgomery Scott.
Your question, please?
<Q - Bob R. Glasspiegel>: Good morning. It seems like you have achieved your homeowners' goal in the low-60s.
Where do you stand on your overall homeowners' strategy going forward?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Bob, this is Tom. I'll make a comment and Matt can talk about what he's doing to turn the
line on homeowners. And I know, you've been after us several times, wanting to declare a victory on homeowners. We
feel really good about where it is now. If you look at the underlying combined ratio, it's in a good place. It's taken us
4-plus years to get there, and we're now positioned to be able to leverage it as a competitive advantage. Matt, can give
you some sense of how he's going to do that.
<A - Matthew Winter>: Hey, Bob.
<Q - Bob R. Glasspiegel>: Good morning.
<A - Matthew Winter>: Good morning. So, I'd mentioned previously, that we kind of have a 4-pronged approach to
the way we're looking at the homeowners' business and our strategy going forward.

The first was the rate adequacy component, which as you and Tom have been talking about and as you've been
mentioning on previous calls, we have made substantial progress on and we feel really good about our rate adequacy.
Right now, although, as things develop and change, we'll develop and change, but that's only one component of our
strategy.
The second component was to update and upgrade some of our product availability, which we did with house and
home, which you know, we've rolled out to a substantial part of the market. We launched it in about 27 states so far,
which is about three-quarters of our new business apps, and we'll continue to roll that out into some additional states
this year.
The third component of the strategy though, was to reassess our probable maximum loss and do what we call PML
optimization, and figure out, if there are ways to use that PML capacity in a more optimized way that enables us to
grow households and enables us to get benefits of diversification. And so, we've done a lot of work with our PML;
we've done a lot of work through reinsurance and we've done a lot of work on a very localized basis to ensure that we're
able to take on some additional homeowners' capacity without really raising our overall risk load.
But the fourth component of it – of the strategy is just general geographic diversification. We know that the more we're
able to grow in certain areas of the heartland, where we have non-correlated risk, just some of the coastal areas; it gives
us overall homeowners' capacity. And so, there's a lot of work underway to increase that geographic diversification,
growing some areas of the country where we have not historically grown and therefore enable us to grow additionally
in some of the regions where our capacity is constrained.
And all four of those prongs are enabled by our brokerage strategy, our Ivantage strategy, which allows us not to hurt
the customer as we do all those things. So, we always ensure we have a homeowners' product offering for our
customers and for our agency owners to offer to the customers, while we're changing things, assessing risks, adjusting
PML. And so, we've done a lot of work with our Ivantage agency and Northeast agencies to ensure we have
homeowner product availability throughout the country.
<Q - Bob R. Glasspiegel>: Thoughtful answer. Your third prong, in an environment where there is less – where
reinsurance costs are going down, are you taking the savings to the bottom line or using it to grow?
<A - Matthew Winter>: Yes.
<Q - Bob R. Glasspiegel>: A little bit of both?
<A - Matthew Winter>: I don't mean to be flip, but first of all, reinsurance prices change over time. It's hard to rely on
what the arbitrage may be over the long-term. So, you have to be thoughtful and I think disciplined in how we choose
to use that and how we choose to think about that in either reinvesting it or taking to the bottom line. So, I think we're
taking a fairly balanced approach. We may be reinvesting some of that savings and using some of it to enable us to
enter areas where we haven't been able to enter before.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Hey, Bob, this is Tom. Remember two things as well, so you don't just take change in
reinsurance pricing and pop it into the combined ratio, which is, we have a stacked program, so it rolls out over three
years, and we – reinsurance factors into our pricing. So, on a long-term basis to the extent reinsurance costs went down,
we'd be able to offer our customers that more value. We would make that up by growing better. So, it's not sort of just
an expense that comes and goes.
<Q - Bob R. Glasspiegel>: Thank you.
Operator
Our next question is from Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs. Your question, please?
<Q - Michael S. Nannizzi>: Thank you. Tom, do you guys have an estimate or an idea of what the potential January
losses may be for the first quarter?

everybody, like not just management, agency bonuses, I mean, there's a lot of people who are incented to drive growth
and profitability in a company. There was a little bit of a bump. It was more than that in the fourth quarter though,
because we had some catch up, because there was a pretty good strong run for the finish line.
<Q - Michael S. Nannizzi>: Got it. Okay. I mean, is there any way to control for that piece – or so we understand. Is
there any way to kind of think about what it might have been excluding that piece just to try and think about what the
forward might look like?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: I think, the best way to look at the underlying profitability, just look at the loss ratio piece.
The expense ratio will move around depending how much we're advertising in a quarter and those kinds of things. We
do expect the expense ratio to come down over time though.
<Q - Michael S. Nannizzi>: Got it. And then, clearly taking rate in homeowners, it seems to be slowing. I don't know
if that's the right interpretation. Do you expect to see – do you think you can continue to see PIF trends move in the
right direction as you continue to push for rate and maybe see some margin expansion there? Thanks.
<A - Matthew Winter>: Mike, I'm sorry. this is Matt. Were you referring just to homeowners there on rates?
<Q - Michael S. Nannizzi>: Yeah, mostly. I mean if you can comment on auto as well, but I was mostly talking about
homeowners, yeah.
<A - Matthew Winter>: Okay. Well, if you look at page 17 to the supp, you can see that the impact to rate changes on
premiums written over the last several quarters broken out by auto and home. And as I said in my earlier comment to
Bob, we have neared rate adequacy. Remember, as we grow out house and home for the vast majority of states that
goes in rate adequate right away, so that has helped us jump to rate adequate position early. But we operate on a
localized rate-taking basis. So, we watch loss trends as they emerge on a local basis, and we react on a local basis. So,
looking at it on a system-wide perspective is hard to do, and I think a little misleading.
When we see issues arising in the loss cost in a region or in a state, we react quickly in a region or in a state and we'll
take rate as needed. We've done a lot of work. We know the importance of customer experience and momentum. And a
lot of work was done over the last several years to factor in customer experience and momentum into the decisions we
make about when we take rate, how we take rate, and how fast we take rate.
And so, we'll continue to balance that to optimize the overall return, the overall customer experience, our growth
capabilities, and our ability to retain our existing customers.
<Q - Michael S. Nannizzi>: Great. Thank you.

<Q - John A. Hall>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Hi, John.
<Q - John A. Hall>: Hey, there, Tom. I was just wondering if you would just talk a little bit about the profit run rate
for Esurance, sort of the timeline and then, whether that's purely a top line phenomenon or whether there is an element
of overspending that's going on in Esurance? And then just sort of tail onto that, whether you have any success metrics
that you could share around your post Super Bowl Esurance ad?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Okay. I'll answer that, and then Don can help me out as well, since he works directly with
him. First, impressive report quickly, I mean fast turnaround, I was like, you must have had that thing all filled out and
just dropped the numbers in. I have to say, I was quite impressed.
<Q - John A. Hall>: Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: But as it relates to Esurance, let me go up to the strategy. Don can get into sort of the
runway on the profitability. But when we bought it, we thought we were a better owner, because we could do a number
of things.
One, we could reposition the brand specifically targeted towards that self-directed customer. We did that – the first
phase of that was to not have it be – it used to appeal to both segments, which was people, when you want them in
technology when you don't, that's obviously trying to appeal to both ends of that spectrum, which they needed to do
because of their size, and we did not. So we repositioned it really around that self-serve customer. And Don can talk
about the work they're doing in marketing there, but that was the first thing, reposition the brand.
Secondly, to strength the brand by endorsing it with Allstate; so in fact, we've done that by having it be endorsed, but
not confusing with the Allstate brand. We also thought we were better at claims and preferred pricing. And it was based
on those assumptions that we said we could get in and invest more aggressively to drive growth in the business. So, we
substantially increased the marketing spend, even though that has a negative impact on the overall combined ratio,
because we can handle it, given the size and scope of our company. And the result of that, as you see, we have great top
line growth over the last couple years of that business.
Now, of course, all good plans always have something that you got to adjust to. And so, the loss ratio is a little higher
than we would like and so, Don and Gary Tolman and the team are working to get that. He can give you some insights
on both. What are we doing with the current marketing program and what are we doing to get loss cost in line, but I'm
okay – as long as the loss cost is in line, I'm okay continuing to invest in growth of the business, even if it brings their
specific component combined ratio above what we would like on a long-term basis.
<A - Don Civgin>: John, let me maybe just fill in a couple of things on both the profitability trajectory and then the
marketing. I mean, as Tom said in the opening comments, you have to look at both the GAAP profitability and then
what we look at, which is economics, because we expense all the marketing expenses up front, particularly in a
business that's growing, and Esurance is obviously growing very rapidly. The GAAP combined ratio is going to be
elevated during the points at which you're growing the way we are.
We would prefer to not just look at GAAP, but also look at economics, which is the way we run the business. So, we
look at the lifetime combined ratio that the business that they're writing today is generating, and I'll talk about the loss
ratio in a second, but by and large, we're comfortable with the business that Esurance is writing right now is profitable
– over its lifetime. You won't see it in the GAAP accounting because of the expensing of all of the advertising expenses
upfront.
On the loss ratio, I think Tom's right, we're all a little disappointed with the loss ratio this year. We've been on it. We
understand where it's coming from. Where we can, we've worked with Allstate, share data and make sure that we're on
top of it.

I think Gary and his team have done a really nice job of working to make sure that through both pricing, which you'll
see in the supplement, you will see the rates being taken, and underwriting actions, that that will come back in line.
And we're already beginning to see the loss ratio come back in line.
So, I would expect to see improvement in the loss ratio in 2014 compared to where we were in 2013, but I think, so
long as the business continues to justify the advertising spend, you will see an elevated combined ratio on a GAAP
basis.
Just one word of caution, you saw, in the third and fourth quarter, the top line slow down a little bit for Esurance as a
result of some of the rates that have already been taken. And I expect to see continued pressure in 2014. The way
they're taking rate and moving underwriting, 2014 will be difficult to maintain the trajectory on the top line that they
had in 2013.
Let me move to marketing for a second. After we made the acquisition, I think Gary and his team did a really nice job
of fashioning a new campaign that was designed – it was called the Insurance for the Modern World campaign. It was
designed to make sure that everybody understood what their customer value proposition was.
So, if you go back to our four square, that advertising campaign was designed to make sure people understood that
Esurance was in the lower right hand and not competing against Allstate. That campaign was terrifically productive,
extremely strong response rates, and you can see from what it did to our top line, it worked extremely well.
The Esurance ad after the Super Bowl was a little bit of a shift, in that, instead of telling people we're in the lower right
hand, we're now going to tell people how good we are at the lower right hand, and that was the way to kick off that
shift in the campaign.
We're extremely happy, not only with the impressions we got and the – I mean, if you read any of the social media
reviews, it was extremely effective in generating Twitter activity, not only after the Super Bowl, but up until last night,
when the announcement was made in the Jimmy Kimmel show on the winner.
And so, I think it's worked extremely well. And what I like in particular is that the credit the team's getting for the
campaign is extremely consistent with what the brand stands for, which is clever, modern and doing things different
than it's been done in the past. So, feeling very good about the marketing campaign. We're investing in it; we'll see how
it works, but I think we're delighted with the way the ad after the Super Bowl worked for us.
<Q - John A. Hall>: Was there an immediate response in terms of call volume?
<A - Don Civgin>: Yes. Well, you have to separate that from call volume to quote volume. So, quote volume was up
substantially after the Super Bowl ad. Call volume was off the charts.
<Q - John A. Hall>: Great. Thank you very much.
<A - Don Civgin>: But a lot of that was obviously to learn about the contest and so forth, but the response was
extremely good.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: We spent a lot of money, people should call.

<Q - Michael D. Zaremski>: Thanks. Good morning. On capital management for 2014, any outlook there in 2013,

<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Well, good morning, Mike. You should think about it as, one of our core values for our
investors is generating good cash returns for them. So, we started to talk about cash returns a little differently this
quarter. So, we talked about the combination of dividend and share repurchases, and what does that look like as a
percentage of one's market capitalization.
And the concept behind that is, if you owned the entire company at the beginning of the year and you owned the entire
company at the end of the year, how much cash would you've gotten in between; and sometimes I think the share
repurchase numbers get lost in the fact that you could choose to maintain your relative ownership interest as a
shareholder by selling pro rata into the share repurchase program getting that cash. And that cash looked like about 9%
last year. And it looked similar to that the prior couple of years. So, that is still our goal.
As Steve said, we evaluate that in the first quarter. We're not prepared to make an announcement on what we're doing
in dividends or share repurchases on this call, but you shouldn't expect a huge change in our philosophy in terms of
driving shareholder return and providing cash them.
<Q - Michael D. Zaremski>: Okay, that's interesting. Next and lastly, a follow-up to one of the previous questions.
Now, if we look at slide 7, auto loss cost seemed to be exceeding earned premium for the last few quarters. I mean,
should we be expecting another tough comp in 1Q given what's been going on in January and maybe, if last year 1Q
was a tough comp as well on non-cat weather? Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: I don't really want to get into quarterly forecast on it. I can tell you that our general
philosophy is one, Matt said, which is manage it locally, but also there's to be paranoid about it. So, the reason you
maintain good returns is you stay focused on it. Matt can talk about what they've been doing in the last half of last year,
to reflect the trends you just mentioned.
<A - Matthew Winter>: Yeah, thanks. Tom. Yeah, Mike, I'd rather focus on, as Tom said, how we manage this. And
so, when you look at slide 7, and you look at that chart, I'd just remind you that this is a percent year-over-year
underlying margin trend. And so, what we just saw is a comparison to what was an extremely favorable fourth quarter
2012. That notwithstanding, we do have some clear pressure emerging. And you see a slight uptick, and we think it's
still within our expected norm and our historical norms, on the severity side on BI and PD, but it is just kind of
volatility that's normal and somewhat expected.
That being said, what we see on a system-wide basis is different than what we see on a localized basis. So, if you go
back to page 17 of the supp, you'll see the number of states we took rate in during the second half of the year on auto.
It's significantly higher than what we took in the first half of the year.
We saw some trends emerging in some particular states, and as such, we took necessary rate to ensure we got out in
front of those and caught up quickly and minimized any lag between the earned premium and the increase in loss cost.
We also took some underwriting actions and we accelerated some correct class work in the second half of the year that
I anticipate will have a positive impact as we begin this year.
<Q - Michael D. Zaremski>: Thank you.
Operator
Our next question is from Dan Johnson of Citadel. Your question, please?
<Q - Daniel Johnson>: Great. Thank you very much. Wanted to talk about a segment that's actually sizable enough to
talk about that's on the other personal lines, the underwriting improvement there was I'd say just about as meaningful as
it was in the auto business, in terms of year-over-year contribution. What's the outlook for that continuing and now that
Don is not there, who is running the business? And I've got one other follow-up after that.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Okay, Dan. Good morning. As you pointed out, yeah, we are doing better in what we would
call consumer household stuff, which includes a variety of other property-liability products. The business is –
profitability is improving.

We'd like to see it grow a little faster to be honest. Its growth was moderate and when we look at the potential market
share, the market share we have in those spaces, whether that be motorcycle or RV or both and we look at our overall
market share in auto and home by state, we have some room to grow there and we'd like to – we're working on having a
more household focus.
Kathy Mabe is the person who runs that part of that business, I'm sorry, we moved it over to Matt. I'm sorry. I was
thinking Kathy and Matt saying, no, no, I've got that.
<A - Matthew Winter>: I thought we're announcing that...
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Kathy Mabe took over for Don. So, all the Encompass stuff and all the – we've rearranged
in stuff called business-to-business and I'll come back to that in a second. So, Don left, Kathy took his role, we
re-shifted that role somewhat. We have some – a fairly large set of businesses that are good at business-to-business, but
they weren't really run together as business-to-business.
So, for example, we have our worksite business, which serves a 2.7 million customers through the worksite. We also
have a commercial insurance business, small businesses. There's a bunch of things that are really, business-to-business
and we felt like we weren't delivering it – really seeing a value proposition to those businesses, as we could have. So,
we put those together and reoriented that, right as Don was leaving.
As part of that, we took the consumer household business and we moved it into Matt's organization, so that it's more
integrated on the household focus from both pricing, technology standpoint, a whole bunch of reasons that'll help us
grow faster.
<Q - Daniel Johnson>: Well, that was actually my next question, as to now that we've got it to a very respectable
profitability, can we grow it? So, maybe I'll just ask it slightly different. Are we sort of at profitability where we hope
to be and then the focus needs to be from growth or is there still other things on a profitability front that you think can
be done and that is it? Thanks.
<A - Matthew Winter>: Hey, Dan. It's Matt. On the profitability side, again, when you see it, it's rolled up to all the
lines together and we still have some additional work to do on a few of the smaller lines there to ensure that their
profitability is sustainable. Remember, some of the profitability improvement we saw in this last quarter was driven
primarily by low cats. And so, we don't want to declare victory too soon there.
The way we're approaching these lines, as we move them over from what was emerging businesses into personal lines
is, I consolidated things with wheels with the auto line into the vehicle line managing, and I consolidated landlord,
renters and condo and manufactured homes into our homeowners business. So, they're being managed more holistically
by what is now vehicle and home – or vehicle and property line management,
I expect that over time as we ensure that we have profitability on each of the subcomponents of those co-ho lines that
we will, consistent with our CVP, begin growing the overall portfolio.
Remember, our overall approach with the Allstate agency now is to say yes more often to customers, have more
products available to serve their customers, and enable those agency owners to be more holistic risk advisors to their
customers and have a variety of products at their disposal.
As we continue to embed that CVP into the agency system, we think that the ability to sell some of the consumer
household products will improve, our breadth and depth of customer penetration will improve as a result, and we will
get better at packaging them together, porting data between the lines, making it more intuitive for the licensed sales
professional to switch from a standard auto sale to a renter or a condo sale and port data over. And so, we're excited
about the opportunity. We think the integration into the rest of personal lines business, the auto and home business will
be a long-term strategic benefit to us.
<Q - Daniel Johnson>: Great. Thanks very much for that.

<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Hey, Dan, this is Tom. I want to add one thing to that, because I think you're on an
important point from a strategy standpoint. This is really a shift from a product and items in force strategy to a
household strategy focus. And our metrics don't quite follow it. We show you items in force by product and that kind of
stuff, and it's really in line with the customer focus.
So, some of our competitors only have one line, right, and we have to compete heads-up with them, but we're more
interested in selling everything we can sell to you. So, if you thought of us as a retail store, we don't just want to sell
shirts, we want to sell shirts, pants, shoes, socks, whatever you need we want to give it to you, because we think that
speak to that customer segment.
And Matt talked about it. They were also doing the same thing in Esurance. So Esurance, we rolled out renters in 16
states, motorcycle in 3 states, and homeowners in 1. So, you should expect to see – we think that gives us a competitive
advantage in that space, because we'll be able to leverage our relationships and marketing dollars over a broader swath
of products and services, have greater retention from people because we sell more things. So, it is about shifting to that
customer focus. And this is, of course, one part of it.
<Q - Daniel Johnson>: Very good. Again, thanks very much.

Our next question is from Josh Stirling from Sanford Bernstein. Your question, please?
<Q - Josh C. Stirling>: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the call and congratulations, good quarter and a couple
of hard years. Now we can all talk about growth. So, I wanted to talk briefly, so we oftentimes don't talk about your
agents. You obviously have a lot of them, they're sort of central to the story, but I think they get lost a bit.
Three or four years ago you guys made a whole bunch of changes, lots of new blood in the organization, some
consolidations, new agency, management strategies and compensation. You're obviously starting to see some core
growth in the channel and I'm curious if what you learned from the various initiatives you pulled and if some of the
growth that we're seeing is kind of you guys getting some traction from – for example the new blood and new hires and
things like that? Or whether the growth is something that's just a bit more cyclical as opposed to structural that we can
look at?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Well, Josh, thank you. As you were talking about, I was saying, okay, well, this is my eighth
year as CEO. The last one was a lot more fun than the first six. And we've made a lot of progress. As it relates to our
agency, they're never lost, they're a key component of that, which we do and very vital to us.
As we've talked about before, we did, when we went through the homeowners – when we had to re-fix homeowners,
we leaned a little heavier on auto, we decided at the same time go in and strengthen the agency distribution force,
through a whole bunch of things and Matt can talk about what he's doing there.
I would say that, I am very proud of the work that our team has done to improve the relationships with them, help them
be more successful and that is part of what's driving growth. It isn't just about not selling more homeowners – about
selling more homeowners and not taking as much rate. That is, of course, part of it, but it's also about getting the
system positioned. And so, we had that kind of period of time for a couple of years where we had to kind of regroup,
build our foundation and they've taken it to a new level. So, Matt, maybe you want to talk about how you feel about
agencies, what they're investing in and how it's driving growth.
<A - Matthew Winter>: Thanks for the question, Josh. I love getting questions about agency owner distribution, it's I
think, one of our core strengths as a company and one of our competitive advantages.
We get a lot of work on reengaging the agency system. As you mentioned, we had a tough transitional period. We had
to do some hard work as a company to change and improve the productivity and efficiency of the agencies. Some of
that involved compensation changes to shift towards more variable compensation, to spur and incent growth, and give
them a reason to take a leap of faith and invest in their agencies, even though at that time, they were declining in size

and we have managed through that compensation program to completely bend the line, because they did take that leap
of faith, they invested in their agencies, they hired licensed sales professionals, they increased their marketing, they
invested in technology, they totally reengaged and, as a result, they are now growing items in force and their agencies
are more valuable, our system is more valuable and we're thriving together.
That brought together a bunch of work. It brought together technology work, marketing work, compensation work,
workflow reengineering to make the products more intuitive to sell, a lot of great product work; and that has yielded a
couple of tangible results. So, I think on the last call we mentioned that the agency relationship survey, which is a
survey that measures their level of satisfaction and confidence in the system, is at an all-time high.
If you see on page 11 of the supp, and you'll see more detail in the 10-K when it's released. We're growing the number
of agencies, and that trend was going down for several years, and now it's increasing because we're adding points of
distribution and they, in fact, are adding additional licensed sales professionals.
Our EA retention is significantly higher. The previous couple of years, we experienced retention rates that were at
about 80%; in 2013, our EA retention was 92%. That means fewer of them were leaving the system, there's less
disruption to our customers. It builds on itself.
So, all of these things, the momentum on the growth side, the momentum on new business side and retention, along
with what I call sustainability metrics, which are the number of agencies and the productivity and efficiency in those
agencies, should all work together to improve the overall growth of the system. So the short answer to your question is,
I think it's very structural. I don't think it's cyclical and I don't think it's a short-term thing.
<Q - Josh C. Stirling>: That's really helpful, Matt. Thank you. Just one other sort of question; long-term, if you guys
think about five years, we're trying to think about what the Allstate of the future looks like, homeowners is arguably,
maybe that's cyclical, maybe that's structural, it's a much more profitable business today and you guys have shrunk your
footprint by something approaching gosh, maybe, 30% in terms of PIF since 2005. The question is, if you think
bullishly, how big could you get that business over some extended period of time?
And then second, Esurance, you're still sort of getting your legs, but your investments thus far, it's been kind of modest
in terms of ad spend, and obviously that's turning the corner. If you look forward five years, how material a part of this
business do you think it may be? Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: How material...?
<Q - Josh C. Stirling>: Would Esurance be as a function of the total Allstate franchise?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Well, I'd like them all to grow as fast as they could grow. So, I'd take the same percentage in
higher growth in total, or I'll take higher percentages on either, but I think if you want to go really five years, I would
start to think more about just telematics connected customer, the way in which we interact with our customers. We
have a different approach to telematics. We're still developing it – but telematics of course is our Drivewise and
DriveSense. It does one thing, which is give better pricing, gives you the ability to do better pricing because you have
more data about individual customers.
Our offering, though, also is trying to enhance the customer value proposition. We haven't sorted out exactly what that
means yet, but if you were to look over five years, I think you would find that the types of services, information and
relationship we have with our customers will be stronger and more valuable to them, and should enable us to grow.
So I think really, the next couple of years, you should see them to grow in what is economical, and as we think we have
the skills, capabilities and performance to grow. I don't really want to talk about just homeowners or the other pieces.
<Q - Josh C. Stirling>: Okay. Thanks, Tom. Good luck.

Our next question is from Adam Klauber of William Blair. Your question, please?
<Q - Adam Klauber>: Thanks. Good morning. Just to follow up on the standard auto loss ratio, looked like it did pick
up a bit in the fourth quarter, as you mentioned. Is some of that just sort of an accident year true-up just looking at if
trends developed and you saw it and sort of caught up?
And number two, you mentioned you're seeing modest pressure in severity. Also looks like frequency is maybe
normalizing. Could you talk about what you're seeing on the frequency side also?
<A - Matthew Winter>: Yeah. So, as I said, the tick up that you're referring to, we just consider kind of some normal
volatility. There is some embedded pressure on the severity side. I think frequency is relatively stable and is performing
well within the historical ranges. So, there was a little PD uptick, but remember the 2012 was actually below the
historical range, so we look at that and there's nothing to be worried about.
We looked at the new to renewal ratios because, as we're growing, we would expect some pressure on our frequency
there, but actually, it hasn't emerged yet. The faster we grow, that becomes somewhat inevitable, but we're monitoring
it closely and we'll stay out in front of it.
And again, on the severity side, it's slightly elevated. You look at the two-year average growth though on – like PD,
paid severity, and it's fairly moderate. And so, I think it's somewhat – I know what you're trying to do. Everybody is
trying to see whether or not a trend is emerging, and so you have to look at like the last two quarters or year-over-year.
But we have to do that and balance it with what it looks like over a two-year period, understanding that there's some
volatility in there.
And again, you're seeing it on a systemic basis, and we're trying to look at it on a very localized basis. We're able, I
think, on a very localized basis, to distinguish better between what is just normal volatility and what's an emerging
trend, and we jump on anything that looks like it's an emerging trend and we weed out what looks like normal
volatility.
<Q - Adam Klauber>: Okay, that's helpful. One follow-up on the overall expense structure, the business historically
ran closer to 25% and clearly been edging up more in the 26% now – is the reality – is it just more of an expensive
business today than it was 5 years, 10 years ago?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Adam, it's changed, I would say, that – you're right in – you're absolutely correct in the
percentages, but there is more money being spent today in marketing than there has been in the past. We are spending
less money in certain categories, and in many categories we cut cost to invest in other things. So, if I look at total
technology spend, we're spending a lot more money in technology and simplifying cutting expense out, which should
lead to both improved customer experience and lower cost in the future. So, it bounces around. We're always about
there trying to reduce cost. This is a relatively thin margin business. It's low involvement business from a customer
standpoint, so they don't like to pay for something they don't have to. So, we try to look at everything, that will our
customers pay for it.
So, I think in terms of – we don't have like a magical goal. I think the answer is, how do you deliver the most value to
customers and split your money up. So, if we have to spend half a point in expenses and we think that it gives us ability
to charge another percent in average price, we'll do that, because – so we're not going to manage just the expense ratio
as a way to grow the business; it's all about what the customer wants. But it shifts around a little bit, a lot more money
in marketing these days and then the mix changes with Esurance in there and you've got to kind of break it out between
Esurance; really the four segments should stand on their own as it relates to expenses because that's what you're paying
to deliver the service to that specific customer.
<Q - Adam Klauber>: Thanks a lot.

Our next question is from Brian Meredith with UBS. Your question, please?
<Q - Brian R. Meredith>: Hey. Good morning. Morning, Tom.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Good morning, Brian.
<Q - Brian R. Meredith>: Hey, I wonder could you give us an update on Drivewise and how that's doing and any
plans for 2014 to push that product, maybe more ad spend or something.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Yeah, I will, Brian. And Matt, I think this is our last call; I didn't realize, we're having some
good questions and we went a little over time, so I apologize to those of you who have other things to do.
So, yes, we have two offerings in the marketplace; Drivewise and DriveSense. First is the Allstate brand; the second is
the Esurance brand. In the Allstate brand, we're over 300,000 units on the street today and we stay connected in our
offering versus some other offerings where they take it back; not everybody does. But there are three components to
that which we're trying to do. One is better pricing, every bit as powerful I believe as credit was when we got started.
Second, it will be about enhancing the customer value proposition. And third is how do we use that data to help our
customers do even more and pay less?
So, there's three components to it. We have what we call V1.0 out in the marketplace today, which is the product I just
mentioned, that's in the cards. We are working on some other alternatives this year that we'll be investing a substantial
amount of money in this year to test and decide how we want to take and grow their property with all of those
affectionately, 2.0, 3.0 and that we have a group of – a team that's working on innovating there. We're connected with
all the OEs in terms of what they do.
I think we'll probably end up with a different strategy for the OE market than the aftermarket and of course, aftermarket
is where most of our customers are. So, that will start to roll out and we'll talk about it as we go through the year, but it
is important to us and we're spending lots of money on it.
<Q - Brian R. Meredith>: Great. Thanks. And then one other just quick one. Can you talk about what potential impact
the ACA may have on your supplemental health business as we kind of look forward here and voluntary products go on
those exchanges?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: It's a relatively small impact on the business. There are some product things we have to
change, but it's not a meaningful item for us in that business or obviously to the whole company.
Thomas J. Wilson
So, thank you all. Last year, you saw us begin to shift from improving returns to accelerating our strategy, which is of
course to grow by providing differentiated value propositions to the four customer segments. We really are now
positioned for growth. We've got a good solid strategy. We've got brands, we've got the business capabilities. We're
executing well. We have financial resources, and as importantly, we have a great team between our management team
here and our agency owners. So, we are positioned to both grow and continue to provide cash returns to our
shareholders. Thank you all. I will talk to you next quarter.
