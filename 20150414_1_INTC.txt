Thanks, Mark. Following our reset of our outlook in March, the first quarter finished roughly as expected. Our PC
business was impacted by slowing desktop sales, particularly in small and medium business. At the same time,
challenging macroeconomic conditions and then appreciating U.S. dollar weighed on our business in important
geographic markets. Despite this, revenue was flat year-over-year as our Data Center, Internet of Things, and NAND
business all delivered double-digit growth.
The diversity and scale of Intel products today puts us in a position to compete across the breadth of devices that
compute and connect. I'll take just a moment to review each of these businesses before sharing my expectations for the
rest of the year.
Our newly formed Client Computing Group results reflect weakness in desktop demand and the depletion of PC supply
chain inventories. And while desktop volume declined, notebook volume grew year-over-year for the fifth consecutive
quarter.
Our silicon technology leadership remains a valuable competitive advantage in the percentage mix of our latest
14-nanometer processors, the 5th gen Core and Core M processors. It is just ahead of our expectations. In addition to
launching the high volume, 5th gen Core product at CES, the CCG group also reached some important product
milestones. We launched our newest Broadwell based vPro notebook SKUs that feature aspects of the company's No
Wires vision to help us all work better.
We also extended our mobile product portfolio to address a range of price points and form factors. This includes the
Intel Atom x5 and x7 the mainstream and premium tablets, formerly called Cherry Trail, which is powering the new
Microsoft Surface 3. We also started shipping the Atom x3, formerly SoFIA 3G, the company's first single-chip
integrated baseband and apps processor designed for entry and value smartphones and tablets. This product was not
even on our roadmap a year-and-a-half ago and is now launched in the market. This is a great example of the velocity
of the new Intel.
In the Data Center, our manufacturing and architecture leadership, combined with opportunities driven by the rise of
cloud computing and HPC usages, continued to yield impressive results. DCG revenue grew 19% year-over-year and
our Xeon E5 v3 product line, formerly known as Grantley platform, now represents more than 50% of our two socket
volume.
New products like Grantley and our increased support of custom versions of the product helped us achieve record cloud
revenue, and in the telco segment, we continue to significantly outpace the market with the adoption of Intel
architecture. We also introduced our first Xeon based SoC processor optimized for microservers, storage, network and
IoT devices. This product is an example of our strategy to reuse [ph] IT (4:26) from our core business in
complementary and profitable segments.
Many of the secular trends underpinning our growth in the Data Center also benefited our NAND business, which grew
14% year-over-year. Just three weeks ago, Intel and Micron formally announced our jointly developed 3D NAND
technology. Intel 3D NAND will be available in the second half of this year and offers roughly three times the stated
capacity of computing technologies which aren't expected until 2016. 3D NAND, for example, can provide greater than
10 terabytes of storage in a 2.5 inch solid state drive and is the first 3D NAND solution to be architected to be lower
cost than 2D NAND.
And finally, the Internet of Things Group grew 11% over the first quarter of last year based on strength in the retail and
digital security market segments, our first quarter results combined with a variety of third-party insights from across the
industry [ph] and form (05:32) our thinking for the balance of 2015. We expect the PC market to remain challenging,
leading to a mid-single-digit decline in the overall full year PC TAM. That said, we are excited about the launch of our
14-nanometer Skylake microprocessors and the capabilities this product family will enable on a variety of operating
systems. In particular, we are enthusiastic about the release of Windows 10 this summer, especially when combined

with Skylake.
We continue to be confident in our strategy to drive growth. We're focused on innovating in our client business,
improving mobile profitability and investing in and growing profitable adjacent markets. We're applying our process
technology leadership, silicon integration expertise, and the efficient use of shared intellectual property. This strategy is
delivering results as evidenced by the growth we saw this quarter in the Data Center, IoT, and NAND segments. The
performance of those businesses remains strong and is expected to roughly offset weakness in [ph] DCG (6:42).
As we move forward, we will continue to work to ensure that it's smart and connected its best with Intel.
And with that, let me turn the call over to Stacy.
Stacy J. Smith
Thanks, Brian. Revenue for the first quarter was $12.8 billion, flat year-over-year and in line with the downward
revision to outlook provided on March 12. As a reminder, the change in revenue outlook was a result of weaker than
expected demand for business desktop PCs, lower than expected inventory levels across the PC supply chain. While the
PC market was challenging in the first quarter, we continue to see strength in the Data Center, Internet of Things, and
NAND business.
First quarter gross margin of 60.5% was slightly above the original outlook provided on the January earnings call.
Spending on R&D and MG&A, $4.9 billion, down $100 million from the fourth quarter and in line with our guidance.
Operating income of $2.6 billion was up 4% from a year ago. Earnings per share of $0.41 was up over 8% from a year
ago.
The newly created Client Computing Group had revenue of $7.4 billion, an 8% decline year-over-year, driven by a
16% decline in desktop unit volumes, partially offset by a 3% increase in notebook volume. Tablet unit volumes were
over 7 million units, up 45% year-over-year. We are on track to our annual goal of improving mobile profitability by
$800 million with the majority of improvements to be realized in the back half of the year.
Operating profit for the overall Client Computing Group was $1.4 billion, down 24% from a year ago. The decrease
was driven primarily by lower desktop revenue and higher unit costs.
The Data Center Group had revenue of approximately $3.7 billion, 19% growth on a year-over-year basis, driven by
15% unit growth. The Data Center Group had operating profit of $1.7 billion. This was up 27% year-over-year, driven
by unit growth, a richer mix and lower unit costs. Additionally, year-over-year, the Internet of Things segment
achieved revenue growth of 11% and the NAND business grew at a fast pace.
The business continued to generate significant cash, $4.4 billion of cash from operations in the first quarter. We
purchased $2 billion in capital assets, paid $1.1 billion in dividends and repurchased $750 million of stock in the first
quarter. Total cash balances at the end of the quarter were roughly $14 billion, down approximately $5 billion from a
year ago. Our net cash balances, total cash less debt, is below $1 billion and inclusive of our other longer-term
investments, it is more than $4 billion.
As we look forward to the second quarter of 2015, we're forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $13.2 billion,
up 3% from the first quarter. This forecast is in line with the average seasonal increase for the second quarter. We
believe there was an inventory burn across the worldwide PC supply chain in the first quarter and we expect a further
reduction in inventory supply chain levels in the second quarter in anticipation of Windows 10 launch this summer.
We're forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range to be 62%, plus or minus a couple of points, a 1.5-point
increase from the first quarter.
Turning to the full year 2015, we expect revenue to be approximately flat to 2014, down from the prior guidance of mid
single-digit percentage growth. We're now projecting a mid single-digit decline in the overall PC market. We continue
to forecast robust growth rates in the Data Center Group, Internet of Things Group and NAND businesses, which we
expect to offset the decline in the Client Computing Group.

As a result of lower than expected demand and reduced growth rates this year, we are lowering capital spending,
spending on R&D and MG&A. We're moving to reuse capital by rolling it forward to 14-nanometer and to align
overall capacity with demand. We're now forecasting the midpoint of capital spending at $8.7 billion, down $1.3 billion
from the prior outlook. We're also forecasting the midpoint of our gross margin range at 61%, down a point from our
prior guidance as a result of temporarily lower utilization rates and lower platform volumes.
And we are forecasting the midpoint of R&D and MG&A spending for the year at $19.7 billion, down $300 million
from the prior outlook.
We're prudently managing our cost capacity and inventory to address the changes in expected PC demand. We're using
our manufacturing leadership to transform the company by developing leadership products across a broad range of end
markets. That product leadership is driving growth in revenue, profits, at the Data Center, Internet of Things and
NAND business.
To illustrate this transformation, in the first quarter, almost 40% of our revenue came from the combination of these
businesses, and these businesses accounted for more than two-thirds of the company's overall operating profit in the
first quarter. Our work is far from done, but the transformation of the company is well underway.
With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.
Mark Henninger
All right. Thank you, Brian and Stacy. Moving on now to the Q&A, as is our normal practice, we would ask each
participant to ask one question and if you have it just one follow-up.
Jamie, please go ahead and introduce our first questioner.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse.
<Q - John William Pitzer>: Yeah, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. I guess, Stacy, my
first question is, relative to your full year gross margin guidance of 61%, it sort of assumes that the back half of the
year is coming in around 61% and I'm kind of curious given the revenue guidance implies a pretty steep ramp in the
back half of the year, i.e. utilization going up, can you just help me understand why you wouldn't get better leverage in
gross margins in the second half?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah, hi, John. So yeah, you're doing the algebra correctly there. We're averaging about 61% in
the first half. We've guided 61% for the year. My expectation is the average over the back half is in that range of about
[inaudible] (13:29). You see some offsetting trends going on. So first, we do expect we'll see some benefit associated
with just seasonally stronger volume in the back half of the year.
Offsetting that is two things. One is we'll start to see – we're seeing 10-nanometer start-up cost today, but they'll ramp
pretty significantly when we get into Q3 and Q4. So that's one element.
And then the other is we're bringing down the utilization rates on our 22-nanometer factory network and have now and
through the Q2, maybe a little bit into Q3. Those products will go into inventory and they'll ship in the back half of the
year. And so, we'll see a little bit of elevated cost relative to what we thought in the back half associated with bringing
down the utilization rates in the factories.
As you've watched us for a while, you know that we do that so that we can free up some capacity and roll it forward
14-nanometer and offset some of the capital investments there. So that's why we're doing it, but the impact of that is

higher costs.
<Q - John William Pitzer>: Perfect. Thank you. And then, guys, as my follow up, Brian, there's been sort of a lot of
speculation in the press about potential M&A activity and I doubt you're going to address specific speculation. But I'm
kind of curious can you just step back and give us a sense of broadly what your acquisition strategy will look like, what
areas do you feel like you need to augment? And importantly, as you think about use of cash, does any potential
acquisition have to be more accretive than actually buying back your own stock?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: You're right, John. I'm not going to comment on any of the rumors and on the press. Our
strategy on investing in this business or what we do with our cash hasn't changed. And it's really the same strategy
that's been before me, and that is always first invest in the business. We firmly believe in that and that investment,
Moore's Law, new architectures, technology, things like that and M&A at times and then share buybacks and
dividends.
Those are always our priorities. We're stewards of our shareholders' cash and we always feel like that's always the first
thing we do. And if we can invest in the business and get a better return than that, then we do that, no matter how we
invest in that. But yeah, I'm not going to speculate on any of the rumors.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: And I'd just comment on the last part of your question, John. As Brian said, our priority is invest
in the business first, dividend second, and then we use the buyback to modulate cash balances. We really don't try to
time the buyback to specific stock prices. We use it as the second mechanism to return cash to shareholders. That's how
we view it.
<Q - John William Pitzer>: Thanks, guys.
<A - Mark Henninger>: Thanks, John.
Operator
The next question comes from Romit Shah from Nomura.
<Q - Romit J. Shah>: Yeah, thanks a lot. Stacy, the revenue outlook for 2015, now, it sort of assumes a similar
recovery as your original guidance, just off a lower base and back in early March you talked about things like weaker
business PC demand, the macro environment and currency impact in the quarter. So is implicit in the new outlook that
you think these issues will go away?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: No. And maybe I'm not completely grokking your question. We were projecting mid
single-digit revenue growth for the company on the back of a relatively flat PC unit demand. Now, we're projecting mid
single-digit PC decline and that's leading to relatively flat revenue growth year-on-year. So that has changed my view
of the year. So maybe you can define your question a little better and I'll try to answer a little better.
<Q - Romit J. Shah>: Well, just to get the flat for 2015, it assumes pretty healthy sequential growth for the next
couple of quarters. And I was wondering if the issues that hurt you in the first quarter do you see those issues becoming
less of a headwind as we move through the year?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Okay. Yeah, I understand your question. It's about linearity. So yeah, let me put the PC market
in context and we can go from there. Again, we're expecting mid single-digit decline overall in the PC market. We are
seeing a little bit of shift in linearity over the course of the [inaudible] (18:00). We saw a fairly significant inventory
burn in Q1.
Normally, in Q2, we would expect to see customers start to put inventory in place for the back half. Our guide for Q2 is
assuming that we'll see a continued inventory burn in the quarter and that's because of the timing of Windows 10. It's
sitting in the summer. And so, what we think is going to happen is that our customers will lean out inventory levels in
the second quarter. And then they'll rebuild inventory levels in the third quarter. And if you do the math, it shifts a point
or two of growth from the first half to the second half as a result of that [ph] inventory (18:39).

<Q - Romit J. Shah>: Okay. Helpful. Thank you. As my follow-up, Brian, I was hoping you could just elaborate on
the $8.7 billion in CapEx and this idea of increased reuse of equipment, is that just re-purposing of 22-nanometer?
Does it at all impact the timing of 10-nanometer? Thank you.
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Sure. I think you've got it mostly right. Each one of these product ramps or these
technology ramps kind of have a personality and an image on their own. And what you're seeing as we move through
2015 is just that, that you did see that we shifted our overall view of the market from single-digit growth to single-digit
decline. So that has one impact.
You are seeing us be able to move more capital now as a result of that, plus I'll give you some other things, move more
capital from 22-nanometers to 14-nanometers. We also said that 14-nanometers, the ramps of our Broadwell products
are slightly ahead of our forecast. So we're seeing a very nice migration of our product demand over to 14-nanometers.
And we're seeing some things like better yields, better utilization out of our 14-nanometers, as it continues to get
healthier. And so, all of those combined have let us adjust our capital. And so, you're seeing better utilization, better
efficiency, but also the ability to move more 22-nanometer capacity over to 14-nanometer.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: I would just say I don't think any of it is the shift in timing of [indiscernible] (20:19).
<A - Mark Henninger>: Operator, please go ahead and introduce our next question.
Operator
The next question comes from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Joe L. Moore>: Great. Thank you. Wonder if you could talk about your inventory level kind of barely went up, I
guess, $140 million sequentially despite being $900 million below where you thought you'd be on revenue. Can you
just talk about how that transpired? And I thought maybe you'd have to work that inventory down in the second quarter.
Just why isn't there a little bit of an inventory overhang after the magnitude of the shortfall in Q1?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah, we were expecting inventory levels actually to come down in Q2, Joe, as Broadwell costs
came down, so it wasn't so much a unit comment as much as a dollar comment. But we expected dollar values to come
down, because 14-nanometer costs are coming down the cost curve pretty steeply and we ended up, up. So there's, from
our perspective, a pretty significant shift.
And then as we think about the rest of the year, we will, as we said, we'll bring utilization rates down on 22-nanometer;
we'll roll forward some of that capacity, the 14-nanometer, and we should bring inventory rates levels down by the time
we get to the [ph] end of April (21:33).
<Q - Joe L. Moore>: Okay, great. And then my follow up, with regard to the buyback, how do you think about what
the net cash level should be? Is there still a target of sort of, I think you said historically you're comfortable at around
zero net cash? And then how do you factor in any potential M&A into that equation? Does that mean that M&A would
require to slow the buyback or just how should we think about those trade-offs? Again, I'm not asking about any
specific stories, but just how should we think about the balance sheet in that context?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah, so as Brian said, we're not going to answer any questions on M&A. I know there's a lot of
speculation out there. In terms of net cash balances, yes, we have said that we're targeting approximately zero net cash.
I also said it's impossible for me to manage it so tightly that we mathematically ever get to exactly zero. You can see
we've brought down cash balances a lot over the year. And in Q1, we were sub-$1 billion in net cash, and when you
include in some of the longer-term portions of the portfolio, we were pretty flat at about $4 billion and it's we're kind of
comfortably where we want to be and comfortably where we communicated.
<Q - Joe L. Moore>: Great. Thank you very much.

The next question comes from David Wong from Wells Fargo.
<Q - David M. Wong>: Thanks very much. Stacy, given your comments about start-up charges for 10-nanometers
towards the end of this year, are you pacing ahead of your original plans on 10-nanometers or are things tracking
roughly according to what you expected?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Well, I can answer that one just from a technology standpoint. First, we have said nothing
about our timing for 10-nanometers. And we'll give all of our timing for 10-nanometers at a later date and the
adjustments that Stacy talked about does not have anything to do really with the 10-nanometer capital or spending or
timing. So they are completely disconnected.
<Q - David M. Wong>: Okay. And given what you were saying on SoFIA, do you expect to be incurring any
contra-revenues on tablet processors sales by the fourth quarter of this year? And can you give us some idea as to how
contra-revenue payments might trend through this year?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Sure. And let me, if I may here, let me just take it all the way up to the commitment Brian and I
made around making the $800 million improvement to the mobility portion of [inaudible] (24:05). We're on track to
that. There's two big buckets, if you will. One is the improvement in product margin and it's a combination of the cost
structure we get with SoFIA and having a great product that's targeted at the entry and value segments of the phone and
tablet market. And a chunk of it is the reduction in contra-revenue dollars, again, the bill of materials around SoFIA we
think is a competitive bill of materials, costs, and so, we aren't planning to pay contra-revenue dollars associated with
the SoFIA shipment.
SoFIA is now shipping in the market, so on track from a timing standpoint. Brian highlighted how fast we were able to
execute to this product line. I think it really is an example of the changes going on inside the company.
As I think about those playing out over the course of the year – oh, then the other big bucket is just reductions in
investment level that we talked about at the Investor Meeting. That second bucket plays out kind of linearly across the
year. It will grow, but it's giving us a benefit in each quarter. The product mix, SoFIA, reduction in contra-revenue
dollars really kicks in in the back half of the year. So it's more back-end loaded for us based on the SoFIA ramp.
<Q - David M. Wong>: Great. Thanks.

The next question comes from Harlan Sur from JPMorgan.
<Q - Harlan L. Sur>: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. DCG was up 18% in 2014. It grew 19% here in
Q1. I assume much of this growth was your Cloud and Web 2.0 customers. As you think about the pipeline of Cloud
and HPC programs, are you anticipating continued strong spend here in Q2? Or should we expect some lumpiness?
And how confident is the team about driving double-digit growth in DCG this year?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Yeah, Harlan, I'll start the answer and then Stacy can jump in. So we've always said in
times when the growth is high or times when the growth is a little bit less is it tends to be lumpy. There are large cloud
providers. They tend to come in with big shifts in their purchasing. And so, don't be surprised if there's a very high
quarter and not as high.
What we said though is that over time, we believe we can continue to grow this business at a mid double digit – mid
teen kind of growth rate, right? So 14%, 15%, 16%, somewhere in there, growth rate over the several year period
moving forward.
We continue to have that view. We look at the products we're bringing, the growth that we're seeing in cloud, Cloud
2.0, as you say. Big data is driving some of this growth, as the cloud generates this data and the cloud providers realize

together and what gives us confidence that we can continue to grow this business segment.
<Q - Harlan L. Sur>: Great. Thank you for that. And then the team started ramping its Core M product just before the
holiday season. In discussions with your customers and partners, what's been the sell through trend and uptake of 2-in-1
platforms through the holiday season and into the first half of the year, just wondering what's the view on adoption and
adoption rates of this new form factor on a go-forward basis. Thank you.
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Sure. So as you said, Core M was introduced right before the holidays. I'd say that we had
a limited number of SKUs available at holiday. And the amount of time we could get in front of it with marketing and
all was limited as well. That said we were very happy with the sales we saw in the holidays.
Core M is really designed to provide the first truly fanless Core product capability, very thin and light form factors. As
we've moved through the first quarter, you're starting to see a lot more. There are several designs that have come out
during this quarter. The uptake has been good and we're continuing to market and make the product awareness.
As we move through the first half, you're going to see a remainder of products come out on Core M that continue this
thin light fanless design, 2-in-1s. And so far the uptake's been very good. We think those combined with our tablet
offerings provide a very – a lot of choices for the consumer in this mobile space.
And then as we move through into the second half of the year, as we introduced Skylake, Skylake will have an
additional Core M version which drives even the performance, the battery life and the second generation for Core M.
And again, we expect to see form factors thin, light, long battery life, fanless designs that are quite compelling.
<Q - Harlan L. Sur>: Great. Thank you.

The next question comes from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein.
<Q - Stacy A. Rasgon>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to try to verify something just so I
understand it. So you've got gross margins down in the second half where your 14-nanometer start-ups are coming
down, your revenues up a bunch, your tablet profit losses get a lot worse. Obviously, you have 10-nanometer ramping.
And you talked about reducing your 22-nanometer utilization and building inventory.
So that to me suggests that utilization has to be coming down a lot in the second half. You've got to be building
inventory a lot in Q2, but it's mostly 22-nanometers that you'll then be selling in the second half when Windows 10 and
Skylake are launching. Do I have those dynamics correct? And then what is the risk that you're going to be building
inventory I guess in the first half or in Q2 that will be tougher to sell in the second half given the new products that
ought to be launching at that point?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah, no. I think that the thing in that isn't accurate.
<Q - Stacy A. Rasgon>: Okay.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: A bit confusing. It is the inventory piece. So what we're doing is in Q2 we're cutting the
utilization rates of the 22-nanometer factories to avoid putting the product [ph] into it (30:31). Our role is to bring it
down. We've seen this from us in the past. When we have downturn or an opportunity to roll forward capacity we want
to do it, we certainly don't want to put older generation inventory into inventory if we can help it. So we're going to be
cutting utilizations. We're actually cutting them as we speak. The impact of that is we'll have some higher costs that are
sitting in inventory, because those products that we're producing in Q2 will sell through in Q3 and Q4.
<Q - Stacy A. Rasgon>: Got it.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: So a little bit of a cost headwind in the back half of the year. The utilization rates will kind of
bottom in Q2 and then we think they start to build back up, because we'll take capacity offline on 22-nanometer. They'll

build back up.
<Q - Stacy A. Rasgon>: Got it. So then why are you not calling out utilization as a negative margin driver for Q2
versus Q1 and gross margins are going up in Q2?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Right. Good question. Because we're not cutting to the point that we have excess capacity
charges, so what's happening is you'll see production costs going up, but that sits in inventory and it sells out in the
back half. So that's why the way you'll see it is a cost increase in the back half as opposed to a period charge in [ph] Q2
(31:43).
<Q - Stacy A. Rasgon>: Got it. So you're basically reducing that early and you're taking the cost, it's actually hitting
your P&L in the back half. So you're almost, like, smoothing your loadings in your margin outlook, so you're taking Q2
up and taking the back half down versus prior guidance?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Well, no, I'd say what we're doing is we're trying to react fast on taking capacity offline and
then rolling that forward. And that was the same playbook we've had whenever we have a [ph] demand issue (32:12).
<Q - Stacy A. Rasgon>: Okay, got it. Thanks. Can I ask my follow up?

The next question comes from Chris Danely from Citigroup.
<Q - Christopher Brett Danely>: Hey. Thanks, guys. So I guess just a hypothetical question on M&A then. Can you
think of any scenario – I guess your previous biggest acquisition was McAfee, which was like $8 billion or something.
Can you think of any scenario that would make you feel like you need it or want it or desired to do $10 billion, $15
billion acquisition short of like saving the company or a big product line or something like that? Will that ever come
into play?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Hey, Chris. I'll give you that question back, because I'm going to give you same answer, which
is we're not only not going to speculate on actual M&A questions, we're not going to speculate on hypothetical M&A
questions.
<Q - Christopher Brett Danely>: Okay. That's fine.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: So you can try a different one if you want.
<Q - Christopher Brett Danely>: That's okay. I'll stop while I'm somewhat behind.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: You're not behind.
<Q - Christopher Brett Danely>: Next one a little more mainstream. So if we kind of do the math on your revenue
guidance, we get like I guess basically high single-digit revenue growth for Q3 and Q4. You've talked about taking the
PC growth rate down. So if we just look at straight desktop, notebook, that's 58% of the biz or something like that. So I
guess how can we get to high single-digit sequential revenue growth for Q3 and Q4 with the PC business a little slow?
When I look at the last 10 quarters, Q3, Q4, and high single-digit revenue growth has only happened once. I'm just
wondering how we can get to the math.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah, I guess I'd say it like this. You're seeing – so I'd say not seeing anything unusual in the
growth rates of DCG, IoTG, the memory business, they're growing at a robust rate. We're not expecting that to
accelerate or decelerate in the back half. So just we're – with the exception of DCG, we had a higher than what our

average is in Q1. So maybe that comes down a little [inaudible] (34:34).
The real issue here is on the PC segment. We think we grew – we reduced inventories in Q1. What's unusual is we're
predicting that we're going to reduce – the worldwide PC supply chain we'll reduce inventories more in Q2. So think of
that as you shift a few million units from Q2 and they get replenished in Q3 and that shifts when the billings happen.
It's not so much a comment on the end market; it's just a comment on when inventories get built up for the back-end
selling season.
<Q - Christopher Brett Danely>: Okay. Thanks a lot.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: We think the driver there is Windows 10. It's hitting in the summer and given that plus
economic volatility and currency volatility, we think customers will reduce inventory levels into the summer and then
replenish back to kind of more normal rates after Windows 10 is available.
<Q - Christopher Brett Danely>: Great. Thanks, guys.

The next question comes from Christopher Rolland from FBR Capital Markets.
<Q - Christopher Adam Jackson Rolland>: Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. So I'm thinking my question's a little
bit more big picture here. So PC industry volumes are now going to fall probably mid single-digits along with you
guys. And some including myself believe that tablet volumes might also fall this year. So overall total compute units
might in fact be flatter or perhaps falling this year.
So I guess I'm trying to figure out what the missing piece here is. Are they really going to fall? Is this a timing issue?
Or is there something else here? Is it PC life span, for example, that might be expanding? I know you guys track that.
How do you look at it in terms of total compute and what's going on here?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: So I'll start and Stacy can jump in as well. I think Chris, you're probably not too far off.
We've said that the PC will be down mid single-digits. I would agree most people are thinking that tablets will likely be
down. We've all heard a variety of forecasts. It's a little bit more difficult to forecast I think in the tablet space. Just as a
reference point, our tablet number for Q1 came in right online with what we had projected, and it's up from our Q1 of
2014 significantly.
So when we look at this for the full year and we look at compute, there's a variety of things that we look at when we
look at this. There's share growth. There is what's happening in compute. And then there's also sell-up as we continue
to have newer and better performance as our products get better and better at the higher end especially and then with
like the introduction of Core M and the number of people coming with entry level systems with Core M. We put all of
those together and that's how we've formed our view of this year.
But as you said, it is formed around a view that when you probably look at the total compute from those products, it
declined. We still think phones and tablets continue to grow. And then there's some growth in the Data Center, the
growth in the Internet of Things, and our memory business, which will all grow in that teens kind of range. And they'll
vary quarter to quarter.
<Q - Christopher Adam Jackson Rolland>: Okay, great. Also, well, if you could address PC life span, for example,
if you do have statistics there. And then the other question I had was a major bear thesis at looking at least cash flow
for Intel was around increasing cap intensity as we move down Moore's Law. But your CapEx guidance implies the
lowest spend that we've had since 2010 and we're pretty much on record revenue here. So in your opinion, does this
speak against that capital intensity argument? Or is this really just sort of a timing issue? Thanks.
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Those are kind of two questions. Let me answer the first and I'll let Stacy answer the
capital intensity one. The first one was around what is happening to system longevity or system lifespan. It is
continuing to grow. Our estimates are that there's something approximating 600 million PCs out there and that's

growing somewhat by the day that are greater than four years old. You can look at that as this is continuing to grow and
push. You can also look at this as this is a great opportunity.
We still believe that, at some point, those systems will flip over. Windows 10, Skylake, all of those things are
opportunities that we think we can start to move some of those units, but the approximation is there's 600 million-ish
units greater than four years. I'll let Stacy handle the capital intensity.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah, on the capital intensity, I mean I'll give you the long-term answer and then come back to
what we're seeing in 2015. The longer-term answer and I refer you to some of the stuff we showed at the Investor
Meeting, we do agree capital intensity is going to go up as measured by capital cost per square inch of silicon. We
believe that through 14-nanometer, 10-nanometer, and with some insight all the way down to 7-nanometer, we can
offset that increase in capital cost per square inch of silicon by improving our density. And so, we can keep the cost per
transistor coming down at the historical curve. So for us, we don't think that we're going to be impacted by – at least
over the next two to three generations – by the increase in capital intensity.
And that's what I showed at the Investor Meeting. There's kind of this $7 billion to $8 billion normalized run rate where
we can respond to some unit growth with manufacturing CapEx. And then on top of that, we put some other capital
things like office buildings and labs and [inaudible] (40:48).
Specific then to what's happening this year is we were planning for – if you go all the way back to the Investor Meeting
last year, we've seen two big buckets of improvements. One is, as Brian said, our confidence around 14-nanometer has
improved. And second, our desktop units have come down and so versus flat units we now think we're down in the
mid-single-digits. And the combination of those two things has allowed us to have more reuse of 22-nanometer or
14-nanometer, and we've driven some efficiency in the factory network. And so, I'd characterize this as being an
unusually low level of CapEx relative to the size of the business, because we're driving efficiency at a faster rate, and
we are getting more reuse than [ph] – and that we expected (41:33).
<Q - Christopher Adam Jackson Rolland>: I see. Thanks for the clarity, guys.

The next question comes from Jim Covello from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - James V. Covello>: Hi, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. I appreciate it very much. You've talked
about how the mobile losses declined in the back half of the year that was very helpful color. Could you talk a little bit
about the strategy or the thought process behind combining the categorizations of the groups in the reporting structure?
What was the thought there?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Sure. I'll start, Jim, and Stacy can voice in on some of this as well because there's the
financial side to this. But in general, there's – we first made this move based on our customers and how we look at the
architecture in the business. And so, our customers, you walk into whoever that customer is, Lenovo or Acer or some of
the ODMs in China, they look at the platform from the phablet especially up through at least the tablet and into the
low-end entry level PC, whether it be a Windows-based system or Chromebook or Android. They look at all of those
platforms as the same type of hardware. And they want to have a single group that they interface with. And so our
customers wanted this.
Secondly, from an engineering perspective, from our side, the silicon, the cost improvement, the software work, the
drivers all of those things again, a lot of overlap. So by driving these two organizations together, we are getting
efficiencies that are helping contribute to that $800 million cost reduction that Stacy and I committed to.
So it was first and foremost, our customers and our efficiency, we're driven by this. This is not anything else. At that
point then, Stacy, what he does is says the financials need to represent how you're running the business, and making
decisions Brian. And so, we also made the reporting structure that same way. But I'll let Stacy jump on that.

<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah, I think Brian said it well. The only two pieces of commentary I'd add to that is I'll take
you back to Chris's question earlier. We're seeing this blurring of lines between different devices and we were doing
some unnatural things to try to categorize them. I think the Microsoft Surface is the perfect example of that.
So when you look at partners and IDCs, way they characterize the market, they count that as the tablet. We were
including that in the PC revenue line and we realize that the customers were viewing these as one category of devices,
we were starting to manage it as one category of devices, and we would be more efficient and more accurate to think of
client broadly.
The other comment I'd make is we showed in the Investor Meeting and Brian had some specific materials on this. We
were also finding that the IP that we were developing was shared across these different groups. And so, again, we were
having to categorize things that ultimately came down to judgment, so we realized it was one set of customers, one set
of products, and one set of IP that was flowing across the different products.
<Q - James V. Covello>: It's really helpful, thank you. Maybe my follow up would be on the NAND market. I know
you said NAND's going to follow the same secular trends as DCG. Is there ever going be a time period where it makes
sense to expand that opportunity for you? It's a good growth market. You're making good margins on it, fills up the
factories. What would be the pros and cons of expanding your business in that segment?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: So first, you're right. As we said in our comments Jim, especially for us, because the
majority of the NANDs that we sell goes into enterprise level products, namely the Data Center. Greater than 50% of
what we sell in the [ph] net of NAND (45:30) is in the enterprise class device. We also announced our 3D NAND
which we think really is a game changer. We talked about the density, the cost and putting 10 terabytes or more into an
SSD we think is pretty compelling. We're constantly looking at these businesses, NAND especially, and asking
ourselves what are the level of investments.
Right now, we have a great partnership with Micron, where we jointly develop these. The majority of the
manufacturing is done. In fact, all of the manufacturing on these technologies is done by them. And that relationship
works very well. We're able to invest and invest through them. And they have the efficiency of having factories that
they can offset loadings with other products that they have. That's a very efficient model in the memory market to have
basically two companies with two very different business models to be efficiently using the same factory network.
What would drive us outside that would be if we saw some unique growth or some unique situation where it makes
sense for us to manufacture. But right now, this model works very well and the efficiency that we get out of working
together with them, I think, is really what has been a game changer in the market for us.
<Q - James V. Covello>: Thank you so much, and congrats on the CapEx cut. Love to seeing that.

the business?
And my second question, my follow-up is on the PC side. Brian, you had mentioned Windows 10 a couple of times.
Are you expecting a big bump up in demand from that? And if so, why? Thank you.
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Sure. So we'll answer these one at a time. Let me start with the Grantley one. And Stacy
can voice in and then I'll answer the Windows 10 one. In all of these cases, our new products, as you said the Grantley
platform, which is our E5 series of products, provides a new level of performance. And when you look at this business,

there's some segments to this business that's replacement. With each one of these new generations, we look at the fact
that total cost of ownership for a cloud provider, an enterprise provider, to come in and do a replacement from an older
generation Intel product to a new generation Intel product tends to have a positive total cost of ownership return.
So there's a replacement function that each one of these new generations have. A lot where the increased density and
performance that a cloud provider can get with a new product like the Grantley allows them to grow their business
without having to grow their footprint as much. And so that allows cloud growth at a much more efficient and effective
capacity.
And so we look at new platforms like Grantley and the fact that we do get a very fast transition, as we said, greater than
50% now is on Grantley, is just an example of how fast people see the economics that these products deliver. So that
would be my answer to this. It's really performance which then drives economics, which then drives both replacements
and overall Data Center growth. But if Stacy has a comment on that?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah, just I'd say that the place you see it is in our mix in server. This is a place where if we can
drive technology faster than everybody else, we get paid for it, because as we bring more powerful products, then
people buy higher in fact, because they get an increasing return on that. When you look at the DCG results
year-on-year, you see that units were up 15%, ASP was up 5%. So you see it in both of those. It drives this replacement
cycle and it drives it increasing mix.
<Q - Ambrish Srivastava>: I guess what I was trying to get to – sorry Stacy. What I was trying to get to is how much
of the growth are you able to handicap on the number, how much of the growth came from the Grantley?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Oh, so how much of the 19% growth was due to Grantley? We don't go through and report
those kinds of separations. Partly, it's – as we said, the growth in Data Center in general tends to be lumpy. And it's
based on orders by some of the big cloud providers. And as we said, more than 50% of the volume is now on Grantley.
So just by the math, you'd say sure, there's more than 50% of the 19% growth was probably on Grantley. But I'm not
sure it's necessarily the factor driving this. It's one of the factors.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: And keep in mind, we bring out a new product in the Data Center every 12 months. And then
that product rolls out over the course of a year, right? So Grantley has been shifting for us since – been shifting since
Q3 of...
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Yeah, Q3.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: ...last year, right? And it started in the cloud. So it's not like an event, it's you bring out a
product, it starts in a segment, then we bring out products that are appropriate to different segments. Then we bring out
a new micro architecture and then we bring out the second generation of the micro architecture. So there's always a
product evolution happening in there.
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: With regard to your Windows 10 question, as we said in the script and in some of these
questions, we're not really currently forecasting a big recovery or boom in second half. What we said is there's some
push out of the inventory that would normally be present in the second quarter, as people lean their inventories so that
they're in preparation for Windows 10. The Windows 10 launch is in the summer as it's been announced. As that occurs
and we move into Q3, we anticipate that inventories will simply recover back to a normal level from that leaned out.
And so we'll see growth in that inventory recovery at that point.
But if you took a look at the sell through and the overall year, we're actually projecting as we said relatively seasonal
mid single-digit decline in the PC business. And it's just got this inventory shift kind of moving in the center of the year
around that.

The final question comes from C.J. Muse from Evercore ISI.
<Q - C.J. Muse>: Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question on the PC side in
terms of the single-digit decline, curious if you could walk through what assumptions you're making around mix shift
from enterprise to consumer ASPs as well as the impact of U.S. dollar strength.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Oh boy. That's a tough one. So I'll start with the second part. It's really impossible to detangle –
what we're seeing in the PC market and separate out what's happening from a macroeconomic standpoint, a currency
volatility, kind of a XP hangover and then Windows 10 shift. It's just kind of all wrapped up together. So I don't think I
can give you a lot of color on that.
I'd say our view of the year when we started the year is that we would see, I articulate it a little less strength in the
enterprise segment of the market and a little less weakness in the consumer segment of the market. I think we'd revise
that statement now to say we're going from strength in the enterprise segment to probably a little bit of weakness in the
enterprise segment and consumer was weak last year. It's probably a little less weak this year, but expect it to be down.
And you take the combination of those two things and that's how you get to minus 5% kind of mid single-digit decline
in [inaudible] (53:54).
<Q - C.J. Muse>: That's helpful. And...
<A - Mark Henninger>: Do you have a follow-up?
<Q - C.J. Muse>: As a follow-up, in terms of the cut to CapEx, curious if this is a new steady state for you guys. And
then I guess as the question that follows that, how do we think about impact to construction in progress if at all? And
then as well, when we go down to 10-nanometer the rising cap intensity there, do we see a stair step higher in terms of
that number in depreciation? Or how should we think about those moving parts?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: So let me start and then I'll let Stacy jump in. What we've said was that this year's capital is
a little bit less than what we would have normally projected for the year. We were able to get, as we said, better yields,
better utilization and we were able to – and this happens from time to time. You can look back in our past, it happened
in 2008-2009 timeframe where we get it at the slight increase in our projection for total volume. And at the same time,
we're going through a transition. We're able to move capital very, very quickly.
One of the things we've made as an improvement at Intel is our ability to shift capital from one node to another very
quickly and that has all to do with the copy exactly and how we design our architectures and technologies to be able to
[ph] do (55:22).
That said again, separate out capital intensity of a technology with the absolute unit cost of the technology. And the real
fundamental of Moore's Law is one of economics. And on the 50th anniversary of Moore's Law, which this year is,
remember that Moore's Law is an economics law in that we're going to reduce the cost as well as we're improving the
performance of these products.
Do we believe in 10-nanometers? Yes. The capital per wafer start does go up, but it goes up less than the density does.
And so, we believe our unit costs and we either measured that in transistor cost, which is probably the best way to
measure one-to-one or our overall product cost on the same die equivalent. If you built a Skylake part on one
technology or the other, we get an improvement in that cost greater than the capital intensity.
So the bottom line is I don't expect us always to have this lower level of CapEx. That said we are continuously trying to
reduce and be as efficient in CapEx as we can. Yes, the capital intensity will go up in 10-nanometers, but we feel like it
goes up less, the Data Center goes up less than the density and cost improvements of the product.
