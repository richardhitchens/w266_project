MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good afternoon and welcome to the fourth quarter 2015 Hewlett-Packard Company earnings conference call. My name
is Amy, and I will be your conference moderator for today's call. At this time, all participants will be in listen-only
mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of the call. [Operator Instructions] As a
reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.
I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Ms. Diana Sroka, HP Inc. Investor
Relations. Please proceed.
Diana Sroka
Good afternoon. I am Diana Sroka, Head of Investor Relations for HP Inc., and I'd like to welcome you to the fiscal
2015 fourth quarter earnings conference call. Given we operated as a combined company through the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2015, we decided to report our results together today. Going forward, starting with Q1 fiscal 2016, Hewlett
Packard Enterprise and HP Inc., will report earnings as separate companies.
I will outline how the call will flow today since it will be a little different than our typical earnings calls. Meg will kick
things off with Q4 highlights for Hewlett-Packard Company and Cathie will follow with additional details. After that,
Meg and Tim will review segments results and outlook for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. Then Dion and Cathie will
review segment results and outlook for HP Inc. Finally we'll open it up to questions.
Before we begin, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be made available
shortly after the call for approximately one year. We posted the earnings release and a slide presentation accompanying
today's earnings release on our HP Inc.'s Investor Relations webpage at www.hp.com, and on Hewlett Packard
Enterprise's Investor Relations webpage at www.hpe.com.

As always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking, and are based on our best view of the world and our
businesses as we see them today. For more detailed information, please see the disclaimers on the earnings materials
relating to forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. For a discussion of some of
these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, please refer to HP's SEC reports including its most recent Form 10-Q. HP
assumes no obligation and does not intend to update any such forward-looking statements.
We also note that the financial information discussed on this call reflects estimates based on information available at
this time, and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HP Inc.'s and Hewlett Packard
Enterprise's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015 For financial information that has
been expressed on a non-GAAP, we've included reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information. Please refer to
the tables and slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release.
Finally, each of the unaudited pro forma Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc., fiscal 2015 non-GAAP diluted net
earnings per share and cash flow information presented in this call and the accompanying presentation is based on the
estimated contributions of each company to Hewlett-Packard Company's fiscal 2015 non-GAAP diluted net EPS and
cash flow as adjusted to give effect to the separation transaction effective on November 1, 2015.
The pro forma amounts do not necessarily reflect what the fiscal 2015 non-GAAP diluted net EPS and cash flow of
Hewlett Packard Enterprise or HP Inc. would have been, had the separation occurred on November 1, 2014. They also
may not be useful in predicting the future financial condition and results of operations of the separate companies. The
actual financial positions and results of operations may differ significantly from the pro forma amounts reflected herein
due to a variety of factors.
With that, let me turn it over to Meg.
Margaret C. Whitman
Good afternoon, everyone thanks for joining us today. The fourth quarter was the final quarter where Hewlett-Packard
operated as one combined company. On November 1, we completed the historic separation and became two separate
independent public companies, HP Inc., and Hewlett Packard Enterprise. I couldn't be prouder of how we executed on
the incredibly complex separation. Throughout the year long separation process we saw no disruption to our customers
and partners and we continued to drive the business forward. And now, both companies are off and running. Each
company has a clear, well defined strategy and is well-positioned to win in its respective market.
Before we get into the business segment performance and outlook, I'll let Cathie provide details on the Q4 results of the
previously combined company.
Catherine A. Lesjak
Thanks, Meg. Hewlett-Packard Company net revenue for the quarter was $25.7 billion, down 9% year over year as
reported or down 3% in constant currency. For the full year, revenue was $103.4 billion, down 7% year over year as
reported or down 2% in constant currency.
Gross margin was 24.7%, up 0.1 point year over year and up 0.9 points quarter over quarter with sequential
improvement across all of our major business segments.
Non-GAAP operating expenses of $4 billion were down 5% year over year, driven by a reduction in SG&A, partially
offset about our continued focus on increasing our R&D investments. Non-GAAP operating profit margin was 9.1%,
down 0.5 points year over year and up 0.5 points sequentially. With a net expense of $151 million in OI&E, a
non-GAAP tax rate of 22.5% and a diluted share count of approximately 1.8 billion shares, we delivered non-GAAP
diluted net earnings per share of $0.93 in Q4, within our outlook range.

Q4 non-GAAP EPS primarily excludes pre-tax charges of $676 million for separation, $591 million for restructuring,
$246 million for amortization of intangible assets, and net tax benefits of $803 million. For the full year, we delivered
non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $3.59 in line with our previously provided outlook range. On a GAAP
basis, Q4 diluted net earnings per share was $0.73, above our outlook range due to the net tax benefits just mentioned.
These were one-time non-cash entries, comprising a number of different items, including the reversal of a previously
recorded U.S. tax valuation allowance that I discussed on the Q3 earnings call.
The total separation cost CapEx and associated cash flows expected across FY 2015 and FY 2016, in total were
originally $2.8 billion, and we now expect $2.4 billion in that same time period. The mix of expenses between one-time
separation cost, CapEx and incremental taxes was different than planned with taxes coming in well under our plans in
Q4.
The 2012 restructuring program is nearly complete with approximately 4,300 people exiting the company in Q4 2015
and just under 56,000 cumulative reductions for the program to-date.
Even with labor migration, we are down a net 59,000 people over this timeframe. In Q4, we recorded GAAP only
charges of $591 million, approximately $200 million were the final charges associated with the 2012 program, and the
remainder were associated with the new restructuring program that each company discussed at their respective
Securities Analyst Meetings in September.
We delivered cash flow from operations of $2.6 billion, and free cash flow of $1.8 billion in the quarter. This brings
our total free cash flow for the year to $3.3 billion, which is just below our outlook range of $3.5 billion to $4 billion.
There was a tailwind from separation costs coming in lower as described. This was more than offset by the following.
Other receivables, including VAT, elevated financing receivables driven by higher HP Financial services volume, cash
outflow for restructuring and lower earnings.
In Q4, we returned $638 million of capital to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases, and $4.1 billion was
returned to shareholders for the full year. We returned over 100% of free cash flow to our shareholders in fiscal 2015,
even excluding the capital return of $750 million that completed our 2014 commitments.
I'll now turn it over to Meg and Tim to discuss the results of the segments that are now part of Hewlett Packard
Enterprise, then Dion and I will return to share comments on Printing and Personal Systems, the new HP Inc.
Margaret C. Whitman
Thanks, Cathie. As we laid out at our Securities Analyst Meeting in September, Hewlett Packard Enterprise has five
key priorities for FY 2016. We plan to grow top line revenue in constant currency, drive a year-over-year increase in
operating profit, grow free cash flow, continue to execute our innovation roadmap, and stabilize revenue and expand
margins in Enterprise Services. And I'm pleased to say that overall Hewlett Packard Enterprise is off to a very strong
start. First and foremost, the segments that comprise HPE have now had two consecutive quarters of constant currency
revenue growth and we believe we are in a strong position to deliver on our plans to grow overall in FY 2016 in
constant currency. Also while there is more work to do, particularly in ES, our cost structure is much closer to where it
needs to be, thanks to aggressive supply chain management, SKU rationalization and workforce rebalancing.
With respect to cash, we are starting the year with a net cash position at the operating company level, and as separation
cost wind down, we are well positioned to increase cash flow in FY 2016. The innovation we've been investing in over
the past four years is paying off. We've introduced breakthrough new solutions and services that have driven a mix shift
in our portfolio towards higher growth products and services. By leaning into new technology, we are ideally
positioned to take advantage of market trends that will allow us to continue to take share from our competitors and to
drive long-term growth.
Finally, while each business segment faces different challenges and opportunities, the company as a whole is aligning
tightly around the four customer transformation areas we discussed at our Securities Analyst Meeting. Customers tell

us our focus is spot on. I'm confident that our clear strategy will accelerate the significant progress we've already made
in our financial performance.
Now, before Tim gets into the financial details, let me provide some highlights from the quarter across each segment.
In Enterprise Group, we performed exceptionally well with strong revenue growth, up 2% as reported or 9% in constant
currency, and improved profitability on a sequential basis. Our industry standard server business was strong, with
constant currency revenue growth across all regions, driven by solid core growth and increasing demand from Tier 1
service providers. Looking forward, we are well-positioned to benefit from the server market upswing driven by the
growth in cloud and big data.
The networking business also performed well, with the Aruba acquisition driving strong cross-selling opportunities
across wireless and data center switching. Storage significantly outpaced the market, and we expect that we gained
close to a point of share in the third calendar quarter. Our 3PAR all-flash portfolio is outperforming the competition.
3PAR all-flash is now a $500 million annualized run rate business and grew triple digits in the fourth quarter. That's
larger and growing faster than Pure in their most recently reported quarter. In fact, just last week, Gartner rated 3PAR
as the best storage product on the market across every use case category. This is a powerful recommendation to our
customers and partners, and will help us continue to drive share gains against our competitors.
Finally, in Technology Services, we continued to see a growing proportion of the business come from high-value
services like Proactive Care and Data Center Care, while operating margins remained steady.
Turning to Enterprise Services, we had the best performance in Q4 that we've had in years due to a more diversified
customer base, stabilized constant currency revenue growth, and a significantly reduced cost structure. Revenue
declined 2% in constant currency, although we grew new logos and saw double-digit growth in strategic enterprise
services, driven by strength in helium cloud and security services. Operating profit was 8% in the quarter, the best
performance since 2011. For the full year, both revenue and operating margins were in the range of our outlook.
Looking ahead, we have a clear plan in place to get to a longer-term sustainable target operating margin of 7% to 9%.
In software, we delivered strong margins while continuing to take steps to align the portfolio and the go-to-market
approach with the four transformation areas. Revenue declined 2% year over year in constant currency, or flat if you
normalize for recent M&A transactions on a pro forma basis. During the quarter, we announced several transactions,
including the sale of TippingPoint and LiveVault, which will allow us to focus our resources and investments in
higher-growth strategic businesses.
Finally, our Financial Services business continues to be a differentiator for the company. Hewlett Packard Enterprise
Financial Services helps customers by creating consumption-based models to buy new technology or financing
programs to transition out of legacy systems. Total FY 2015 financing volume increased 9% year over year in constant
currency.
As I have said before, HPE's innovation engine is humming, and Q4 was no exception. During the quarter we
introduced important new solutions and continued to see strong customer traction across the portfolio. For example, in
September we announced several new security solutions to help customers quickly detect high-risk threats, reduce data
breach impact, and enhance overall security. We also won several significant new security deals in the quarter,
including new wins for our Voltage and Fortify solutions with a major financial services company.
In Enterprise Services, we announced a significant new partnership with Microsoft and HP Inc. to enable Windows 10
adoption and drive employee mobility for the enterprise. As part of the agreement, we will build and sell
industry-specific business applications for Windows 10 across key industries such as retail, energy, and transportation.
This agreement is a great example of how Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. will work together going forward.
In servers, we saw continued strong customer momentum with our leading portfolio of Apollo high-performance
compute solutions. We are the clear market leader in high-performance computing, and today more than a third of the
market is leveraging HPE compute platforms to process, analyze, and manage data securely.

Cloud is another important growth driver for us, and we saw strong momentum in the quarter. We are the leading cloud
infrastructure provider, and we see a significant opportunity as enterprises move to a hybrid cloud environment. In late
October we announced HP Helion OpenStack 2.0, our latest enterprise-grade cloud platform with new lifecycle
management and security enhancements. We believe strongly in open standards, and our OpenStack-based cloud
offerings provide the open, agile, and secure hybrid cloud environment our customers are asking for.
We also refined our cloud strategy during the quarter. Our goal is to help customers source, manage, and consume
services across traditional, private, public, and managed cloud environments. To that end, we announced in October
that we will double down on our private and managed cloud capabilities and sunset our public cloud offering. This is
the right move. It plays to our strengths in private and managed cloud. We will continue to extend our cloud
infrastructure leadership and integrate the public cloud element for our customers through a strategic partner-based
model.
In line with that approach, we've reached an agreement with Microsoft that you'll hear more about during Discover next
week. Microsoft shares our view of a hybrid IT approach for enterprises, and we both see opportunity to simplify
hybrid infrastructure for our customers. Going forward, Microsoft Azure will become a preferred public cloud partner.
HPE will serve as a preferred provider of Microsoft's infrastructure and services for its hybrid cloud offerings. Overall,
the move to a hybrid cloud environment presents a significant growth opportunity for us, and you can expect to hear
more about our approach in coming months.
And on that note, I'll hand the call over to Tim Stonesifer.
Timothy C. Stonesifer
Thanks, Meg.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise finished the year on a strong note, and we are already executing against the financial
architecture we laid out at our Securities Analyst Meeting. This calls for solid growth from EG, with stable to slightly
up margins, stabilizing revenue in ES with strong market expansion, stabilizing software revenue with good
profitability, all while leveraging Financial Services with their good return on equity.
In Q4, our segments collectively delivered revenue of $14.1 billion, which was up 3% year over year in constant
currency. This marks the second quarter in a row of delivering year-over-year constant currency growth, and we expect
to take share in x86 servers, storage, and networking during the third calendar quarter. For the full fiscal year 2015, we
estimate HPE's contribution to HP's total non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be $1.84, in the middle of the
previously provided outlook. Similarly, we estimate HPE's contribution to HP's total free cash flow for the year to be
$1 billion, just below the previously provided outlook.
We benefited from a push-out of separation costs that was offset primarily by the timing of value-added tax receivables
and restructuring payments along with the higher financing receivables that Cathie mentioned in her remarks.
Now turning to the segments, the Enterprise Group continued its strong momentum, growing revenue 2% year over
year, or 9% in constant currency. Operating profit improved sequentially by one point to 14%, and was down 0.8 points
year over year, primarily due to currency. Industry Standard Servers grew 5% year over year or 13% in constant
currency, and was up across all geographies in constant currency. The work we have done segmenting the market and
delivering innovative products has enabled us to capture more than our fair share of this strong market. We expect
server momentum to continue next year, but at a moderated pace given more difficult compares.
Business Critical Systems declined 8% year over year, but only 2% in constant currency. This was our strongest
year-over-year revenue growth in over three years as our mission critical x86 and NonStop platforms offset the
challenges from Itanium.
Storage declined 7%, but was flat in constant currency, significantly outperforming the market. Converged Storage
grew 17% in constant currency, and was 53% of the portfolio. We are now seeing our R&D investments pay off with

exceptional growth in all-flash, which has taken over ten points of share in the last year. We expect the improving mix
of Converged Storage to drive overall growth in fiscal year 2016 at improved margins and with better TS Attach.
Networking grew 35% year over year or 43% in constant currency and grew high single digits in constant currency
excluding Aruba. The recent strategic moves we've made are already yielding results. The Aruba acquisition is driving
incremental opportunities from the campus wireless refresh and we've returned to growth in China following the
announcement of our partnership with Tsinghua. We expect to close the Tsinghua transaction in Q1.
TS declined 11% or 4% in constant currency, impacted by tough compare in consulting from the prior year. Order
growth was flat year over year in local currency, lighter than expected. This was partially due to customers in China
waiting for the Tsinghua transaction to close before signing new multi-year support contracts. Additionally, we had a
higher mix of Tier 1 service provider growth in servers that attach little support. We are addressing these issues with
more value added services like Proactive Care and Data Center Care that are increasing our support attach dollars on a
per unit basis. For the full year, orders were up 1% in local currency and TS continues to be on track for flat constant
currency revenue in fiscal year 2016.
In Enterprise Services, revenue declined 9% year over year, or 2% in constant currency and was flat when you exclude
the top three account runoff. For full fiscal 2015, we saw total bookings growth driven by new logo signings and solid
renewals. Our cost actions also delivered strong margin expansion. Profitability was up 1.4 points year over year to
8.2% for the quarter, the highest it's been since the second quarter of 2011. Infrastructure technology outsourcing was
down 11% year over year or down 4% in constant currency. We saw encouraging constant currency growth in EMEA,
which was previously our most challenged region.
Application and business services was down 5% year over year, but grew 1% in constant currency, our strongest
constant currency result in over three years. This result is especially encouraging since ABS carries the highest
operating margins within ES.
In Software, revenue declined 7% year over year, or 2% in constant currency and was flat when normalized for
acquisitions on a pro forma basis and divestitures. The team continue to focus on disciplined cost controls, achieving
operating margins of 30.1%, down 1.3 points year over year due mostly to currency. We enjoyed good revenue growth
in security and double-digit revenue growth in big data year over year in constant currency when adjusted for
acquisitions on a pro forma basis and divestitures. In particular, licensed revenue for Vertica increased in excess 50%
year over year, driven by several large wins in North America. SaaS also grew year over year in constant currency and
in each business when normalized for acquisitions on a pro forma basis and divestitures.
Going forward, we expect better alignment with the enterprise group and enterprise services to improve cross selling
opportunities. However, we also continue to expect pressure on the top line as we evolve our go-to-market efforts
towards SaaS and subscription based offerings.
In Financial Services, revenue declined 11% year over year or 4% in constant currency with operating profit declining
1.3 points to 11%. The challenges to both revenue and profitability were entirely due to unfavorable currency and a
tough compare. Financing is playing an increasingly strategic role for our customers with volume up 9% in constant
currency during fiscal year 2015. Financing volume is a good indicator of future revenue performance. The return on
equity remained healthy at 16.4%.
With that, let's turn to the outlook. On the top line, we expect the momentum of Q3 and Q4 constant currency revenue
growth to continue through fiscal year 2016. The currency environment continues to be volatile and based on current
rates we expect a three point headwind to revenue in fiscal year 2016.
Before I give our EPS outlook, let me provide some guidance for earnings seasonality at the new Hewlett Packard
Enterprise. In general, EPS will be backend loaded for a few reasons. First, both Enterprise Services and software
margins normally expand throughout the year from a low in Q1. Second, the benefits we receive from restructuring will
continue ramping over time. And finally, the negative impact from dissynergies will decline throughout the year. With
that in mind, we expect non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $0.37 to $0.41 in the first quarter of 2016, and
continue to expect full year fiscal 2016 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.85 to $1.95.

We expect GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $0.09 to $0.13 in Q1 of 2016 and continue to expect full year
fiscal 2016 GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.75 to $0.85.
We continue to expect free cash flow of $2 to $2.2 billion for the full year; however, please keep in mind that cash flow
is seasonally lowest in the first quarter and in fiscal year 2016 it will also be impacted by the majority of the remaining
separation payments.
Finally, for capital allocation, earlier this month we announced our Q1 dividend of $05.5 per share, in line with our
commitment to distribute approximately $400 million in the form of dividends in fiscal year 2016. We remain
committed to returning at least 50% of our free cash flow for the full year to shareholders in the form of share
repurchases and dividends.
In closing, let me say that I'm pleased with the progress we are making against the five key priorities we discussed at
our Securities Analyst Meeting. The business has momentum and our financial architecture continues to strengthen. In
short, I'm excited about our prospects and the future of Hewlett Packard Enterprise.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Dion.
Dion J. Weisler
Thank you, Tim.
The Printing and Personal Systems markets are experiencing challenges right now. As we discussed on the Q3 earnings
call and in more detail at the Securities Analyst Meeting, we expected to have several tough quarters and Q4 was,
indeed a difficult quarter and somewhat weaker that we expected. Following separation, we remain confident that we
are well-positioned for the long term in the marketplace. The market challenges do not intimidate us and we are keenly
aware of what we need to be focused on going forward.
Turning to the results, overall, in Q4 our business performance was mixed. In Personal Systems, we executed well
against the expected tough market backdrop, while Printing represented a much greater challenge due to a number of
factors that have changed our near-term view of the market and the supplies revenue trajectory.
Before I go into those details on Printing, let me briefly reflect on the Q4 results for Personal Systems. The PC market
continued to be tough, especially in consumer where industry channel inventory remained elevated in the market.
While we saw improved performance in the U.S., EMEA remained weak with market units declining 22% year over
year in the third calendar quarter, as we foreshadowed at the Securities Analyst Meeting. As I've said in the past, where
markets are down, our ability to outperform the market profitability is key.
HP gained unit share in calendar third quarter in each of our three regions, achieving 19.7% market share worldwide.
We continued to extend our lead in the market with commercial PC share of 23.7%, our highest share position ever.
And we managed to do this all while improving Personal Systems operating profit by 0.8 point sequentially to 3.8%.
We believe that innovation and sprinkles of magic are key to differentiation as the PC market goes through
consolidation. In Q4, we introduced a robust portfolio of enterprise class and consumer PCs with a number of form
factors and industry firsts. And we announced a partnership with Disney and Lucasfilm around Star Wars, The Force
Awakens, delighting our customers with the launch of our Star Wars special edition notebook PC.
Looking ahead, we expect the PC market to remain challenged for more quarters to come. As expected, Windows 10
has not been a material catalyst for sales yet, but continues to receive favorable reviews. We see the most adoption in
the U.S. retail segment and our share here is very strong. We maintain that this new operating system is important for
the industry and a contributing factor to support a future hardware refresh cycle.
Turning to Printing, we saw accelerated revenue declines across hardware and supplies and there have been a couple of
factors that have changed since the Securities Analyst Meeting. The most significant factor was the continued effects of

currency movements that have accelerated pricing pressures even more than we expected in certain profitable segments
of the printing markets.
Secondly, the market was somewhat weaker than we expected in the calendar third quarter. And you're seeing this in
our results and you saw it in the results of some of our peers, some of whom have announced their intention to
reevaluate strategic options. We do not expect the landscape to improve in the near future and we will constantly assess
how the market evolves. In any case, our market leadership and scale serve us well, but we have much more work to do
on many dimensions.
Specifically in hardware, we saw a 17% year-over-year unit decline due to three factors. Firstly, the hardware market
continued to contract, with calendar third quarter total units down 6% year over year, down more than we expected.
Secondly, pressure in the unit performance was a planned channel inventory reduction. We consciously elevated
inventory levels in Q3 in advance of the IT system cutover as part of our separation related continuity planning. The
good news is that with the reduction in Q4, the hardware channel inventory is now within the desired range as we finish
the year. So approximately, three quarters of the unit decline is linked to the market and channel inventory reduction.
Thirdly, with the market down more than expected, the competitive pricing environment was even more challenging in
certain profitable segments where usage is high.
Let me take a moment to outline the impact currency is having on the pricing dynamics in the market. We have seen
further reduction in average unit prices in key segments. Our competitors have leveraged currency advantages to drive
down pricing, and we have responded in kind. This has changed the price points for certain units and means that some
units in specific markets were no longer MPV positive, and as we said we would do, we have responsibly been going
after profitable share gains and walking away from negative MPV hardware unit deals.
Another consequence of lower average unit price points is that we are attracting buyers that may have different usage
patents than we originally targeted. For example, the pricing of some of the Officejet Pro hardware has fallen into price
bands that are within reach of home users who typically print less. The unintended result is that we are not getting the
yield per unit we would have expected on some of these units.
We see this impacting our supplies revenue trajectory. Q4 2015 supplies revenue was not where we expected it to be,
and we have more work to do. We will accelerate initiatives across all the levers we pull to improve the supplies
revenues trajectory.
Examples of these initiatives include driving programs to increase ink usage and to increase after-market supply share.
On ink usage, we expect to accelerate our instant ink subscription service with programs that increase our attach rate. In
Q4, one of the programs was to expand the number of models and therefore price points that instant ink addresses,
ensuring more customers never run out of ink. We are confident that the fundamentals of the 4-box model are sound.
We believe all of these actions will help improve the trajectory of supplies revenue over time.
However, given the unit declines and change in usage patterns, the data from our 4-box model is indicating that we
expect stabilization in ink supplies revenue to be delayed towards the end of 2017 as we drive these initiatives.
We are moving quickly on three vectors. We remain focused on solutioning the $1 billion of productivity
improvements we laid out at the Securities Analyst Meeting. Secondly, we can't compete on price alone, so we are
balancing our pricing actions with increased marketing and sales activity to stimulate demand. And finally, we have to
materially change our non-revenue generating cost structure to compete aggressively. This may both accelerate and
increase the previously announced restructuring actions.
In closing, we firmly believe in our strategy around core growth and the future as outlined at the Securities Analyst
Meeting. Let me remind you, we are still the leader in large consolidating markets. We have scale, innovation, channel
reach, and an incredible brand. While the markets are challenging now, we believe the actions we are taking now will
protect the core that generates the majority of our cash flow. And of course, we will continue to invest in adjacent
market opportunities and our future.
I'll now turn it over to Cathie, who can provide additional details and our financial outlook.

Thank you, Dion.
Printing net revenue was down 14% year over year as reported or down 9% in constant currency. As expected, the
year-over-year currency impact was greater than past quarters, as favorable long-dated financial hedges matured.
From a channel inventory perspective, we've reduced both hardware and supplies levels year over year and
sequentially, but we are still slightly above the target weeks of supply range for supplies. Supplies revenue was down
10% year over year as reported or down 5% in constant currency and was 65% of the revenue mix in the quarter.
We had some bright spots in the quarter, including constant currency revenue growth in graphics. Also, Managed Print
Services revenue grew double digits in constant currency year over year in Q4, and for fiscal 2015 we saw strong
growth both as reported and in constant currency in total contract value for our partner MPS offering.
From an operating profit perspective, we delivered 17.4%, down 0.8 points year over year. Currency headwinds and
competitive pricing were only partially offset by strong supplies mix.
Turning to Personal Systems, revenue was down 14% year over year as reported or down 7% in constant currency.
Consumer and commercial PC units were each down year over year, but we outperformed the market in calendar Q3,
gaining 0.3 points of share in consumer and 1.6 points of share in commercial. We've done a lot of work to drive to a
variable cost structure, which supports our profitability in these down quarters. Personal Systems operating profit
improved sequentially to 3.8% on the strength of gross margins, but was down 0.2 points year over year as a result of
reduced operating expense leverage on lower volumes despite OpEx reductions and improved gross margins. Gaining
cost efficiencies will position us well as the market slowly recovers.
Considering the combined performance of the Printing and Personal Systems segments in the context of the overall
Hewlett-Packard Company results, we estimate our pro forma contribution to the non-GAAP EPS result for fiscal 2015
to be about $0.01 below the baseline range provided at the Securities Analyst Meeting. Our pro forma free cash flow
contribution to the company was approximately $2.3 billion for fiscal 2015, within the range we outlined at the
Securities Analyst Meeting.
Turning to the financial outlook, beginning in Q1 2016 the new HP Inc. will make a reporting change related to
pension. For the last several years, we have had pension income. Our pension liabilities and assets are revalued each
October 31 based on interest rates and asset values on that day. This can drive non-operational volatility in our pension
income from year to year. For FY 2016, this volatility causes a year-over-year decrease in pension income of
approximately $90 million, and we don't expect this to have an impact to FY 2016 cash flow. Without a change in
reporting method, however, this headwind would have put incremental pressure on our investments, and
sub-optimizing our business for non-operational impact is not in our best long-term interest.
Specifically, the change relates to the expected performance of the plan assets and interest rate movements, the
market-related factors in determining pension income or expense. We will exclude these market-related factors from
the non-GAAP operational results going forward. With this reporting change, the service cost associated with our
pension plan and the amortization of prior service cost will continue to be reported as operational expenses within our
non-GAAP results. For more information, please refer to the Investor Relations earnings presentation, which includes a
few slides detailing the change.
We believe that going forward this reporting change provides greater transparency to underlying operating results.
However, the reporting change will result in a reduction of our non-GAAP EPS outlook, given we will now exclude
our non-operational pension income.
Moving to revenue, as discussed at the Securities Analyst Meeting, we expect year-over-year constant currency
declines to moderate, but currency will continue to be a headwind to revenue of about three to four points in FY 2016.
Since then, net currency moves have been unfavorable, and we see only incremental pressure to both revenue and
operating profit year over year. Our non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be about a point lower than the 22% to 23%

range provided at the Securities Analyst Meeting, given the pension reporting change noted.
For Q1 specifically, keep the following things in mind. The Personal Systems and Printing markets continue to be
tough. Supplies revenue will continue to be under pressure as we reduce supplies channel inventory, and the supplies
revenue trajectory improvement will take longer. Given the pricing dynamics Dion laid out, we expect printer units to
be down double digits year over year as we continue to focus on profitable unit placement. And finally, productivity
improvements are expected to ramp throughout the year. Considering these factors, we expect the first half operating
profit to be lower than our typical in-year seasonality.
With all that in mind, the HP Inc. Q1 2016 non-GAAP net earnings per share outlook is in the range of $0.33 to $0.38,
inclusive of the pension reporting change. Our full-year fiscal 2016 non-GAAP net earnings per share outlook is in the
range of $1.59 to $1.69. Operationally, our non-GAAP EPS outlook is unchanged. But with the exclusion of
non-operating pension income, there was a reduction of $0.08 in fiscal 2016 as compared to what we provided at the
Securities Analyst Meeting.
On a GAAP basis, Q1 2016 GAAP net earnings per share outlook range is $0.27 to $0.32, and our full-year FY 2016
GAAP net earnings per share outlook range is $1.50 to $1.60. The reduction in the full-year GAAP EPS outlook of
$0.05 in fiscal 2016 from what we provided at the Securities Analyst Meeting is associated with the following: $0.03
for lower pension income as a result of the revaluation of pension assets and liabilities as of October 31, 2015; and
$0.02 is associated with the amortization of intangibles related to the marketing optimization shift to HP Inc. and the
separation charges that moved from FY 2015 to FY 2016.
For FY 2016 we expect our normalized free cash flow to be in the range of $2.9 billion to $3.2 billion, consistent with
the discussion at the Securities Analyst Meeting; however, we are adjusting our free cash flow outlook to a range of
$2.4 billion to $2.7 billion, down $100 million due to separation payments that slipped from FY 2015.
Finally, for capital allocation, we announced earlier this month that we will be paying a dividend of $0.124 per share in
fiscal 2016. We remain committed to a total capital return to shareholders for the full year to be at the high end of our
overall framework of 50% to 75% of free cash flow. We expect that share repurchases will drive a moderate decline in
weighted average shares outstanding beginning in Q1.
With that, let's open it up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator instructions] We request that you only ask one question and one follow-up question. Our first question is
from Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Kathryn Lynn Huberty>: Yes, thanks. Good afternoon. It sounds like some of the businesses, printers in
particular, deteriorated as you moved through the quarter, and yet DSOs are up three days year on year. So can you talk
about linearity and just the overall tone of business as you exited the quarter? And then I have a follow-up.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: So on the Personal Systems and Printing side of the house, so PPS, because we don't have
HP Inc. today. At the PPS level, our cash conversion cycle actually was a bit better than what we had laid out for you at
the Securities Analyst Meeting, and so from our perspective, we performed very well with respect to working capital.
<Q - Kathryn Lynn Huberty>: And then on the enterprise side of the business, how did linearity look versus normal?
<A - Timothy C. Stonesifer>: True. As we spoke about at the analyst meeting, in 3Q we had about 30 days and that
was a little bit elevated given by the fact of our business continuity plan that we have in place. So as we had
anticipated, we have worked those down and we're sort of in the mid-20s range and that's what I would think about as
you think about 2016.

<Q - Kathryn Lynn Huberty>: Okay. And then, Dion, you mentioned that some of your peers in Printing are going
through strategic reviews, I imagine that may over time open up competitive opportunity, but curious whether you have
interest in the near term at looking at any assets, not mentioning any in particular, but looking at some of those assets
that may come for sale and driving scale in the Printing business? Thanks.
<A - Dion J. Weisler>: Thanks, Katy. Look, obviously, as a matter of policy, we don't comment on those sorts of
matters, but our general approach to M&A has not changed since we had the discussion at the Securities Analyst
Meeting. We will continue to look for opportunities that are complementary to our strategy. They'll always be
return-based in nature, they'll be thoughtful and disciplined and they'll land clearly and squarely on the strategy page,
so they will be core across growth and in the future. Areas that we have talked about have been the areas of 3D print
and materials specifically around document workflow solutions, sprinkles of magic, but generally not broadly
consolidation place for consolidation sake.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: So we did talk – let me just add, we did talk a little bit about the fact that there could be
some very specific markets in some specific countries that could be of interest to us as long as it was kind of in the core
areas of emphasis, especially on the Personal Systems side around commercial.
<A - Dion J. Weisler>: I would add, Katy, that obviously there is a lot changing in the market, even since the
Securities Analyst Meeting on both the Personal Systems side with Dell EMC, as well as Xerox and Lexmark, that
present particular opportunities, and as they evaluate their strategic options, I think customers are generally fairly
confused and worried, and we are the pillar of stability right now, and we are going to take full advantage of that.
<Q - Kathryn Lynn Huberty>: Great, thank you.
<A - Diana Sroka>: All right, next question.
Operator
Next question is from Maynard Um at Wells Fargo.
<Q - Maynard J. Um>: Hi, thanks. On the HP Inc. side, Lenovo talked about getting more aggressive to take
advantage of the disruption, both from your split and Dell's acquisition of EMC, I presume on both PCs and server. So
I'm wondering if you are already seeing that, and that's what you're referring to in terms of the competitive
environment, or if that's something that you haven't seen, and are expecting. Can you just kind of walk through that?
<A - Dion J. Weisler>: I would say, generally speaking, that the PC market continues to be tough, and consolidation
continues to happen. The big four are getting bigger. They're now 62.5% of the total overall market, and growing. And
I think we've been pretty predictable over the course of the last two years, not taking share for share's sake. We did
grow in all three regions to 19.7% overall. Commercial share, we grew to 23.7%, and that was our highest ever shared
position. So we remained very disciplined. We walked away from some sizable Black Friday deals that were not very
high calorie, or in fact negative calorie. So I think we continued to execute, as we said we would. We continue to
segment the market, drive to where the heat is in the market, drive cost out, make sure our channel inventory and
particularly aged inventory is well under control. And as we did that we saw profit margin expansion 0.8% sequentially
to 3.8%, so we're squarely on strategy here.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: And I would say that we didn't see a disruption. Dion went through the details that show
that we didn't see the disruption to our business as a result of the split. That was not a factor on how we met customer
needs or in the reception that we got from customers.
<A - Margaret C. Whitman>: And I think, Maynard, you asked about servers. I would say the exact same thing.
There was no disruption to customers. I have to say this split was executed nearly flawlessly, and it's a credit to the
team across the globe. We've been very successful, actually, at taking server share as the IBM server business migrated
over to Lenovo. We've actually been very good at taking share and also gaining formerly – former IBM channel
partners. So, we've been very aggressive there. And obviously, as I've talked about as the Dell EMC merger creates

uncertainty in the marketplace, we obviously want to be there. Talking about the future of the company, the future of
our server business, and of course the future of storage and networking, which we feel like we're in really great shape,
as I said our innovation engine is humming.
<Q - Maynard J. Um>: Okay. And just for my follow up. For HP Enterprise, I calculate that roughly nearly three
quarters of your profits next fiscal year will be recurring. Are there any dynamics in the transactional businesses that
make the cash flow less recurring, or can we assume that nearly three quarters of your free cash flow is also recurring?
Thanks.
<A - Timothy C. Stonesifer>: I'm sorry, yeah. At a high level profitability is recurring, so I think you could assume
that.
<A - Margaret C. Whitman>: I don't think there's anything in the dynamics that are different in 2016 than were
different in the Hewlett Packard Enterprise segments in 2015, except for that TS is getting stronger. So TS is up,
Financial Services is an annuity, and ES is getting stronger as well. So I would say that ES, the contracts are getting a
bit shorter, but that shouldn't really affect us in 2016.
<Q - Maynard J. Um>: Great, thank you.
<A - Diana Sroka>: Thank you. Next question, please.
Operator
Next question is from Toni Sacconaghi at Bernstein.
<Q - A.M. Sacconaghi, Jr.>: Yes, thank you. I have one for HP Inc. and one for HP Enterprise. On the HP Inc. side,
you commented on an incremental currency headwind, and you also commented on a fundamentally more challenged
printing business going forward, including supplies, which drive the profits. Yet you didn't change your operating EPS
guidance for fiscal 2016, and I'm wondering why because the commentary certainly would have suggested that it
should be lower and what the offsets are?
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: Thanks, Toni. So we're taking very decisive action in order to counterbalance some of the
headwinds that we're seeing in the Printing business. And Dion talked a little bit about them in his prepared remarks. I
mean, we're absolutely maniacally focused on the billion dollars in productivity improvements and making sure that
those are getting delivered, and frankly getting delivered a little bit earlier in the year.
We are also trying to change kind of how we approach the market and the market looks at us by really doing a better
job from a marketing perspective and a sales perspective so that in fact we are not competing on price alone. We've got
a lot of value in the products that we bring to market and we think that there's an opportunity there. We also think there
is an opportunity to improve our supplies market share position and so we're taking action around, again, marketing and
feet on the street as well as really going after online.
And then finally, Dion mentioned the fact that we are restructuring our non-revenue generating cost base and we will
be aggressively taking cost out of kind of the non-revenue generating. We believe that with these actions, that will
counterbalance some of the incremental headwind that we saw in the printing market. But clearly, there's now more
actions that need to take place in order to deliver the outlook that we provided.
<Q - A.M. Sacconaghi, Jr.>: And on the HPE side, I was wondering if you could comment on a couple of things. It
looked like separation costs had been pushed out from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016. I was wondering if you could
comment on the magnitude of that push out as it relates to HPE and sort of the same question as with HPI, if you have
incremental separation costs in fiscal 2016 relative to your expectations, why is cash flow not adjusted? And also, if
you could just confirm what the expected impact of the closure of the Chinese JV will be on your EPS and revenue for
fiscal 2016 and whether that's in your guidance or not?

<A - Timothy C. Stonesifer>: Sure. Okay, let me start out with the cash flow. So from a separation cost, we had about
$300 million of favorability from a free cash flow perspective on the E side in 2015; $200 million of that will move
over to 2016. So if you look at the overall amount of separation cost, we were actually able to work down the overall
amount, so there will be about a $200 million separation cost increase in 2016. If you look at overall free cash flow and
the adjustment to 2016, we're still holding to the 2016 guide. And basically our shortfall was driven by a couple of
things. If you think about the financing volumes were higher in our Financial Services business, as well as we had some
pressure on the VAT receivables that we were unable to collect. That will push over and give us some favorability in
2016 which will offset some of the separation cost pressure. So overall, we're sticking to the guide that we provided at
SAM.
As far as Tsinghua, we haven't adjusted EPS yet because the deal is not closed. But just to give you some color around
that, from the remaining 49% that will stick with us we're going to account for that with the equity accounting method.
So you'll see that earnings and cash flow impact flow through the other income line. And then as far as a guide or
framing it up from an EPS perspective, we've said historically that we've earned – we had about $400 million of op
profit in that business in 2014, so I think you could use that as a proxy. And then I'd just take a couple of things into
account. One would be the timing of the transaction. So when we close it. And then the second thing I would think
about is there will be some stranded costs associated with overhead costs that do not go with the transaction. So similar
to dyssynergy costs, we will need to work that out of the system and that will take a little bit of time. So that's the
Tsinghua impact.
<A - Margaret C. Whitman>: And I would just say, Toni, we expect this transaction to close in Q1. We expect to
have all the regulatory approvals by December 31.
<A - Diana Sroka>: Okay, thank you, Toni. Next question, please?
Operator
Your next question is from Sherri Scribner at Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Sherri A. Scribner>: Hi, thanks. I had a question on the HPE side. Thinking about the server business, it's been
relatively strong this fiscal year. Can you talk through your expectations? I know you commented you expect it to
decelerate somewhat, but do you expect that business to continue to be able to grow in fiscal 2016?
<A - Margaret C. Whitman>: Yeah, we do. I mean, we are seeing very strong momentum that is in part driven by the
sales to the Tier 1 service providers, but also there's very good strength in our core server market with strong options
attached that obviously help the margins. And ISS, yes, the Industry Standard Server portion has the best ever product
line that we've ever had with Gen9, with Cloudline and Apollo, and these are resonating really well with customers,
and importantly are purpose-built for specific workloads. I think we've talked about how we're taking our server
business to a workload focused strategy.
And as Tim said, ISS grew 5% year over year, 13% in local currency and we expect to gain over a point of share in the
calendar Q3 of 2015. And the market we think is going to be healthy. And so I think we feel very good about the server
business. And the reason we don't think it'll be quite the revenue year-over-year growth that we saw is that we're
starting now to lap very strong compares. But at least for the foreseeable future, we feel pretty good about servers.
<Q - Sherri A. Scribner>: Okay, great. Thanks. And then a question for Dion in terms of the A3 market. You talked
about that a lot at the security analyst day. Does anything that's happening now with the printer market mean that that
entry into that market moves out? Or are you still on your plans to enter that market in about a year?
<A - Dion J. Weisler>: No, we're absolutely on the same course and trajectory that we outlined at the security analysts
meeting. We think it represents a strong growth opportunity for our shareholders.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: And I would just add that we are taking decisive action around the core right now. We are
not taking our foot off of the accelerator on the core or on the investments that we're making for kind of the midterm

growth areas around commercial mobility, packaging, and copier market, or for the future around 3D and immersive
computing.
<A - Dion J. Weisler>: Exactly. Look, said another way, we firmly believe in our strategy. And there's lots of
disruption and change in the market at the moment, and our competitors are pursuing all sorts of options. We will
continue to assess how the markets evolve. We'll get ourselves in fighting shape inside the core, but we will continue to
execute against our strategy.
<Q - Sherri A. Scribner>: Thank you.
<A - Diana Sroka>: Thank you, Sherri. Operator, next question, please.
Operator
Next question is from Steve Milunovich at UBS.
<Q - Steven M. Milunovich>: Thank you. First I wanted to ask about the profits in the server business. Obviously,
you're pretty bullish on the growth rate. But what's been happening to the margin in ISS? I assume it's been coming
down. So have you had and do you expect to have operating profit growth in that segment going forward? And I just
want a little clarification on when you say Tier 1 providers, are those the big hyperscalers? And are you selling them
only Cloudline, or are you selling them more fully configured servers as well?
<A - Timothy C. Stonesifer>: Sure. From a profit perspective, we'd expect margins to be relatively stable actually.
There's a lot of work going on in supply chain on the productivity front. So we have various initiatives going on there
that will help offset some of the pricing pressures that we're seeing. As well as if you look at Gen9, as Gen9 becomes a
bigger piece of the overall portfolio, those margins are also more attractive than what we had with the Gen8.
<A - Margaret C. Whitman>: And as regard to Tier 1, these are the big hyperscalers, as you describe, and they
continue to grow. And we don't really sell them much other than Cloudline. Now we sell storage often and some
networking, but for the server portion it's mostly Cloudline. And then you immediately drop down into what we call
Tier 2, Tier 3, Tier 4, and they buy a much broader mix than just Cloudline.
And the other thing, Steve, that I know you know is that if you look at Enterprise Group in total, obviously the storage
business, which is doing very well with 3PAR and all-flash, plus the networking business is higher margin than the
server business. So the blended average, as we said at the Securities Analyst Meeting, EG needs to be the growth
engine of the company over the next couple of years with modestly expanding margins. And the margins will expand
with the mix shift, and obviously, of course, with the attach rate that is higher on 3PAR and all-flash.
<Q - Steven M. Milunovich>: That's great. And it's good to see you getting some credit for 3PAR all-flash. We've
certainly heard the same thing that it's a terrific product. How about on the solutions side? I think obviously legacy
vendors are under attack from a lot of different directions, but you do have a bit of an ace in terms of the completeness
of the product line. And I've always had some concern that HP is a bit of a piece parts company, but it seems like you
have been emphasizing solutions, trying to coordinate the groups more. Are you seeing evidence that customers are
beginning to react to that and it's going to put you in a good competitive position?
<A - Margaret C. Whitman>: So we feel really good about our ability to continue the transformation to a solutions
selling company. First of all, because we now have a great server storage networking converged offering, but as we
move to these four transformation areas that we talked about at the Securities Analyst Meeting, this is dead on with
customers. These four transformation areas is exactly what virtually every customer is looking for. How do I transform
my IT environment to a hybrid environment? How do I secure my digital enterprise? How do I enable an analytics, a
big data analytics environment? And how do I drive workplace productivity? And we are aligning software, services,
and hardware or infrastructure to that.
And this is particularly powerful for software because software now has some of the anchor IP in each of these areas,
and it's also helping us decide what parts of software we want to be in and what parts we don't. We talked about

LiveVault and TippingPoint. This four-transformation area gives us a very good portfolio criteria by which to manage
that software business.
So I think the transformation areas are absolutely right on for customers, and we feel like we've got a pretty good
portfolio. And where we have gaps, our first choice will be to do organic innovations. Second choice will be around
partnering with our ventures arm. And then finally would be M&A along the lines of a 3PAR, 3Com, Aruba kind of
acquisitions.

The next question is from Kulbinder Garcha at Credit Suisse.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Thank you, a question for Dion first. On the supplies business, what I think I've heard is
the market is a little bit worse, the pricing environment is tough, and inventory levels may be high. I guess can you
speak about the visibility you have on each of those items beginning to improve?
And then linked to that is that I think once upon a time, not so long ago, you were saying that the supplies business
would stabilize by the middle of this year, then it was by the end of 2016, now it's by the end of 2017. So this four-box
model which manages this business, which is supposed to give this predictability isn't seen that predictable, I guess. So
my question is, how much faith do you have in that continued model about that supplies business eventually turning?
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: Thanks, Kulbinder. I guess I'll start and then I'll throw it to Dion to add any additional
comments. We have found that our four-box model is in fact very good. And as we have collected more big data, and
every week we collect new data, we update basically the model. What we saw in Q4 were basically two things that
really impacted the model and impacted when the ink supplies would stabilize and push it out to basically late 2017.
The first thing was we did see incremental competitiveness in key segments, particularly in SMB ink, and therefore we
placed less units. And as a result of that, that's going to have a knock-on effect around ink supplies.
Secondly, what we saw was through aggressive pricing, we actually took a product that should have been sold into one
end user, an end user that in fact prints a lot, and we now are selling that product into home users which just don't print
enough. And so we need to change that, and that's part of better managing the marketing, better managing basically the
price points. And that has a knock-on effect because those were units that we had expected would be very high usage.
So we have a lot of confidence in the model, but you have to work the model all the time. And it's across those four
dimensions that we've talked about: the installed base, usage, aftermarket share, and then also making sure that we're
careful about what we do from a supplies pricing perspective.
<A - Dion J. Weisler>: Absolutely. The only other thing that I would add to that is that we just believe that this is the
new normal. We have a lot of faith in our four-box model. It is an incredibly predictable model. But there are dynamics
in the market, competitive dynamics in the market that just our working assumptions need to change around. This is
exactly how it is going to be. And as a result of that, we need to go to the gym, we need to get fit, we need to deal with
currency the way that it's exposing itself in the market and the ramifications it's having on the marketplace, and do the
three things that we talked about: drive those productivity improvements; not fight on price alone; balance marketing
and sales; and materially go after non-revenue generating expenses. When we do that, we can turn marginal NPV units
that have slipped into negative back into positive territory, and that will then reinform the four-box model.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: And maybe just one very quick question for Meg. As you've separated now into HP
Enterprise, what are your thoughts on industry consolidation under all of the HP Enterprise perhaps players in there?
Thanks.
<A - Margaret C. Whitman>: Listen, obviously I think one of the things that validates the decision to separate is
these markets are changing enormously. I mean, Dion talked about a couple of his competitors, looking at strategic

opportunities. We also obviously see the Dell, EMC transaction. What I'd tell you is we feel really good about our
strategy relative to what we see Dell and EMC doing. I mean, they could not be in more stark contrast. They're getting
bigger leveraging up and doubling down mostly on legacy technology, while our strategy is to get smaller.
I just spent the last four years deleveraging the balance sheet and leaning into new technology like converged
infrastructure, new server architectures, 3PAR with all-flash, Aruba, et cetera. So we feel really good about our strategy
and our portfolio of assets. And I'll underscore what I said before. These four transformation areas is the way we're
going to pivot this company to solution selling. EF, already solution sells, EG and Software are moving rapidly towards
that solution of driving business outcomes as opposed to just selling speeds and feeds. And it's a cultural change for this
company, but actually I will tell you, it's underway and I'm feeling pretty good about it.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Thank you.
<A - Diana Sroka>: Thank you, Kulbinder. Operator, we'll take a final question, please.
Operator
The last question is from Jim Suva at Citi.
<Q - James Dickey Suva>: Thank you and congratulations on your separation. I have one question for Meg and one
question for Dion and/or Cathie. Meg, I believe you mentioned some of the ES contracts may be getting shorter. Did I
hear that correctly? And what does that mean to the profitability of such, the ability to invest in such? It seems like it
may compress some of that a little bit? But maybe I'm wrong on that.
And then the other question for Dion and/or Cathie would be, I think you'd mentioned that you said the PC channel had
some elevated inventory. And I believe we heard about this when you were going through the separation and you
wanted to have your systems make sure that they converted over, but that was several months ago. So are you referring
to excess inventory in the channel from HP, or others, or both? Or how should we think about that comment? Because I
would have thought by now that that PC inventory or anything due to your separation in the IT conversion cycles
would have already right side themselves? Thank you very much.
<A - Margaret C. Whitman>: Let me answer the ES question. So the ES business is changing and you will recall in
the old days, in particularly the ITO part of the business, you would lose money in the first two years of the contract
then you'd breakeven for about three years, and then you'd make money in the final four years. But the only problem
with that is that in about year eight the customer would renegotiate and you'd miss out on the whole profit of the whole
thing.
And so really the market has moved to shorter more strategic relationships in ITO. As opposed to just labor arbitrage,
now there is, how do we transform your infrastructure to be more nimble, more agile, and lower cost? And we've talked
about a number of our customers for whom we're not just taking their mess for less. In the old days, that's probably
what we would have done. Now we are saying, we will help transform your IT environment to be part of this new
world order that's going to allow it to be lower cost, more modern, and allow you to be more agile. And those contracts
tend to be shorter, and we're actually okay with that because we also are very clear now that we're not going to lose
money in contracts in years one and two. And these things have to be profitable from the beginning.
And that's been a change in the industry, and frankly a change that we're putting a lot of discipline in. We're very, very
focused on only taking deals that are good business for us. And like Dion said in his business, share for share's sake is
not interesting to us here. We want to do good profitable deals with customers that we can drive a good outcome for.
And you're seeing that. We said at our analyst meeting, we now have the highest Net Promoter Score in the business, in
the services business. And that ultimately, and we can see it, is going to translate, I think, into higher new logos and
higher TCV.
<A - Dion J. Weisler>: Okay. And to your question on channel inventories, I'll step back. Going into quarter four,
what I said was industry inventory levels were high. And our inventory levels were also high. As we exit Q4, I would

say that industry inventory levels are still elevated, but somewhat lower than they were as the market has begun to
digest the Windows 8 inventory. But our inventory position is now back within the ranges and in good shape with
regards to the age profile of that inventory.

Good. All right, thank you. Thank you very much, everyone, for being on a slightly extended call today, because we
wanted to make sure we covered the company and then also Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. So thank you very
much. And next quarter, we'll be reporting as two separate companies. So, again, thanks for your support and thanks for
a little extended time today.
