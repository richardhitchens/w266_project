MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Sharon Yeshaya
Good morning. This is Sharon Yeshaya, Head of Investor Relations. During today's presentation, we will refer to our
earnings release and financial supplement, copies of which are available at morganstanley.com.
Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause
actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP
measures that appear in the earnings release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our
consent.
I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman.
James Patrick Gorman
Hi, good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us.
In the second quarter, we achieved a 9% ROE, reflecting the stability of many of our businesses, which offset a
relatively difficult trading environment. In many ways, this quarter provided a robust test of our business strategy.
Whilst many trading businesses were affected by benign markets characterized by low volatility and the absence of
meaningful macro events, other business lines demonstrated resilience.
Investment banking showed continued strength, reflecting diversity of our global M&A and capital markets franchises.
Investment management saw asset inflows and solid performance across alternatives. As a result, this business saw
improved revenues and returns. Wealth management performed at the high end of our 2017 target, achieving a 25%

pre-tax margin and a record profit before tax of over $1 billion. It is worth noting that in the first year after the
acquisition of Smith Barney, wealth management generated approximately $1 billion of pre-tax profit annually.
Compensation expenses are in line with our stated targets and higher accruals year-to-date reflect higher revenues.
Non-compensation expenses include one notable item, which Jon will take you through in a moment.
Given the obvious headwinds this quarter, we're pleased to have generated respectful returns for shareholders, albeit at
the bottom end of our target range. Of course, with the firm now on solid footing, fulfillments could still materially
improve in the years ahead, assuming constructive markets. In addition, there are three tailwinds worth calling out.
Each of which has the potential to impact our long-term performance in a material and positive way.
Capital, tax reform and interest rates, on capital, this year through CCAR, we asked for and received approval to buy
back up to $5 billion of stock and increase our dividend to an aggregate of $1.00 per share annually. While we intend to
invest in our business as opportunities present themselves, we're determined to use any excess capital to continue to
reduce our share count.
Much has been talked of adjustments to some of the Dodd-Frank rules that were put in place over the past eight years.
It is fair to say that now is the time to make some practical changes to the multitude of regulations. These changes
would allow U.S. banks to be greater engines of economic growth.
Second, U.S. corporate taxes are too high. If the administration and congress can achieve a sensible realignment of tax
rates with other major developed economies, then that would be a clear positive for our business and corporate America
in general.
Finally, as a major U.S. depository, we've endured historically low interest rates for a very long time, each movement
higher in rates, assuming a measured path should benefit our business.
In summary, in the second quarter, we showed resilience in a challenging market. In a more favorable environment, we
should see better results. More interesting to us though are the long-term impacts of some of the changes just described.
We've built meaningful operating leverage in our business. While we remain cautious in the near-term, we like our
business mix and remain bullish on the long-term outlook for the firm.
I will now turn the call over to Jon to discuss the quarter in greater detail. Thank you.
Jonathan Pruzan
Thank you and good morning.
The optimism that characterized the first quarter was replaced with a more subdued tone amongst clients for the
majority of the second quarter. Activity was more sporadic and market sensitive businesses, particularly within fixed
income, were impacted. That said, we supported our clients when market opportunities presented themselves. Equity
sales and trading and investment banking produced strong results. Wealth management and investment management
both witnessed continued growth and stabilized our headline performance.
Firm revenues were $9.5 billion, down 2% compared to a strong Q1. PBT was $2.6 billion. EPS was $0.87 and ROE
was 9.1%. Non-compensation expenses were up approximately $138 million or 6% quarter over quarter. Well over half
of the increase was due to a provision that we recorded as a result of a self-identified item relating to that on
intercompany services provided to our UK operations. We also saw some seasonal increase in professional services,
marketing and business development and higher volume driven expenses. We continue to exercise compensation
expense discipline, which led to a 1% sequential decline in total non-interest expense.
On Project Streamline, virtually, all identified projects are in-flight and we are on track to complete the target outlined
at the start of last year. Compared to the same period in 2016, our 2017 year-to-date revenues have increased by over
$2.5 billion. In the same period, our non-compensation expenses have increased by about $300 million and total
expenses by approximately $1.3 billion in the same comparison. As a result, our year-to-date efficiency ratio of 72% is

approximately 300 basis points lower than the same period last year and remains well inside the 74% target for the full
year.
That said, we recognize that expenses in any one quarter may be impacted by business mix, geographical mix, seasonal
patterns and other factors. During the remainder of 2017, our focus will be on completing all remaining initiatives and
making sure that the culture of cost discipline represented by Project Streamline remains best practice. This will help
ensure that the savings achieved to-date remain permanently out of the expense base.
Now to the businesses. Net revenues across Institutional Securities businesses of $4.8 billion were down 8%
sequentially. The trading environment slowed from the first quarter. Market moving events were episodic. Volatility in
many asset classes hit multi-year lows and activity was sporadic. Despite the quarter-over-quarter decline, revenues
across ISG were strong.
Non-compensation expenses were $1.7 billion for the quarter, up 6% sequentially driven by the UK VAT expense as
well as higher execution-related costs due to a shift in business and geographic mix of client activity. Compensation
expenses were $1.7 billion with the compensation-to-net revenue ratio of approximately 35%.
In investment banking, both advisory and underwriting performed well. Revenues of $1.4 billion were unchanged
versus the first quarter. This result contributed to an exceptionally strong first half of the year.
Advisory revenues for the quarter were $504 million, up 2% sequentially. Broadly, M&A volumes remained healthy.
The fundamental drivers of activity, including challenging organic growth, remained in place encouraging client
engagement. However, we have seen a decrease in larger transformational deals on a year-to-date basis compared to
2016 as the current market environment is impacting management's decision to act.
Additionally, uncertainty over taxes, regulatory reform and the broader political landscape will likely weigh on activity.
As such, we remain cautious as we look towards the rest of the year.
Turning to underwriting. A continuation of stable capital markets with low volatility and range-bound credit spreads
contributed to another strong quarter for underwriting. Overall, equity volumes continue to recover from the weak
levels seen last year, particularly in Europe. The market was receptive to both IPOs and follow-ons. We generated
equity revenues of $405 million, up 4%. We expect activity levels to remain healthy, although near-term issuance
windows may be impacted by macroeconomic uncertainties and the typical summer slowdown.
Fixed income underwriting revenues decreased 5% sequentially to $504 million. A market wide decline in volumes
relative to a strong first quarter was partially offset by market share gains across both investment-grade bond and
high-yield financing.
Our sales and trading performance was solid. The post election excitement that began to slow towards the end of the
first quarter did not reassert itself for most of the second quarter, predominantly impacting our fixed income franchise.
However, activities saw a notable uptick towards the end of the period as rates held off. This contributed to our overall
performance and underscores the strength and resilience of our franchise.
In equities, we retained our leadership position and expect to be number one globally with revenues of $2.2 billion, up
7% sequentially. Strong prime brokerage revenues, aided by seasonal factors, contributed to the sequential increase.
We continue to witness growth in client balances, positioning us well in this business. Derivative revenues remained
solid. These gains were partially offset by lower cash revenues driven by lower volatility. Once again, our diversified
strategy and global footprint benefited from pockets of regional strength. In the quarter, we saw a very strong European
activity as well as increased results in Asia.
Fixed income revenues in the second quarter were $1.2 billion, down 28% versus a very strong first quarter and 4%
versus year ago. Historically, low volatility, a rally in interest rates over most of the quarter, and fewer market events
contributed to a slowdown in overall performance. While the revenue showed a sequential decline, given the market
backdrop, we are pleased with the results.

In our credit businesses, revenues were down quarter over quarter, driven by lower levels of activity. Our securitized
products business also witnessed a decrease in revenues compared to last quarter, as the frequency of larger
transactions slowed. Within macro, our rates businesses were negatively impacted by low levels of volatility. This was
partially offset by foreign exchange and emerging markets, where discrete geopolitical events and pockets of volatility
led to stronger revenues. Commodities saw a sequential decline, as there were fewer structured deals in the quarter.
While the environment did weigh on the results, this quarter revenue underscores the progress the business has made
over the last 18 months. Since we restructured our business in 2015, we have experienced various market backdrops.
Clearly, some have been more favorable than others. We are encouraged by the consistency of recent results and are
critically and credibly sized to service our clients as the backdrop evolves.
Average trading VaR for the period was $51 million, up versus $44 million last quarter. We deployed capacity to
support accretive client opportunities.
Now turning to wealth management, which reported another record quarterly revenue and pre-tax profit result, the
revenue and margin achievements underscore the business's ability to benefit from the scale of the platform. These
results were achieved despite a normalization in activity following a strong first quarter, as retail sentiment reflected the
same uncertainties faced by our institutional clients. Second quarter revenues were $4.2 billion, a 2% sequential
increase. The PBT margin of 25%, slightly above our full-year 2017 target range, reflected growth in fee-based
revenues and operating leverage.
Client assets grew 2% to $2.2 trillion. Fee-based assets increased 4% to $962 billion or 43% of total client assets.
While the Department of Labor's fiduciary rule has contributed to these fee-based flows, the majority of the movements
have been from non-retirement accounts, reflecting clients choosing the enhanced service levels provided by this
offering. We saw strong fee-based asset flows of $20 billion. Higher asset levels and positive flows contributed to asset
management revenues of $2.3 billion, representing 5% growth relative to the first quarter.
Net interest income of $1 billion was up 2% over last quarter. The benefit of higher rates and lending balances was
partially offset by lower deposit levels. This reduction in deposits reflects both typical seasonal client tax payments and
deployment of cash into the markets. NII was further negatively impacted by higher prepayment amortization.
Wealth management lending in the U.S. banks grew by about $3.5 billion in the quarter or 6%, as clients drew on their
SBL lines to manage liquidity needs, a trend we often witness in the second quarter. Year to date, our NII of $2 billion
is up approximately $340 million or 21% compared to the same period last year. While market expectations for
additional rate hikes have lessened, we remain comfortable with the full-year NII guidance provided in Q1. In
particular, we expect to continue to benefit from further lending risk.
Transactional revenues of $766 million were down 7% from Q1. While clients deployed cash into the market, the
frequency of trading captured in brokerage accounts decreased from the previous quarter, again, mimicking the pattern
witnessed in the institutional space. Lower mark-to-market gains on our deferred compensation plans were also a driver
of the sequential decrease.
Total non-interest expenses were essentially unchanged versus Q1, highlighting the operating leverage in the scale
business. Lower compensation expenses were offset by seasonally higher marketing and business development and
professional services expenses. The compensation ratio was below our full-year target of 56%.
Looking forward, we remain optimistic about the outlook for this business and the value of its contribution to the firm's
business mix. Annuitized revenues continue to grow with fee-based assets and increased loan balances. Additionally,
our investments into improving our digital capabilities will enhance future productivity and provide more operating
leverage to the franchise over time.
Investment management witnessed a solid quarter, with strength across both asset management fees and investment
results. Total net revenues were $665 million, up 9% quarter over quarter. Overall, AUM grew 3% to $435 billion,
driven by investment performance, with particular strength across our active equity strategy. We also saw positive
flows across our equities, fixed income, and alternative businesses with strong capital raising internationally.

On the back of higher AUM, we saw a commensurate 4% growth in asset management fees to $539 million.
Investment revenues were up 28% to $125 million, driven by gains in our infrastructure and real estate funds. Despite
the 9% revenue increase, overall expenses were up only 3% quarter over quarter.
Turning to the balance sheet, on a sequential basis, total spot assets of $841 billion were up $9 billion and average
assets were up $12 billion, reflecting continued support of client activities within the sales and trading businesses. Our
pro forma fully phased-in advanced RWAs are expected to be up approximately $22 billion versus the first quarter to
$381 billion driven by higher market RWAs consistent with the increase in VaR metrics over the quarter.
As a result, our pro forma fully phased-in Basel III advanced common equity Tier 1 ratio decreased approximately 70
basis points sequentially to 15.9%, which remains in line with our pro forma fully phased-in Basel III standardized
common equity Tier 1 ratio. We continue to expect the two ratios to remain relatively close in the near-term.
Our pro forma fully phased-in supplementary leverage ratio for the quarter remained at 6.4%. During the second
quarter, we repurchased approximately $500 million of common stock or approximately 12 million shares. Our tax rate
in the second quarter was 32%. We continue to expect our tax rate for the remainder of the year to be in the 32% to
33% range.
This quarter's results reaffirm that our strategy is working. As James said at the outset, this quarter represented an
important test of our model. Notwithstanding a challenging trading environment, we achieved a 9% ROE on account of
our balanced business mix and the resiliency of the franchise. However, investor psyche remains fragile. The same
questions that lingered around timing and achievability of the administration's policy initiatives at the end of the first
quarter remain unresolved as we enter the third quarter.
In addition, the market continues to grapple with mixed economic data and questions around the timing and pace of
monetary policy tightening. This dynamic may continue to weigh on activity and sentiment in addition to typical
seasonality in the summer.
At the same time, we should not lose focus on the broader macroeconomic issues that could have a materially positive
impact to our business. After years of headwinds for the industry, we are finally starting to see some tailwinds that can
be promising for our business in the long-term, including the potential for tax reform, sensible regulatory change and a
rising interest rate environment. We are confident that we will achieve our stated goals.
With that, we will open the line to questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Your
line is now open.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Hi, thanks very much. First question on wealth management. I noticed the deposit's down 7% I
think. Sometimes there's seasonality and then sometimes it's cash deployment. I'm just curious how you attribute some
of that and also if there's this rate competition and what we should expect on the deposit beta if there are more rate
hikes?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Sure, Glenn. I think, as I mentioned in the script, it was a combination of both. Clearly, we
normally see in the second quarter BDP deposits going down because of tax season. We also saw continued
deployment into the markets. I don't think we've seen a lot of deployment into other cash products, so again, from a
competitive dynamic, I don't think it's a rate story. I just think it's an opportunity story.
We've started a couple of quarters ago initiating some other strategies around the deposits, including a premier cash
management product and some CD products and we've got a couple billion dollars in those products. So we feel good
about the overall deposit franchise and the overall ability to fund that business as we continue to see growth in the asset

side.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: And so maybe bluntly, if we get a couple more hate rate hikes, do you capture the majority of it?
Even without, as you said, a rate story, do you have to hike along the way? Are the clients looking to participate in that
move up?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: I think the best indication of sort of how we feel about that is really looking at the NII line
which is, as you know, has been a very good story for us, right. Back in 2012, we had $1.6 billion of NII in the wealth
business. Last year, it was $3.5 billion, grew more than $500 million. In February, we talked about what we thought we
would see and we thought we would continue to see good growth in the NII line, albeit at a slightly slower pace.
Year-to-date, we're at $2 billion, which is up over $340 million over last year.
So, again, we feel very confident about that story. It is reliant on the lending growth, which we saw good growth across
all the products this quarter. So we feel good about that. I think the composition is a little different. Your comment
about betas, generally, the betas have lagged what we've modeled. So that's been a positive. We've also – if you go
back to the first quarter, remember what the curve looked like, I think we've gotten rate hikes faster than we thought
back then.
On the other side of the ledger, as you just mentioned, the deposits are down. So we brought down the liquidity pool in
the banks as well as started to use other savings and deposit products as well as some wholesale funding to support that
business. And then lastly, we clearly didn't model any prepayment acceleration that we saw in the second quarter as
rates went down. So, on balance, we're very confident with where we are on NII and it's been a good story, but the
composition has been a little different.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is now open.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. So, first on FICC, really, again,
encouraging to see the sustained stability. Say that a few times fast. And now that we're clear, we've demonstrated –
you've demonstrated some stability here after the repositioning. Has there been a shift in mix? Can you give us a sense
for the different business lines now that the business has been adjusted? And can you also – I know you mentioned,
Jon, that commodities were down sequentially, but was this quarter extraordinary from your perspective? We've heard
some mixed things from some of the competitors. So additional color there would be great. Thanks.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Sure, I'll try. I think the way I would look at it is the results clearly just reflect the
environment that we were operating in. If you look over year over year, the results are pretty flat. So, when we look at
the individual product mix, as I did mention, our rates business given the low volatility is down, yet our FX did a little
bit stronger particularly in the emerging market areas. Credits were hung in there, less movement in credit spreads this
quarter, but again, comparable type of results in light of the fact that the year-over-year results were essentially flat.
So we feel good about the business. Commodity is also down a little bit, less activity, a tighter trading ban there, but the
results reflect the moves and the changes that we made and the results reflect that the business is really starting to come
together and gelling. And I think we feel pretty good about the results in light of the environment
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Right. But – so, I guess from your perspective, paraphrasing, you said that commodities
were tough but not necessarily extraordinarily difficult or remarkable in that way?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Yeah, listen, the commodities business that we have has been totally reshaped and resized,
more traditional sales and trading supporting our client base. It's a smaller contributor for us, so the movements are not
that dramatic.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura Instinet. Your line is now open.
<Q - Steven Chubak>: Good morning. So I wanted to start off with a question on wealth management pre-tax margin.
It's certainly encouraging to see that you guys eclipsed the 25% target for the quarter. I'm just wondering as we look
ahead to the second half, given a number of favorable trends for the business that, Jon, you had cited, whether it's
strong fee-based conversions, healthy loan growth, and NIM expansion, I'm wondering, barring any exogenous market
shocks, whether you'll be able to sustain margins above that 25% target for the remainder of the year?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Listen, I think you highlighted what we think is driving that margin. Right now, with rates
and higher markets, those are good trends that will drive our asset-based fees as well as our NII. The lending growth
has been solid. I think the one area of potential volatility or softening is around transactional. We are heading into the
summer months, but again, I think the tailwinds for this business are very good. We saw really strong operating
leverage here. We saw really nice growth across all products in the lending book and we feel very good about the
results. I mean the PBT and $1 billion plus is obviously a record. And it's a really important contributor to the overall
franchise.
<Q - Steven Chubak>: Thanks. And just one follow-up on capital. You guys had outlined a couple of the potential
benefits that – to your business in terms of capital relief that were outlined in the treasury white paper. One of the areas
that's gotten quite a bit of focus is this notion that – or the prospect for cash and liquid assets to be excluded from the
SLR denominator. And I'm wondering, given that 4% – the Tier 1 leverage constraint in CCAR of 4% appears to be
your binding constraint for the moment. It's not clear whether that carve-outs going to apply that measure. I didn't know
if you had any feedback from regulators as to whether they were considering that possibility and what might that mean
for you guys in terms of capital relief?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: On the first part of the question, I think clearly the reform around SLR would be helpful for a
variety of reasons. Whether or not it's our binding constraint this quarter or next quarter is certainly not a foregone
conclusion. So there could be some benefit from that, but we also think there's just general benefit with that calculation
in terms of what it means for their overall sales and trading businesses. But I do think there are several changes that
have been discussed or that are being discussed that would clearly help our position including around the balance sheet
and how you think about capital actions going forward.
So I think it's a little early on 2018 CCAR to sort of have a prediction, but clearly, we were pleased with the results. If
you look back a year ago where we were versus what came out of the report a couple of weeks ago with 100% payout
and a 33% increase in capital return and a clean report, we're very pleased.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: I would just add on the leverage ratio, specifically, we have argued for a number of
years and presented to regulators for a number of years, that the fact that a balance sheet grows during a time of
financial stress, it's hard to understand how that happens. Assets depreciate, assets run off, new business is not
gathered. It would be hard to imagine factoring the crisis in the years following of our own balance sheet, obviously,
shrank dramatically but through our actions and market activity. So the leverage ratio constraint is made more acute by
the fact that the denominator is growing at I think is about 4% or 4.5% a year for the nine quarters.
There's been quite a lot of sympathy to that view. That if we should look, not at some blanket growth rate, but what
actual experience was during the crisis and during other periods of financial stress. And I think that experience would
largely hold up the balance sheet's shrink. So if you just held our balance sheet flat for that time period, that would have
a material impact on our leverage ratio. So I think there's certainly a good dialogue going on through the treasury white
paper and with the regulators on that topic alone.

<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Good morning.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Just looking at the VaR and the RWA metrics, which you talked about and floated up on an
average basis I guess at an 8%, depending on which one you look at, could you give us a sense for, given that those are
average daily metrics, what we look like at on a spot basis towards the end of the quarter? Should we be expecting that
these things will slow down again?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Sure, a couple things, so on the VaR metric, obviously, the $51 million was the average for
the quarter. If you have the 10-Q, it was actually $57 million at period end at March 31. So that actually came down
over time and has actually continued to come down and the spot period end will be lower than the $51 million that we
said.
On your market – excuse me, on the RWA comments, actually some of the calculations, our daily average volume,
some of them are 12-week averages, and the VaR metrics are important in those calculations. So I think that the same
trends that we've seen in the VaR would be consistent in terms of how we finished out quarter end in that metric. With
the ratios that we have at CET1, even at the 16 or 59 level, we're still obviously very, very strong in terms of our capital
positions.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Great, that's helpful. And then just my follow-up question is more targeted on FICC
specifically. Given the success that you've had in generating revenue even in a period like the one that we've just had,
which was certainly weaker characterized by low volatility, et cetera, and all the things that you've said, would you
consider raising your quarterly average expectation from that $1 billion number you've been talking about for quite a
while now?
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Guy, I'm surprised it took somebody this many questions to get to let's raise the target
discussion. We dodged one on the pre-tax margin a few questions ago. I think the short answer you know, and it's no.
We've been pretty consistent. We've set these targets for proof of business model for this year. We're going to stay with
them. We think – listen, we were – recall third and fourth quarter 2015, we were doing $500 million, $600 million in
FICC. First quarter of 2016, I think if memory serves me, it was about $800 million. A $1 billion number on a steady
run rate basis is a good number with 25% less people, much smaller organization, much more focused organization.
If we consistently do better than that, then that's terrific. But I don't think – the point of setting the target was to
establish what we needed to prove to ourselves on an average run rate for the business to justify the expenses and
capital balance sheet that we put behind it at that level. Everything we do better than that with the same expenses,
capital, and balance sheet is obviously a gift.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Your line is now
open.
<Q - James Mitchell>: Great, thanks. Good morning, maybe just a follow-up on the SLR and the treasury report. If we
assume that both the Tier 1 leverage ratio and the SLR are treated similarly by excepting cash and maybe short-term
treasuries, how do you think that impacts the business? I guess I think a lot of people are asking the question, is this a
revenue opportunity to re-expand the balance sheet, whether it be repo or other businesses, or is it really more of an
excess capital story? I'm just trying to get a sense of if you think business has been held back by the SLR.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Let me start with that. Jon might want to add to it. First and foremost, this is a capital
question. We believe we are overcapitalized. There were good reasons for that several years ago as we were coming out
of the financial crisis. We had a dividend of $0.05 a quarter. We've now raised that four years in a row to $0.25. Our
initial buyback program was zero, then went to $500 million, and it's now all the way up to $5 billion over a five-year
period. And our payout ratio is closing in on 100%. So we clearly believe that we're overcapitalized and for good
reasons. We were coming out of the crisis and we needed to shore up our defenses.

There is plenty of opportunity for business expansion with the amount of capital we have today. The more fundamental
issue is what is the right level of capital this firm should hold. Are we holding too much capital because of the way the
leverage ratio has been constructed? What is the right denominator for the SLR? In fact, what is the right ratio? In
Europe, it's at 3% of the balance sheet, of the grossed-up balance sheet. In the U.S., they took the GAAP balance sheet
ratio of 5% and attached it to this SLR balance sheet from Europe, so we ended up with a fairly draconian answer.
I think let's start with, number one, if the treasury and other type securities can be taken out of the SLR, that obviously
makes sense. Number two, to not gross up the balance sheet under the GAAP – core leverage ratio makes sense. And I
think we have capacity at that point both for further capital distributions and for sensible business growth.
You saw the RWAs bounce a little bit this quarter. That was consistent with sensible business growth. There was
opportunity. Clearly, Tier 1 capital ratios are not a constraint or nowhere near it, so that the RWA constraint is not there
for this firm at the moment.
<Q - James Mitchell>: Okay, that's helpful. And maybe as a follow-up on just the treasury report generally, is there
any other aspect of the proposals that you feel would be particularly helpful for your business?
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: I'm trying to remember all the aspects of the report, but just actually I can't do it off the
top of my head. Clearly, I think there's a general recognition from the regulators all the way through the Treasury that
the Volcker Rule, as it played out over time, strayed a fair bit distant from what Paul Volcker initially envisaged, which
was a simple restriction on the amount of capital put into proprietary investing and proprietary trading, and became
frankly constrained on the ability of institutions to make markets and effective market liquidity. So I think the treasury
report spoke about that. There was reference to the fact that banks are required to continue their payouts,
notwithstanding they're in a period of financial stress for nine quarters. No bank board would authorize continuing a
buyback program during a financial crisis. That clearly wouldn't happen.
You could argue holding the dividends static, but certainly, the buyback shouldn't be and that would have a material
effect on the institutions. So our approach has been and we've talked about this somewhat publicly recently, let's focus
on a few things that don't require major legislative change. Let's leave the basic architecture of Dodd-Frank in place.
Let's focus on some sensible changes because we've now had eight years of experience to digest and see what worked
and what didn't. And the cumulative effect of a lot of these regulations in some cases end up, if you will, with the
double counting. And I think the spirit of the treasury report reflected that. I think they're focused on sensible pragmatic
change. They're not focused on trying to redo the whole legislative agenda, and I think that's the right approach.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Your line is now open.
<Q - Devin P. Ryan>: Hey, thanks, good morning. Maybe first here, just in wealth management, you've recently
outlined the digitization strategy, which was very helpful. And with respect to the robo offering, it sounds like you're
not going to be able to focus on the children of existing clients and some lower balance accounts, which it does seem
smart just with this generation of wealth transfer coming here and where the money is going to be over the next several
decades.
So, as we think about that process, how do you protect against maybe some cannibalization of existing business as
clients look at the lower price point? I guess the question is, is the revenue opportunity here just much more of an offset
or do you just not think this is something that would appeal to some of your existing higher net worth clients for a
portion of their account, it's just a different bucket.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: I think that your description of what we're doing on the digitalization and the robo strategy is
pretty accurate. Listen, we have a business that is built to cater to clients with wealth. Those wealth clients want advice.
They want personal advice. We're seeing it as we see the brokerage fee-based flows coming out of brokerage into the
fee-based accounts.

Obviously, digital is going to be an important part of that strategy. But the digital-only client is not someone right now
that would generally be interested in the types of products and services that we have. We think the digital strategy is
going to be both important for both revenue opportunities longer-term, but also optimization and efficiency around
what happens in a branch and how we free up people's time to spend more time with their clients. So, overall, it's a
strategy that's going to be built for the longer-term, but the thesis of our business is around providing people with
personal advice around their wealth and their planning.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: I just like to add to that because it's an important question. We actually saw this movie
once before in 1999, when the direct players came out and the big fear was cannibalization. That would only have held
true if people actually didn't value the financial advisors and advice that we're getting from those advisors and it didn't
play out that way.
The reality is the marketplace has different segments based upon consumer preference and I think the digital strategy
makes all the sense in the world that's clearly a segment. Whether they change their behaviors, they've become wealthy
remains to be seen, but there's clearly a segment that wants to deal digitally just to serve this segment that wanted to
deal through direct brokerage trading and so on.
But on the price sensitivity, it's interesting. If you'll look at the – I think I'm right in this. If you look at the average
basis points paid from the various robo platforms, they range, in general, I think from something like 20 to 40 basis
points. If you look at the average basis points for a full-service advisory like ours, just divide our revenue into our
assets, including everything. You get somewhere in the 70s, low 70 basis points.
So the value-added of a financial advice, the institution behind it, the research, the product offering, the new issued
calendar, you could argue is being put out there for 30 to 40 basis points. It's not clear to me that that is such an
expensive GAAP. That that's going to lead to the cannibalization issues.
I think it's more that we just need a very compelling digital platform to deal with clients, who want to deal with Morgan
Stanley, but want to deal with us digitally and don't want to deal through a traditional Wealth management advisory
relationship. That's an exciting opportunity for us, frankly, given our brand and our technology capability.
<Q - Devin P. Ryan>: Okay, great. That's great color. Looking forward to seeing it. Maybe in equities trading here,
we're six months away or within six months of MiFID II in Europe. I'm sure there's a lot of preparation at the firm right
now. So just curious with respect to expectations there, is this something that you feel like it will weigh on the research
fee pool, but you'll pick it up in trading market share? Or just Morgan Stanley is going to take market share of the
overall equities pool? I'm just curious kind of how you'd frame your expectations right now. This is – we're getting
pretty close to the implementation.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: I think, as you know, we've been preparing for a while both in terms of dialogues with
clients, but also systems and technology-related investments that we needed to make. But I will tell you, it's going to be
very hard to estimate what the impact of this is. Any time you have a change of this magnitude, where you just sort of
flip a switch, we would expect the potential for disruption to be pretty high. How it affects longer-term structural
markets is still up in the air. We've got global clients, who are already doing this. We have global clients who are going
to probably adopt it in all the markets even though we don't expect it to be adopted in the U.S. We have some clients
who are walling off their European operations.
So how it all plays out is certainly unclear. But given the fact that we are number one in the world in this business and
we have a full-service platform and intellectual capital and product, if there is consolidation in a number of
counterparties, we would expect to participate in that. But I think it's a little early to make a call here. I'm trying to
estimate the impact, is also probably a little early to make a call.

<Q - Chris Kotowski>: Recognizing the excellent outcome that you had in the CCAR capital return process, I have to
say I was surprised the week before when the DFAST results came out that, that still shows Morgan Stanley as being
the most severely impacted by the severely adverse scenario. The Fed's booklet shows you losing 8.4 percentage points
of capital against the median of 2.8. and given all you've done in derisking your balance sheet, I would've thought that
we would've seen more progress in that. And can you tell us what it is that the – in the Fed's methodology that seems to
cut against you so disproportionately?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Look, again, we were very pleased with the results. We had the same issue last year around
DFAST and people sort of concerned with our outcomes. At about 100% payout ratio, continued increase capital
return, part of our core strategy, we clearly have derisked the balance sheet. Our RWA density is lower than basically
every other firm out there, which is why you see some of that disparaging percentages. If you look at the
leverage-based ratios, you get a slightly different picture. We clearly have derisked. We've gotten – you've seen that
through the dollar amount of losses that we've seen over the last several years have come down. We have met our
strategic objective of increasing capital return. We still think we're capital sufficient.
When we came out in January of 2016 with that statement, we said we were capital sufficient. We did not want to grow
our equity base. We have grown our equity base a couple billion dollars, but we've also supported our businesses and
grow our balance sheet by $50 billion. So we've increase capital return and we've increased the size of the balance
sheet. And we feel comfortable with our capital position.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Chris, we don't have complete access to the Fed models as I think you know. The
construction of operating risk capital, the various stress losses that are in there, counterparty risk, how the trading book
is managed, how you derive your PPNR [Pre-Provision Net Revenue], there's a hell of a lot of stuff that goes into this.
Our own submission was 45,000 pages. And frankly, looking back at this point, I don't think that's going to be very
valuable.
The regulators and treasury are all focused on how to make both the models more transparent, the process more
transparent, and to make some sensible adjustments for it. So I don't – honestly, I mean not to be flip about it, but I
don't care what the past was. What I do care is that our distribution this year approved is about $6.8 billion. And five
years ago, it was $400 million. So let's start with that one. And number two, let's see what changes come through. We
may all be pleasantly surprised. We may be in the same place we're in. But we're operating now currently with about
100% payout, so I'd let this one play out a little bit and see what comes out of the treasury efforts.
<Q - Chris Kotowski>: Okay. I guess the thing is like, just again, if you look at the old way of doing it, right, if you
needed $5 billion after the stress and you were losing $8 billion or $9 billion, and you need $1 billion for margin of
safety, that would suggest you need a CET1 ratio of 14% – 15% on an operating basis. Is there an outlook for operating
at less than that?
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: I think you're torturing yourself by looking backwards. Honestly, I wouldn't do it.
Focus on the big picture here, buddy. The big picture is we distributed $400 million five years ago. We're distributing
$6.8 billion now, and there's a full review of the whole capital process being undertaken right now.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Lim with Société Générale. Your line is now open.
<Q - Andrew Lim>: Hi, there. Can I press you a bit more on your claim of excess capital? As things currently stand,
your SLR under the severely adverse scenario, that's 3.2%, and you're slightly above the 3% minimum. So you're
maxing out your capital return here, so your claim of excess capital is rather contingent on changes coming through
from the treasury, or as you say, the Fed being more lenient on how the leverage exposure pans out under a severely
at-stress scenario. So can you give a bit more color on there?

<A - James Patrick Gorman>: I'm really not sure what else I can say. We have consistently increased our capital
payouts while the test has become consistently more severe. We are now at 100% payout. So by definition, any excess
capital we have from the gating constraint with the leverage ratio this year and we were above the gating constraint
after we did our distribution, so by definition, we're carrying excess capital. And our view is that the way we calculate
our capital needs to run our business, we continue to have excess above that, but we're waiting for the outcome of the
white paper and the various efforts from the regulators to see what changes take place. There are clearly going to be
changes. How favorable they are and to what extent they affect Morgan Stanley remains to be seen. It's not going to be
productive to try and guess that.
<Q - Andrew Lim>: Right, understood, and just a follow-up question. You've got the FTRB (sic) [FRTB,
Fundamental Review of Trading Book] lurking in the background. We haven't heard anything on that for a long time
now. But just guidance on when we might get some disclosure on the impacts on capital ratios or the timing?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: I don't think we have much more visibility than anyone else in this area. I think the thing that
sometimes people fail to recognize is we obviously have this white paper out. And if you think about it, we are actually
going to enter a period of refinement and adjustment to regulations versus where we were a year ago, where our
expectation with incremental regulations for periods and periods and periods of time to come, we're clearly going to be
in a better place. Now how that plays out and what timeframe and what the actual changes are is very hard to predict,
but we are clearly entering a different period going forward than we have been in the last eight years.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now
open.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Thank you, good morning. Can you guys share with us, once we get into a more normalized
return of capital environment that we see in the future, what kind of dividend payout ratio are you guys comfortable
with as we look further out?
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: I don't think it probably serves us well to get ahead of that discussion with the
regulators and others. I think the current regulatory environment anticipates for the G-SIFI banks a payout ratio of
something like 30%. And for some of the smaller institutions, I think they've gone higher than that, maybe up to 40%.
Whether that changes post all the work being done, I don't know. We're not at the 30% at this point. I think we're close
to it.
So one way to think about our business, which is I've thought about it for a while, the wealth management business is
almost like a yield stock. So you can imagine the dividend coming out of wealth management earnings, and obviously
the institutional businesses are more volatile over time. So they're more capital distribution businesses or capital
investment businesses. But I don't know, Gerard, that we want to change what the targets that are currently being given
to us by regulators are.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Okay, great. And then second, in the supplement package you gave us, on page 5 you gave us
the total loans of the organization. And could you share with us some color on, and I may have missed this and I
apologize if I did, why the corporate loans were down 37% or so year over year, and a little color behind that, really
good growth you're seeing on the wealth management side, where those loans were up 20%?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: I'm just flipping to page 5. Give me a second here. Okay, I think the changes in the corporate
book are really around the size of the event book and the event activity as well as some just overall management of the
relationship book. The real story for us, as you mentioned, has been in the wealth business as we continue to increase
the penetration of our client base with lending products. The growth has been very good across all of our three core
products; the SBL, the mortgage, and the tailored lending.
And we feel like we've got good momentum. The growth last quarter of $3.5 billion was pretty balanced across the
businesses, a little bit more skewed towards SBL and tailored versus mortgage given what happened in rates. But again,

that lending story we feel very good about. Our levels of penetration of how many of our clients have lending products
is still probably a bit below peer level, so we feel good about the ability to continue to grow that. And that's been a real
key driver to our wealth business.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Christopher Wheeler with Atlantic Equities. Your line is now
open.
<Q - Christopher Wheeler>: Yes, good morning. A couple questions on wealth management. I think during the
quarter, we've had the news that I think yourself and a couple of your big competitors are now stepping back from
piling away experienced financial advisors. Obviously, in doing that, obviously reducing the cost of amortizing the
forgivable loans that are a part of piling senior producers. I'd like to perhaps understand how that's actually progressing.
How are you getting on with that? Because obviously it's a big change.
And then perhaps to link it up with the end of the Smith Barney payouts, talk about what you think this might do to
your pre-tax margin. Because I think at one stage, you said it might add – once the Smith Barney payouts, the retention
packages have gone out I think next year, you might be adding 1.5 percentage points to your pre-tax margin. So a little
bit color there would be helpful. Thank you.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: I'll go first on the second part of your question, which is the retention payments conclude in
first quarter of 2019. Obviously, it's a function of numerator and denominator, but 1.5% increase is a reasonable
approximation. And obviously, that will drop directly to the bottom line. In terms of the attrition and the recruiting that
we've seen, it's clearly slowed down. And that is, obviously, helpful both in terms of just ins-and-outs. There's the
expense associated with bringing in new FAs. But also when an FA leaves, generally, their book goes with them or a
good chunk of their book goes with them. So just lower levels of recruiting and lower levels of attrition has been
overall helpful to the business.
<Q - Christopher Wheeler>: Thank you. And just kind of decide whether do you think your competitors are holding
the line? Because it does seem a really beneficial move. There are one or two players out there, of course, who are still
sort of quite keen to take away some your senior people.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Listen, these are big organizations. Our major competitors each have, I don't know,
10,000 to 15,000, 16,000 advisors. If you have 1% attrition, that's three people a week. So it's not like these – you're not
going to have movement. You'll always have movement, Chris. I think what's changed structurally with the industry is,
frankly, there are fewer competitors. If you think of Morgan Stanley, Morgan Stanley is now a composite firm that
includes Dean Witter Reynolds and Company, Robinson Humphrey, Legg Mason, Smith Barney, Shearson, Hutton,
and there are probably some that I'm missing. All of which used to compete against each other and recruit against each
other. So it's a consolidated industry. The big and small firms continue to recruit. There are fewer numbers of them. I
think the deal structures have become, shall I say, more sensible. There was a bit of a crazy period there. So, yeah, but
there will always be some recruiting and that makes sense. I mean, people have a right to go and work where they want
to work.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Your line is now open.
<Q - Brian Kleinhanzl>: Okay, thanks. Maybe just the first question on equity sales and trading. I think this is
probably the third or fourth quarter that you called out strength in prime broker. As a driver of those revenues, can you
maybe give us a little bit more color as to what's driving that strength? Is it by region? Is it existing clients being more
active? Is it client growth?

<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: The simple answer is yes to all of those things. Very strong quarter. The growth was across
all the regions. Particular standout being EMEA given some of the seasonality there. Balances are up. We continue to
invest in the balance sheet. And so, again, it's been a very good story for quite some time. It's the full-service platform
and our clients have been very responsive to that.
<Q - Brian Kleinhanzl>: And then second question, can you give us an update on kind of where the banking pipeline
stands, especially for M&A? It seems like there's been a pickup in activity thus far, early in the third quarter. I mean,
how did the pipeline stand at the end of the second quarter versus first quarter?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: I would say that, first of all, it's very early in the third quarter, point number one. I would say
that the IBD pipeline is clearly healthy into the third quarter. I think if we look specifically at advisory, it's probably
down slightly. But overall, the equity and underwriting and debt underwriting remains healthy. IPO's backlog is healthy
and broad. That activity has picked up really nicely here. So, again, a healthy environment. We're going into the
summer months so we'll have to see how that impacts us as well as all the sort of policy uncertainty that we've talked
about in the past. But right now, pretty healthy.
