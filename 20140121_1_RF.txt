O. B. Grayson Hall
Good morning. And welcome to Regions' fourth quarter 2013 earnings conference call. We certainly appreciate your
participation and interest in Regions Financial.
Overall we are pleased and encouraged by our achievements and results in 2013. During the year, we focused on the
fundamentals, serving the financial needs of our customers and communities and building stronger relationships with
them.
We began 2013 with three important business priorities: first, loan growth; secondly, customer relationships; and also,
third, prudently managing expenses. Through the focused execution and dedication of our team, we accomplished these
goals and made meaningful progress.
For the year, total new and renewed loan production increased $4.5 billion or approximately 8%. As a result, we
experienced $1.3 billion of balance sheet loan growth in 2013, which excludes the residential first mortgages, mortgage
loans transferred to held for sale, which I'll address momentarily.
This growth was achieved by expanding our customer base and deepening relationships with existing customers, aided
by new initiatives launched in 2013 called, 'Regions360.' This is a very deliberative and prescriptive approach to
building a strong relationship banking culture on a foundation of trust. Further we increased our total number of
customers and households in a diversified manner.
Business lending achieved solid growth in 2013, led by commercial and industrial segment. This segment increased
$2.7 billion from the end of 2012, primarily driven by specialized lending teams. Also we believe our investor real
estate segment is close to stabilization as new loan production continues to increase and pay-offs and pay-downs
diminish.
On the consumer side of the balance sheet, our indirect auto portfolio experienced a very strong year with production
up 35% and loans increasing 32%. We accomplished this by expanding our dealer network by 12% and increasing our
average loans per dealer by more than 50%.
We also achieved growth in our consumer credit card portfolio as the number of active cards increased 7%
year-over-year, and we grew our home equity loan and line production by 78% from this same time last year.
Additionally, our full-year 2013 adjusted expenses were lower than 2012 expenses on the same basis and we did this
while making significant investments in people, in products and in technology.
We will continue to rigorously manage all expenses in a disciplined manner as it is part of our culture, while ensuring
that we have the right infrastructure and foundation in place for future growth.
In addition to successfully executing our business priorities, we also had a number of other noteworthy
accomplishments in 2013. We increased net income available to common shareholders 10% over the prior year. We
expanded our net interest margin by 16 basis points. We lowered our deposit costs by 10 basis points. We achieved
broad based improvement in asset quality with every metric significantly improving. We raised our common stock cash
dividend. We completed several actions that improved our debt and capital structure while reducing overall funding
costs. And again we completed a common stock share repurchase program. Clearly we accomplished a great deal in
2013.
With respect to the fourth quarter, there's several notable items that impacted results. David will cover these in more
detail momentarily, but I wanted to highlight a few of them. First accelerating our risk strategy we transferred $686
million of troubled debt restructured loans to held for sale. This transaction has minimal capital impact and will
improve the company's credit profile. Importantly, as a result of this transaction, we can experience lower FDIC
premiums and can redeploy the capital more economically.

In addition, we recorded a $58 million non-tax-deductible charge related to previously disclosed inquiries from
government authorities concerning matters dating back to 2009. And during the fourth quarter we announced that we
will consolidate 30 branches in early 2014. This will create additional efficiencies within our branch network channel
and demonstrates our ongoing rigor and discipline with respect to expense management.
Looking to 2014, there are several underlying economic and political factors that have the potential to influence the
U.S. economy, but nonetheless, consumer balance sheets are healthier than they've been in some time, corporate
balance sheets are in solid condition and the housing market in our communities continues to improve. These factors,
along with an improving global outlook, should contribute to moderate to improving GDP growth in 2014.
Again, we are encouraged with the progress we made in 2013. But more importantly we look forward to building on
that momentum in 2014. All team members at Regions are focused on building a stronger company each and every day.
We believe in our company and we believe that by focusing on and serving our customers and communities we'll
ultimately drive our results and benefit our shareholders. I'll now turn it over to David to discuss fourth quarter results.
David J. Turner
Thank you, Grayson. Good morning everyone.
Today we reported earnings of $219 million for the fourth quarter. As Grayson mentioned, there were a number of
notable items occurring in the quarter that warrant further explanation. I'm going to go over those first and then I'll get
back to the core operating results later.
In the fourth quarter, we identified approximately $686 million of primarily accruing first lien residential mortgages
that were classified as troubled debt restructurings and transferred them to held for sale. The majority of these loans
were originated prior to 2007 and approximately 40% are located in Florida. We expect to execute a sale of these loans
early this year.
In connection with the loan transfer, we recognized incremental net charge-offs of $151 million. However, this was
partially offset by $76 million of allowance for loan losses. As a result, the pre-tax net income impact of the transaction
totaled $75 million.
Also in the fourth quarter we terminated two leveraged leases incurring a $39 million gain, however, the tax expense
related to these terminations was $33 million and therefore the benefit to net income was $6 million.
In connection with the branch closures that Grayson mentioned we incurred additional pre-tax expenses of $5 million
in the quarter.
In addition, as Grayson also mentioned, at the end of the quarter, we recorded a $58 million regulatory charge
associated with previously disclosed matters dating to 2009. We are in discussions with our banking supervisors to
resolve their inquiries on these matters, and although you may have additional questions, please recognize that we
cannot comment at this time beyond this disclosure.
Also the company incurred a $40 million reduction to overall income tax expense primarily related to the valuation
allowance for certain state net operating losses that occurred in previous years.
And finally, during the quarter we incurred $25 million of additional legal expenses resulting from adjustments to the
indemnification reserve established in connection with the sale of Morgan Keegan and these legal expenses are
reflected in discontinued operations.
Combined, all of these items lowered income by $75 million and earnings per share by $0.05.
Let's take a look at fourth quarter operating results starting with our loan book. Total average loan balances were up 1%
from the previous quarter, however, ending loans declined 2% due in part to the transfer of residential mortgage loans
to held for sale at the end of the quarter. Excluding the loans transferred, adjusted ending loans declined 1% linked

quarter.
Specifically, average commercial industrial loan balances increased $631 million from the prior quarter, however, on
an ending basis they declined $450 million. The decline in period in commercial loan balances resulted from repayment
of loans, some of which were non-performing, corporate clients accessing funds in the fixed income market and
volatility in REIT lines in the normal course of business.
Finally, part of the decline was also driven by $104 million of leveraged lease terminations. This decline was partially
offset by increases in specialized lending led by technology and energy. Encouragingly, commitments for new loans
increased quarter-over-quarter by $500 million to $38 billion.
Investor real estate loans were down 3% from the previous quarter as the pace of pay-downs and derisking was only
partially offset by new loan production, which increased 2% from the previous quarter and new production is expected
to remain strong going forward.
Indirect auto continued to lead consumer lending as loan balances increased 6% from the prior quarter. At the end of
the fourth quarter, we had more than 2100 dealers in our network and we remained focused on increasing our
pull-through rates primarily through technology enhancements.
The total home equity portfolio was steady linked quarter as the pace of new production in the home equity loan
product offset customer deleveraging within the home equity lines of credit. As a result, balances in the fixed rate home
equity loan product have increased 17% over the previous quarter.
Credit card balances increased 6% over the third quarter as we increased the number of active cardholders by 4%. We
will continue to focus on expanding the number of customers that carry a Regions credit card and have increased our
penetration rate by 50 basis points over the third quarter. And finally mortgage balances were relatively flat excluding
the transfer of loans to held for sale. Now looking ahead, based on what we know today and our economic forecast, we
expect 2014 loan growth to be in the 3% to 5% range.
Let's take a look at deposits. Deposit mix continued to improve in the fourth quarter as low cost deposits increased to
89% of average deposits. This positive re-pricing and mix shift resulted in deposit costs declining to historically low
levels of 12 basis points. Total funding costs for the company declined to 34 basis points in the quarter.
We'll see how this impacted our results. Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $846 million, up $8
million or 1% from the previous quarter. The resulting net interest margin was 3.26% an increase of two basis points
from the previous quarter.
For the fourth quarter, continued increases in long-term interest rates served to further reduce prepayments on securities
and the related premium amortization. Lower premium amortization contributed approximately five basis points
increase to the margin and totaled $45 million for the quarter. Of course higher long-term rates also benefit net interest
income and net interest margin over time through higher yields on reinvested fixed rate loans and securities.
In 2013, liability management strategies and an improving mix of deposits offset the negative impact of a persistently
low growth and low interest rate environment. Although the pace of decline in deposit cost has slowed, the recent rise
in long-term rates off mid-year lows helped provide additional lift to the margin.
Our balance sheet continues to be asset sensitive to short-term interest rates, mainly attributable to floating rate loans.
Moreover, further increases in long-term rates would provide additional benefit to the margin but at a somewhat
reduced pace given pre-payments and premium amortization have already slowed considerably. With rates at their
present level we expect the net interest margin to remain relatively stable in 2014.
Let's take a look at non-interest revenue. Fourth quarter non-interest revenue was up 6% from the previous quarter. The
fourth quarter included a net gain of $17 million related to the sale of certain low income housing investments as well
as the $39 million gain previously mentioned related to leveraged lease terminations.

Non-interest revenue continues to be impacted by lower mortgage revenue. During the quarter, mortgage production
declined 23% and mortgage revenue declined 17%. As a result, we continued to optimize the mortgage operations
model and reduced overall mortgage production expenses 10% in connection with lower revenue and we expect
mortgage expenses related to production to continue to decline. As a reminder, the previous quarter included a $24
million gain related to the divestiture of a non-core portion of the wealth management business.
As previously disclosed, we will discontinue new enrollment for our Ready Advance product and begin working on a
transition plan related to our existing customers. This transition plan will be executed during 2014 and includes the
recently introduced new Savings Secured Loan to help meet the credit needs of our customers.
In 2013 we made significant investments in our wealth management group by adding over 100 financial consultant
positions, and we expect these positions to be fully profitable in 2014. Additionally, we were successful growing
certain consumer product lines throughout 2013 that will provide future revenue opportunities. For example, we grew
our Now Banking households 26%, our active debit card users 2%, and our prepaid card users 50%.
Let's take a look at expenses. Non-interest expenses totaled $946 million in the fourth quarter and included $58 million
of expense related to the regulatory charge and $5 million of expense related to the branch consolidations. Deposit
administrative fees, or FDIC expenses, were lower in the fourth quarter due to an improvement in asset quality, overall
business performance and refunds of previously incurred fees. As a result, these costs are expected to be lower in 2014
compared to 2013, and the run rate is expected to be between the levels reported in the third and fourth quarter.
Salaries and benefits increased 2% this quarter reflecting an increase in head count, primarily in customer-facing,
revenue-generating and compliance positions. This was partially offset by a decline in mortgage incentives. Generally
speaking, it takes about 12 months for these customer-facing positions to become profitable contributors.
Our adjusted efficiency ratio improved 100 basis points from the previous quarter, and we expect this to continue to
trend down over the near term. Some fluctuation in expenses can occur on a quarter-to-quarter basis in order to
generate ongoing revenue. However, if the revenue does not materialize, we will adjust accordingly as we are
committed to generating positive operating leverage.
We have effectively managed expenses throughout the cycle and have consistently reduced full-year adjusted expenses
since 2009. Full-year 2013 adjusted expenses were lower than 2012 expenses on the same basis and we expect this
trend to continue in 2014.
Now, let's take a look at asset quality. Improvement continued in the fourth quarter as most credit metrics improved. As
previously discussed, this quarter's results were impacted by the loans transferred to held for sale. Adjusted net
charge-offs, which excludes the amount related to the transfer of loans, amounted to $127 million. The provision for
loan losses was $79 million, of which $75 million was related to the loan transfers.
Our non-performing loans declined 20% linked quarter and inflows of nonperforming loans declined 12% to $175
million. And our coverage ratios remained solid. At quarter end, our loan loss allowance to non-performing loans
increased to 124%. Notably, criticized and classified loans continued to decline with commercial and investor real
estate criticized and classified loans down 14% from the third quarter.
Troubled debt restructurings declined 14% from the previous quarter, and excluding the loans associated with the
transfer, TDRs would have been down 32% or approximately $1 billion. Based on what we know today, we expect
favorable asset quality trends to continue. However, at this point in the cycle, volatility in certain metrics can be
expected.
Let's take a look at our capital and liquidity. Our capital position remains strong as our estimated Tier 1 ratio at the end
of the quarter stood at 11.6%. Our estimated Tier 1 common ratio was 11.2%, an increase of 20 basis points. We
estimate our fully phased-in pro forma Basel III Tier 1 common ratio would have been approximately 10.5%, well
above the minimum threshold.
As you are aware, we submitted our CCAR earlier this month and we expect to get the results sometime in March.
Liquidity at both the bank and holding company remain solid with a loan to deposit ratio of 81%.

And lastly, based on our understanding of the proposed rule, Regions remains well positioned to be fully compliant
with respect to the liquidity coverage ratio.
So I'd say in summary our fourth quarter and full-year results reflect our continued focus on moving the company
forward. At the core, we remain focused on our customers by continuing to drive a culture of leading service quality
across the company while following a shared value philosophy. We believe focusing on our customers, having an
engaged workforce and making a positive impact on our communities will ultimately drive long-term growth and
shareholder value.
Now I'll turn it back over to List for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call.
M. List Underwood
Thank you, David. We're ready to begin the Q&A session of our call. We have a number of you already in the queue
and we want to take as many as possible this morning. As a result, I would ask you to each please limit yourself to one
primary question and one related follow-up question. Now, operator, let's open the line for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Paul Miller with FBR.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Paul.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Can you hear me, guys? How are you guys doing? I missed the very front end of your call and I
don't know if you addressed it, but you did give guidance of loan growth of 3% to 5%, am I correct?
<A - David J. Turner>: That's correct.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Can you just tell me where do you think that's coming from, and is that just really through
discussions through your customer base?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Paul, we've gone through our lending segments extensively. And we had pretty solid
growth in the fourth quarter in terms of average balances. There was obviously a lot of activity that occurred near the
end of the quarter. We had a number of pay-downs and pay-offs that had taken place. I think you had the transfer of the
first residential mortgages over to held for sale. You had more customers taking advantage of the capital debt markets
that we didn't see in the past. But we have continued to be encouraged by signs that we've seen in looking at our
production, looking at our pipelines, and looking at what we believe is an improving economy.
We've seen particular strength in certain segments. I would mention three. I think we've seen good strength in both
energy and in technology, but we also have seen strength in commercial real estate. We believe that our commercial
real estate portfolio for the first time is close to a stabilization point. We're encouraged by the production and we think
we've got an opportunity. If you remember, we had indicated that we thought our loan growth on the upside might be as
much as 4% a quarter ago. We've raised that slightly at 5% today. But we think we've got the opportunity to do that and
we're optimistic about it.
David, would you like to comment on that?
<A - David J. Turner>: I think if you look at commercial real estate in particular, multi-family and homebuilder
portfolios look strong. We feel comfortable with those going into 2014. Grayson talked about the other parts of C&I.
But the consumer side is getting better for us, as well as our home equity loan product is just about to take care of the
declines we've seen in the home equity lines. Our indirect auto continues to be a nice growth story for us as we
continue to expand on dealerships and our penetration within those dealers. Credit card continued to grow as well. So

we're feeling good about a broad array of loan increases and production leading us into 2014.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: I mean, the big thing I would say is we're seeing more diversified demand, both across
lending segments and across markets. It's broader and more diversified than it was a quarter ago.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Okay. Guys, that's a very complete answer. Thank you very much.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Gerard.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Good morning. Thank you. David, you mentioned that you that you thought the expenses in
2014 were going to be lower than 2013's adjusted expenses. What's the adjusted expense level we should use for 2013
to measure against for 2014?
<A - David J. Turner>: Gerard, that number is 3.4 – 3.4, 3.3 to be exact, that you could calculate off of our
supplements, taking all the adjustments out. So it's working off that number.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Okay. And then just as a follow-up, on the LCR ratio, I think you said that you're well
positioned to be fully compliant. Does that state that you're there already, meaning that you don't need to put more
liquidity on the books that could pressure the margin if you were to do that to become fully compliant?
<A - David J. Turner>: We aren't quite at 100% today as that number bounces around a little bit. We're pretty close to
100% but we're close enough and feel confident enough that there's not a lot of restructuring we have to do with regards
to being compliant when the rule is effective.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Okay. So that would imply we should not hear any margin – some of your peers – the
reason I asked this is some of your peers have pointed out that margin pressure in 2014 will develop because of
becoming fully compliant with LCR. We should not expect that from you guys; is that correct?
<A - David J. Turner>: We expect our margin to be relatively stable all in through everything that we have to do. So
perhaps we're a little unique. But, remember, stable margin for us, we've kind of given guidance. That's one or two
points either side of where we are. And we're sticking with that, even though the LCR's out there.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Thank you. Appreciate the answers.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, John.
<Q - John Pancari>: Good morning. Wanted to see if you could give us more color on your expectations for the
efficiency ratio. You saw some good progress this quarter, and wanted to get your thoughts on the 2014 outlook for that
metric as well as how you would think about it on a longer-term normalized basis.
<A - David J. Turner>: Yeah, John, this is David. As we have been mentioning on our calls, we are looking very
closely at our efficiency ratio and positive operating leverage as well. You notice our efficiency ratio went up to 67
points and change last quarter. We had talked about working that down into the lower 60s without a rate increase and
we think with a rate increase we can be in the 50s. Our goal ultimately is in that 55 to 59 range, but we acknowledge
we can't get there without a rate change, rate increase.

But while we're waiting for that, we do expect us to continue to drift down during 2014 into the lower 60s. We've made
investments in people and technology that have caused our short-term our expenses to increase, but we expect the
revenue to come with that. As a result we expect that efficiency ratio to continue to drift down. We've really looked at
our efficiency more from a long-term perspective. We don't get so caught up on a quarter-to-quarter change. But that's
kind of the broad guidance that we think over time we can get it to.
<Q - John Pancari>: All right. Then also my second question is just around expenses as well. Do you have a
quantification around the likely savings that you can get from the 30 branch closures on a combined basis?
<A - David J. Turner>: We really hadn't quantified the savings from those 30 branches. I will tell you, you heard the
number we had had about $5 million that we're going to incur this quarter. We'll have some more related to people
costs that you can't accrue until that time, but we expect a payback in less than a year on these type of expenses. And
we're constantly looking at all areas of our company in terms of becoming more efficient. It is part of who we are, what
we do, and we'll take appropriate actions when we can see the benefit of that as the payback is relatively quick.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: And I would just add, closing a branch is a very public action. But internally there are a
number of expense save initiatives that we're working on. Clearly even within the branch channel we're working on a
number of efficiency programs that would allow the branches that we have to operate at a lower cost basis and trying to
improve both the utilization of all of our channels so that we get efficiency across the methodologies that we service
our consumers on.
We realize that 2014 is still going to be a year where expenses are very important and so we'll continue to have a
number of internal initiatives that look at staffing, that look at the workflow, look at the way we handle all of our
operational processes to improve that overall efficiency ratio.
<Q - John Pancari>: Okay, thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the Kevin Fitzsimmons from Sandler O'Neill.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Kevin.
<Q - Kevin P. Fitzsimmons>: Good morning, guys. Just a few questions; with CCAR coming up I just was wondering
if you could give an update on your capital return priorities. I know buy-backs were a big part of it last year but the
stock is higher versus tangible book now compared to last year, if you can just give us a list of where you think those
priorities sit today. Thanks.
<A - David J. Turner>: Sure, Kevin, as we think about capital, we really want to use the capital we have to grow our
business. We think that's what the shareholders gave it to us for. That being said, we acknowledge we'd like to get our
dividend closer to where peers are, which has been in that 25% pay-out on income.
We then want to use the rest of the capital to grow, whether that be growing loan portfolios, we've talked about
acquiring a portfolio like we did our credit card book and other acquisitions if there are other opportunities that arise.
When we can't utilize all of our capital efficiently in those activities, returning it to the shareholders is important,
because we don't want it to build up and have trapped capital that builds up on the balance sheet.
So having an appropriate return in the form of a buyback to the shareholders is certainly something that we've looked
at. As you know we just filed our plan so we need to let the process work. We really have a very robust capital planning
process, the output of which happens to be at times a couple of regulatory filings called CCAR and DFAST but our
capital planning process is built around the efficient use of that capital and getting the most appropriate risk adjusted
return on that capital and that's what we've done.
<Q - Kevin P. Fitzsimmons>: Okay, thank you. Just a quick follow up. If you can just talk about the timing of the
transfer of those Resi mortgages to held for sale now and is that more a statement about the improvement you've seen

in the housing market, there's more of a market for those loans today or just being teed up going into 2014 with that in
the rearview mirror?
<A - David J. Turner>: Good question. We had a couple of things working for us. One, the market for assets is pretty
strong. These were accruing first lien residential mortgage loans, but they were TDRs and that's a designation that
causes a little more of a charge when you go through the FDIC calculation and mathematically if you took a look at the
return on capital by holding those in our portfolio versus how we could improve the return on proceeds from a
transaction, we felt that it was the best thing for us to do at this time.
We have not executed that transaction. We expect to do so in early 2014. But as a result of making that decision not to
retain those in the portfolio, it required us to move them to held for sale and take a mark on those to our estimate of fair
value, which is what we did in the latter part of the fourth quarter.

Your next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Craig.
<Q - Craig W. Siegenthaler>: Hey, good morning, Grayson. First I'd just like to hit on the 2014 non-interest expense
guidance again here. If the annualized adjusted 4Q run rate was $3.5 billion and the 2013 run rate was $3.4 billion, with
the guidance now south of $3.4 this implies about $100 million-plus delta year-over-year. I'm wondering what are the
biggest pieces here? Maybe you can give us some color in terms of the biggest pieces and maybe give us some sense of
magnitude?
<A - David J. Turner>: Craig, let me help you out with the start point I think it's about 3.4. 3.4, 3.3 should be your
start point based on what we've released and we believe that we can come under that number and it's really no one
thing. It's just a continued focus on every one of our expense categories. Obviously our top three expenses are salaries
and benefits, occupancy and furniture and fixtures, but there are other expense categories underneath those that we
continue to focus on and make sure while, we haven't come up with an expense initiative, that we require all of our
leaders to really take a look at the expenses they have in their businesses and make sure they're being as efficient as
they can be.
So you really can't look at one area. It's just a little bit here and a little bit there and over time it adds up. If you look
over the past several years we've been able to do this because of this kind of cultural approach to expense management
and you'll see that again in 2014. I think when you get your start point, the number is not as, not your start point that
you had.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: But I think we just have to, in this environment, until we see, until we see the results of
more sustainable growth and a different interest rate environment we've got to stay diligent and very rigorous on
expense management. To David's point we haven't done a branded expense program but what we have done is we have
literally dozens of expense initiatives across the company and we've invested an awful lot in technology to improve
efficiencies and workflow across all of our operating units.
We still believe that there's opportunities for us to improve the efficiency. We've been working on this for a great long
time and when you look at our expense metrics, by almost any measure, we've delivered some really good efficiencies
relative to our peer group. Some of our biggest challenges are on the revenue side. And so we're trying to work on both.
We're trying to have a balanced perspective on it.
That's why we invested in people this past year to try to improve our revenue generation, because while we want to
continue to be rigorous in our management of expenses, we do realize some spending is necessary to generate revenue
growth. And so we have a very balanced perspective on it. But given where we're at today, we still believe we have
identified enough areas that allow us to continue to drive our expenses down on a same cost basis year-over-year.

<Q - Craig W. Siegenthaler>: Thanks, Grayson. Just as my follow up here I just wanted to separate your expectation
for overall earning asset growth next year versus the 3% to 5% loan growth guidance. So if loans are growing in the 3%
to 5% range but if you notice your deposit growth has been not been positive. Should we expect to see modest decline
in the securities profile to fund that and will the LCR allow that or is it more likely that deposits will grow next year
potentially could grow from higher costing deposits like CDs?
<A - David J. Turner>: I think, Craig, one of the things that you saw was the level of higher cost CDs that as we
lowered the cost, some of those did not – we did not retain those in the bank. So that worked against our earning asset
growth that we had.
We do have a little over $4 billion of CDs maturing next year but we don't have the price differential on those that we
had in 2012 and 2013. So we don't see the retention issue with those like we just saw. So we don't see that working
against our earning asset growth.
So I think the primary driver on earning assets in total will be the loan growth that we're talking about and so we think
we've hit the bottom of earning assets right now. Remember, last year we also did some deleveraging and had some
liability management activities on our, in our bank and holding company that also worked against us on that measure.
But we think we grow from here.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: But with our loan deposit ratio at roughly 81%, you know, during 2013 we made some
very strategic decisions related to deposits. We have reduced our reliance on more expensive forms of deposits. In
particular, time deposits are down to 12% of the total portfolio. But we also took a very different strategy on the other
high priced sources of deposits such as public funds. And so we have – we've seen the mix – our mix, our overall
deposits have not grown in 2013. We did see a favorable shift in the mix of those deposits and are very pleased with
where we stand today. So from the deposit standpoint we're feeling pretty good about our position.
<Q - Craig W. Siegenthaler>: Grayson, David, thank you very much for the color.

Your next question comes from Erika Najarian with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Erika.
<Q - Erika Penala Najarian>: Good morning. My question is could you just shed some light on the CCAR process in
terms of under stress, do the regulators treat a TDR similar to any performing loan, or they treat it worse, and I guess
the real gist of the question is, is a derisking in your TDR portfolio reflected in your submission for this year's plan?
<A - David J. Turner>: Let me answer it a little different than you asked because we want to be careful about what
we've turned in to our supervisors. We have a capital plan and our derisking relative to TDRs is not just the impact to
capital, although that is true. TDRs are treated adversely by us and the way we look at capital.
So I think that as we think about derisking you also have to look at the cost associated with maintaining a TDR, in
particular as it relates to FDIC insurance. Those are punitive in the calculation and so being able to derisk helps us from
an earnings standpoint and the expense discussion that a few folks have asked us about this morning you'll see the
benefits of that coming through in 2014.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: But it does derisk our credit portfolio, it accelerates the pace of that somewhat. But the
economics, the economics are the primary driver.
<Q - Erika Penala Najarian>: So the follow up to that is, in theory, if this were included in a submission, you have a
derisked balance sheet from a TDR perspective as these are sold, but not just that, the cushion for your PP&R should
also improve under stress because of the administrative costs that go away? Is that the right take away to assume if it
was in the submission?

<A - David J. Turner>: That's right. The cost to carry these are punitive in all of our – whether it be your base or your
two adverse runs. So being able to strip that cost out and have the assets, the proceeds reinvested in assets that don't
attract as much capital and generate more PP&R is what we tried to do and we think we accomplished that.

Your next question comes from the line of Sameer Gokhale with Janney Capital Markets.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Sameer.
<Q - Sameer Gokhale>: Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. This is the first question. To go back to
the discussion about the head count, I think you mentioned two broad categories: one, compliance, and the other,
customer-facing. And I was hoping just to get a little more clarity, what was the rough mix of compliance versus client
facing. And then if you could give us insights into what specific businesses on the client-facing side you added head
count to, maybe some geographic information, that would be helpful.
<A - David J. Turner>: I'll tell you that roughly half of our head count, I think it was almost 60% of our head count,
were in revenue-generating positions. So we gave an example in our prepared comments, our financial consultants that
we put in the branches this year, a little over 100 that we hired during the year. And then the other parts of this were
really establishing more folks in our compliance areas and risk management as we deal with some of the changes in
expectations that we all have in the banking industry.
So the head count that we've added, we expect the folks that we've added to pay for themselves. In particular, the
revenue-generating folks that should be paying for themselves in less than a year. Our early read on that, and I'll use the
financial consultants as an example, is we're a little ahead of schedule. And we feel good about that going into 2014.
But we've wanted to make those investments in people. We think it's the right thing to have done as we battle the
balance between generating more revenue yet watching our expenses in total.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: I think that given where the industry's at, and there's clearly an expectation for greater
focus and resources on compliance and audit functions, we continue to invest in all of those functions across our
enterprise risk management program, if you will. And so we're going to continue to invest there. We have to find ways
to pay for that. And we find ways to pay for that through efficiencies in other parts of the company and our additional
revenue opportunities we find by adding people or products where appropriate.
I think if you look at geographically, we've added those resources opportunistically where we see advantage. Clearly,
we've seen a lot of growth across the markets that are more heavily invested in energy: south Louisiana and Texas
being two great examples of that. But we also saw strong growth in the auto sector. And in the Southeast we have a
number of markets that enjoy large employment in the auto sector. So it's been pretty well disbursed across our
markets, and we want it that way because we want that diversity.
<Q - Sameer Gokhale>: Okay, that's good color. And then just in terms of the auto business, I think in your prepared
comments you had mentioned that you expect a higher pull-through from some technology enhancements in the auto
business. I was just trying to get a sense for what you mean exactly by pull-through. Is that more volume driven from
the dealers because of the technology or just the ability to process more volume because of the technology
enhancements? If you could talk about what these enhancements are, that would be interesting. Thank you.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: It's all around speed of answer and quality of answer. We continued to grow the number of
auto dealers that we are working with, partnering with, but we have higher expectations for the volume we get through
those dealers. And in order to do that we had to invest in technology and had to invest in people in the back office to
ensure that as we get applications for credit that the speed of our answers and the quality of our answers continued to

Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Ken.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: David, I wanted to ask you to go a little bit deeper into your comments about the investments in
the fee businesses starting to get to profitability this year. So the wealth management line hasn't really broken out yet,
so to speak. Can you give us a little flavor for how you expect the fee businesses to act this year, and can they more
than offset the expected decline in mortgage that's just a matter of fact? Thanks.
<A - David J. Turner>: Yeah, Ken, we've just pointed to wealth management as an example. We don't have any one
business that's going to light it up and take over all the pressures that we had in mortgage. We do believe mortgage
doesn't have quite the decline it had 2012 to 2013 as it does in 2013 to 2014. We think, as a matter of fact, we'll be
down production-wise in mortgage about 10% to 15%. We'll right size the expense side of that and get to what will be a
normalized mortgage contribution.
But wealth management, we have some new products and services that we're working on. We'll have the full run rate of
those additions that we had, the financial consultants. So you'll see that. We've had some improvement in our
investments in insurance that we think also will be a driver. So it's not one – it's not just one area. We think all those
really are contributors to help offset any other negatives that we have in our NIR, primarily mortgage.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: I think the important point is that those initiatives are on track and wealth management in
particular, our early results are exceeding our preliminary forecast that we made the decision upon.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Okay. My second quick question is just on the new deposit products and the sunsetting of Ready
Advance. Can you talk about any net revenue and income effect you'd expect?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Yeah, I mean, it's a little early for that. We made the decision to discontinue new
registrations or new enrollment of that product from our customers. That goes into effect in the morning. And we're
working through our transition plan now. We have a fairly substantial group of customers who use this product and
we're being very thoughtful, very deliberate about how we transition them away from this product.
So we've got our product teams working on those transition plans now. They're going to take a few weeks to finalize.
You'll have more information from us forthcoming as this matures. But part of it is trying to predict customer behavior.
And as we offer alternative ways of meeting this customer need, we are going to find out exactly how the customer
responds to that. And it will sort of drive the end results.
We are still committed to focusing on our customers and meeting their financial needs, and we've tried to do that with
innovative products and really a focus on strong customer service. We'll continue to do that. It's just that on this
particular product we need to transition and focus our attention on other products in order to best serve our customers.

<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Matt.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Could you just provide an update of how asset sensitive you were at the end of the year? I
noticed your liquidity increased on a period-end basis and if you could provide an update of how much you benefit if
rates rise, say, 100 basis points?
<A - David J. Turner>: Matt, we have, right now if you look at a 100 basis point parallel shift, it's about $180 million
to us. Down slightly from where we were last quarter, it was about $200 million. I think we drifted down to about $180
million.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Okay. And then just separately, as we think about credit going forward, obviously the held
for sale actions pulls forward some charge-offs. Also uses some loan loss reserves. How should we think about both
charge-offs and the provision expense going forward from here?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Matt, when you look at – when you look at when we had this call for the third quarter, we
really at that point in time indicated that we thought our credit recovery would continue. We thought that the pace
might moderate somewhat. But the fourth quarter, again, very positive results. It exceeded our internal early forecast.
And so we continue at this juncture to still believe that that recovery process continues.
As David said earlier, there may be some volatility in a particular metric quarter-to-quarter. We had a little bit of
volatility in, for example, charge-offs this quarter. We had a couple of transactions that had they gone in a different
direction, it could have been a much better number than it was. But you're going to see that sort of as we get down to
where our distressed loans are more granular in nature. You're going to see a little more volatility, but we think the
overall trend still continues.

<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Hi, good morning.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: A couple of follow ups on the NIM outlook. I know you've indicated that you're looking for
relatively stable NIM if rates stay where they are. Is that in reference to current rates or that's in reference to the
forward curve?
<A - David J. Turner>: It's really looking at the forward curve as exists today.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. So if the forward curve were to shift up, then that's where the NIM benefit comes
from?
<A - David J. Turner>: That's correct.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: And then could you give us a little understanding of how you're thinking about non-interest
bearing deposits? I know we had a conversation earlier in the call around the fact that deposit quality has improved
significantly. But how are you thinking about what happens to non-interest bearing deposits in an environment where
the forward curve is increasing and particularly in the belly of the curve in the three to five year section?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: That's a great question and one we're spending an awful lot of time on trying to figure out
how do you forecast sort of customer behavior in a rising rate market after you've been through several years of such
low rates. And there's really not a great empirical model that allows you to forecast this out. We have built that into our
liquidity plans. We built it into our business plans so that we have quite a bit of variability, depending on changes in
customer behavior.

Anecdotally, what we're seeing from our customers is just a greater propensity for both individuals and businesses to
hold liquidity. We've not seen a great movement when borrowing demands increase that liquidity diminishes to any
great degree. We're watching it closely. I don't think we have the answer. But we absolutely realize the importance of
monitoring that on a daily basis and looking for trends over each and every quarter.
<A - David J. Turner>: Go ahead, Betsy.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: I was just going to say it's interesting because you highlighted that line utilization requests
are up. So what you're saying is at those customers where line utilizations are up, their deposits have not been coming
down ahead of those?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: On average that's true. When you look at it on a customer by customer basis you see a little
bit of differentiation. But still what we see both in the numbers and conversation anecdotally is still customers being
conservative and still having a desire for increased levels of liquidity as compared to what you would have seen prior to
the economic crisis.
<A - David J. Turner>: Betsy, I think it's a great question and one, what we do know is you can take the history book,
just about toss it out the window because we've been in this low rate environment for so long we all have loan deposits
that are non-interest bearing, in particular. We can go back and look back at history. It's a data point.
We study that. But we want to be careful that we don't lean too hard on history. We're sitting here at 81% loan deposit
ratio, we think we're well positioned for that. While we look at liquidity as being the biggest risk we face and what we
want to make sure is what's the impact to our profitability as others who aren't that low on loan deposit ratio, if they
start seeing deposits move out, what does that mean from a pricing standpoint?
So I think that when we look at our forecast of liquidity, we've shocked that a number of times to see what might
happen and we shock it again after that just to be sure we don't get caught in a liquidity filet. But we still don't know yet
exactly what that's going to mean to us.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Because then you think should you have an LCR that's even above 100% at this stage of the
rate cycle? I don't know if that's too aggressive a comment but...
<A - David J. Turner>: We still have to work through LCR. As we mentioned on the prepared comments, we're pretty
close to being there right now. We don't see that being a huge driver. It's clearly something we have to consider. But
one we need to get to the point where all that's happening. If that starts to happen, that means we're in a lot better
economic environment than we are right this minute and while it has its challenges it has its rewards that go with it as
well. So it's a great question, one for all of us to really pay attention to as we get closer to that time.

going forward and that's baked into our guidance that we've given you, but we haven't been specific with disclosing that
exact amount.
<Q - Keith A. Murray>: Okay. And then just moving to funding costs for a second, the improved basis points this
quarter, you mentioned the CDs that are left to re-price, not much of a savings there. Are you sort of out of room on the
funding cost side?
<A - David J. Turner>: I wouldn't say we're out of room, I would just say, the kind of improvement you've seen over
the last two years for us is slowing quite a bit. When you're 12 basis points of cost of deposits, it's hard to see how that
moves. As I mentioned we have a little over $4 billion of deposits maturing next year. It's almost about $1 billion, $1.1
billion each quarter. The first quarter has the bigger benefit, but I think what's coming off there is still pretty close to
what's going on, like 42 basis points what's going on is in the 20 range. So there's just not a lot to pick up there. We do
have some liability management that we've done. We'll get the full benefit of that in 2014 that we executed in 2013. So
you'll see some pick up there, and all that added together is one of the ways that we're able to give you the stable

Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: Yes, hi. Good afternoon guys. Just another follow-up on the funding side of the equation. Does
the stable net interest margin outlook contemplate any further liability management actions outside of just re-pricing of
deposits? And then related to that, you noted that premium Am. [amortization] fell to $45 million in the quarter. How
much premium amortization is left? What is the assumed duration of those securities today and what yields are you
reinvesting today?
<A - David J. Turner>: I'll tell you on the premium amortization, I think our number's closer to about $700 million.
We'll flip the pages and find that exact number in just a minute. But that number is slowing down considerably. What's
really going on from maturities and pay-downs going back into the mortgage backed here in that 275 range and that's
kind of where we'll be. You'd asked funding – what was your funding question?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Duration.
<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: Is there anything outside of deposit re-pricing that's contemplated in the liability management
side?
<A - David J. Turner>: Yeah, we've really kind of run the course of the pure liability component of that. Anything
that has to do with, that's tied to capital has to go through the CCAR process. We need to – we can't comment really on
the capital elements of that that manifest themselves at times in interest expense. So you'll have to wait until March to
hear our CCAR results.
<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: Got it, and I have one quick high level follow-up. David, if I tied together all the guidance that
you've given with improving loan growth, stable margin, lower expenses, is it fair to say that the operating leverage
that you drive in 2014 will be more balanced between revenues and expenses relative to, I believe your prior guidance
was, it will mostly come from the revenue side?
<A - David J. Turner>: We've actually been working on operating leverage from both sides. It's obviously a little
easier to move on the expense side, but this year, 2014, we see contributions from both revenue and expenses. And as
we've mentioned pretty confidently, our goal is to generate positive operating leverage. We think we have the plan in
place to do that. What can change that is a very different rate environment than what we're assuming. But we're fairly
confident on that. That premium, by the way, is $700 million of amortizable tied to the mortgage backed. I wanted to
confirm that with you.

Your next question comes from the line of Josh Levin with Citi.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good afternoon, Josh.
<Q - Josh D. Levin>: I want to ask, you've been a bit more up front than some of your peers about considering doing –
making acquisitions. In terms of getting a deal done or making an acquisition, has anything changed in terms of the
number of conversations you're having or in terms of the regulatory burden that you have to clear to get a deal done?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: I mean, I haven't – I can't comment on the comparative analysis between us and peers. But
clearly what we're trying to do is to strengthen our balance sheet, finish our derisking activities and put ourselves in
position when and where opportunities present themselves and when and where they're appropriate. But we really have
no comment beyond that. I still think it's early yet in that whole debate.
<A - David J. Turner>: Let me clarify what you may be getting at. The question we get oftentimes, we got it today, is
how do you think about capital allocation? So we mentioned acquisitions as the thought process before we get to the
return to shareholders. The caveat is if and when those are available and you need to – we don't want to get the cart
before the horse, there are a lot of things that need to happen in order to get to that. We do believe acquisitions will be
part of our industry. We think it will be part of us. But it will be at the right time. And we're not trying to signal
anything other than the capital allocation process on how we think about it.
<Q - Josh D. Levin>: Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good afternoon, Matt.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just a couple of quick ones for
David. David, you mentioned that we should probably throw out the history books in terms of thinking about deposit
outflow. So let me ask the question in a slightly different way. If you were to assume something closer to 80% of the
incremental deposits you have in this cycle flowing out, rather than maybe the – rather than a historical number that's
closer to 50%, how much of a change would that create in your estimate of the interest rate benefit from higher rates?
<A - David J. Turner>: You know, I don't know if I can answer it that way. Let me try to frame it up. When I say
throw out the history books, we clearly look at what occurred last cycle, but we've all had deposits that have come into
our balance sheets over the past several years what we think is happening is that the liquidity requirements of our
customers, in particular our commercial customers that have non-interest bearing deposits, we think they're not going to
– we think there's a chance that they actually keep more on deposit and leverage up more to preserve that liquidity for a
rainy day.
We don't know that that will happen. It may. That's why we go through multiple scenarios with regards to outflows.
Clearly something out of the ordinary deposit outflows, and we have multiple risk scenarios that we use to establish
tolerance, risk tolerance in the company, subject to board review. If we end up having more outflows than what we
think our core is, we'll have a plan to address that. So if it's higher, markedly higher, then there will be actions that we
take well in advance of that occurring so that we don't get caught having to go out and put high priced deposits on our
books to fund ourselves.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Okay. For my follow up, in terms of the expense guidance you provided I'm presuming that
your expense number for 2014 is going to be on an adjusted basis as well, when we begin that comparison to the 3.43

number that you gave us?
<A - David J. Turner>: I think we put in our prepared comments, on the same basis. That's what that was intended to
do, be clear that it's apples to apples.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Thank you very much.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Thank you.
<A - David J. Turner>: Matt I'll go ahead and add we have in our base scenario for our outflows in deposits, a higher
percentage than our history indicated. So I just want to point that out.

Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Guggenheim.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good afternoon, Marty.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Hey, guys. I had a question going back, David, I'd like to revisit the expense guidance
again. But if you look at the trends through the year, the adjusted operating number went down from around $850
million to $830 million from fourth quarter last year to mid-year. And then mid-year to the end of the year it increased
from that $830 million number closer to the $888 million, $890 million-ish type level in the fourth quarter. To get it
back down to the annual number you have got to really reverse that trend and get down to something close to $850
million. So we're just making sure that the trend and the thought process of what's happened in the last couple of
quarters is going to reverse and quarterly we're going to see incremental declines?
<A - David J. Turner>: Marty, our guidance that we're giving you is on an annual basis. We furthermore indicated
that there could be some volatility in a particular quarter. We think looking at this as more of a long term basis, one
year, is a better indication of kind of our commitment to expense management. You saw our increases in the second
half of the year primarily due to investments that we decided to make. We thought it was important to make
investments in the revenue-generation folks. I've talked about financial consultants in wealth a couple of times, but
there have been other areas that we've made those investments in.
We also are working down costs, costs in mortgage we've talked about, costs in our branch network, we'll continue to
focus on. We've looked at legal and professional fees. We're continuing to watch that very closely. Our FDIC costs in
terms of reducing the risk in our balance sheet such that we get lower charges coming from the FDIC there. So it's no
one place.
But, yeah, if you wanted to get on the run rate, you see the change that has to happen from the fourth quarter to the first
if you used history of having to come down pretty aggressively. But our commitment is for the year right now. As we
get going on the year we'll be perhaps more specific on quarters, but that's not our message today.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Understood. I'm just trying to get to the benchmark you have to get to, to get to the full
year. And then lastly, the follow-up question would be on the FDIC or deposit administration fees or expenses, you
dropped from the mid-$30 millions to $20 million this quarter. Is that a good run rate, and does the sale of these TDRs
eventually bring it lower than the $20 million per quarter that it was at this quarter? Just kind of a continuation of that
trend in that line item?
<A - David J. Turner>: Yeah, we put in our prepared comments that we thought the run rate would be somewhere
between the third quarter and fourth quarter's number. We did have some unusual things in this quarter that won't
repeat. So we're giving you guidance that would be between those two, third and fourth. We do, in our overall expense
guidance number, take into account changes that we're making on the balance sheet, which includes this quarter's
transfer of loans to held for sale and the ultimate disposition of those. So, yeah, that's already been baked into our

Your next question comes from the line of Gaston Ceron with Morningstar Equity Research.
<Q - Gaston F. Ceron>: Hi, good afternoon.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good afternoon.
<Q - Gaston F. Ceron>: Thanks for taking my question. I know it's been a busy call. Quickly I just wanted to go back
to the branch consolidation issue. So you're cutting 30 offices. So that should take you to around, what, 1,675. I know
you didn't say, I think, the X number of expenses associated with the offices. I'm curious if you released the head count
associated with those branches?
And also I thought I saw a comment inter-quarter from one of your executives at one of your conferences about how
something to the effect of you're always looking at branch consolidation but some of the low hanging fruit is gone
given the consolidation you've done. I'm curious what does this 30 office cut mean as far as anything we can expect in
the future?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: I think we've gone through a fairly extensive review of all of our branch offices and we do
that on a continuous basis. And so the 30 consolidations that we announced in the fourth quarter shouldn't surprise
anyone. This is not new for us. We look at our branch offices literally on a regular basis and make decisions.
If you look at remaining offices, we had a little over 1,700, 1,705 offices. By reducing these 30, you have to look at the
remaining balance of that. And about 1,600 and – sorry, if you look at full service branches, we had about 1,625 of
those. A lot of those other offices from that 1,705 were drive-throughs, just purely drive-throughs. So you have to back
out those drive-throughs to get to full service. So even on the full service we've gone through a fairly exhaustive
process of looking at staffing, looking at transactions, looking at kinds of technology we have in those offices, and have
made decisions that improve the overall efficiency of that channel.
We balance that with also looking at other channels in terms of our Web-based services and our mobile-based services
and our contact center. And there's a lot of changes in customer behavior across those channels, and we're finding ways
to continue to serve our customers well but differently. And so branch channel is still very relevant for a big percentage
of our customers and a big percentage of our sales, and we're going to continue to invest in physical branch offices but
we're going to do it obviously with a lot more discipline that we've embarked on as we've studied this issue much more
closely.
<Q - Gaston F. Ceron>: Got it. I'm sorry, have you released a head count associated with the 30 branches or no?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: We have not.
<A - David J. Turner>: That will be a first quarter.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: That will be a first quarter event.

Your final question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good afternoon.
<Q - Vivek Juneja>: Good afternoon. A couple of questions. First one, how are you thinking about reserve levels?
Reserves to loan are down to 1.8%, especially in light of the fact that you took a fairly large 22% mark on the loans you

transferred to held for sale and what that would imply for your ongoing provisions, David and Grayson, if you can –
because your core provisions were only $4 million when we exclude that portion of the mark that went to the provision
line.
<A - David J. Turner>: So we're down to 1 8%. We acknowledge the charge taken on the transfer. But that charge is
related to the fair value of the loans that exist. And those fair values are derived by the required rate that they would
have on those assets today versus the yield that's on the assets when they went through a troubled debt restructuring.
If you think about a troubled debt restructuring, one of the ways that you reduce that payment, if you will, from the
individual is to reduce the rate. So our primary mechanism of troubled debt restructurings at that time was rate
reduction and/or extension of terms, very little principal forgiveness. But the market is demanding a fair value rate
today. When you calculate that, the differential has to go through your reserve. But that's not something that you
normally can reserve for in your allowance. So I don't think you can equate the reduction to the adequacy of the 1.8%.
I will tell you, as our credit metrics continue to improve, including a reduction in non-performers, a reduction in
criticized and classifieds, a reduction in past dues, a reduction in the transfers going into non-performing all coming
down leads us to believe that our reserve number will continue to decline.
We were at charge-offs of 67 basis points this quarter. As Grayson mentioned there are a couple of things in there that
caused that to be higher than what we thought it might be, which was continued to be lower than the net number. So we
see charge-offs continuing to come down but there may be some volatility here. But we feel good about where we're
reserving and that our provision will continue to be lower as a result of that "credit leverage" that we have in the
reserve. How much lower? We'll have to see.
<Q - Vivek Juneja>: In light of that, though, David, if you take out that $151 million mark, your net charge-offs are
$127 million and your provisioning, your core provisioning, was $4 million. So how should we think about going
forward, even if that $127 million comes down, where does that $4 million trend to?
<A - David J. Turner>: We'll have to see how things settle out in terms of the ultimate reserve levels but we do expect
the $127 million to continue to come down as a whole, again, with some volatility. Where it stops and where the
terminal point is, we'll have to see. We would argue that it wouldn't be sustainable that it would be $4 million every
single quarter, but given our reserve levels compared to how our credit metrics are trending, makes us feel good that we
have the right reserve levels today and how low they can go and we're just going to have to see.
<Q - Vivek Juneja>: And Grayson, I have a follow-up for you. The loan growth that you said you raised by 1%, is that
just reflecting the loan, because you sold about 1% of loans, is that simply what's being reflected there?
<A - David J. Turner>: Actually, we went and looked at our expectations of GDP growth for next year, slightly higher
than what we had a quarter or so ago. We feel incrementally better about that. And as a result of that, and talking to our
business groups, and team leaders, we felt that an increase from the 2% to 4% that we had indicated a quarter or so ago,
that 3% to 5% was a better indicator of what that percentage increase could be.
<Q - Vivek Juneja>: But given that you did sell 1% of loans, would that mean from a dollar amount delta, that didn't
really change that much, right?
<A - David J. Turner>: Yeah, it's because the base is so large. It's just not that big of a change.
<Q - Vivek Juneja>: Okay. All right. That would be – great, thank you.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Thank you. There are no more questions, so we thank you for your time and attention on
this call and we'll stand adjourned.
