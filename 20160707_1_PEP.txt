Jamie Caulfield
Thank you, operator. With me today are Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo's Chairman and CEO and Hugh Johnston, PepsiCo's
CFO. We'll lead off today's call with a review of our second quarter 2016 performance and full-year outlook and then
we'll move onto Q&A. We've kept our comments brief this morning and intend to conclude the call by 8:45. Before we
begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. This conference call includes forward-looking statements,
including statements regarding 2016 guidance based on currently available information. Forward-looking statements
inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those predicted in
such forward-looking statements. Statements made on this conference call should be considered together with
cautionary statements and other information contained in today's earnings release and in our most recent periodic
reports filed with the SEC.
References to organic revenue results exclude the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, structural changes, foreign

And now it's my pleasure to introduce, Indra Nooyi.
Indra K. Nooyi
Thanks, Jamie. I'm pleased to report that our businesses continue to perform well in the second quarter. We had more
than 2% organic volume growth in both Global Snacks and Global Beverages. While foreign exchange translations
continue to pressure our reported revenue results, we delivered more than 3% organic revenue growth, led by Frito-Lay
North America, AMENA and Latin America.
ESSA delivered operating margin expansion together with increased A&M investment. North America Beverages
delivered solid net price realization and margin expansion. And Quaker Foods North America had very strong net
revenue and operating profit growth.
And positive net pricing and continued execution of our productivity agenda, including the implementation of our
Smart Spending program drove 80 basis points of core operating margin expansion. At the same time, we continue to
invest in advertising and marketing, which increased 50 basis points as a percentage of sales in the second quarter.
And our performance was well-balanced by market type. Our developing and emerging markets businesses grew
organic revenue almost 7% for the quarter, with double-digit organic revenue growth in China, Mexico, Turkey and
Egypt.
And our developed market's growth was led by the United States, where we grew revenue more than 2%. In fact, on a
standalone basis, Frito-Lay was the largest contributor to growth at retail and gained value share in both salty and
macro snacks.
North America Beverages maintained its value share leadership and possesses 5 of the 10 top beverage trademarks
based on dollar sales, Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Gatorade, Lipton and Starbucks.
And Quaker gained almost 1.5 value share points in hot cereal, while accounting for 100% of category retail sales
growth.
Year-to-date our results are equally strong. Organic revenue grew 3.4%. Core constant currency operating profit grew
7% and up 9% excluding the impact of deconsolidating Venezuela. And core constant currency EPS grew 8% but up
10% excluding the Venezuela impact.
On the strength of our year-to-date results and our outlook for the balance of the year, we have increased our full-year
core EPS target to $4.71 from our previous target of $4.66, driven by the expectations and factors set out in this
morning's press release.
Specifically, there are five things we've focused on to deliver in what continues to be a challenging macro-environment.
First, consumer-centric relentless innovation; second, connecting with digital age consumers in new ways; third, being
a true growth partner to our customers; fourth, flawless end-to-end execution; and fifth, a maniacal focus on
productivity.
Let me touch on each briefly. Product innovation and portfolio transformation are enabling us to provide consumers,
the delicious and convenient products they want and to satisfy their constantly evolving demands across a broad
spectrum of occasions and need states. We have ramped up our innovation engine and as a result, new products
comprise approximately 9% of sales or over $5 billion.
We've achieved this by leveraging our global scale while simultaneously tailoring products to appeal to local taste,
addressing consumers' evolving demand for convenience, taste and variety, from the occasional treat to nutrition, by
transforming our product portfolio. So today, what we refer to as guilt-free products generates approximately 45% of
our net revenue.

And we're now recognizing consumers' interest in craft, niche and premium products. So for example in beverages,
Gatorade continues to innovate in the new areas of sports hydration, with the introduction of the G Frost flavor lineup,
while propelled by the makers of Gatorade, drove more than 40% of the enhanced water category volume growth
year-to-date.
Following on the success of Mountain Dew Kickstart, we've introduced Mountain Dew Black Label, a deeper darker
DEW, made with real sugar and crafted with dark berry flavor and herbal bitters. Mountain Dew Black Label is for
those times when DEW Nation wants to live it up – with a touch of class.
Dew Black Label was initially released exclusively at approximately 600 colleges and universities, giving students a
first taste of the unique beverage. And demand for the product built as word quickly spread across social media.
Along with the nationwide release of Mountain Dew Black Label, the brand is extending its BOLDLY REFINED
campaign. It started with activation during the South by Southwest Music Conference and Festival in Austin, which
included the Mountain Dew Black Label Parlor, a South by Southwest Takeover concert and product seeding at local
bars and venues. The campaign continued with the release of a new digital spot called Gentlemen of the Jacket. The
content showcases different gentlemen skaters including DEW athlete and pro skateboarder, Theotis Beasley,
mixologists and gamers, all crossing over to the classier side of DEW with the help of putting on a unique jacket,
transforming world they are in to become a more refined version of itself, yet still getting at the heart of all things
DEW.
In the second quarter, we also launched Aquafina Sparkling, a new line of flavored sparkling water that provides a light
and naturally sweetened hydration option. Aquafina Sparkling is offered in three delicious fruit flavors: Black Cherry
Dragonfruit, Lemon Lime and Orange Grapefruit. Each sleek single-serve 12-ounce can contains just 10 calories and
the tiniest pinch of Fair Trade Certified sugar for a smooth, crisp finish. Aquafina Sparkling will also be available in a
multi-pack containing two flavors.
We also are appealing to consumers' desire for discovery and more premium experiences. Naked Juice launched a line
of cold pressed juices branded Naked Pressed. It provides a new take on fresh taste and the line comes in five varieties.
It's sourced from cold-pressed whole fruits and vegetables and is Non-GMO Project Verified.
And Pepsi has introduced 1893 from the makers of Pepsi-Cola. It capitalizes on the cultural food revolution and is
inspired by consumer interest in bold and interesting taste combinations. 1893 is packaged in sleek and premium 12
ounce cans and brings together premium ingredients and more than 100 years of cola-making expertise to present a
great tasting, unexpectedly bold experience. 1893 is a blend of premium kola nut extract, real sugar and sparkling
water, available in two delicious flavors original and ginger cola. 1893 can be enjoyed as a delicious standalone
beverage and is also the perfect complement for cocktails.
In the Quaker business, because consumers are increasingly seeking greater convenience, portability and nutrition in
their breakfast, we've introduced Quaker Breakfast Flats. Crispy, baked snack bars that contain delicious ingredients
that you can see, like oats, real pieces of fruit, crunchy nuts, flax and sunflower seeds. Each serving contains 18 grams
of whole grains with less than 200 calories and no artificial flavors or added colors. Quaker Breakfast Flats comes in
three delicious flavors including Cranberry Almond, Banana Honey Nut and Golden Raisin Cinnamon.
Turning to Frito-Lay, we continue to expand our portfolio with a particular focus on premium offerings and healthy
snacking options. So for example, we've expanded our Simply line with the introduction of Simply Tostitos Black Bean
Chips made from real black beans. It's Non-GMO Project Verified and Simply Tostitos Black Bean Chips offer
consumers an excellent source of fiber with 5 grams per 1 ounce serving. And this Simply line has also introduced
Simply Tostitos Organic Chunky Medium Salsa and Simply Tostitos Organic Black Bean and Corn Mild Salsa. And
both salsa varieties are USDA certified organic.
SunChips has introduced Veggie Harvest Farmhouse Ranch Flavored Veggie & Wholegrain and Veggie Harvest
Tomato, Basil & Cheese Flavored Veggie & Wholegrain and both are made with real veggies and whole grains.

And SMARTFOOD has introduced SMARTFOOD DELIGHT Sea Salted Caramel Flavored Popcorn, which offers
50% less fat when compared to regular SMARTFOOD White Cheddar Popcorn. It offers 100% whole grains and 35
calories per cup.
So as a result of initiatives like this year-to-date, our Frito-Lay U.S. premium portfolio growth is outpacing the growth
in the balance of the portfolio by a factor of more than four times. And we're extending our value-shared leadership
position in premium salty snacks.
So that's innovation. The second capability I mentioned is connecting with consumers the age of social and digital
media and the purpose-driven consumer. So this summer, Gatorade is running FOR THE LOVE OF SPORTS, a
national campaign that encourages athletes to think about and hold on to that moment when they were younger and first
fell in love with sport. The multifaceted campaign features a national retail promotion, TV commercials and a unique
cause initiative that encourages consumers to vote for deserving sports-focused organizations to which Gatorade will
donate on their behalf.
The retail component includes limited-time-only bottles featuring athletes such as Usain Bolt, Serena Williams, Paul
George, and April Ross with a special callout of the FOR THE LOVE OF SPORTS cause initiative. Gatorade has
partnered with a total of 19 sports-focused nonprofit organizations, five of which were selected by a roster of athletes
featured on the limited time offer bottles. For the remaining 14 organizations, consumers will have the opportunity to
vote for their favorite online to receive donations that will help athletes pursue their love of sport.
We're also driving greater consumption of Quaker Oats in the warmer shoulder season by promoting the concept of
overnight oats. We have collaborated with influential foodies to bring consumers quick and easy online tutorials on
how to make delicious and nutritious jars of chilled overnight oats, perfect for days when you just need a simple
no-cook recipe.
And earlier this year, we kicked off Quaker's very first Bring Your Best Bowl contest, a nationwide search for the next
Quaker oatmeal flavor. The Bring Your Best Bowl contest highlights the endless ways to enjoy oatmeal, and invited
fans across the country to submit their oatmeal creation using two to five ingredients, along with their inspiration, for a
chance to win $250,000 and have their combination brought to life as Quaker's newest oatmeal flavor.
Millions of consumers submitted creations using two to five ingredients, along with the inspiration behind their idea.
Three finalist flavors are now being developed by Quaker and will be revealed on around National Oatmeal Day, which
is October 29. The selected flavors will then be made available in stores across the country for consumers to taste. Then
it's up to America to vote online before the winning flavor is revealed in February of 2017. The grand prize winner will
take home the cash prize, along with a chance to have his or her oatmeal combination debut on shelves nationwide.
At the same time, Frito-Lay drove greater consumer engagement with the Lay's brand by asking Americans to help
decide which Lay's flavor stays and which ones go. Lay's Flavor Swap campaign asked Americans to unleash the
power of their palates and allow their voices and their taste buds to be heard. Consumers were invited to visit
FlavorSwap.com to vote for their favorite flavor in each of the four Flavor Swap match-ups. We received millions of
customer votes, drove tremendous social media buzz and consumer engagement, and strengthened Lay's brand
awareness in regard.
To support trademark Pepsi this summer, we're taking the world's global language, emojis. We're taking it offline in a
visually striking and socially shareable campaign inviting consumers to Say It With Pepsi, from a smirk, to a kiss, to a
wink. This initiative connects cola lovers around the world through a common language that is uniquely and definably
Pepsi. The PepsiCo Design and Innovation Center created more than 600 PepsiMoji designs, all incorporating the
essence of Pepsi, including the brand's iconic globe shape and the colors of blue, red and white.
Both globally relevant and locally significant, PepsiMoji designs come to life across the full Pepsi portfolio and also
beyond packaging in unexpected ways, such as a fashion collaboration with designer Jeremy Scott, the limited edition
Pepsi with Jeremy Scott Capsule Collection includes six styles of emoji-inspired sunglasses featuring PepsiMoji
designs.

We have partnership with famed photographer, Ben Watts, as well as Daniel Arnold, a street photographer with one of
today's most enviable Instagram followings. Their work, share the story of #PepsiMoji in the same nonverbal vein as
emojis themselves, with a quirky, candid and playful tone.
We also have localized experiential content from vending machines in India that dispense Pepsi product, adorned with
a PepsiMoji design that matches users' current state of mind, to online engagement in Argentina, where consumers can
create a personalized PepsiMoji design or use PepsiMoji accessories to fashion their selfies. And we also have a free
PepsiMoji keyboard app that can be downloaded at the Apple App or Google Play stores.
Global television and original digital creative also showcase how communicating through PepsiMoji icons can lead to
unpredictable and memorable adventures and experiences. And consumers around the world have already begun to
experience #PepsiMoji in the U.S., Australia, Canada, India, Mexico, Russia and Thailand. The global campaign is
being featured in more than 100 markets around the world in 2016.
We're also capitalizing on our partnership with the UEFA Champions League with global activation. Every year, the
UEFA Champions League brings together the best teams across Europe to compete in the game's biggest club
competition. Fans of the tournament extend far and wide around the world. That's why in more than 100 markets
around the globe, PepsiCo executed programs to realize the benefits of our official sponsorship of the UEFA
Champions League.
From Argentina to Zambia, we had football fans covered with exciting media-to-shelf campaigns tailored to the local
market. For example, in South Africa, Lay's and Pepsi launched the national #PerfectMatch campaign, reinforcing
Lay's and Pepsi as a snack-and-beverage combination of choice. In Mexico, we ran a Power of One campaign,
promoting the concept, Pepsi and Sabritas take you to the UEFA Champions League final. And in Chile, we leveraged
the UEFA Champions League partnership with unique packaging and promotions across our Gatorade, Pepsi and Lay's
brand. And we delivered a phenomenal experience at the UEFA Champions League final opening ceremony presented
by Pepsi, where Alicia Keys gave an incredible performance, ushering a new live entertainment era at the soccer final.
The third capability is being a valued growth partner with retailers. And we've done this by continuing to drive traffic
and basket size, through investing in and leveraging consumer and shopper insights, constantly finding new ways to
become more efficient and coordinated with our retail partner supply chain, and integrating our marketing initiatives
with our retailer strategies, including tailored execution of sports, music and other properties.
As a consequence, we tend to be among the top drivers of our customers' growth. In fact, in the United States which is
our largest market, in the second quarter, we were once again the largest contributor to food and beverage retail growth
in the United States, accounting for more growth at retail than all other $5 billion-plus food and beverage
manufacturers combined. More growth at retail than all other $5 billion-plus food and beverage manufacturers
combined.
The next capability is dialing up end-to-end execution from seed to shelf, making sure our products are fresh and
ubiquitously available. We're doing this by using advanced data and analytics to capture more precise demand signals
to inform our supply chain and retooling our supply chain and go-to-market systems to improve service, eliminate out
of stocks and reduce the cycle time from raw material to product on the shelf.
Our initiatives in this area now include expanding our successful Genius program from Frito-Lay North America to our
Beverage businesses.
And the fifth and final focus is fueling margin expansion and capability investments with productivity. Year-to-date,
core gross margins expanded 100 basis points and core operating margin expanded 115 basis points, even as we
continue to invest in A&M, which is up 55 basis points as a percentage of sales.
In addition to marketing, we've also continued to invest in critical capabilities like R&D, the establishment of our
global design center, and the creation of our global e-commerce group. To capture productivity, we're increasingly
leveraging automation and advanced technology, as well as the development and deployment of global best practices,
all to make our supply chain more efficient.

Let me just give you a few examples from the hundreds of supply chain productivity projects that are currently in play.
We're implementing automated high-speed packaging lines across the globe, increasing packaging line speeds by up to
50% while at the same time eliminating the bottleneck to total production lines and significantly reducing labor costs.
To improve our water use efficiency, we have developed and are implementing technology and processes that capture
sugar and starch from wastewater streams. The waste sugars and starches are then sold as byproduct. The resulting
water stream can then be repurposed for secondary manufacturing uses such as sanitation. This normally generates
incremental cash flow and saves money. It also reduces our water usage to advance our sustainability agenda.
Our Global Operations Group is identifying and then lifting and shifting best practices developed by our manufacturing
teams around the world. For example, our manufacturing team in Romania developed a refinement to our potato cutting
process that can reduce raw potato waste by up to 2%. We're now implementing this process improvement in other
plants around the globe.
We're capturing significant savings by using advanced logistics, planning processes and tools, which enable us to
optimize both the mode and routing of material transport. These tools initially developed and deployed in North
America have been expanded to nine more countries and are generating 3% to 4% savings in transportation costs. And
in key markets, we've also advanced our third-party transportation procurement process by consolidating all transport
origin-destination pairs across our food and beverage businesses to present to the market for competitive bids and we
have the opportunity to expand this process to many more markets.
Productivity is also being captured through the implementation of our Smart Spending program, which is driving
meaningful reductions in key discretionary spending areas like travel, facilities and consulting.
We're attacking spending on both rate and volume dimensions. So for example, in travel we've adopted much more
stringent policies governing mode and class of travel, hotel rate and per diem meal limits, all of which have reduced the
rate element of the cost. But we've also mandated and encouraged working in ways that reduce the volume element of
costs. So for example, we've reduced meeting-related travel by insisting on the use of teleconferencing in place of
physical meetings in many instances. And as a result of all of our productivity efforts, we're capturing significant
savings that are delivering meaningful margin improvement and also providing the funding necessary to invest in the
long-term health of the business.
Taken together, our top-line driving commercial activities and our robust productivity agenda are helping us to deliver
our financial targets, despite continuing macro challenges. We're aggressively driving innovation, marketing,
marketplace execution productivity to deliver balanced and sustainable performance. We are confident we have the
right plans in place and believe we are well-positioned to achieve our 2016 targets, including our increased core
constant currency EPS outlook, which we announced this morning.
Just as important, we continue to invest in capabilities and to transform our portfolio to succeed in the dynamic
customer and consumer landscapes with a singular goal of generating sustainable shareholder value for the long-term.
With that, let me turn the call over to Hugh Johnston. Hugh?
Hugh F. Johnston
Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone. As Indra mentioned, we're pleased with the financial results for the
first half, and we have a positive outlook for our performance for the balance of the year. And so as you saw in this
morning's release, we've raised our full-year core EPS target to $4.71, which incorporates the following: underlying
core constant currency growth of 9%, excluding the impact of deconsolidating Venezuela; a negative 2 percentage
point impact of the Venezuela deconsolidation; and a negative 4 percentage point impact from foreign exchange
translation based on current market consensus.
Our outlooks on the other metrics we provide remain unchanged and are set out in this morning's release. Our efforts to
improve working capital continue to yield positive results. Over the past year, we have improved our working capital

cash conversion cycle by more than 10 days.
For analysts on the call, as you update your models, I ask that you consider the following factors. Foreign exchange
translation continues to be a headwind, more heavily skewed to Q3 than Q4. We have more difficult core constant
currency operating profit growth comparisons in the second half at Frito-Lay North America. North America Beverages
has particularly difficult revenue and operating profit lapse in Q3. We expect low-single digit raw material inflation,
including the impacts of foreign exchange translation in the second half compared to modest deflation in the first half.
We will continue to invest in our business to drive sustainable long-term growth, including an expected increase in
advertising and marketing expense as a percentage of sales for the full year. And finally, we will be lapping Venezuela
core earnings of approximately $0.06 per share in Q3.
Taken together, we expect the balance of year core EPS growth to be generated entirely in the fourth quarter.
And with that, operator, we'll take the first question.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz of Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Bill Schmitz>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Morning, Bill.
<Q - Bill Schmitz>: Hey. Can you guys just talk about the sustainability of the great organic growth at Frito? And then
also the margins which are pretty close to peak? Maybe I'm wrong on this assumption, but I think Frito
disproportionately benefited from GES, and I just wondered like kind of what inning we are, in baseball terminology,
on that front and if you still think there's room for margins to go up there.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: I mean, let's talk about the organic growth first, Bill and then, Hugh, maybe you can chip in on
the margin expansion. Look, the macro snack category is a big category. And we're only playing in the salty snack
category, expanding into savory snacks. And our goal, if you'd go back maybe 15 years ago and we've been consistent
in this strategy, we've always said grow the core and add more inside of the core. We've used these words. And that's
what Frito-Lay has been doing, solidify our position in salty snacks and start to step out of the core into other savory
snacks, and then start to take on other occasions from the overall macro snack category. So all the work we've done in
demand spaces says that there's huge opportunity, as the world starts to swing more and more towards the liking for
savory products. So savory is in and we see amazing opportunities ahead for Frito-Lay to grow its business.
Secondly, Frito-Lay has been a mainstream competitor. We haven't played as much in the premium part of the portfolio
and now we've gotten our game together on the premium side and we're seeing growth. And as I mentioned in the
script, the premium part of the portfolio grew four times faster and we're just getting started. So we see tremendous
opportunities for Frito-Lay to grow in the premium side.
And I'll make one final comment, Bill, before I toss it to Hugh to talk about productivity. The great thing about
Frito-Lay is that we've got great brands. We've got a great innovation capability but we've got an amazing pipeline to
the customer and consumer. Our DSD system is a well-oiled machine and we can keep expanding the diameter of that
pipeline and it's really our imagination in terms of what products we can innovate with to put through that pipeline. So
with that, let me it to Hugh to talk about the margins in Frito.
<A - Hugh F. Johnston>: Yeah, happy to. Good morning, Bill. A couple comments on margins and the short answer
is, I think Frito-Lay still has lots of margin expansion left in it and can do so in a very defendable, sustainable way.
Why do I say that? Number one it's to build on the commentary that Indra just made. While we are the market leaders
in premium, we are relatively underpenetrated compared to where we are in mainstream. And premium does offer very,
very attractive margins, particularly as you scale it over time. So I think there is a significant margin uplift there.

Number two is in the area of GES, the initiative that we've been working on for a number of years, where we shorten
the supply chain, deliver product to the customer and, ultimately, to the consumer much more quickly by going,
essentially, direct from plant to the store or going from plant to cross dock to store. The benefit of that is, we obviously
eliminate a lot of excess cost in the system and as we take that excess cost out, we are reinvesting some back in
premium and we're delivering some to the bottom line. To use the baseball metaphor that you used earlier, we're really
only in about the fourth or fifth inning on GES. GES has a number of years to run and, in fact, I think the GES impact
on the financials are likely to be more profound in the future than they have in the past.
And then the third element to this is this whole area of Smart Spending. Frito-Lay has absolutely taken the ball and run
with Smart Spending as they always do, but we're really only, right now, exploiting four out of what could be
potentially be about 30 categories in Smart Spending. So I think Smart Spending also offers us years of runway to
deliver additional productivity. So if you put all of that together, premium, plus GES, plus Smart Spending and
combine that with the fact that Frito-Lay's strong market position gives it the ability to scale things in ways that none of
its competitors can, I think we have many years of margin improvement to come and, frankly, significant margin
improvement to come in Frito.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: And I think we should add that the way we've executed Smart Spending, make sure that we
create the breathing room but reinvest back in capabilities to keep this virtuous circle going. That's what's important
with our productivity programs.

Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Dara, good morning.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Hi, good morning. So maybe building on that Frito-Lay margin commentary there, you've
seen very strong SG&A leverage if you exclude the increases in A&M spending over the last couple of quarters here,
Hugh. As we think about that going forward, is that sustainable going forward? And what's driving that because it is
different than what we've generally seen over the past few years?
<A - Hugh F. Johnston>: Yeah, happy to answer that, Dara. To me, number one, it is absolutely sustainable. We're
able to continue to drive that? Why are we able to continue to drive it? We have invested significantly in streamlining
our supply chains. And remember with PepsiCo, the supply chain doesn't just have cost in cost of goods, there's also a
significant piece of it in the selling systems which fall into SG&A. That's primarily the DSD system. We've got lots of
room to be more efficient on that. We're really very much in the early innings on that.
Number two, we do continue to streamline the organization. And number three, Smart Spending is having a significant
impact on our SG&A spending. So put together, the combination of making DSD more efficient, making the
organization more efficient and leveraging Smart Spending, you're seeing improvements in the non-A&M portion of
SG&A that are likely to continue to deliver for a number of years.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: I want to add something to what Hugh said. You know, Dara, we spend a lot of effort, time,
money on putting in an ERP system and we invested in SAP. And we started that way back in 2000 and we've been
doing that for the last 10 or 15 years. And putting in an ERP system takes time, takes money. And now we're beginning
to see some of the benefits from that ERP implementation. And as we compete a lot of the implementations, we're able
to take out the costs from those implementations and start to realize the benefits. So it's streamlining the supply chain,
the organization Smart Spending and now the increased leverage from the SAP investments.

<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Hey, guys.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Good morning, Ali.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Hey. How are you?
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Good. Thank you.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Good. Hey, I have two questions. One is just trying to get little bit of a better handle on your
earnings guidance raise today. I know last quarter a lot of people were kind of thinking about it going up, but this
quarter you've raised it from 8% to 9% but the top-line isn't any different, productivity is roughly the same,
commodities look the same, taxes look unchanged versus last guidance. So you're assuming an acceleration of about
two points for the back half of the year. I'm just trying to get a better sense of what gives you that confidence that it's
going to go up to 10% for H2. It's clearly not macros. You knew what the Q4 compare is. So I'm trying to get a sense
there, that's question one.
Question two, and, Indra, don't take this the wrong way at all, in fact, take it very positively, but there continues to be a
real thoughtful set of questions from important investors about your future at Pepsi versus for example any future
presidential administration and these are really questions people are really thinking about it. So can you in any way
give us some help in clarifying your future interest between business and politics? You've done such an incredible job
at Pepsi people are really asking themselves this question. So anyway if you can help clarify that debate that whether
you know or not it's out there, would be helpful. Thanks.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: So, Hugh, go ahead and answer the first question.
<A - Hugh F. Johnston>: Yeah, happy to, Ali. Thank you for the question. You know, we always start the year with a
perspective on the macros and on the world that tends to be conservative. When we give guidance our intention is
always to hit it and perhaps beat it. Now that we're halfway through the year, I think we've seen two things. One, the
macros are operating in a consistent steady way so there has not been a deterioration which obviously is to our benefit
relative to our expectations. And number two, we do see significant innovation launching in the back half of the year
that we're quite optimistic about. Some of the things you've seen more recently that Indra mentioned, whether it's
Mountain Dew Black Label, Aquafina Sparkling, 1893, the Simply line at TOSTITOS, down at Frito or Quaker
Breakfast Flats which are doing terrifically well, and in it coming out of Quaker as well.
When you put together all of that innovation, it will have a disproportionate impact in the back half of the year which is
really our cause for optimism in the balance of the year. So that's the driver behind the raise at this point.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Ali, on question number two, in the foreseeable future, next several years I see myself running
PepsiCo.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg of Stifel.
<Q - Mark Swartzberg>: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Morning, Mark.
<Q - Mark Swartzberg>: Two questions on Latin America, if I could, Indra and Hugh. One is, in the quarter,
advertising and marketing in the region was up. I believe for the half its flat or maybe even down a bit just by the
omission of the reference to being up for the first half. So question one is, do you intend for it to be up for the full year?
And then question two, if you take these two large markets of Brazil and Mexico, could you give us a bit of an update
on your outlook for each of those two regions because of course the conditions and your performance there are quite
divergent. Just looking for how you're looking at your future performance in those two markets.

<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Yeah, I'll just talk about the second, and Hugh, you can talk about the A&M issue. Brazil, all of
us have read the news on Brazil. Brazil's going through a very difficult time, politically and socially. So they have to
work through their issues.
Mexico is actually doing well. The strength of the dollar, the increased remittances into Mexico are doing well. The
country actually is one of the brighter stars in the whole Latin American economies. So we feel good about our
business in Mexico. Our teams are performing very well in Brazil in a very difficult environment. And I think what
we're focused on right now is stepped up execution, making sure we have the right value equation and trying to gain
share in a difficult environment. And that's really what we're focused on right now, so tale of two cities.
<A - Hugh F. Johnston>: Yeah. Happy to jump in on your question regarding A&M, Mark. We're actually up 80 basis
points on A&M year-to-date. So, happy to close the loop with you on how you're calculating the number that you came
up with, but the number is actually up 80 basis points year-to-date. We're not going to get into A&M guidance for the
full year, but given that we're up 80 basis points year-to-date, I'd certainly expect it to be up for the year, and I think
that's a reasonable expectation for you and all the investors to run with as well.

Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Morning, Judy.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: So I have two questions. One is, you know, obviously you guys have been very disciplined on
the capital allocation front, and particularly in the M&A side. And I know that your business is obviously performing
pretty well right now, but how you are assessing that as it relates to maybe even kind of volatile macro environment;
changing consumer environment? And given some of the robust multiples that some of these assets are getting fetched
for, do you have any views on sort of maybe looking at divesting some of your assets in this kind of environment?
And then completely unrelated, so you're bringing back Diet Pepsi with aspartame, so just wanted to get your
perspective on lessons learned, and then as you think about your diet portfolio, the risk of maybe fragmenting the
portfolio even further with different kind of offerings and how you manage that.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: I'm going to talk about the second one, and I can also talk about the first, but I'd like Hugh to
talk about this, because Hugh is my right hand and left hand when it comes to disciplined capital allocation, and so I'd
like Hugh to talk about that.
Let me talk about Diet Pepsi, Judy. You know what's interesting? If you go and poll consumers today and read all the
social media reports, there's still trepidation about aspartame. There's no scientific reason for that, but people are
somehow worried about aspartame. And when we launched Diet Pepsi aspartame-free, it's because there was a huge
consumer need for that product. What we did not anticipate is that there's a group of consumers that absolutely loved
the original Diet Pepsi. And in the cola category, in particular, because it's been optimized over years, people get
incredibly fastidious about their products and don't want to have any changes.
So rather than remove the aspartame-free, which is still loved by a lot of people. In fact, I'll tell you, when we
announced that we're bringing back the old Diet Pepsi, the few people who thought aspartame-free was going away
wrote me some pretty tough emails. And so there is a very loyal group that is thrilled that we have an aspartame-free
following. So we brought back the original Diet Pepsi, in addition to keeping the aspartame-free product, so we could
serve all consumers with the products that they love.
I think that's going to be net positive for us. Now let me just say, the marketplace is fragmenting. Forget Pepsi or Diet
Pepsi or the cola category, any new category that's expanding is becoming more niche, more fragmented, and that's
why it was important for us to own the distribution system because once you have control over the distribution system,
you can pump a lot of niche products through it. All our craft products, all of those are low-volume products. So we

have to learn how to handle complexity, not walk away from it.
So Hugh will talk about the capital allocation in the portfolio.
<A - Hugh F. Johnston>: Yeah, sure. Happy to Judy. And let me just start with a bit of historical perspective on this
because obviously there's lots of activity in terms of people trying to reshape their portfolios right now. Again, as a
reminder, we have about a little over a quarter of our portfolio in nutrition, and then if you add in the Better For You
products, so it's really, it gets upwards to almost half of our portfolio in terms of the balance that we have right now.
We're also from a developing and emerging markets perspective, about a third exposed to developing and emerging
markets.
All of that is the result of transactions that we've executed really over the last decade or even more, whether it's Quaker,
Gatorade, Tropicana, Naked Juice, Wimm-Bill-Dann, Izze, we've executed a variety of transactions over the last
10-plus years in order to get the portfolio into a place where it could consistently deliver performance. And frankly,
that's what you've seen is this portfolio now regardless of economic cycle, regardless of consumer sentiment, regardless
of consumer trends and shifts, seems to be capable and has been capable of delivering good, strong performance
throughout all of those shifts.
As we look at things going forward, what we've said is we intend to expend something on the order of $500 million a
year in tuck-in acquisitions. As those good opportunities emerge, we look at them, and we look at them through two
lenses. One is a strategic lens around does it make sense relative to where we think the consumer is going. And second
is, obviously, a financial lens, is this good for our shareholders? And you can count on us to continue to do that because
we think that's the right way to think about M&A on a go-forward basis.
I will also tell you that we look at everything. We've looked at everything that has transacted and probably every
company that hasn't transacted. And if something transacts and we're not a part of it, you can very reasonably assume
it's because we didn't want to be.
So the result of that is we feel like we're operating from a position of strength. We feel like we're in a position right
now where we'll continue to look at things. We'll do things if they make sense, but the guidance that we've given right
now is the guidance that makes sense and that's the way we're thinking about it going forward. Some investors talk
about the notion of sell when everyone's buying, and buy when everyone's selling. We tend to be good stewards of
capital, and we follow that maxim fairly closely.

Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of CLSA.
<Q - Caroline Levy>: Good morning.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Good morning.
<Q - Caroline Levy>: Good morning, Indra and Hugh. Thank you. Actually just to follow up on what you said, Hugh,
for clarification, I guess Judy's question had been around a willingness to sell anything. And I think you said that when
prices are high you are a potential seller, is that right?
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Only if it makes sense to the portfolio, Caroline. Only if it makes sense to the portfolio.
<Q - Caroline Levy>: Got it. Okay. So then my question was around Diet Pepsi and the Pepsi franchise overall
because, Indra, you gave the stunning number that you drive more growth for retailers than the next five companies,
large companies, combined. In the case of Pepsi and Diet Pepsi, that has not been the case from what I can see. And so
how do you maintain your shelf space? How do you think about strategically moving those in a different direction? Is it
through fragmentation? Or is there something else you need to do? Because that seems to be one area where you're
really losing share?

<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Okay. I think, Caroline, and we talked about it in the Q1 earnings call. It's critically important
that all of you change your frame of reference on the beverage market from cola to CSDs to LRBs. Thirty years ago it
was colas. Twenty-five years ago it was CSDs. Fifteen years ago it was CSDs. It's been LRB for the last decade or so.
And I think the sooner we can shift our frame of reference, the better it is. Because just beating a category that is in
secular decline, just beating that all the time is not a game to play. That's not a game that is going to guarantee good
results.
If we play this rich LRB game, multi-category, placing the bets where the growth is and where the consumer is going, I
think we're better off. So my request to you and to all of you who are tracking the company in this category, expand
your aperture. LRB is the game to play. That's the game we are playing, and we watch LRB share very, very carefully.
That's the right strategy for any company.

Your next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein of Evercore.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Morning, Rob.
<Q - Robert E. Ottenstein>: Good morning, and thank you very much. Could you give us a little bit more sense on the
North American beverage business? It looks like you've got about 2% price mix. Can you give us a little sense to that
how much of that is headline pricing? How much is channel mix, category mix, just so we have a better idea of what's
going on there?
<A - Hugh F. Johnston>: Yeah, a couple of things on that, Rob. This is Hugh. Number one, there was more pricing in
CSDs than there was in non-carbs. Not a surprise on that. Number two, about half and half split between rate and mix,
so very comfortable from that perspective. Obviously, our single strategy has been working particularly well, and it's
giving us what we think is sustainable mix with benefit with lots of runway left to go on it. So really the pricing
environment right now is very good, it's very healthy, we feel terrific about where pricing is in North America.
Indra K. Nooyi
So thank you all for your questions. And in closing, I just want to say to you that we are pleased with our results for the
first half of the year. We believe we have the plans in place to deliver our targets for 2016. We appreciate the trust
you've placed in us with your investment. We're absolutely committed to increasing the value of your investment.
