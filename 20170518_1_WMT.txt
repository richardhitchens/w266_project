Thank you for calling in for the replay for the Walmart's fiscal year 2018 First Quarter Earnings Release Conference
Call, which originally took place on May 18, 2017 at 9:15 AM Eastern Time.
Greetings and welcome to Walmart's Fiscal Year 2018 First Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all
participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator
Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to Mr. Steve
Schmitt, Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Schmitt. You may now begin.
Steve Schmitt
Thanks, Manny. Good morning. And welcome to Walmart's Investor Relations Call to discuss our first quarter
earnings. This is Steve Schmitt and I'm joined today by Pauline Mohler, Kary Brunner, [ph] Michael Brigance (0:55)

and Miguel Garcia from the IR team.
I'm going to make a few brief opening comments in a moment and then we'll open up the call for Q&A. There will be
forward-looking statements on today's call, which are subject to future events and uncertainties. Actual results could
differ materially from these statements and please review the full Safe Harbor statements accompanying our earnings
materials.
Now I'm sure you've seen our earnings materials from early this morning, but I want to give you a few highlights. First,
we're encouraged with our start to the year. EPS was $1 in the first quarter, 2% increase over last year. U.S. comp sales
growth was 1.4%, including 1.5% traffic growth, which makes 3% traffic growth on a two-year comp basis.
Our U.S. e-commerce had extraordinary growth in sales and GMV, up 63% and 69% respectively including
acquisitions. The majority of this growth was organic through our Walmart.com business. So, for the U.S. business,
we're pleased with both store traffic and GMV performing well.
Sam's Club reported comp sales growth of 1.6%, which was also traffic led and International continued to post solid
results keeping in mind the later Easter and lapping Leap Day from last year negatively impacted year-over-year
comparisons. From second quarter guidance standpoint, we expect EPS of $1 to $1.08. This excludes an expected gain
of approximately $0.05 from the sale of Suburbia, the company's apparel format in Mexico, and we expect U.S. comp
sales growth between 1.5% and 2%.
Now before we get to Q&A, just a couple of reminders. We have – I want to – so everyone know that registration
closes today for our Annual Shareholders' Meeting, which will be June 2 here in Arkansas. We'll release our second
quarter earnings on August the 17 and our Investment Community Meeting will be held here in Arkansas October 9
and 10, so please mark your calendars accordingly.
And at this point, we'll be happy to take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is
from Oliver Chen of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.
<Q - Oliver Chen>: Hi. Thank you and great results. Regarding your results and momentum, was there an opportunity
to consider raising the full-year guidance or how should we think about how the full year may proceed in the context of
the environment you're seeing? Are you still seeing a fair bit of volatility in terms of the traffic situation? And then, just
a modeling question on average ticket, will that be a slight headwind throughout the year or is that an aberration given
some of the dynamics around the shift? And on the gross margin line, the – is flattish kind of a run rate we should think
about? Thank you.
<A - Steve Schmitt>: That's quite a few. I guess, maybe first off, on the full year outlook. We're pleased with our start
to the year. We've given guidance for second quarter and on a full year basis, that's something we'll update at a later
date, so we're not in a position to talk about full year guidance today, but we're certainly pleased with our start to the
year.
I think on a traffic standpoint, you mentioned traffic next. Look, 3% traffic on a two-year comp basis is something
we're really proud of, and I think that's 4% on a three-year stack. So we're really going from strength to strength for
traffic in our stores. And it's nice to complement that with really healthy e-commerce sales and GMV growth.
From a gross margin perspective, it's really not something that we guide to. All of our assumptions around both
operating profit and gross margin are included in our guidance for the second quarter that was issued. I would point you
to our earnings materials and the presentation that explains a little bit about our gross margin for the quarter.

<A - Kary Brunner>: And I think you asked about average ticket, Oliver.
<Q - Oliver Chen>: Okay, thanks. Yes.
<A - Kary Brunner>: Average ticket, we'll see how it goes. Clearly, where we saw deflation be less of a headwind this
quarter, but we'll see how the next quarters flow through.
<A - Steve Schmitt>: Thanks. Manny, next question please.
<Q - Oliver Chen>: Okay.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Karen Short of Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Karen Short>: Hi. Just a couple of things. Wondering, can you maybe just provide some color on the U.S. comp
and how it trended throughout the quarter, because it seems fair to say that it accelerated, and that the momentum
continued into 2Q, based on your 2Q guidance? But I guess – so just clarify that, and then the strength is kind of there
in the second quarter. And then, is there anything you'd call out as it relates to drivers of the acceleration, or was it
more or less delayed tax refunds?
<A - Steve Schmitt>: Sure. We typically don't comment about intra-quarter trends, but we did mention, if you may
recall on our fourth quarter call, that we'd gotten off to a slower start than expected to the quarter, due in part to the
delayed tax refunds – federal tax refund checks. So we did see sales strengthen throughout the quarter, and all of what
we've seen in the business and our plans are incorporated in our guidance in the second quarter, which would be 1.5%
to 2%. And Kary, did you have anything else?
<A - Kary Brunner>: No, I think that's correct. We did have a strong Easter, and both in food and general
merchandise, so we're pretty encouraged by that.
<Q - Karen Short>: Okay. And just to clarify one thing on the comp then. I guess in grocery, the comp was low-single
digit in the first quarter, which is unchanged from the fourth quarter. But in the fourth quarter, as you know and pointed
out, you had the 90 basis point headwind from deflation. So I guess, is it fair to assume that kind of the deflation
headwind went away in the fourth quarter, but it was basically replaced by price investments in the first quarter?
<A - Steve Schmitt>: Well, keep in mind, the deflation number, or lack of deflation for this quarter, excludes our price
investments. And we won't comment even – more on what the pricing investment impact might have been.
<Q - Karen Short>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - Steve Schmitt>: Thanks, Karen. Next question please, Manny.
Operator
The next question is from Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Good morning. Steve, can you tell us or give us some color, why the big acceleration in
online GMV, the 69%? And just to confirm, Jet is in the GMV, but it's not yet in the e-commerce comp?
<A - Steve Schmitt>: Sure. Thanks Simeon, for the question. Good question. So there's a few things that are impacting
the e-commerce growth. So it's certainly an acceleration with 69% GMV growth. If you think about some of the
products, some of the intra-quarter offerings you have, you have the two-day product that we introduced, that was
certainly a catalyst to the growth of Walmart.com. You have recently announced Pickup Discount. You have the
combination of first party and third party SKUs going from 10 million to 50 million from a year ago standpoint. So we
really have quite a few things positively impacting both e-commerce sales and GMV growth.

From a contribution to the comp, Jet would not be included. It's not included until we anniversary that, it would be
excluded from the comp until that point in time. And I think the other point, just to make sure people call it in the
materials, is that the majority of our growth is organic driven through Walmart.com, as opposed to acquisition-driven.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: And can you tell us the pickup in store percentage either this quarter, how it's trending
sequentially, or how it looks year-over-year, because I think people are also looking at the in-store comp, which I don't
know if it's on a sequential basis or on a two-year basis. Looks like it could've slowed, but I'm assuming, if you're
raising your pickup percentage, that's getting moved in – the pickup in store, that's getting moved into your
e-commerce contribution?
<A - Steve Schmitt>: It would be, and so the Pickup Discount that we recently launched, it's still early days and didn't
have a dramatic effect on the first quarter, but it's an initiative that leverages our store base like we think only Walmart
can, and combine our e-commerce and store business to really give the customer what they need. So...
<A - Kary Brunner>: Online grocery has been really strong too.
<A - Steve Schmitt>: Yeah. Online grocery has been [ph] growing too (9:25).
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Steve Schmitt>: Next question please, Manny.
Operator
The next question is from Michael Lasser of UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Can you give us more detail on the
U.S. gross margin in light of the price investment, the mix shift to the online business being able to – how are you able
to keep the gross margins flat?
<A - Kary Brunner>: Yes. Good question, Michael, this is Kary. You're correct, we did continue to invest in price this
quarter, it's falling along our multi-year strategy that we've talked about in past quarters. We did benefit this quarter
from continuing, saving from procuring merchandise, and so that was a COGS benefit to us. And then, I would remind
you that we had some timing related to markdowns, where we had [ph] pulled for (10:18) markdowns forward into Q4,
and so that was the benefit in Q1 for us. E-commerce continues to grow and we're really pleased, obviously, with our
top line results. There is the mix headwinds that we're facing there, and that would include the Jet acquisition, which
doesn't have a comparable amount last year.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: So in light of all those factors, do you think keeping your gross margins flat over time is
sustainable?
<A - Steve Schmitt>: Yes. It's not something we – we're going to specifically guide to, and I think we'll leave it that,
it's all incorporated in our guidance. Certainly, I understand why you're asking the questions, it's just not a detail that
we're going to guide to at this point.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: Understood. Good luck. Thank you.
<A - Steve Schmitt>: Thank you very much. Manny, next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Bob Drbul of Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Robert Drbul>: Hey, Steve, good morning. On the inventory side, given comp inventories in the U.S. were
down, can you just tell us what are the drivers or the initiatives, that continues to be impressive and when you think

about opportunities or focuses that the company is on right now, what else is left and where do you think this can go?
<A - Steve Schmitt>: Yeah. Thanks, Bob for noticing that. It's something the team, I know, is very proud of. Lets our
associates focus more on the customers with less inventory. You'll notice over really more than a year now, some nice
improvements in the comp store inventory and it's really a combination of technology as well as initiatives in store. As
we talk to the operators, we do think there is additional room to improve, maybe not the step change amount that you've
seen year-over-year, but [indiscernible] (12:02) [ph] folks of Greg, Judith and her team (12:04) and they are making
great progress.
<Q - Robert Drbul>: Okay. And I'm – can you call in a little bit about the apparel business, just in terms of how you're
positioning yourself and how that's trending for you?
<A - Kary Brunner>: You know, Bob this is Kary. The apparel business really has been solid for the last number of
quarters. Our Basics business is really the foundation, and that continues to perform well. We did have some headwinds
this quarter with a delay in tax refund check impacting apparel and weather didn't help in some degree over the quarter.
But, overall, we're really pleased with the Basics business and we like the value that we're providing with the quality,
[ph] just at the (12:51) quality we have in apparel.
<Q - Robert Drbul>: Great. Thank you very much.
<A - Steve Schmitt>: Thanks, Bob. Manny next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Budd Bugatch of Raymond James. Please go ahead.
<Q - Beryl Bugatch>: Good morning and congratulations on the quarter. Just, I wonder if you could give us outside of
the U.S. some additional color on e-commerce globally. I know you've got still lot of moving parts, particularly with
the Yihaodian in China, but maybe you could give us some feeling of how we can look at the penetration and think
about that for modeling?
<A - Steve Schmitt>: Yeah, Budd. Thanks for the question and I appreciate you noticing the Yihaodian piece. Hope
you paid attention to Brett's comments in his script on how that's going to [ph] end up (13:30) drive a sales headwind
for – as that business winds – that first party business winds down. I'd say the biggest piece that I'll mention from a
global e-commerce standpoint is that we continue to partner with JD in China, and we continue to have new offerings
that service the consumer faster and with the new products. That's probably the highlight of the International
e-commerce. Miguel, is there anything else you can highlight?
<A - Miguel Garcia>: No. And I think just and as a reminder, Budd, I mean, our – we obviously have a pretty mature
business in the UK already with online grocery and everything, which is – continues to do well. But just [ph] premature
for the growth returns to see how it's going to be, (14:04) where they are and that you're seeing obviously in the U.S.,
but we're still pleased with the initiatives we have in the other International markets.
<Q - Beryl Bugatch>: And – thank you. And just, and on the e-commerce in the U.S., can you talk about how many of
the transactions and what percentage maybe also impacting in-store. I know the new Pickup Discount is new, but what
are you seeing between customers doing online only and [indiscernible] (14:30) online and store business?
<A - Steve Schmitt>: Yeah, we will not give you any specific numbers around that, but our in-store e-commerce
transactions continue to grow. We're nearly doubled the amount of stores that offer the online grocery service. You've
seen some initiatives and how we continue to give customers new options around pickup at store. And that's part of our
strategy. We think we can make magic [ph] not (14:54) bringing the online and the store business together, and we like
the progress that we've seen but we don't break that out specifically, Budd.
<Q - Beryl Bugatch>: Okay. And last for me is, Scan & Go was in two locations for Walmart U.S. that Doug talked
about in the last call and we saw on a couple of our visits. Can you talk about what you're seeing in that or what might

Operator
The next question is from Robby Ohmes of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Robert Ohmes>: Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. Steve, I was wondering, hopefully you'll maybe
comment on the confidence in U.S. same-store sales accelerating in the second quarter against the tougher comparison.
Is it – should we be thinking it's e-commerce driven or how should we be thinking about that? The traffic trend was
strong in the first quarter – where does that confidence come in the acceleration against a tougher comparison?
<A - Steve Schmitt>: Well, we certainly have confidence in the range, to put it out there, of 1.5% to 2%. So we're
feeling good about the business. You mentioned the traffic piece of it, which is a pretty healthy indicator of how our
business is performing. Whether or not it's going to be more e-commerce driven or not, it's hard to say. And we're not
going to guide on that specific element. But we're happy with all the things that we're seeing in terms of where the
business is, where our plans are to grow our comp sales 1.5% to 2%, which is an acceleration, and we feel good about
it.
<Q - Robert Ohmes>: And just on the Pickup Discounts on non-store items, I know it didn't – it's real early. But can
you give us a little more color on sort of what the early response has been, and how many stores is it exactly?
<A - Steve Schmitt>: In the Pickup Discount piece?
<Q - Robert Ohmes>: Yeah.
<A - Steve Schmitt>: Well, it would – I guess it's going to be all the Supercenter business stores that we have. And in
terms of specific, just general comments around, we're pleased with what we've seen so far, but really nothing beyond
that. It's still pretty early for us.
<Q - Robert Ohmes>: Great. Thanks so much.
<A - Steve Schmitt>: Thanks, Robby. Manny, next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Edward Kelly of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Yeah. Hi, guys. Good morning. So, obviously, e-commerce sales accelerated. Can you just
talk about, though, what you're seeing sequentially from an operating loss perspective, especially as you eliminated the
membership fee for shipping? And then Doug mentioned in his prepared remarks the need to scale e-commerce to
deliver further results. What if anything is he trying to tell us about losses in this business over time, over the next sort
of like year or two?
<A - Steve Schmitt>: Yeah, in terms of breaking out the losses specifically, it's not something I'll give you a specific
number on. We did talk, if you remember, back to our analyst meeting last fall, that this – that we would be investing in
e-commerce, and we said at that time that it would be the heaviest investment in e-commerce during this fiscal year. So
we're making investments, we're certainly seeing the – some of these investments pickup the growth rate, like you've
seen in this quarter.

But Doug's comments is – scale is a big piece of e-commerce, and we need to scale it faster. It's still, from a U.S. sales
standpoint, it's still relatively small piece of our total U.S. business. So, certainly we need to get some advantages of
scale and we expect that as the business grows.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: All right. And then just a quick follow-up on the price investments. Can you just talk about
the impact price investments have had in the markets where you've taken the action? So how has performance in these
stores been versus markets where you haven't made the investment? And then, where are you in the journey at this
point? Has there been any pause in the rollout? And as we transition to inflation, how does that change the way you
think about executing this, because obviously it gets more difficult to lower prices?
<A - Steve Schmitt>: We always have to weigh all the different environmental factors, inflation being one of them as
you make your pricing investment decisions. But overall, it's a – executing the plan. And it's a continuous execution of
the plan from a pricing standpoint. And beyond that, we're really not going to talk about performance, markets, and
what we're seeing relative to non-price investment markets. So – other than to say, look, we're pleased with what we're
seeing.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Okay, great. Thanks.
<A - Steve Schmitt>: Thank you. Manny, next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Thanks a lot. Good morning. I've got kind of a two-parter on some of the metrics that you
disclosed. Given the growing role of e-commerce, I'm interested in whether we should think about the contribution of
e-commerce to traffic being similar to the contribution of e-commerce to the comp overall? And also, as you think
about comp store inventory, is that inclusive in any way of inventory associated with e-commerce, or is it really just
what's in the stores, however the sales are fulfilled?
<A - Steve Schmitt>: Thanks, Matt. So, I'll take the second part first. So the comp store inventory would just be
inventory in the stores, which we think is the relevant measure to report on. And then – and we also report inventory as
a total too, so we give you both metrics.
The first part of your question, what was the first part, Kary?
<A - Kary Brunner>: E-commerce comp contribution.
<A - Steve Schmitt>: So the e-com – so how much does it impact traffic as well, it should be similar.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Got it. And then just a very quick follow-up. Health & Wellness in the context of a good
quarter overall seemed like it moderated a little bit from the prior quarter, anything in particular happening in that slice
of the business?
<A - Steve Schmitt>: No, not really. We were up against some tougher compares last year, allergy season, cold, cough,
flu season was stronger last year than this year in the OTC business, so pretty consistent business so far on pharmacy.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Got it. Thanks so much, guys.

<Q - Greg Melich>: Hi. Thanks, Steve. I want to follow up a little bit about understanding the margin dynamic in the
guidance. So, if you look at the first quarter, EBIT margins for the company were down 10 bps, I think dollars were
down about a 1%. And if you look at the second quarter guidance, you're guiding for better sales and if I use the
midpoint, I get EBIT margins down 20 to 30 bps and dollars down like 3% or 4%. Is there some shifting in costs or
expenses, or something else going on there as to why that guide implies like higher sales, but weaker margin trends?
<A - Steve Schmitt>: Yeah. I understand your question, and I'd ask the CFO as he quite frankly the – there are always
moving pieces in a quarter. There's a lot of moving pieces in and we've given you our guidance as everything rolls up
and we just don't tend to give all the different pieces of it. So we've just given you through an aggregate, but I
understand the question and there is a lot of moving pieces that go into it.
<Q - Greg Melich>: Yeah. So, okay. So try and at least help put some color on that. Is it fair to say there were moving
pieces that may have helped the first quarter from a margin perspective that you see with some timing might hurt
second quarter?
<A - Steve Schmitt>: Yeah. Sure. Yeah. So I won't talk about the second quarter, but I'll remind you what Kary talks
about and what's in our presentations around the timing of post-holiday markdowns that helped our [ph] gross profit
(22:26).
<Q - Greg Melich>: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then, just to make sure I get the e-commerce side of this right,
e-commerce helped traffic 80 basis points, but then you said organic Walmart.com was a majority of the growth. I just
want to think about it, that if we think about e-comm at 80 bps, then a fair assumption would be, if that was – basket
didn't change that basically Walmart.com was 50 bps of it, and Jet was less than half of the traffic?
<A - Steve Schmitt>: Well, just keep in the mind that the Jet's not in our comp, so Jet won't – Jet's in our overall gross,
but not in the comp.
<Q - Greg Melich>: So when you're reporting the e-commerce traffic boost of 80 bps, that excludes Jet?
<A - Steve Schmitt>: Say that again.
<Q - Greg Melich>: If e-commerce helped traffic 80 basis points and maybe that's a wrong number. But I just – I
thought I...
<A - Steve Schmitt>: Yeah. Jet's not in our sales or comp traffic – comp sales or comp traffic.
<Q - Greg Melich>: [ph] I don't need it. (23:31) So that 80 bps – whatever came out of e-commerce was
Walmart.com's benefit to both comp and traffic?
<A - Kary Brunner>: Yeah. So, think about things like two-day shipping, obviously benefited the Q1 online grocery,
anything that's worth initiated is – and is not acquisition related, is included in the 80 basis points, but as Steve
mentioned, Jet or any of the follow-up acquisitions are not included in that 80 basis point contribution to the comp.
<Q - Greg Melich>: Got it. All right. Thanks a lot.
<A - Kary Brunner>: 63% growth in sales.
<Q - Greg Melich>: Got it. Thank you.
<A - Steve Schmitt>: Thank you. Manny, next question please.

The next question is from Dan Binder of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - Daniel Thomas Binder>: Thank you. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more detail around the
third-party or marketplace business, the size of that, I know you are moving the SKUs up materially, but as you look at

that in the overall percentage of the e-commerce business, what does that look like? And then can you just remind us of
the accounting for that on the P&L like, assuming you're getting fee income on those transactions, where is that
showing up?
<A - Steve Schmitt>: Yeah. So, Dan, we don't break out the SKUs, but certainly the marketplace business has been
growing and a big part of the SKU growth that you've seen, again, going from $10 million to $50 million in the last
year. So, well, we don't break out the specifics of that. And from an accounting standpoint, it's a commission-based
model, so you [ph] cannot use – so (25:08) I don't know if there is anything more to do add on that.
<Q - Daniel Thomas Binder>: But is that fee income showing up in – is it showing up in gross margin, is it showing
up in sales, where does it show up?
<A - Steve Schmitt>: In sales.
<Q - Daniel Thomas Binder>: In sales. Okay. And then my second question was around Brazil, there was no – last
quarter, that was included in the comp store sales table for international, just curious why it was excluded and what's
going on in that market?
<A - Steve Schmitt>: Yeah. Nothing really, this is smaller business internationally and we just made the decision not
to break it out going forward.
<Q - Daniel Thomas Binder>: Okay. And then if I could just fit one more in, on the comp impact that you excluded or
you've given us the comps for the different markets internationally, including the impact of the later Easter and leap
year comparison. Can you just give us a rough estimate of what that impact look like when you consider those two
things?
<A - Steve Schmitt>: We haven't broken that out, I don't think it materials, but – so, no more details on that
[indiscernible] (26:10) for the quarter.
<Q - Daniel Thomas Binder>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - Steve Schmitt>: Thanks, Dan. Manny, next question please.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Peter Benedict of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Hi, guys. A question on the pickup discount. Is the way we should think about this from your
perspective that – is it the price of discount you are giving to incent the consumer to picking up in the store basically is
offset by the delivery savings that you are getting from not shipping it to the home, is that kind of a – so maybe a
margin neutral thing that might incent maybe more sales, is that kind of the way to think about it?
<A - Steve Schmitt>: Yeah. I think, look, the idea is we know that our stores are located within 10 miles and 90% of
the population and it's convenient for a lot of customers to [ph] combine (26:57) and pick up their online order while
they are in the area or while they are combining it with the different super center shop. And so, it makes sense for the
customer. In terms of the discounts, I won't break out who owns what piece of it, but certainly, as this business scales,
transportation costs become more efficient and it will be, what we think is a better economic model over time for us
and the consumer.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Now it sounds like it. And then just a clarification, Steve, if I can. The fiscal 2017 guidance,
I know you guys don't update that until after the second quarter. In terms of the Suburbia sale though, I assume that
wasn't in the initial guide, and I know that the $0.05 is not in the 2Q outlook that you've got, which makes sense. But
the couple – I think there's a couple of pennies of operating headwind in the back half of the year. Is that – again, it's
not a big number, but just to clarify, that was not incorporated in the initial guide you guys gave, is that right?

<A - Steve Schmitt>: This gain – I mean, it was -it's hard to tell when the transaction will close and this is the $n0.05
that we're excluding from our second quarter. But I'm not going to comment any further on full year, what's in there,
what's – [ph] we'll (27:58) take that later on in the year. But it's the $n0.05, our guidance excludes that for the second
quarter.

Yeah. The next question is from Joseph Feldman of Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead.
<Q - Joseph Isaac Feldman>: Yeah. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So I wanted to follow up, for the
pick-up at store, both at the Walmart business and the Sam's Club, whether it's on – any of the online pickups, I guess,
what kind of add-on sales are you seeing and any kind of extra lift you can share about that?
<A - Steve Schmitt>: From a pick-up customer to whether or not they come in and buy something else, I don't have
that to quantify for you, Joseph, I just don't.
<Q - Joseph Isaac Feldman>: Okay. And then I wanted to go back some – I know you've been asked a couple of
times now about the e-commerce, with the GMV 69% and the total up 63%. If you excluded Jet from that number, like
just the total e-commerce, how much would the organic Walmart be up like 40%, 50% or?
<A - Steve Schmitt>: We didn't give that specific number, it's the majority.
<Q - Joseph Isaac Feldman>: Wow, that's great. Okay. Thanks. That does it for me for now. Thanks.
<A - Steve Schmitt>: Thanks. Manny, next question please.

The next question is from Kate McShane, Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kate McShane>: Hi, thanks for taking my question. There have been several articles this week about the more
aggressive entry of European competitors in the grocery space and further price competition. Just wondered your take
on this, how you are navigating and what we can expect going forward.
<A - Steve Schmitt>: Certainly, have a lot of respect for the hard discounters. We've got experience competing against
the hard discounters in a couple of international markets and certainly, in the U.S., certainly with Aldi. So a lot of
respect for what they do. We like our strategy and we'll continue to do what we do best, give great assortment to our
customers, give them great prices, low-cost baskets of goods, and give them more ways to shop, whether it's online, in
our stores, combination of both. But we are certainly aware, paying a lot of attention, have a lot of respect, but we like
our strategy.
<Q - Kate McShane>: Okay. And if I can just follow up with an unrelated question, again strategic. With regards to
acquisitions, obviously Jet was a big one. I think there, again, has been a lot of speculation of what you could buy or
what's being contemplated. Could you remind us on how you're thinking about M&A, and where you're prioritizing
some of your thoughts around acquisitions?
<A - Steve Schmitt>: Sure. So if you think about some of the smaller acquisitions we've made over the last, call it six
months, what they are really designed to do is, is improve our assortment, bring category expertise that we can leverage
across all of our e-commerce business, and we're doing that. So, it's certainly leveraging the expertise within the

No? So that's how we're doing.

Thank you. The next question is from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Paul Trussell>: Hey. Good morning. The e-commerce growth was very impressive, I'll add my congrats on that,
but it does imply the in-store comps being a little bit slower. Just wondering if you can perhaps address that a little bit.
And then separately, just speak a little bit about how we should think about your ability to leverage expenses going
forward.
<A - Steve Schmitt>: Sure. Thanks, Paul. First off, with store comps, which I think is the first part of your question, I
guess I'd – what I'd point you to is really healthy traffic in our stores. To have the e-commerce growth that we've had,
and to have the traffic growth in our stores of 1.5%, on top of 1.5%, is something we feel really good about, to have
this one-two punch going of both e-commerce and strength in our stores. How that progresses, we'll just have to see. I
think we've talked a couple of times about the U.S. comp of 1.5% to 2% in the second quarter. So we expect continued
healthy growth to continue. In regards to leverage, it's a company initiative to look at all of our expenses to manage, as
effectively as we can, of course, growing sales is a part of that equation, and we'll continue to do that.
<Q - Paul Trussell>: Thank you.
<A - Steve Schmitt>: Thanks, Paul. Manny, next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Hey, guys. I just wanted to clarify with the last answer, and then I will get to my questions.
You said traffic at 1.5%, but I thought we also said that about 80 basis points of that was actually e-commerce, so
traffic would be about 70 bps, is that right?
<A - Steve Schmitt>: Yeah. Just keep in mind, the store traffic is calculated on transactions and the e-commerce
transactions that touch the store.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Okay. So, then another clarification, the 3P business has grown real fast, that goes to your
comp [ph] to these? (33:33)
<A - Steve Schmitt>: That's right.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Do you know what – of the 80 basis points, how much is 3P?
<A - Steve Schmitt>: We haven't broken that out, Scott.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Okay. And then, to follow up on Paul's question, just trying to understand if your – it looks
like your stores are running 50 to 100 bps of positive comp in the last year or two, year. And obviously, we've seen a
lot of wage growth, not your bump, but just on the low-end side, expenses are growing really rapidly. I mean, how do
we grow EBIT U.S. if store comps stay where they are and e-commerce continues to grow?
<A - Steve Schmitt>: Yeah. I think it just gets on looking at all of our expenses and, in some cases, we utilize
technology to change the roles that our associates have. Examples of that are moving people to online grocery
initiatives like that and putting more self-checkouts in, so you have just different ways of changing how we work and

<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: And on the procurement savings, and this is my last one, what are you guys actually doing,
and how long can it last? And then, thank you.
<A - Kary Brunner>: Yeah. Scott, this is Kary. We're doing a better job working with our suppliers to get the best
cost. And so, you saw us, over the last year or so, work on aligning our terms and allowances with our supplier base,
and that has been a benefit and now we're partnering together with suppliers to grow together. As Steve mentioned, we
have really solid growth in our stores, good traffic and I think that's appealing to our suppliers.

Thank you. The next question is from Zack Fadem of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
<Q - Zachary Fadem>: Hey, good morning, guys. Just a follow-up on some of the smaller e-commerce deals in the
home and apparel categories and I know it's a small part of what you're doing, but as you think about building out your
e-commerce portfolio, are there any other specific categories that you believe you are underpenetrated online and
would be looking to expand either organically or via M&A?
<A - Steve Schmitt>: Yeah. I'll just talk about what we've done, which is, in the companies that we bought again, it
does expand, our assortment improves, our category expertise, but we won't talk about any particular areas or
acquisitions that may be in the future or not.
<Q - Zachary Fadem>: Okay. And then on all the [indiscernible] (36:07) to follow up there, how do you think about
the role of the hard discounters in the U.S. retail landscape and how that compares to the UK? And then when you think
about how you compete with them over there, what have you learned from Asda that you think can translate over to the
U.S. business as this competition heats up?
<A - Steve Schmitt>: Again, I'll just say, we certainly have a lot of respect for what they do and we do have
experience competing against them in other markets, and [ph] that'll (36:35) certainly factor into what our strategies are
here.
<A - Kary Brunner>: Yeah. And the only thing I'd add to that is, you've seen us do a lot work in the U.S. to provide a
better value proposition for our customers, investing in price. We're looking at becoming more efficient in our stores.
We're offering a better assortment, better quality. our private brand offering has [ph] – that's up a lot. We're on trim
(37:01) with organics and healthy foods and healthy life-styles and our activewear in apparel. So, our business strategy,
I think [ph] it sit's (37:12) up quite well.
<Q - Zachary Fadem>: And briefly on your private brand, you mentioned that what's that the penetration today as a
percent of your U.S. sales?
<A - Kary Brunner>: We don't disclose that, but it is growing in penetration.
<Q - Zachary Fadem>: Got it.

<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: Hey, guys. Scot Ciccarelli. With deflationary pressures on the food side finally starting to ease,
can you guys help quantify for us what you're expecting for inflation and deflation in 2Q and the balance of the year?
<A - Steve Schmitt>: Thanks. Thanks, Scot. We're not going to give a forecast on what we think inflation or deflation
is. I'd point you back to what we've said, I think, last quarter, which is we expected deflation to abate in the second half.
So it's clearly been ahead of our expectations. But we'll report it as we go, we're not going to get into the business of
trying to forecast that.
<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: Okay. And then just a clarification if I could, Steve. Just looking for a definition here, when you
guys say or use the word majority, does that mean closer to 90% or is that – could that mean something like 51%?
<A - Steve Schmitt>: Yeah. Good question. I think we would [ph] use a different descriptor and find a majority
through 90%, (38:27) but it's the majority of our business, and it's not 51% either.

Thank you. The next question is from David Schick of Consumer Edge Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - David A. Schick>: Hi, good morning. On the general merch, you talked about the business getting better as the
quarter progressed. I was wondering if you could talk any more detail about apparel, in particular, your private brands
and how those are doing online as well?
<A - Kary Brunner>: Sure, David. It's Gary. Yeah. General merchandise [indiscernible] (39:01) beginning. Clearly, as
we mentioned last quarter, the delay in tax refund checks created a bucket to get out of, but we – the quarter
strengthened as it went on, it still ended negative overall. From an apparel business perspective, I mentioned earlier that
our basics business really continues to perform well and candidly, that's the – the majority of our business is basics, so
jeans, socks, underwear, T-shirts, just everyday essentials that customers need. And that business continues to perform
well. But as you look at brands, we're focused on quality. Our private brands have really strengthened and then price
points are important. And so, we think that we're making good, solid progress there and we'll look to continue to build
upon that in the quarters to come.
<Q - David A. Schick>: And how are your private label apparel brands doing online?
<A - Kary Brunner>: Clearly, the store is the biggest business, but that's our business we want to grow online as well.

<Q - Edward J. Yruma>: Hey, thanks for taking my questions. I guess first, in the Sam's commentary, you guys
called out higher shrink, was that tied to greater use of technology and self check-out? And then, I guess, second,
obviously, you guys discontinued ShippingPass, was that a material contributor to the membership income and how do
we think about that going forward? Thanks.
<A - Steve Schmitt>: Ed, can you ask the second question again? I want to make sure I [ph] understand... (40:44)
<Q - Edward J. Yruma>: Sure. This is the – on the membership income line, and then I guess, was ShippingPass ever
a component of that and was that a significant number kind of when you had the program?
