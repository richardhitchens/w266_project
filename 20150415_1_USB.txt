Please hold. Everything is clear.
Richard K. Davis
Thank you very much.
Sean O'Connor
Thank you. Richard and Kathy will be referencing the slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the
slide presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at
usbank.com.
I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and
uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on page two of
today's presentation, in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC.
I will now turn the call over to Richard.
Richard K. Davis
Thank you, Sean, and good morning, everyone. It's great to be here and to talk about U.S. Bancorp. I want to begin our
review with the results on a summary of the quarterly highlights on page three of the presentation.
U.S. Bank reported net income of $1.4 billion for the first quarter of 2015 or $0.76 per diluted common share, a 4.1%
increase year-over-year. Total average loans grew 5.1% year-over-year and 0.8% linked quarter, excluding the impact
of a reclassification of certain municipal loans to securities at the end of the fourth quarter.
In addition, we continue to experience strong loan growth in total average deposits, strong growth in total average
deposits of 8.1% over prior year and 1.1% linked quarter. The strongest first quarter deposit growth we've seen in
several years.
Credit quality remains strong. Total net charge-offs decreased by 18.2% from the prior year and declined 9.4% from
the prior quarter. Total non-performing assets declined compared to both the prior year – quarter and on a
linked-quarter basis.
We continued to generate significant capital this quarter. Our common tier 1 capital ratio estimated for the Basel III
standardized approach as if fully implemented, was 9.2% at March 31. We repurchased 12 million shares of common
stock during the first quarter, which along with our dividend, resulted in a 70% return of earnings to our shareholders in
the first quarter.
Slide four provides you with a five-quarter history of our performance metrics, and they continue to be among the best
in the industry. Return on average assets in the first quarter was 1.44%. And return on average common equity was
14.1%. Moving over to the graph on the right, you can see that this quarter's net interest margin was 3.08%. Kathy will
discuss the margin in more detail in just a few minutes.
Our efficiency ratio for the first quarter was 54.3%, equal to the prior quarter. We expect this ratio to decline and
remain in the low-50%s going forward as we continue to manage expenses in relation to revenue trends while
continuing to invest in and grow our businesses.
Turning to slide five. The company reported total net revenue in the first quarter of $4.9 billion, a 1.9% increase from
the prior year. The increase was due to the higher net interest income as well as higher revenue in most fee businesses,

partially offset by a lower loan fees due to the previously discussed wind-down of checking account advance.
Average loan and deposit growth is summarized on slide six. Average total loans outstanding increased by $12 billion
or 5.1% year-over-year and 0.8% linked quarter, excluding the impact of a reclassification of certain municipal loans to
securities at the end of the fourth quarter. Average total loans grew by 0.6% linked quarter on a reported basis.
Again this quarter, the increase in average loans outstanding was led by strong growth in average total commercial
loans, which grew by 15.1% year-over-year and 2.4% over the prior quarter. Residential real estate loans were
relatively flat year-over-year and declined modestly on a linked quarter basis. Average credit card loans increased 2.4%
year-over-year and were seasonally lower on a linked quarter basis. Total other retail loans grew 3.5% year-over-year
and 0.4% over the prior quarter, mainly driven by steady growth in auto loans.
We continue to originate and renew loans and lines for our customers. New originations, excluding mortgage
production plus new and renewed commitments, totaled approximately $38 billion in the first quarter. Total average
revolving commercial and commercial real estate commitments continue to grow at a fast pace, increasing
year-over-year by 11.7% and 1.9% on a linked quarter basis. Line utilization was relatively flat in the first quarter.
Total average deposits increased almost $21 billion or 8.1% over the same quarter of last year and 1.1% over the
previous quarter. Excluding the Charter One acquisition, the growth rate remains strong at 6.4% on a year-over-year
basis. Growth in low-cost interest checking, money market and savings deposits was particularly strong on a
year-over-year basis.
Turning to slide seven and credit quality, total net charge-offs declined 9.4% on a linked quarter basis and 18.2% on a
year-over-year basis. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding was 0.46% in the first quarter.
Non-performing assets decreased by 6.2% on a linked quarter basis and 15.2% from the first quarter of last year.
During the first quarter we released $15 million of reserves, $5 million less than the fourth quarter of 2014 and $20
million less than the first quarter of 2014. Given the mix and quality of our portfolio, we currently expect the total
non-performing assets to remain relatively stable in the second quarter of 2015. While we expect the level of net
charge-offs to increase modestly in the second quarter, mainly due to lower expected recoveries.
Kathy will now give you a few more details about our first quarter results.
Kathy Ashcraft Rogers
Thanks, Richard. I'll turn you to slide eight. This gives you a view of our first quarter 2015 results versus comparable
time periods. Our diluted EPS of $0.76 was 4.1% higher than the first quarter of 2014 and 3.8% lower than the prior
quarter.
The key drivers of the company's first quarter earnings are summarized on slide nine. The $34 million or 2.4% increase
in income year-over-year was principally due to an increase in total net revenue, driven by increases in net interest
income and fee-based revenue and a decline in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by an increase in
non-interest expense.
Net interest income was up 1.7% year-over-year, as an increase in average earning assets was partially offset by a
lower net interest margin, including lower loan fees. Approximately $50 million of the reduction in loan fees was due
to the previously discussed wind-down of our checking account advance, our short-term small dollar deposit advance
product.
The $34.6 million increase in average-earning assets year-over-year included growth in average total loans, as well as
planned increases in the securities portfolio. Also at the end of the first quarter, approximately $3 billion of student
loans were transferred from the loan portfolio to loans held for sale.
The net interest margin of 3.08% was 27 basis points lower than the first quarter of 2014. This was primarily due to the
growth in the investment portfolio at lower average rates, as well as lower reinvestment rates on investment securities,

lower loan fees and lower rates on new loans and a change in loan portfolio mix, which is partially offset by lower
funding costs.
Non-interest income increased $46 million or 2.2% year-over-year, due to higher revenue in most fee businesses. We
saw growth in retail payments, trust and investment management fees, deposit service charges, treasury management
fees, investment product fees, mortgage banking and other income, which was driven by higher equity investment
gains.
Merchant processing revenue, while relatively flat on a year-over-year basis, was negatively impacted by foreign
currency rate changes. Excluding this impact, merchant processing fees grew approximately 5.5% on a year-over-year
basis.
Non-interest expense increased year-over-year by $121 million or 4.8%. The increase is primarily the result of higher
compensation and benefits expense and higher other expense. The increase in compensation expense is primarily the
result of the impact of merit increases, acquisitions, higher staffing for risk and compliance activities, and the variable
cost related to higher mortgage production volumes. Increased benefits expense is due to higher pension cost of about
$25 million for the quarter.
Other expense is higher primarily due to mortgage servicing-related activities. On a linked quarter basis, net income
was lower by $57 million or 3.8%, mainly due to lower net interest income and seasonally lower fee-based revenue,
partially offset by a decrease in non-interest expense.
Net interest income was lower due to the impact of two fewer days in the quarter and a lower net interest margin. The
net interest margin of 3.08% was 6 basis points lower than the fourth quarter. The 6-basis point decline includes
approximately 2 basis points related to the unusually high interest recoveries in the fourth quarter which, as you recall,
we discussed at the earnings call in January. Higher interest recoveries continued in the first quarter benefiting net
interest income by approximately 1 basis point. The remaining decline in net interest income was principally due to
growth in lower rate investment securities and lower reinvestment rates, lower rates on new loans and a change in the
loan portfolio mix, along with the impact of higher cash balances at the Federal Reserve as a result of continued deposit
growth which, as Richard mentioned, was exceptionally strong in the first quarter.
On a linked quarter basis, non-interest income was lower by $216 million or 9.1%. This variance was principally due to
seasonally lower fee revenue and the fourth quarter 2014 Nuveen gain. On a linked quarter basis, non-interest expense
decreased by $139 million or 5.0%. The decrease was due to seasonally lower costs related to investments in tax
advantage projects, the impact of the notable fourth quarter 2014 charitable contribution and legal accruals, and lower
marketing and business development expenses.
Professional services also declined due to seasonally lower spend in many of our businesses. Partially offsetting these
reductions were higher compensation and benefits expense due to increased pension costs, seasonally higher payroll
taxes and increases in variable compensation related to higher mortgage volumes.
Turning now to slide 10, our capital position is strong. Our common equity tier 1 capital ratio, estimated using the
Basel III standardized approach as if fully implemented at March 31, was 9.2%. At 9.2%, we are well above the 7%
Basel III minimum requirement.
Our tangible book value per share rose to $16.50 at March 31, representing a 10.1% increase over the same quarter of
last year and a 3.4% increase over the prior quarter. Our return on tangible common equity was 19% for the first
quarter.
In March, we received the results of the 2015 comprehensive capital assessment and review, or the CCAR, including
the Federal Reserve's non-objection to our capital plan. Subsequently, we announced our new five-quarter buyback
authorization totaling approximately $3 billion, effective April 1, and our intention to recommend to our board of
directors a 4.1% increase in our common stock dividend beginning with the second quarter dividend payable in July.
I will now turn the call back to Richard.

Richard K. Davis
Thanks, Kathy. Turning to slide 12, you'll see the cover of our 2014 annual report and its theme, The Power of
Potential. At U.S. Bank, we stand at the intersection of people and potential each and every day. And we're privileged
to serve as a catalyst for all of our customers whether consumer, small business, wholesale or institutional to assist
them by providing the financial tools and resources they need to achieve their full potential. This positions us well for
growth as our customers seek a strong banking partner to help them as they pursue their goals.
Next week, we'll be holding our annual shareholder meeting in Louisville, Kentucky. I look forward to telling our
shareholders how proud I am of what we've accomplished and of the 67,000 remarkable and engaged employees that
have contributed to our success. We remain focused on producing consistent, predictable and repeatable financial
results for the benefit of our shareholders.
That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Kathy, Bill and I would now be happy to answer your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom of RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Jon G. Arfstrom>: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Good morning, Kathy.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Jon.
<A - Sean O'Connor>: Good morning.
<A - Kathy Ashcraft Rogers>: Hey. Good morning, Jon.
<Q - Jon G. Arfstrom>: Richard, may be start with this. Just your view on the state of the economy. You talked a little
bit about your position for growth when the economy gains momentum. Curious, are you still as optimistic as you've
been in previous quarters? Do you feel like the economy is gaining momentum and then maybe update us on your loan
growth outlook?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yes. I will. Thanks, Jon. I remain very optimistic for the economy and for the great citizens
of America; a little less optimistic for the bankers until the interest rates start to move up. So if you think about it,
consumer confidence continues to move up and particularly small business. Even corporate confidence continues to
move up, but part of that confidence is found in their ability to operate more effectively during their day with more
money in the bank, more of a reserve in their minds that they've got a backstop of equity in their homes and the belief
that right now they don't need to be indebted. So for bankers that might not be as positive as it is for consumers and for
businesses, but it does reveal itself as people husbanding cash may feel a little bit better about their situation than they
did a few years ago.
As rates start to move up I'm still convinced of two things. One will be that when there is a real sense that it's about to
happen there will be a tsunami effect particularly on the corporate and wholesale side of people wanting to lock down
loan rates before they finally get stuck having missed that opportunity. And I think consumers will move from those
who have heretofore been saving looking for some money, now they'll start making some real money in their savings
accounts and their endowments and their long-term trusts. And I do expect people to start using their lines of credit
again, feeling the strength of an economy and a higher wage that will come with it.
So I'm super optimistic about how things are moving. They are slow but steady but they continue to move forward, but
I do think until rates move up it continues to impinge the ability for banks to be particularly as financially successful as
they will be when things get better.

As it relates to loan growth, we were at 0.8% this year if you adjust for the little bit of noise and that's outside of our
normal range of 1% to 1.5% on a linked quarter basis, which is about a 5% to 6% annualized number. We're looking to
get back into that 1% to 1.5% in quarter two as we look into this 15 days into the second quarter.
I'm also hopeful that as the year ages, we'll see those increases a little higher to the ranges we are used to at the 1.5% to
2%. So I'm still going to stick with our hope that we can get in the 6% range for our loan growth on a year-over-year
basis by year's end, but for now the 0.8% for me is a little disappointing, because I really want to stay in that 1% to
1.5% range. But for you as an investor make it certain that we're not going to stretch on any kind of credit quality in
order to accomplish those numbers until which time it's more natural and the customers that we serve have a need for
their loans. So I'm quite optimistic and yet a little bit hesitant until rates start to move.
<Q - Jon G. Arfstrom>: Okay. Good. That's helpful. And then just maybe a quick one for Bill. I know it's a small
number but the incremental provision in energy, can you maybe just give us an update of what you did and what your
expectations are, and maybe size the exposure for us?
<A - P. W. Parker>: Sure. So our energy loans are about 1.3% of our total loans and the part of that portfolio that's
most directly impacted by the lower oil price is, is the E&P portfolio. It's roughly two-thirds of that. We have now run
through that entire book with the new pricing deck reflecting the much lower forecast, obviously on oil. And we have
adjusted the ratings accordingly on that book. And we did take an incremental reserve at the end of the year. We've
adjusted that now that we accomplish this on loan-by-loan basis, it all adds up to something that's really not that
material in terms of our $4 billion-plus loan reserve, but it's all baked in now and we've done all the analysis and we
update that pricing deck at least two times a year, so if we need to do it again, we will.
<Q - Jon G. Arfstrom>: Good. That's helpful. Thank you.
<A - P. W. Parker>: Yeah.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Thanks, Jon.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hi, Betsy.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: Hi. Good morning. How are you doing? A couple of questions. One is just on investing in your
people in an environment where rates are low and the loan growth is solid, but not accelerating too much. I'm just
asking the question with regard to how you're considering allocating resources to drive top-line growth, and is there
opportunity to pull back maybe on some of the non-client-facing related areas to be able to put more feet on the street?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Right on. First of all, I wish, but no, we're not going to be able to slow down our incremental
adds for first, second and third line of defense, as we call it, for compliance and audit. That's just a new world and even
if I thought we had everything right, I'd still keep everyone there to double-check, triple-check that we are still doing
things well. So that has been the only place we've increased our FTE since I told you I think many times last year that
in the middle of February of 2014, so that's now 14 months ago, we asked the employees, but for those in the
compliance areas to stay at their FTE level for all intents and purposes and to manage at a higher expected performance
per person.
So that's not a hiring freeze, because there's a lot of turnover and when people, if you have 964 FTE in your group, you
can still have 964, but it does encourage you to manage the bottom performers out more swiftly and to increase the
quality of the 964 people that work for you, and that's where we are, Betsy. I'm not going to do reduction in force.
We've hung on here for eight years and done quite well. Our engagement, I believe to be at the highest level it's ever
been, and I believe if the employees are deeply engaged, they'll perform remarkably well for customers and
shareholders will get the benefit. So I don't want to mess with that formula, but I am asking everyone here to work
harder, I'm working harder, and we're asking everyone to appreciate the fact that protecting all of our current positions

by performance is really the way to manage through these difficult times.
So that's the backdrop. You'll see that our operating leverage was, as you know, negative for quarter one, both on a
linked quarter and year-over-year basis. And as we put the plan together, we, as I said, always seek positive operating
leverage, and our plan for 2015 is for the year to be slightly positive. I will say, however, that hinged on the original
expectation that interest rates would start moving up at midyear, and based on our stress test and the prevailing view of
economists a couple months ago, if that doesn't happen in June, then it's going to put some stress on our ability to be
positively operating leverage.
I will tell you this, though, in almost any circumstance, quarter one at 54.3% operating leverage will be our highest
quarter, or in this case, our least attractive quarter of the four. And I think you'll see that as the quarters age, we'll get
smarter and better at managing our expenses as revenue starts to move up. But if anything else, I'd just close by saying
I'm on a lagged basis, so I've got to see revenue move up sustainably and consistently for long enough before we start
to increase any expenses. In the meantime, we'll deliver with the same people working as hard as they do to deliver a
little bit more each time and we'll manage the quality of our FTE to the highest level at this point where I think we're
still an attractive employer and we can get some really good people from different places to accompany those who are
here.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: And so if there is a push out in the rate hike, you counter that with more productive employees?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah, I do. And again, being very clear is, that could put a pressure on our full-year positive
operating leverage. It can make it slightly negative instead of slightly positive because we were counting on that. But
it's not enough of a difference, and it doesn't change, I don't think, you're all's trust in the way we manage the company
to cause me to want to start laying people off or doing something more draconian, because it's not an if, it's a when for
interest rates and when that happens, I'll be very glad we have the quality of people we have ready to jump on whatever
opportunities come along.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: Sure. Okay. And then separately, you did have a change in the management of the payments
business recently.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: We did.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: And I did want to understand if there is any change in direction of the organization that we can
expect?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: So let me turn that over to our new Chief Operating Officer. Andy is going to give you an
update there.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Hi Betsy.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Good morning, Betsy. No, there is no change in our strategy. We have a good place in terms
of market share and capabilities and our platform and merchant expansion outside of the U.S. All those things are going
well and we continue in that focus. Our card issuing is doing also very well. We're growing in regard to the activity.
Our branch activity is also increasing and finally our corporate card is doing well. So I don't see any change in
direction. Corporate card was impacted this quarter by a lower fuel price, which impacts our fleet business, and that
was one of the big anchors this quarter in terms of our year-over-year growth.
And the other phenomenon that we did see this quarter was corporate spend on payables is down, which again probably
reflects to what Richard spoke to which is just a general, careful attitude in terms of large companies and payables for
corporate spend was perhaps 1% up, where in a normal period it'd be up 5% to 6%.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: I'll just add too, Pam Joseph is staying all the way through June 30, so she and Shailesh
Kotwal will have, gosh, almost four months of overlap, which we're going to take every day of, because you know
Pam's done a remarkable job. Shailesh was attractive to us in a number of ways, not the least of which is his

international experience and we will continue to follow as Pam started this march across the pond to increase the
exposure we have in the European markets and eventually looking at other places of the world for our merchant
acquiring, but he's going to be a perfect transition and the two of them have already established, I think, a great rapport
to carry on for the second quarter and we'll make sure you all get a chance to meet him in future meetings, because I
think, you'll want to hear him directly and get a chance to understand his thoughts.

Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hey, John.
<Q - John Pancari>: Good morning.
<A - Kathy Ashcraft Rogers>: John.
<Q - John Pancari>: Just want to ask a little bit more around loan growth, just want to see if you can give us a little bit
more color on trends in the first quarter, particularly around commercial real estate, as I know it was particularly weak
in the quarter, and what may have impacted that. And then secondarily, how do you get back to that 1% to 1.5% range
that you indicated for next quarter? Is it just the snapback in something that was abnormally weak this quarter? Thanks.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah. Thanks, John. I'll start and I'll let Andy add some color. First of all, one of the ways
out of the 0.8% into the 1% to 1.5% is getting out of quarter one. So look how we've done already, we're in April. It's
part of it. We're seasonally affected company particularly with such a heavy Midwest influence which includes some of
the weather. So that helps a lot, that's part of it.
Commercial real estate was actually pretty strong for us. So I'm not sure what numbers you were looking at, but I will
give you the trend in commercial real estate is very consistent. We call it the smile, but it's East and the West Coast and
Texas, and that's where most of the activity for growth is coming for at least our customers. The development activity
per se is in the bigger cities West Coast, Seattle, San Francisco, LA, Orange County and then you've got Miami, Boston
and New York.
So in the places you would expected and a couple years ago on this call, John, I indicated that we had done a study of
total on housing availability once that when people moved out of their parents' basements and when the housing stock
of foreclosures came back into the normal course and there were a couple of markets that we actually stayed away from
for a while, thinking that they might be overbuilt. We're not seeing that right now. It seems that things are settling. The
economy has been slower to recover. People have been thoughtful about building in the right places so I'm not
concerned about that as I was a couple of years ago.
And then finally, construction lending is highest for apartments, office space and some lodging properties, which
continue to find their way to pop up all across the country as people start traveling again. So for me, I think commercial
real estate continue to be a strong point for us. Our quality is remarkably high because we only deal with the very large
national customers for the most part and we're going to stick to that approach as it's served us well.
And then I'll just close by saying loan growth continues to be really strong in commercial and wholesale which you've
seen before, the 15.1% year-over-year growth. Our commitments are even higher so that bodes well for once and when
people start using those commitments that will start to have a nice increase and any time that happens that's going to be
a twofer because we'll start talking future quarters about loan growth being remarkably higher than anything in the last
few years and part of it will just be line usage. So those of us who are collecting customers with lines that they're not
using are still doing a good job of developing a future core of outstandings once and when people draw on them.

So Andy, why don't you bring some color around [indiscernible] (27:33)?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: So to your point commercial, wholesale, real estate all very strong. Commercial corporate
up 15%, real estate up 6% year-over-year. The area that is not growing as rapidly is our real estate, residential real
estate, which is relatively flat and what's going to drive that growth is going to be our home equity increases. We do see
increases in the pipeline and line of credit, home equity line of credit and in residential real estate and I think as you go
throughout the year we'll see an increase in that category which will help the overall loan growth numbers.
<Q - John Pancari>: Okay. I guess I was looking at the commercial real estate GAAP line item on the consolidated
balance sheet going from 42.8 to 42.4. That was primarily what I was calling out in terms of it appeared to pull back a
little bit.
<A - Kathy Ashcraft Rogers>: That might be – John, that might be – are you looking at the end of period versus the
average growth?
<Q - John Pancari>: Yes.
<A - Kathy Ashcraft Rogers>: Yeah. And I think that at any given day you might have a little bit of fluctuations in
with pay downs and new loans coming on. So we really focus on average loan growth.
<Q - John Pancari>: Okay.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Let's give it up for John though. John got the longest pause we've ever had. We are never
stuck. So John, congratulations. You win something for that.
<Q - John Pancari>: I figured I would let it sit just to see.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: It felt like forever. Transcripts will read a few minute pause.
<Q - John Pancari>: Right. Adds a little suspense to the call, you know.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: There you go.
<Q - John Pancari>: Okay. And then lastly, just back to energy. I know it's a small piece of your book, but just want
to clarify something. Did you quantify the size of the reserve or size of the provision that you took? And then what's the
size of your energy reserve as of today as a percentage of loans?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Yeah, we haven't disclosed that. I mean, as I said, I mean, the total loan book's about $3.3
billion and about 60% of that is the E&P portfolio, which is the area most directly impacted.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Exploration and production.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Yeah, exploration and production. So all re-rated. It's – the impact is in the numbers but, no,
we haven't disclosed the actual dollar amount.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: It's not material, John, but it's certainly sufficient for the regulators.

<A - Kathy Ashcraft Rogers>: Hi, Scott.
<Q - Scott Siefers>: Just had a question on the margin and just sort of future directions there. I think all the big
pressure seems pretty much behind you with kind of a cessation of the deposit advance product and then you're pretty
much all set with liquidity build for LCR. So at this point I imagine it's just normal spread compression, maybe to the
tune of 3 basis points or 4 basis points a quarter. Is that a fair way to think about margin erosion as we stay in this kind
of sustained low rate environment?
<A - Kathy Ashcraft Rogers>: Yeah, Scott. I'll take that. Here is what I would say, as we look out into quarter two, I
think you're absolutely right that we will continue to see a margin erosion related to the mix of our growth. So we're
more heavily weighted right now on wholesale versus retail. So I would expect that to come down 2 basis points to 3
basis points.
We also as we think about our investment portfolio, while we're done with the build, we still have a run off in that
portfolio of about $2 billion a month, which is now coming on at lower rates. So the reinvestment aspect of that is also
worth a couple of basis points. And then as we talked about earlier, our deposits are really strong. And while that is
positive from a net interest income standpoint, I do think that that potentially has the possibility of having a negative
impact on our margin as we look out into the next quarter of 1 basis point or so.
<Q - Scott Siefers>: Okay. So maybe somewhere in mid, sort of mid-single digits per quarter kind of a compression
range?
<A - Kathy Ashcraft Rogers>: Yes.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: That's about right. And you know, I mean, this – we are seeing something a little new
because we didn't expect it. With rates keep staying flat as long as they have, you actually do have this reinvestment
risk. I mean stuff we put on anywhere in the last seven years, some of that much less than seven-year tenures coming
due and it's coming in lower than it was before. So when rates move up just so many things start to get better and things
that were about to be tough stopped being tough. And never mind when rates move up we have this wonderful benefit
from some of the trust businesses that we have where we've been paying out to, what's the word, Andy? The waivers?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Waivers.
<A - Kathy Ashcraft Rogers>: Right.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: To protect against that. So it's just so many things that will start to improve. But I would say
there is another basis point of two of added risk with rates staying low longer on this reinvestment that we haven't
talked about in addition to the mix. So Scott, it's – but it's exactly what we've telegraphed before.
<Q - Scott Siefers>: Yeah, okay. All right. That sounds good. Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Good morning.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Good morning. My question is probably top of mind for most investors in that it seems like
some of the assumptions even from three months ago on rates for most banks on normalizing interest rates have been
pushed out. And we're sort of at the level of provision and charge-offs or even if you stay pristine you could have
volatility in any one quarter. I guess the question here, Richard is what is your view in terms of the timing of when
normalized rates could converge relative to normalized credit, knowing that it's the normalized credit that's likely under
your control or that you have a better viewpoint on?

Page 11 of 19
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah, I get it and I agree with everything you said. Investors do want to know. We all do. I'll
tell you, we use the prevailing view of the general economic forecast, which I think we all agreed, particularly a few
months ago, where, starting in June one of four interest rate increases, June, July, September, December, and I think
we're now getting a telegraph that this could start later and is more like September and less frequent, maybe two times
instead of four. What's most important is it starts at all.
I've got to tell you that is way more important than the number of times that it occurs, and I think that starting point, as
I referenced a few minutes ago, will begin a bit of a tsunami effect of people extending and taking uses of credit and
taking credit lines and locking down the interest rates. So for me there will be a little bit of blip. If you remember Cash
for Clunkers, maybe the same sort of thing in the wholesale side.
I will say, though, I've also telegraphed, the way it works for bankers is people will use their deposits first to invest in
their life. Then they'll use the line of credit they have established, whether they have anything outstanding on it, call it a
house or call it a wholesale line of credit. Then they'll extend more credit. So it does have to go through those steps,
like Maslow's hierarchy. So banks have to have deposits, should see deposits flow out and deposits go down, and a lot
of you've been asking us about our stress testing and volatility of deposits running out.
Second, then, lines of credit will go up and then new lines and loans will be formed. So even when it starts, Erika, it'll
take a little bit of time, but once it starts, we can see a better predictability around it, because we haven't been able to
show you guys what we used to do seven, eight years ago, when rates moved we had a pretty high correlation on what
behaviors would occur and what kind of margin impacts it would be.
So for me, I think we're going to say that as the economy gets stronger, we're kind of in that interlude where it's
stronger for everybody else, but banks don't particularly have an important need in the minds of consumers and
businesses. As it starts to – it gets really strong and rates move up because it's strong, we'll start getting a lot of benefit
on the income statement and the balance sheet will start to move from deposits over to loans, and then we'll start to get
a much more predictability, which I think is probably a year away. But I'm of the mind, believe it or not, after all this
torture, I still think rates will move sometime in 2015 and that effect itself will have a pretty stunning impact, and then
we'll all study very quickly what happens on the backside but it will be positive under any circumstances and it'll just
move from one side of the balance sheet to the other, all giving us net interest income, which is what you all want.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: And what about on the credit side? Given sort of the underwriting standards have remained
quite tight and the economy on both corporate and consumer remains healthy, are we – is it a longer path to normalized
charge-offs even though the provisions could be volatile from here?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yes. It's a very long path, like multi-year path. If you think about it, we're at 46 basis points
and we've declared to all of you, from a bottoms-up basis, that over the cycle we thought we'd be at about 95 basis
points. So we're now actually under half of that, and over the cycle, as you know, you never actually hit it, you just pass
through it on your way to either the next recession or the next recovery, but I will tell you, it's many, many years until
we get to that number because it takes that long to get the loans on the books, it takes that long to have them stressed,
unless there is a monumental event, and then it takes a long time for our reserves to be used in order to accommodate
that.
So you'll see interest rates move up probably three to five years before you'll see the kind of credit quality that would
be impacted by what would be some either poor underwriting decisions or aggressive underwriting decisions, either
one we're not going to make, but I think you'll see the credit quality will be better than average for many years and it'll
be the least thing we'll be talking about in the next couple.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Got it. And just one last question. You continue to do well in the CCAR process. Are you
confident that at least for the banks that are not considered SIFIs by the Fed that the CCAR process from here will be
steady state? I'm sure there is going to be the transition to advance, but less stringent or less change for non-SIFIs in the
U.S.?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: So do you mean do I think that the non-SIFIs will get relief from where they are or that they
won't be brought under the structure?

<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Well, not necessarily relief, but more so less incremental negative change in the tests
looking forward.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: I mean, we do believe that there will be a distinction. I mean, I don't know where the line's
going to be on SIFI, non-SIFI. It doesn't matter to us because we are SIFI. We think we are. We will defiantly not be a
G-SIFI, but we'll be a SIFI, and so according to that I think there'll be plenty of regional banks and smaller banks that
will not be brought into that same kind of a routine, which is what we planned for all the way and not something we're
going to see as a disadvantage.
On the other hand, I do think we can play our advantages to not being a G-SIFI as it relates to not only the oversight,
the additional capital requirements and some of the expectations that have been placed on them. So we're going to call
it a sweet spot, and based on our own preparation, we've been working on the SIFI and the CCAR process. It's well
ensconced here. There is no reason to not want to keep it up. And frankly, I sleep better at night knowing that we've
passed all the SIFI tests. And if I were to ever acquire another bank, I would be more attracted to them if they'd gone
through the same rigor because it improves half of my due diligence. So I'm actually a supporter of it and knowing that
we're in it anyway, we're going to make the best of it.

Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hi, Ken.
<A - Kathy Ashcraft Rogers>: Hi, Ken.
<Q - Kenneth Michael Usdin>: Hey, everybody. Good morning. One big picture question, just following up on that
normalization effect. Given that – and the structural changes to the balance sheet given LCR and some of these
intersecting points between that path to growth and rates, do you still see a path that long-term 1.6% to 1.9% ROA is
achievable? And is there anything that has happened over the last couple of years that would prevent the company from
getting back to that point as you look further ahead?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah, I'm quite bullish that that is not a problem. We will get there because the income will
be so much higher. The ROE will forever be lower for all banks based on the requirements that have been placed in this
new world for higher capital, and that's the E part of this equation. But the ROA is really a function of just how much
money we can make and the quality of which we do it and that is – no one's really taken that from us as long as
consumers and businesses need banks and use us. And I have every reason to think that 1.6% to 1.9% range is quite
still reasonable. And I think for our ROE, the 16% to 19%, while we're not there yet, will also find its way through our
normal standards and I also think we'll be at the high end of the peer group. So we're sticking with those numbers.
They're not evidential today, but I think in a year or two, you'll see them again very quickly.
<Q - Kenneth Michael Usdin>: Okay, got you. And then on a short-term question, just on mortgage banking, can you
talk a little bit about the drivers of the really strong gain on sale margins and whether they're sustainable? And then
also, if you have it, just the mix purchase refi in both the volume and the apps?
<A - Kathy Ashcraft Rogers>: Yeah, this is Kathy, why don't I go ahead and start with the just the mix of the volume.
So as you know in quarter four, we were kind of in that purchasers versus refi of kind of 70% purchase, 30% refi. We
did – as rates started coming down – we did see a shift of that into the first quarter probably in that – more closer to the
55%/44%. So we did see a little bit of a pickup on the refi.

As we look out, we still see volumes increasing. We would expect to see seasonal impacts related to second quarter.
People should go out – or probably will be out buying and I would think that we would start to see a little bit of a shift
back to purchase versus refi market. And I think if we think about the rates, as you know, kind of our margins have
been up, on a linked quarter basis, about 10 basis points, year-over-year about 28 basis points. And I would think that
as we look into quarter two, we would expect to see that trend be for slightly increasing margins.

Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald of Sanford Bernstein.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hi, John.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Hi. Good morning, Richard. Question on the CCAR. You've been a leader in payout
and cap returns for the last couple of years. That said, the magnitude of your requested increase in dividends and
buybacks this year was a little less than the Street was expecting and relative to peer increases. Did you look at the
results and kind of feel like, wow, I left some money on the table or we were conservative here, particularly on the
dividend payout? Maybe just some thoughts on what you were thinking as you went through the request and kind of
how you felt when you looked afterwards?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah, that's a really fair question. I had no regrets after I read everybody's, but I did study it
hard, as you would expect we would. Well, let me put it this way and it might just be a philosophy, but until interest
rates start to move again and we have a higher sense of control over the final outcomes that we provide you guys, it
didn't seem reasonable to me and it had nothing to do with the Fed that we should increase our dividend above that
30%, 31% level until which time we had more control.
So you'll never hear on this call that we're going to waive our ability to create outcomes because something else is
changing our future, like interest rates. We have to manage to it, but it does take away our ability to be certain that we
have control over the bottom-line. And this whole discussion today about when interest rates move is torture for us. But
at the same token, I haven't stretched so hard that I have to worry that if something doesn't go like we hope it will, that
the company is now overextended or that I've missed my opportunity to work with the Fed to exceed that 30%.
Another way to say it is, I am prepared to ask the Fed for more than 30% on dividends when I feel that we've got a
control over the profit plan we put together in October. And that like in the old days, it's highly deliverable in the next
year solely based on our execution, not on somebody else's decision on when the rates move. So that's what you're
seeing is a company that's conservative to control its own destiny and not wanting to send signals until we can confirm
it. I would not have asked for more than the 30%, 31%.
And in terms of buybacks that will probably be the other place you'll see us extending ourselves a little further because
we do have control over that. We can shut them off if we need to. And so at the end of the day you probably will see
our buybacks go up a little more than our dividend request but they'll both move up. And I think as soon as we get that
confidence that we have the control of the entire company like we want, you're going to see us be a little more
aggressive. But for now, I'm satisfied with where we are and actually quite pleased with how this has moved out nice
and slow and predictable, repeatable and I think our shareholders at least can count on a steady-state return. And that's
what I promised them.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. Thanks. That's very clear and fair. On that point about the
controllable/non-controllable, you mentioned that you've got the plan for a modest positive operating leverage, but it
could get tough if you don't get the midyear rate hike. So what's the debate that you have there? It sounds like you don't
want to cut too much and cut into muscle. Do you have some kind of break the glass program to use? This is going to
be longer than we thought? Is there room on deposit funding costs or other expenses even though you're already pretty

lean where you can pull and try to get this balance right?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah, I mean that is the dilemma, right, broken glass. And so we've never invited a third
party to come and tell us how to watch our expenses. We've never created a special campaign and named it to tell
people they're going to lose their job and still be good with that. We're not going to do that and I'm not. Maybe it's the
effect of being in this for eight years but what I'd like to do is have gone through this whole recession and not have had
to do that because I just can't describe to you the impact of execution when the employees trust the company and trust
that they're going to be safe. It's just, it's remarkable.
So I'd rather have 67,000 people here who feel really good about their job and the company that has their back through
the tough times, than to have 69,500 who at any time 2,500 wonder if they're going to lose their job and the other
67,000 wonder if they're the next. So I can't explain that very well as a CEO. It's almost worthy of someone trying to
write a book on it. But that's really important to me and this team and to this board.
If you told me interest rates are going to be flat for the next three years or if I believe that to be the case, we do have the
broken glass scenario. It would be a reduction in force. It would be a very aggressive but thoughtful precise reduction
in people and in expenses and things that honestly you would know would impair the near-term and the long-term, but
you'd have to do it to get to the other side.
I'm highly convinced after this eight years of recession that we are going to get interest rates to move again. I do
believe it's worth hanging on. So I'll give you my Richard Davis dorky way of thinking about it. If you remember in
high school the bar hang, the bar hang was the test we all had to take for the President's Fitness Award. The bar hang
was 90 seconds on the bar. And if you remember it at all, the last 10 seconds were a torture, but they were equal to the
exact same value as the first 10 seconds, which were nothing.
And I feel like we're here at the last 10 seconds and this company is going to hang on longer than anybody. And it is
torture but I want to do it for the right reasons because in two years and four years and six years, you guys are all going
to be asking us how we're doing in a positive environment with a great economy. And I want to harken back to times
like this and say we gave up a penny or two on near-term profits in order to be able to say to you here in the future that
we're an amazing company and doing as well in great times as we did in the tough times.
So that is the discussion around the table and I'm holding on for dear life not to do any reduction in force so that we can
have a great future while watching every penny, which you know we've done for years, that we do have expected spend
at this point in time. It's tough.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: All right. Well, keep hanging and thank you.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah, thank you. Good one. I should have had violins in the back too for my dorky story. So
thanks.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Better than pull-ups.

back your earnings? Richard, you just mentioned the bar hang and 67,000 people who will be more productive over the
next five to 10 years because they don't have to worry about a strategy of the day. But in addition to that, what else are
you doing that might hold back earnings now for the benefit of the future?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: That's it. That's it. It's all people. Because I've got all the other expenses quite well aligned.
Our compliance costs are still at the high point but they're not going to go higher because we've managed that and we're
moving through the more mature stages of some of these – a creation of the compliance groups, the audit functions and
even the first line of defense in the lines of business. There is no expenses that we're not watching and haven't and
there's really no other activity but FTE, paying people fairly and compensating them well. So Mike, that's – and
following John's question they're perfect back to back it would be simply sit around the table and say do we cut people
and we simply don't want to do that.
So that's all we're doing is asking them to work harder. Your decision is whether or not we've got enough of a good
culture here that our people will work harder, they'll sustain it and they'll do better than others and then that's good
enough. And otherwise you can challenge the fact that either we should be taken a reduction in force or that I should be
adding a bunch of people and taking the hits from you guys for having really negative operating leverage and I'm not
doing that either. It's kind of right down the middle. So we're not withholding on anything else that would cause us to
be unable to deliver on everything we said we would in tough and especially in good times.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: I guess, I'm stuck on that last 10 seconds of the 92nd bar hang and sometimes especially as you
get older and I'm finding this out it makes sense just to let go.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah. This is funny because last night I told my wife what I was going to say if this came up.
I said I'm probably going to do this stupid bar hang, what do you think? And she smiled and she turned around and she
said and just for the record tell them you actually hung on for two minutes. So the fact is this company can hang on past
the 90 seconds. We can. We're not old. We're actually ready to roll. But it's tough, that was all I was trying to say, not
that we're about to fall off, just that it gets really tough.
And as long as you know that it's the gut that carries you through this stuff and the best companies in our business are
going to be the ones who have the will and the ability and the trust to get through it. I'm just convinced of it. Again the
book I'll never write but it's that nth degree spirit of a company acting like a person that believes anything is possible
and delivering it with a certain level of pride. But I've got nothing more to show you for it.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: All right. Last follow up on this, Richard Davis versus the 10-year bond?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah, yeah, I thought that. I still haven't met it. It's down 25 basis points since we last talked.
It's fallen below 2 basis points, but go ahead, ask your question.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Well no, just the quarterly update. I mean, seems like you're feeling better about the economy,
but we're still waiting for it. Is – what – how – do you feel better than last quarter about the economy, or are we just all
still waiting here?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: John's question at the very beginning is exactly how I feel. I feel better about the economy
than I did 90 days ago. I can see that it's not better for banking in the near-term. It's just that simple. And when rates
move up I'm going to love the economy and I'm going to love the Fed. I'm going to love our future. But right now, I
think the economy is really that strong, record stock market performance, Europe is coming back. We've got customers
depositing cash all over the place. They've got money in their pockets because fuel prices are down. And yet, they don't
need a bank as much as they're going to need us, so we just want to keep them all as happy customers and we'll be there
when they're ready but right now we're probably on the low end of their need to get through the day priorities and for
that it's not correlated. A great strong economy – an improving economy is not necessarily good for banks until rates
start to kick in.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: All right. Thank you.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Thanks, Mike.

Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller of FBR.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hey, Paul.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Yeah. Thank you very much. Hey, can you talk a little bit about – because you've got some of
the best, I think, mobile apps out there and how – and everybody is seeing mobile banking really pick up especially
with the new accounts. How do you see the mobile banking, online banking in your branch system work together?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: I'm going to go first and have Andy jump in. You know why we're really good at mobile
banking is because we're great at mobile payments and I can't tell how much that matters and I actually wouldn't know
it if I had a bank that didn't have this large payments business, I would just – I wouldn't know what I don't know. We
have a thing called the Grove, down in Atlanta where we have our payments group. It's hundreds of people who sit
there and do nothing but work on merchant and consumer paradigms and modules on how to change the way they
move money around and it's a ton of customers. It's a lot of money we spent and by the way I haven't taken that out at
all of our forecast.
But because we have merchants who work with us to create better mobile apps then that transfers backwards to mobile
banking, because mobile banking is just kind of a mini app to people moving the money intra-bank and between them
and merchants. And the merchants are really the smart ones on how to get stuff installed and stuff moved about. So that
is one of the reasons we're so good at it and because we have people in house that are focused on something even
greater than that and I'm kind of excited to showcase that particularly high at our next investor meeting a little over a
year from now. So that's one of the reasons we do well.
In relation to the branch, they therefore are the benefactors of that and Andy you might carry on from that.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: In addition to what Richard said, I would mention that the other key aspect of this is making
sure the branch is working together with the mobile payments and mobile banking side of the equation, so they're
working as one, so the seamless delivery of transactions and products and the ability to buy or sell, looking at it from
the perspective of a customer, and if they start something on mobile, want to finish it at the branch or vice-versa, that
we're all in sync in terms of the process from the customer's perspective.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: And, Paul, I appreciate you bringing it up because most of you guys live on the East Coast
and bank on the East Coast and you actually don't get to experience us. So there is not a branch down the street that I
can send you to or you don't just walk by and see whatever our current collateral is, but if you all want to come online
and take a look at it, it's really, really good stuff and it'd be our pleasure to have you experience us through a more
mobile approach than just perhaps the old brick-and-mortar.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Well, I know we've seen when somebody comes up with a really cool mobile app, it's copied
very quickly. But one of the things that you have that I have not seen anybody else have is the automatic bill pay app. Is
that just because you work with the merchants so close you were able to develop it? Do you think other people will be
able to develop that same product?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: I think it gets back to what Richard talked about, which is our R&D and looking at different
aspects of what we can do on the mobile app and what we can do in a branch and what the people can do at home and
then do at an ATM and trying to make everything as convenient as possible and as a cross-channel as possible as we
can.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Okay, guys. Thank you very much.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Thanks, Paul.

Your next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache of Nomura.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Good morning, Bill.
<Q - Bill Carcache>: Good morning. Thank you. Richard, I had a follow-up on your comments about rate increases
and positive operating leverage. To the extent that the frequency and magnitude of rate increases came in lower than
what the market currently expects, do you have a sense for how much of an increase you would need to see to achieve
operating leverage? Maybe if you could just give us a sense of whether you've kind of run through the math and what
that breakpoint is?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah, I mean, I'm pretty transparent. We expected four increases starting in June – June,
July, September, December, 25 each. If that doesn't happen you can back into our math and do a pretty quick calc, and
if that slows down and moves, say, to September and only one in December, which is now the prevailing view, that will
put pressure on our positive operating leverage. And while I have no idea what the next nine months of this year are
going to be, they will be very, very tough.
We'll be very close to flat or even slightly negative, and that would be where I'd get back around the table, like John
and Mike talked, and sit down with the group and say, is that enough of a reason for us to curry favor with the
investment community try to be positive for one year, which you may or may not remember, in order to do something
draconian or do I take my lumps and have you guys a little disappointed but understand why we had a slight negative
operating leverage to live to fight next year when things will be highly positive.
I'll probably go to the latter, but I promise you we'll always have that conversation and every time there's an adjustment
we'll see the impacts and decide whether or not it's worthy of taking a near-term or a longer-term view.
<Q - Bill Carcache>: Understood. That's very clear. Thank you. If we look at your loan growth – on a separate topic,
on a year-over-year basis to take out seasonality, the growth in residential mortgage in particular has been decelerating
for about nine quarters and turned negative this quarter. And I think we are kind of – by looking at it year-over-year, we
would strip out seasonality. So I'm not sure like some of the comments about weather and stuff would really play a role.
I was hoping maybe you could talk a little bit more specifically about your outlook there and address how you're
thinking about that deceleration and kind of what gives you confidence going forward in the resumption of growth in
that area in particular.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Bill, this is Andy. The principal reason for that decline is our smart refinance product that is
a branch-originated high-quality refinance product that has been shrinking because refinance volumes were coming
down throughout the year as rates were not moving down as rapidly. The pipeline for that right now is a little stronger
because of what we saw in the first quarter, so I think you'll start to see a little bit of an uptick certainly than a down
tick in that category in the future quarters, and then the other wildcard in the overall category is home equity loans, as I
mentioned in the retail category, which we're seeing strong growth and strong pipelines.
<Q - Bill Carcache>: Excellent. Thanks very much. I appreciate it.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah, thanks, Bill.

And your next question is from the line of Nancy Bush of NAB Research.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hi, Nancy.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Good morning. Sorry I came into the call late. Another of your competitors' call ran way
over, but -
<A - Richard K. Davis>: So no matter what you say, I'm going to say we already answered it.

<A - Richard K. Davis>: All right. I knew I'd try.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Yeah, one of your competitors just did a material purchase of CRE loans from GE Capital
and it looks like GE Capital is going to be the gift that keeps on giving. So I'm wondering if you have any appetite for
that or if you're looking in other places for portfolios of loans?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yes, yes and yes. And more than I have in the past because if I can't deploy it in normal
course and I've got deposits, I honestly love and cut it but don't know what to do with, the answer is yes to both. GE is
way too early to know until they get out some RFPs and take a look at what pieces, particularly leasing would be of
interest to us as we look at our big equipment financing business that we have here in the company. And there are other
portfolios that we would be interested in defending. It could be credit card portfolios, it could be high-quality auto
portfolios but it's got to be something that we do already.
It's got to be underwritten, the qualities that we would do ourselves and if we do something of any size, you know we're
going to spend more time in due diligence, it will be a nightmare for whoever it is because we want to due diligence
like we underwrote it ourselves. And if we can't get that level of comfort I'll pass all day long because I really don't
need to introduce anybody else's problems into our otherwise high credit quality but my appetite is definitely higher
based on the lack of alternatives on how to deploy both the deposit growth we have and the capital that we're starting
now to build.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: And given the portfolios that you may be seeing right now, is the pricing attractive? We're
still scratching our heads over that.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: That's a good question. In fact, as we put our student loan portfolio out for sale they're
attractive to us, because there is a market out there that people want to pay a premium it seems for something that we
have less value for. So I do think that it's going to be an expensive proposition if you don't get it the right way and if
you don't due diligence and underwrite it properly for potential risk as we all think the world we have today isn't a good
proxy for how loans will perform.
So I think it's going to be rough – tough to find something you like at the right value and that's why we won't over pay
for it either. And that's one of the reasons we're attracted at this moment to put our portfolio of student loans out for
sale because there seems to be a fairly robust level of interest and premium out there that we'll take, so it may just come
down to the fact that we will look but we won't like the pricing, we'll step away anyway.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Yeah, and just a final note on that. It looks like the deal that Wells Fargo did was
something of a joint venture with Blackstone. I mean are you seeing other private equity pools or whatever out there
that you might want to do some kind of similar transaction with?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah, I don't know their deal but no. We don't like partners. We're not very good partners.
We want to own it, we want control it and you know how with third-party particularly, third-party in every way now in
banking has become an intensely added risk. It's like more than a twofer, so anything we do with a third-party we have
to operate as though we have full control. We have to have information that allows us to have full control and then if
you don't have full control, even if you have all the information it's a whole lot less rewarding when something happens
that you're not absolutely able to predict. So for us, probably not.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Thanks, Nancy. And by the way we had not answered that question so you didn't miss
anything.
