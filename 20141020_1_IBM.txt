Martin J. Schroeter
Thanks, Patricia. We have a lot to cover today: our third quarter performance; actions that accelerate the transformation
of our business, including important announcements that impact our results and the basis of our reporting; our 2014
guidance and what it means as we move into 2015.
Let me start with the top level results. We reported revenue of $22.4 billion, which is down 4% or 2% at constant
currency, excluding our Customer Care divestiture. We delivered operating net income of $3.7 billion and earnings per
share of $3.68, all excluding the discontinued semiconductor manufacturing business.
These results fell short of our expectations, and I'd attribute the shortfall to three primary drivers. First, our software
revenue was weaker than expected. We had some sales execution issues. And in addition, we've made it easier for our
clients to manage their IBM software capacity across new and more traditional workloads as they invest in our platform
for the long term. I'll expand on this later. Second, we didn't get the productivity required in our Services business,
impacting both our profit and margin. And third, the environment, including currency, isn't helping. With a sharp
movement in currency rates in September, there was some effect in the quarter, and we expect it to have a larger impact
going forward. And for the business overall, we did see a slowdown in September, which had a particular impact on us
given the skew of our transactional business.
I'll get into the details of the quarter shortly, but let me first describe the actions we're taking and put them into context.
For some time now, we've been clear about our strategic direction and how we address the market shifts around data,
cloud, and engagement. All of this year, we've been launching initiatives and making significant investments to drive
this shift. We've been very successful, with strong revenue growth in our strategic imperatives. And you'll see in our
third quarter results that the strategic imperatives again delivered double-digit revenue growth. But some of these
fundamental shifts in the industry are happening faster than we planned, so we're putting in place a series of actions to
accelerate our transformation. I want to address these right up front.
First, we're continuing the remix to higher value. We just took a bold step in our transformation, going fabless with the
divestiture of our semiconductor manufacturing business. We have world-class technologists and intellectual property,
but this is a capital intensive business which has been challenging for us without scale. With future node progression
and the potential transition to larger wafer sizes, the capital requirements will substantially increase.
GLOBALFOUNDRIES will acquire our microelectronics business and will become the semiconductor technology
provider for our future systems. This agreement leverages the strength of each company, IBM's semiconductor and
materials science research, development capabilities and leadership in high-end systems, and GLOBALFOUNDRIES'
leadership in advanced technology manufacturing at scale and commitment to delivering future semiconductor
technologies, enabling them to address new business opportunities.
With GLOBALFOUNDRIES operating at scale, we'll get supply at market-based pricing for the long term, and we'll
exit a business that was not only capital intensive but also a drag on our profit. Clearly, this is the right move for our
business for the long term.
Also in January, we announced the sale of our x86 business to Lenovo, and earlier this month we completed the initial
closing. This was a $4 billion business for us in 2013 with effectively no annual profit. With the transaction, IBM and
Lenovo have formed a strategic alliance, which includes an agreement for Lenovo to resell selected IBM storage and
software products. And to insure a smooth transition for our clients, IBM will provide x86 related maintenance on
Lenovo's behalf.

We'll continue to remix our portfolio by investing in higher value areas and making decisions on businesses that no
longer support our high-value strategy.
Second, we are implementing changes that make it easier to consume our capabilities and innovations and increase our
agility. We are creating vertically integrated units to address key growth areas. As we did with Watson earlier this year,
we're creating a dedicated business unit for cloud and other integrated units to address growth areas like security and
Smarter Commerce. This enables more focused investment and improves our integration and speed in bringing
solutions to the market and with our clients.
We're also providing more flexibility to clients in the way they buy our software. Specifically, we're accelerating
investments to make our software more directly consumable through digital channels. So we'll have an end-to-end
digital sales and marketing channel which will improve our reach.
Third, we're taking additional actions to simplify our structure and accelerate productivity. For example, to improve
productivity in services while at the same time providing greater value and innovation to our clients, we're
implementing a number of actions. These include accelerating the use of automation in our data centers and being more
aggressive in our use of global delivery skills and intellectual property across our service lines.
Let me tell you what these actions do for our financial model. In the near term, our revenue will be down, not
surprising since the three divestitures this year represent about $7 billion of revenue with pre-tax losses of about $500
million. So clearly we'll have an improved margin profile. These actions also free up our spend and capital to be
reinvested to areas that will accelerate our transformation, and these allow us to continue to provide very strong returns
to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. All of this is consistent with our strategic direction. And
while there are impacts in the short term, we improve our position for the longer term.
I want to spend a minute on the high-level financial implications of the two most recent transactions. We've posted
additional information in two articles on our Investor portal. For the System x business, as I mentioned, this was over a
$4 billion business for us last year. Though the businesses break even on an annual basis, the transactional skew would
have driven profit in the fourth quarter.
Starting in the fourth quarter this year, we'll no longer have the System x hardware revenue and profit and the related
maintenance will be at a lower revenue and profit level, reflecting the new relationship. At an IBM level, this will result
in about a four point impact to revenue growth over the next four quarters but an improved margin profile. Our fourth
quarter results will include the gain on sale associated with the countries closed net of related transaction and
performance-based costs. This net gain as well as the operational profit we lose in the fourth quarter will be included in
our view of the full year, which I'll talk about later in the call.
Free cash flow will be impacted by two items: accounts payable for the balances at closing as well as the future
procurement IBM will perform on Lenovo's behalf; and for cash tax payments made in 2015. We estimate this will be a
use of cash of approximately $0.5 billion in the fourth quarter and another $0.5 billion in 2015.
Turning to the microelectronics business, the 2013 OEM revenue associated with the divested business was $1.4
billion. And our STG segment included pre-tax losses for this business of over $700 million. This is being reported as a
discontinued operation. In the third quarter, disc-ops will include both losses from the ongoing operations of about $90
million after tax and a one-time after-tax charge of $3.3 billion associated with the transaction. The transaction had no
impact to free cash flow in the third quarter.
Now let me spend a minute on the reporting structure. All of our results obviously start with GAAP, which is in the
middle of the chart. To the left is a reference to our prior definition of operating results, which we introduced a few
years ago to provide a better perspective on the operational performance of our business. This presentation excluded
non-operating retirement-related and acquisition-related items. Operating results is the basis of our 2015 roadmap
objective, and we have provided a view of our results on this basis since 2011. This definition of operating results no
longer exists.

Now moving to the right side of the chart, with the reporting of our microelectronics business as a discontinued
operation, all of the financial impacts of that business are lifted out of each line of our P&L and reported in one line,
loss on discontinued operations net of tax. Starting in the third quarter, our GAAP P&L will be on a continuing
operations basis. We'll make the same non-operating adjustments to determine our operating results. Though our
operating results definition will now be on a continuing operations basis, this is the basis for our third quarter and
year-to-date results, all historical periods presented, and our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year.
So now let me get into the third quarter results. And again, these are all operating results which exclude the
discontinued operations. We delivered $3.7 billion of operating net income on revenue of $22.4 billion. Revenue was
down 4% or 2% at constant currency excluding the divested Customer Care business. On that constant currency basis,
Services was flat, our Software segment declined 2%, and Systems and Technology revenue was down double digit.
Ninety days ago we expected that currency would be a modest help to our revenue growth, but in September we saw a
sharp move in the currency markets. I'll talk more about currencies later.
Our margins were down with weak hardware performance and insufficient productivity in Services. We had a tax
headwind of three points year to year, and we generated $3.7 billion of net income in the quarter. On the bottom line,
we reported operating EPS of $3.68, which is down 10%. Looking at our free cash flow, we generated $2.2 billion,
which is relatively flat year to year.
Turning to revenue by geography, when you look at the year-to-year performance at constant currency, major markets
decelerated two points from last quarter and growth markets one point. These results aren't normalized for the
Customer Care divestiture. Both major and growth markets are impacted by a point of growth, consistent with last
quarter.
As I mentioned earlier, we saw deceleration in September. This is true in nearly all regions and was most pronounced
in our growth markets that have a higher transactional content. Within the growth markets, we again had double-digit
growth in Latin America, led by Brazil, and good growth in the Middle East and Africa region.
I think it's important to understand the impact of the System x divestiture on the geographic results going forward.
Given the geography mix of that business, major markets growth will be impacted by about three points and growth
markets by about nine points. Reporting our divested semiconductor business as a discontinued operation will adjust
the OEM revenue but not impact the geographic results.
Turning to the segment perspective, I'll cover the revenue drivers when we get into the segment discussions.
Looking at the gross profit in total, our operating gross margin was down 90 basis points, driven by margin declines in
Systems and Technology and in both of our Services segments. The six point decline in Systems and Technology was
due to a combination of lower margin across the brands and a mix away from higher margin System z due to the
product cycle.
In Global Technology Services, we did get the savings from the workforce rebalancing actions we took earlier in the
year, and we continued to make investments in capacity and skills. But we didn't get the base productivity we had
planned through automation and the transition on some new contracts took longer than expected.
In Global Business Services, we had strong growth with good margin performance in the strategic imperatives. But in
the more traditional back office implementations, we continue to see price pressure. Our total operating expense and
other income was up 2% year to year. Acquisitions over the last 12 months drove two points of expense growth and
currency drove one point.
The base expense, which is total expense less the impact of acquisitions and currency, was essentially flat. Within our
base expense, we have been shifting our spending to drive our strategic imperatives and differentiated offerings. And
with the actions we're taking, we'll accelerate that shift.
There are a few items that are impacting the year-to-year expense dynamics. First, we increased our accounts
receivable reserves, which impacted expense by over $70 million year to year. This coverage is now at 2.2%, which is
up from a year ago but not as high as 2009 levels. Second, as you would expect, our accrual for 2014 variable

compensation is down relative to where we were at the end of the first half. However, the reduction in the quarter was
not as substantial as last year. And so across cost and expense, this element was up $230 million year to year.
Finally, I want to spend a minute on the impact of currency. The dollar appreciated dramatically in the last several
weeks of the quarter. And as you know, when the dollar appreciates broadly against other currency, it impacts our
revenue and earnings. What is unusual about this is not just the sharp move, but the movements were nearly all in an
unfavorable direction for our business profile.
We hedge a portion of our cross-border cash flows, which as you know defers the impact of the currency movement but
doesn't eliminate it. While our hedges are designed to provide stability around the receipt of cash, there is no
year-to-year benefit in the income statement when a currency's direction is sustained over a longer period. Looking at
the third quarter, we had a modest impact to profit from currency. However, at current spot rates, we would expect a
significant impact to fourth quarter and into 2015.
Now let's turn to the segments, and we'll start with Services. This quarter, combined Services generated $13.7 billion in
revenue, which was flat year to year at constant currency adjusted for the Customer Care divestiture. Services pre-tax
profit was down 13% year to year. Total backlog was $128 billion. Adjusting for the divested business and currency,
total backlog was down 2% year to year. Global Technology Services revenue was $9.2 billion, down 3% as reported
but up 1% at constant currency adjusted for the divestiture.
In the third quarter, we wrapped on the SoftLayer acquisition, and it continues to attract new workloads to the platform.
We're expanding our footprint, and in the third quarter we opened cloud data centers in London and Toronto, as well as
two federal data centers outside of Dallas and Washington, DC. We also added cloud capacity in Singapore.
ETS outsourcing grew 2% at constant currency adjusted for the divestiture. That growth was driven by IT outsourcing
performance from the substantial new contracts we brought on in 2013. ETS pre-tax profit declined 11% in the quarter.
While we continue to benefit from the rebalancing action earlier this year, this was more than offset by the investments
across our portfolio in areas like: new resiliency centers, additional security skills, and the SoftLayer cloud hub
expansion; the lost profit associated with the divested Customer Care business; and we didn't get sufficient productivity
in the base. Part of this is due to the large deals we signed last year, which have lower margins in the early stages, and
we didn't execute those transitions as rapidly as expected.
Global Business Services revenue was $4.5 billion, down 1% at constant currency. Consulting and systems integration
declined 1% year to year and was flat at constant currency. We had strong double-digit growth in our practices that are
highly differentiated in the marketplace, which address cloud, analytics, mobile, and social, offset by declines in the
areas that are becoming less differentiated, such as the more traditional back office implementations.
During our last call, we discussed our strategic partnership with Apple to deliver a new class of enterprise-ready
mobile-first business applications for iOS, combining mobility and analytics. This quarter we will launch the first
dozen applications.
Application outsourcing was down 6% at constant currency, reflecting modest sequential improvement. Our
performance continues to be impacted by pricing pressure and client renegotiations, as well as a reduction in elective
projects.
GBS pre-tax profit was down year to year. Here too we got the benefit from the previous workforce rebalancing
actions, but it was more than offset by a couple of factors, lower revenue on a relatively fixed cost base. And where we
have strong differentiation, such as our solutions that address the strategic imperatives, we get good growth in margin
performance. But in the parts of our portfolio that aren't as well differentiated, we're continuing to see price and profit
pressure. These are the areas where we will be more aggressive on the use of global delivery centers and applying
intellectual property for faster time to value for our clients and improved business results for us.
Software revenue of $5.7 billion was down 2% and middleware was flat. We had solid growth in many of our solution
areas, like security and mobile and cloud. Across our software brands, Software-as-a-Service offerings are up nearly
50%. But overall software results didn't meet our expectations.

First, we clearly had some sales execution issues. And second, given our clients' substantial investment in the IBM
software platform, we've been providing more flexibility on how they deploy our software with economics that enable
their mobile and social workloads on our platforms. This enables them to better manage their capacity and commit to
our platforms for the long term. This will drive higher utilization of our middleware as these mobile and social
platforms drive additional on-premise workload.
Looking in our results by brand, WebSphere had another good quarter, up 7%, led by commerce, mobile solutions, and
business integration offerings. Both on-premise and SaaS offerings contributed to WebSphere growth, with the
majority of growth continuing to come from our on-premise solutions. In commerce, we saw broad-based growth, with
strong momentum in Commerce-as-a-Service, which includes our recent acquisitions such as Silverpop and Aspera.
Across Software and Services, IBM's mobile business more than doubled from the prior year. Information Management
software was down 5%, where we were impacted by our sales execution challenges and some product transitions.
Tivoli revenue was up 3% at constant currency, driven by security and storage software. Security once again grew at a
double-digit rate. Workforce Solutions grew 1%, with growth in our social and collaboration solutions mitigated by a
decline in Notes. Rational Software was down 12%, facing a tough compare.
Across software, we are transitioning our portfolio to capture growth areas, we continue to drive innovation in our core
franchises, and we'll be accelerating investments to make our software more consumable through digital channels.
Systems and Technology revenue of $2.4 billion was down 15%. This reflects the product cycle of System z and
declines in Power, Storage, and System x, but both Power and Storage improved sequentially.
We got a lot done recently, including the initial closing on the sale of our industry-standard server business to Lenovo,
an agreement to divest our semiconductor manufacturing business to GLOBALFOUNDRIES, and the introduction of
our first OpenPOWER-based scale-out system.
Looking at our results by brand, System z revenue was down 35%, now in the ninth quarter of the current product
cycle. We continue to innovate on this platform. And as an example, we've recently made available new analytics
offerings for the mainframe to provide real-time customer insights. With this, IBM adds new analytics capabilities to
the mainframe platform, providing clients with the ability to integrate Hadoop big data.
Power revenue declined 12%, which is a significant sequential improvement in year-to-year performance. We have
repositioned Power. We introduced scale-out systems based on Power8 in June. And earlier this month we announced
high-end Power8-based enterprise systems. These systems are highly scalable and can handle the most data-intensive
mission-critical applications in the industry.
In addition, we saw continued expansion of the OpenPOWER consortium, now with over 60 members. Through the
efforts of consortium members, we have for the first time introduced a system built on IBM's Power8 processor that
tightly integrates IBM and other OpenPOWER member technologies, including NVIDIA's GPU accelerator
technology.
Our System x revenue was down 10%, and this of course was the last quarter before the divestiture. Storage hardware
revenue was down 6%, a sequential improvement from the rate in the prior quarter. We again saw strong contribution
from our FlashSystems and our Storwize portfolio. This was more than offset by weakness in high-end disk and the
continued wind down of our legacy OEM business. We see value in the Storage business shifting to software, and this
quarter our storage software grew. We will continue to expand our software-defined storage portfolio.
So across our Systems and Technology business, we have taken significant actions to reposition our portfolio and
maintain our commitment to driving innovation in our high-end systems and storage. We committed $3 billion of
investment in the next era of chip technology as we strengthen our semiconductor research and development and
systems innovation, with future chip supply coming from an at-scale provider.
We repositioned Power through creation of our own Power8 systems, which are built for cloud and big data, and also
made available the Power8 architecture through the OpenPOWER Consortium to build an open ecosystem and an IP

play. We are repositioning Storage to capture value through software-defined environments, and we divested our
low-end System x business.
Moving on to cash flow in the quarter, we generated $3.2 billion of cash from operations excluding our global
financing receivables. We invested $1 billion in CapEx and we generated $2.2 billion of free cash flow, which was
down $60 million year to year. This includes a $300 million dollar year-to-year increase in cash tax payments.
Through the first three quarters of the year, our net cash from operations, excluding financing receivables of $8.6
billion, was down $700 million year to year. Within that, our cash tax payments were up $1.5 billion year to year. We
invested $2.8 billion in capital expenditures, which was up about $100 million from last year. This includes about a
$350 million investment in software. So this is a good example of where we're shifting spending in the base to new
areas; so free cash flow was $5.8 billion, down $800 million or up $700 million excluding the impact from cash tax.
Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $9.6 billion. Our total assets reflect a
reduction of more than $1.5 billion associated with the semiconductor transaction. This includes a non-cash charge for
fixed assets and an increase in deferred tax assets. Total debt was $45.7 billion, which includes just over $28.5 billion
in support of our Financing business.
We target global Financing leverage to be in the range of 7.0-to-1 to 7.2-to-1, and we do not have plans to change this
model. However, the late quarter impact of foreign exchange on equity was the main driver of the leverage being
slightly elevated at 7.4-to-1 versus our model.
Our non-financing debt was $17.1 billion and our non-financing debt-to-cap was 62%. While the semiconductor
manufacturing divestiture does not affect debt levels, it does impact equity by approximately $3.3 billion, resulting in a
seven point impact to the debt-to-cap ratio. At these levels, we continue to have the financial flexibility to support our
business over the long term.
Before we wrap up, I want to spend a minute on the performance of our strategic imperatives that address the areas of
data, cloud, and the way our clients are engaging. We have a broad analytics portfolio that helps our clients to extract
value from their data. This was a large business for us, with revenues last year of nearly $16 billion. Through
September, our business analytics revenue was up 8% this year, with the strongest growth coming from GBS. Our
cloud portfolio supports the full scope of enterprise client cloud requirements, including solutions for private clouds,
hybrid clouds, and public clouds. Our revenue was up over 50% year to date. Our as-a-service component up over 80%,
and we exited the third quarter with an annual run rate of $3.1 billion.
Addressing engagement on a year-to-date basis, our mobile revenue more than doubled. Our social offerings returned
to growth with double-digit growth in the third quarter; and our Security revenue up over 20%, marking the eighth
consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in Security. Together, the revenue in our strategic imperatives was up
double digits, and about half of the content was in software.
So let me bring all of this back together. As I mentioned earlier in the call, we're driving the shift toward our strategic
imperatives. Earlier this year, we created a Watson unit and committed $1 billion to bring Watson cognitive capabilities
to the enterprise. We launched Bluemix. We are globally expanding our software and cloud data centers, and we
formed a partnership with Apple for enterprise mobility.
Now as we exit the third quarter, we're making it easier to do business with us, including creating vertically integrated
units to address key growth areas and making our software more consumable through digital channels. We're taking
additional actions to drive more productivity and increase the agility of our company. And while we invest the drive to
the growth areas, we're also aggressively moving away from the businesses that don't fit our strategic profile. The sale
of our x86 business and the divestiture of our microelectronics business are the two most recent examples. Earlier this
year, we divested our Customer Care BPO business. And as I mentioned, the revenue from these three businesses was
$7 billion in 2013. And in aggregate, we incurred a pre-tax loss of more than $500 million, all supporting the shift to
higher value.

Let me spend a minute on our view of the full year. As I said earlier, our operating results are moving to a continuing
operations basis, so they exclude the financials associated with the semiconductor business in the current and prior
periods. So when we reflect the discontinued operations in the base, our full-year 2013 operating EPS was $16.64
versus $16.28 based on the prior definition.
Within this new operating definition, we've considered a number of items in our guidance for 2014. First, we've
completed the initial closing of the sale of our System x business. And as we said, we will no longer have the revenue
and profit associated with that business. But in the fourth quarter, we will report a gain on the sale net of related deal
and performance-based cost. That net gain will contribute about $0.75 of earnings per share, but that does not reflect
the lost profit in the fourth quarter. Additionally, as we execute some of our plans to drive simplification and accelerate
productivity in our business, we expect to take a workforce rebalancing charge in the fourth quarter. We're starting to
work through our plans, but at this point we'd expect to take a charge of up to $600 million.
We've also had a dramatic move in currencies, and we've taken into account an impact based on current spot rates.
We'll see how that plays out. And of course, we've considered the rate and pace of business coming out of the third
quarter, including the environment. As I noted, we saw a slowdown in September, and the fourth quarter is our largest
transaction quarter. Put all of this together, and we expect full-year 2014 operating EPS to be down between 2% and
4%, and that's off of last year's comparable base of $16.64.
Given that reduced outlook for earnings, we see a comparable impact to free cash flow for the year. As I mentioned, we
can estimate the x86 divestiture impact at about $0.5 billion in the quarter. And so with that included, we see free cash
flow for the year between $12 billion and $13 billion at this level of income. Of course, this doesn't include the gain
from the divestiture.
Looking forward to 2015, we've always considered a few factors as we look at the progress toward our 2015 objective:
the trajectory of the business, including the macro environment; the investments we need to be successful over the
longer term in enterprise IT; and our return of capital to shareholders. Two of these have now changed, the trajectory of
the business and the timing of investments we need to make. Of course, it remains a priority to return significant value
to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
Given our third quarter performance, the actions we're taking and with only 15 months to the end of 2015, we no longer
expect to deliver $20.00 of operating earnings per share in 2015. As is our practice, we'll provide our view of 2015 in
January. In the meantime, we have a clear and compelling strategy and we're accelerating our implementation. We will
continue to manage our business for the long term, and we will absolutely continue to return significant value to our
shareholders.
Ginni and I look forward to your questions.

Thank you, Martin.
Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to mention a few items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the slide
deck that provide additional information. As Martin mentioned earlier, we've also posted articles to our investor
website that contain additional information on the two transactions discussed today. Second, I'd ask you to refrain from
multi-part questions. And finally, I want to remind you that Ginni Rometty is joining today's Q&A.

Thank you. [Operator instructions] The first question comes from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your
question. Sir, please check your mute button.
<Q - William C. Shope, Jr.>: Sorry, can you hear me now?
Operator
Yes, sir. Go ahead.
<Q - William C. Shope, Jr.>: Okay, great, thanks. I have a bit of a broader question. Obviously, there's a lot of new
info here, so I'm trying to understand or clarify how we should think about the unifying theme here for the short alls
you're seeing. The challenges that really began in 2013 were primarily centered on the growth markets. Can you talk
about how much of your current challenges are still centered on that issue and how much of it is now well beyond just a
geographic problem at this point? I guess related to that, how are you thinking about the potential for stability in growth
markets and what that would do for your turnaround potential in 2015? Thanks.
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: Sure. Thanks, Bill. I guess from a unifying theme perspective, the theme that we have
been talking about since 2013 is both the secular and cyclical challenges we've had in our hardware business, and we
talked about the profit loss year to year last year.
Now relative to the growth markets, that hardware business has an outsized effect because it does represent more of the
business there than what we see in the major markets. So that theme within our current results continues despite the
actions we've taken within the hardware business to reposition that. We are not yet seeing the benefits, all of the
benefits of that repositioning. So as we talked about, we repositioned Power. We have divested of the x Series business.
We will wrap on the z Series cycle, if you will. That's the cyclical element of this. So the ongoing theme of the
hardware business continues, and it does have an outsized impact on the growth markets.
Now relative to the growth markets specifically, the one other point I'd make is that there is not a homogeneity around
the performance of these growth markets. What we saw in the growth markets is a continuation of what I'd call
disparate revenue performance. So Brazil continues to do well. China continues to decline as that hardware business
affects them fairly substantially. India declined in the quarter. What we see in the third quarter was where we have
heavy transactional content, we tended to have a much bigger decline in that September month. So again, the unifying
theme around hardware continues. And specifically within the growth markets, we're seeing the disparity of
performance continue, and September impacted those transactional businesses much more dramatically.
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Thanks, Bill. Can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
The next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.
<Q - Kathryn Huberty>: Thanks, good morning. Beyond what has already been announced, what are the paths to
accelerated transformation going forward? Are there additional asset sales on the table? And also, how likely is it that
we see more transformative acquisitions going forward?
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: I guess I'd say a couple things, Katy. First, we do invest at a high level every year already.
We spend, as you know, about $4 billion in capital. We spend $5.5 billion in research and development, as examples.
And we remain acquisitive. We've had a number of acquisitions this year to solidify, if you will, the core capabilities
we've built around our strategic imperatives.
So when we think about accelerating the shift, think about it from a SoftLayer perspective, for instance. We said earlier
in the year we put about $1.2 billion into capital into software to expand their footprint around the world. Now we're
not going to add over $1 billion to our overall capital bill. We'll probably wind up adding just a few hundred million
year to year. But again, we're shifting that into the software business, and that shift happens over time. And we think

we have a pretty good set of facts around why and how that's working. So you saw again this quarter solid double-digit
growth in our strategic imperatives. So as that shift happens over time, we've been able to shift. Now we're going to
accelerate that, and rebalancing our skills is an element or a means by which we can accelerate that shift.
So yes, we will remain acquisitive. We still believe we have the core capabilities for our view of enterprise IT around
data and cloud and engagement build. And so we'll continue to add capabilities around those, but our core capabilities
are in place. We do invest at a very high level, and so we'll just accelerate the means by which we're shifting.
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Okay, thank you, Katy. Can we please go to the next question?
Operator
The next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein. You may ask your question.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: Yes, thank you. I have a question for Ginni. Ginni, IBM is missing its free cash flow goal
this year by $3 billion to $4 billion, which certainly in investors' eyes is a really significant margin. The announced
actions feel not that different, quite frankly, from what IBM has been doing for the last 10 years, ongoing restructuring,
organizational changes, and select dispositions and the migration to the higher margin businesses.
So I guess my question for you is, do you think this time is different in the sense that – do you view the current results
as effectively a crisis at IBM? And how do you gauge this magnitude of disappointment? And given that, do you
believe that your responses should be outsized and different from what you've done historically? And do you believe
they are because certainly, at the surface, they feel somewhat consistent with what you've done before?
<A - Virginia M. Rometty>: Okay, Toni. Look, let's just back up one second. And first, [ph] let me give you (37:16)
context. As you said, does this time feel different? And so as you and we and I have talked with all our investors, this
time in this industry is different, with these three shifts all going on at once. So it is unprecedented change, which then
leads to your question.
There is no doubt. Look, in this quarter and part of the reason I'm on the call, obviously, we were disappointed in this
quarter. But when we talked about what we're doing for the long term in these actions, these actions go on the heels of
what has been a series of what I think are very bold actions from the entire year with a very clear strategy, one that's
around moving to the enterprise IT to the era of cloud, one that's around data and analytics for transforming our clients'
industries and professions, and then social-mobile; and I can't underscore enough, security.
So when you step back and look at the full year when we've said these will reorder our industry, and therefore we've
got to reinvent ourself like we've done in prior generations, but it will be around these things. And just go back to
January, Watson, a $1 billion investment to start the group. As Martin just talked about, $1.2 billion to extend our data
centers, $25 billion to $40 billion for cloud. Then $1 billion for Bluemix. It is a platform, a platform-as-a-service that
will provide a platform for innovation for many years to come. Not to mention the Power8 having been redone,
developed bottom-up for data and cloud, then $3 billion of research and development for semiconductors that secure
our long-term future.
Not to mention what we did with Apple, with SAP, which are really a fundamental change in partnering strategy that
not only apply to Apple and SAP, they really point to us being the go-to enterprise that people come to on how to
change and how to enter into the enterprise business. Along with having divested, as you just heard, as you well know,
$7 billion of revenue, which by the way, was at a loss, $500 million loss; so empty calories, as some of my investors
would say, and then the reprofiling of the STG business.
So on the heels of those bold actions, these are three more that continue, and I consider them quite bold. The idea of
cloud all together, integrated verticals, and then not to underestimate this point about speed. And what we are doing, in
fact I want to really punctuate this point on speed. These divestitures do give us an opportunity to go ahead and
simplify the business and remove layers. Make no mistake; that's important because the strategy is correct and now it is
our speed of execution that needs to continue to improve.

<A - Patricia Murphy>: Thank you. Can we please go to the next question?
Operator
The next question comes from Benjamin Reitzes with Barclays. You may ask your question.
<Q - Benjamin Reitzes>: Yeah. Thanks a lot. Quick question I guess for both of you. I wanted to talk about earnings
power. I'm an old free cash flow guy; call me antiquated. But the free cash flow has been averaging let's call it between
$12.00 and $14.00 per share the last two years. Your guidance now is about $12.40 per share if I take the midpoint.
And you're still reporting EPS and guiding for EPS that's $16.00-plus. And we've just had obviously a major setback
here.
And usually, when we're dealing with IBM, we have a roadmap and all those things to guide us. But in my training,
free cash flow, EPS usually migrates towards free cash flow. So it seems like you have a lot of increased investments
and whatnot that are going to keep free cash flow low for some time. So I guess I wanted your view of earnings power.
And could we see flat to down EPS for several years now as these two numbers meet in the middle, or is the EPS set to
have growth from the $16.00 level despite free cash flow being significantly below? Thanks a lot.
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: Sure, Ben. Thanks for the question, a couple of points. First, from a free cash flow
standpoint and your data that you just quoted, I won't rehash it. But with a cash tax headwind this year, which we've
talked about in the past, that's obviously an impact. And the way the Lenovo transaction is structured has a free cash
flow impact not only in the fourth quarter of this year, but that will carry through a little bit to next year as well.
In terms of capital investment requirements and what we need going forward, as I mentioned on Katy's question, we'll
grow capital where we see opportunity, and the SoftLayer example is a good one. But in total, I would expect our
capital requirements to be fairly flat to up a little bit. They won't change dramatically going forward. And so once we
get through some of these impacts, if you will, some of these headwinds on the cash line, I think we'll have a
relationship that is more like what you're used to from us.
Now there are some other impacts that will affect, if you will, the ratios as opposed to the free cash flow alone. So as an
example, you noted the earnings number on an earnings per share. Now that has obviously the gain from the Lenovo
transaction in it, but that goes into the investing section of free cash flow. It doesn't go into the free cash flow area. So
there are some other impacts or some other dynamics around free cash flow in the near term that are going to impact
those ratios.
The balance sheet itself, when we look at the balance sheet itself, it looks as though it's tracking. Once you make some
of these – once you recognize some of the adjustments that have to be made, the balance sheet itself is continuing to
track to the profitability, and we would expect that to continue as well.
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Thanks, Ben. Christine, can we please take the next question?

The next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel, Nicolaus. You may ask your question.
<Q - David M. Grossman>: Thank you. Martin, I can appreciate the comments you were making earlier about the
hardware business and the impact that it's had on earnings and cash flow. However, you obviously have two very big
important businesses beyond that. Both Services and Software. And I guess specifically in Software, you had a pretty
easy comparison this year. And I'm wondering if you could just better help us understand exactly what the issues are in
Software and what you mean by making software more consumable through digital channels and how that's going to
impact the business?
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: Sure, David, a couple things on Software. First, when we say more consumable through
digital channels, when we look at how the world is evolving in terms of how our clients will try, will then buy, a lot of

that's moving into a model where they essentially have it through like what we have with our Bluemix store, our store,
if you will, our platform that allows them to try and get access to Bluemix. So if you haven't looked at our Bluemix
content yet, I would encourage you to get a sense of what we mean by moving to a more digital engagement.
On Software, specifically on performance, we did see, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we did see a slowdown
in September, and that was true in Software as well. And obviously, the Software performance has a pretty profound
impact on our profit given the margin. Within Software, when we looked at our performance, you saw that our
WebSphere business continued to grow. It did reasonably well. Our SaaS business, our Software-as-a-Service business
across all of Software continued to do well. Where we had a bit of a struggle was in our IM business, our Information
Management business. Some of that's due to product transitions. And some of it, as we said on the call, is the way we're
providing flexibility around our clients as they engage in these enterprise license agreements, as they engage to try to
manage their capacity requirements.
So again, the Software performance impacted certainly in September, but not uniformly. We did have pretty good
growth, as I mentioned in WebSphere and some challenges in the IM business, but a disappointing – as we said, a
disappointing quarter for us in software.
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Okay, thank you, David. Can we please go to the next question?

The next question comes from Steve Milunovich with UBS. You may ask your question.
<Q - Steven M. Milunovich>: Thank you. Ginni, thanks for joining us today, a question for you. I believe you recently
took some of your executives out to the Valley. And I know when I go out, I generally come back pretty depressed.
They all argue, of course, they're going to disrupt the large companies; that the large companies basically have to break
up. There's an inevitability to the difficulties that companies like IBM face. I'm just curious what you took away from
that, if you feel better or worse about IBM's ability to come back. And conversely, our survey suggests a lot of
customers do want IBM to help them to move forward, but I think investors are concerned that you won't get a lot of
these new companies who do start out with a different kind of infrastructure. I wondered if you could comment on that.
<A - Virginia M. Rometty>: Okay, that's a great question, Steve, from a couple different perspectives. First, I've been
out there many times actually, so not even just one. And if you take a look at our SoftLayer business, and I think this is
actually an important point, as we have moved not only Watson but SoftLayer itself to be a platform for innovation for
many companies. And so what we are finding is that many are very interested in SoftLayer, and SoftLayer runs some of
the most interesting startup companies that there are. So on one hand, it's about providing them with infrastructure, but
then BlueMix and its platform-as-a-service, and any idea that Watson as a platform which, as you know, is a very
different approach we've taken. Already, 3,000 of those partners are in line to get onto Watson, many of those from the
West Coast. So that's one set of messages I pick up that pertain from what I would call the startups.
But to your other question, I think as well and equally interesting to our current client base, I was with 30 CIOs of our
biggest clients just at the tail end of last week. And to me, it was very interesting to hear them talk about what they
really need and are going to need even more of our help from. And it was a role that one of them called being a
navigator; that there are many of these startups out there. And that's interesting for innovation, and I agree. Every
company will do some innovation, and many of these are cloud companies and the like. But at the end of the day, this
gets integrated with how their businesses operate today. And you can see this now peaking into a point to say hey, look,
you're the ones that understand how an enterprise operates and how we should pull all of this together. This is a
wonderful opportunity for us, and it really matches.
And I believe we have placed the right bet when we said in cloud, one of the most important attributes would be hybrid.
And that's this idea of all of us will build businesses part on the cloud. In fact, you'll see most of that around things that
need to move fast. And then you'll have your systems of record. You'll need to integrate them. That's the word hybrid.
And we're seeing that play out; that's what people are looking for. And that's, as you know, where we doubled down in

creating a lot of capabilities around hybrid in the cloud, about data. We said at the end of the day, it's going to be all
about data and it's going to be about security. And I believe sure enough, all three of those are coming to pass.

The next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang with J.P. Morgan. You may ask your question.
<Q - Tien-tsin Huang>: Great, thanks very much for taking my question. I hope you can hear me. I just wanted to ask
a big-picture question on people, labor and culture and things like that. I heard words like workforce rebalancing. It
sounds like you're shifting more to global delivery, more automation in sales and processes. What does this all mean for
head count? Could we see a big change in head count? And more importantly, what's the impact on culture? Thanks.
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: Thanks, Tien-tsin. It's a good question, so a few things. We have been reducing head
count just as a function of some of the divestitures that we've been in. So as an example, when we divested our
Customer Care business, our headcounts come down. And when we finished the x Series divestiture, again, same kind
of pattern, so our overall head count is obviously down.
From a culture perspective around the shift to global delivery centers, quite frankly, we have not been as aggressive
here as others have been, so we think we have an opportunity. We have an opportunity to move more of that work to
where we can put it into a more common platform. So yes, the overall head count is coming down. And yes, we will be
moving more aggressively into global delivery centers. But again, we have not been as aggressive as others.
And then the other thing I'd point out is that reduction in overall head count also allows us now to think about how we
simplify our business. And some of what you heard in my prepared remarks were around trying to simplify the
business. So yes, overall head count is coming down. And I think what we would expect is not a dramatic shift, if you
will, in the employee base, but just a reflection of what you've seen us publicly announce.
<A - Virginia M. Rometty>: Tien-tsin, let me go ahead and add in. I really want to talk about this point on culture
because this is something that we have been working on, and I think it's again important as part of any reinvention of
any company, you have to go and match the culture with it.
And I think of a couple defining characteristics of the culture we are building here. One is speed. The second is the
word engagement, and the third Martin just mentioned around simplification. And so make no bones about it on speed
with the whole team. And as many of you know, I've been on this and with our teams, and it's not enough to tell teams
about you need to go faster. The point is you point them to where we're going to go. We've been very clear about the
strategy. And then it's also how you work. And many people call that agile or DevOps. It's this kind of speed that
comes with you try things, you fail, you correct them, you keep moving forward. And that in fact is what we are
building around the company. In many of the places where we have done that already, great results, and we're going to
continue down that path. So I underscore speed.
And then the second is this idea about engagement, which really our use of social and mobile within our own company.
Think of that as a production engine that makes things go faster. It's also, by the way, what we do with commercial
clients. But we have done a great deal of work on this topic to allow the IBM-ers across 170 countries to both move to
the future and move there with speed, this idea of engagement. And then, as I said, Martin mentioned simply, and part
of you simplifying is this idea of taking layers out, which is what I just talked about a minute ago. So culture is
paramount, take away the words speed and engagement.

<Q - Jim Suva>: Thanks very much. And, Ginni, I appreciate you coming on the call, given the changes and
challenges to what's going on. Maybe if you can, just help us understand a little bit. When we look at the results
geographically, it looks like all geographies were down. So some may say it's more of an industry situation. But then
when we look at IBM's results and compare them to the peers out there and the competitors who maybe are unique
individual companies, they are all seeing a lot better growth. So then one may say it's actually IBM focused or
challenges. Can you help us better understand if you view this more as industry or IBM not being nimble enough, or
how would you view it as how you're trying to paint the culture within IBM to adjust to this new age and these new
three focus areas?
<A - Virginia M. Rometty>: So look, Jim. First when I think about revenue in our company, I think first and foremost
about moving us to higher value. And so when you think of higher value, as we've clearly staked out this idea around
data and analytics, around cloud and around social, mobile and security. I want to take you back. And just remember
that in this quarter and in fact, by the way, those collectively grew almost 20%, and it's improved every quarter, grown
every quarter a higher number. And you take a look at them and they're not small businesses, big data and analytics,
which ended last year at – what were we, $16 billion, and now this quarter year to date 8%.
And you take a look at cloud, already greater than 50% year to date, and I think of how we ended last year – what were
we, about $4.4 billion, and the as-a-service was about $2.1 billion at a run rate.
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: That's right.
<A - Virginia M. Rometty>: We just now exited at a $3.1 billion run rate. If these were individual businesses, they
would be very highly applauded for their growth rates. And then on social, mobile, and security, again, eight quarters
double-digit. And so these are in and of themselves large businesses with very high growth rates. So I view those
compared to their peers in those areas, they're doing quite well.
Now when I take a look and you say, what do I see overall? We do have core franchises, core franchises that we've said
they do mission-critical work in many cases. We need to keep innovating on them to improve their margin, but they
may not be in growth markets. And as you know, we just as well added to the growth challenge, and no apologies for
divesting a revenue that is not high value, not core. We need to redeploy that capital to other things. This
announcement this morning of GLOBALFOUNDRIES is a great example of that. That is a business that requires a fair
amount of capital but requires even more going forward as you look at what happened as you go from 20 nanometers to
10 nanometers to 7 nanometers, let alone a larger wafer size. And so that is someone else's business. They're going to
do that well. We're going to redeploy that capital into those growth areas. So when you think of growth, I want you to
keep – we keep saying the word mix. We're mixing into what we believe are the areas that are aligned with the shifts in
the marketplace and then managing for high value.
I guess one last question or one point I'd make on macro that might be of interest, I take a look. And as Martin said, I
can only speak to what happened in our September, as what we saw was both broad-based across the world. But
clearly, in the areas where we were high transaction revenue impacted more. But as well, I did see, when the look by
different industries, I see different industries doing different things. So as an example, financial services, very focused
on things like omni-channel, cyber security, as you might expect. In fact, I had done a dinner with some of the largest
CEOs of all the clients in France. And there were two topics we talked about, data analytics and security, the entire
four-hour dinner.
And so this topic and certainly in cyber itself, and then married with when you do omni-channel, the impact you have
with channel reach, big in financial services, same in retail. So you see some industries pointed more one way, others
pointed more towards efficiency, so I do see differences around the world. But again, back to that September, just
based on what we saw, and time will tell whether what we saw is pure execution. We're treating it that way, or time
will tell whether it was something broader.

The next question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. You may ask your question.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Hi, thank you. My question relates to Services, and it's a two-part question. Can you grow
Services? Outsourcing is about 45% of Services revenues, and outsourcing backlog is down about 8% in constant
currency. Outsourcing signings in constant currency declined 17%. Coupled with that, maintenance is about 13% of
Services revenues; it continues to decline. So when you think about that question, I wanted to add on to, why is IBM
underperforming Accenture so dramatically? Is this part of the organizational structure? So it really – Ginni, you
mentioned speed and engagement. It seems like IBM continues to underperform. Would IBM be better off with a
different organizational structure, perhaps even breaking up the company further to allow for greater speed in the
organization?
So the two-part question is, can you grow Services, and then why is IBM underperforming a market leader like
Accenture so dramatically? Thank you.
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: Sure, Keith, a couple of things. So in terms of Services, we did not have the signings
performance that we were looking for. Now we have some pretty big deals. I wouldn't say that those deals are gone.
Those deals are still out there and the teams continue to work them. As always, there are a series of complexity in
regulatory environments and things. So we had a large pipeline when we entered. And unfortunately, because we didn't
get them done, or fortunately maybe, we have a large pipeline as we exited the quarter as well. So we did not get the
signings done we wanted.
Now as we've talked about the in the past, within any given quarter, but if I look at it over a longer term, about 70% of
our revenue growth is driven by the backlog that we enter a year with. And our backlog now, adjusted for the
divestiture of our Customer Care BPO business, is down about 2%. But what we've been seeing is better yield out of
that backlog than what we've seen in the past. And so a few dynamics, backlog down a little bit, but with better
performance in terms of what we're getting out of the backlog, we've done a bit better.
And then on the in-quarter signings, what we in the past talked about in terms of base growth, which the way to think
about that is sales into existing customers where we already have contracts, there are generally two what I call forms of
that. One form is where we are adding more work, so deploying more servers on their behalf or something of that sort.
And we did not see that as much as we expected in this quarter. And also, some of our contracts have more
volume-related metrics tied to their performance, and we didn't see the volume levels that we had expected. Now that
could be, again, macro related.
So from a Services signings perspective and how it feeds in, I would say that we are not relying on in our guidance a
dramatic turnaround. That business, however, does have some pretty strong underpinnings in it with regard to what we
saw in the base strategic outsourcing business, very good signings growth. Bear in mind that, with the divestiture of our
Customer Care BPO business, that GPS business is going to be down, obviously, because we're not in that business
anymore. So across Services, not the quarter we wanted in signings, but some metrics and some dynamics underneath it
that are consistent with what we saw coming out of the third quarter.
On our GBS business, very good performance when we move and where we've moved to the new areas, including front
office digitization of things we've talked about, so very strong performance in the GBS elements of the business where
we see the future. And in fact, the pipeline now is more than half of that future business. And also, we'll start to see the
benefit of – some of the benefit of our partnership with Apple in the GBS business as well as they start to deploy those
mobile apps that we're going to announce this quarter. So the GBS business is a mix between very strong performance
where we move to the future and continued price pressure and profit pressure in that more traditional packaged
applications business. It is very price competitive. The incumbents in an account are protecting those accounts. And
obviously, to break in, we're having to be more aggressive, so it's a pretty aggressive environment.
<A - Virginia M. Rometty>: Yeah, I would just add a couple points here in that, one, the comment about versus
Accenture, now remember, managing for high value. So when you look at that from a margin point of view, you would

say something different, and so a couple things. As Martin just described, where we grow, I think it's important to see
in their business, the team has aligned across where the growth areas are and then aligned in other areas where they
need to really just focus on efficiency and productivity. That will allow them to continue to go faster. So as an example,
the team is aligned around strategy and analytics together. We just talked about that result. They have aligned around
what they call mobile and interactive. In fact, we've put another $100 million into these mobile studios, interactive
design studios around the world. We are now the largest digital agency as measured by Ad Age, not ourselves, the
largest digital agency out there. So there's strategy in analytics, big practice, big practice around mobile and interactive,
both of those with very good growth.
And then I'll just complement it where Martin said. The other two practices, ERP, and then the other is application
development maintenance. And between those, you saw pricing pressure on application packages. And you saw it as
well, as you just described it, on the application maintenance area. But I believe the right way to grow, they've actually
aligned themselves, two different formulas. And that's the right focus because, remember again, it's about managing for
higher value.
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Thank you. Can we please go to the next question?
Operator
The next question comes from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.
<Q - Sherri A. Scribner>: Hi, thank you. Martin, I was hoping you could give us a little more detail on the FX
impact? Specifically, you said it was going to get worse in the fourth quarter and continue into 2015. So just hoping
you could give some detail on the magnitude and how that runs through the P&L. Thanks.
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: Sure. So as we've talked about in the past and I mentioned on my prepared remarks as
well, as currencies have a one-directional long-term trend here, our hedging programs to help us manage our cash
position really have no benefit to the I&E anymore. So it was the short move in the third quarter was relatively small. It
was an impact in the quarter, but relatively small to what we see coming in the fourth quarter and next year.
Now this is all based on the most recent exchange rates, and we don't know where this is going to wind up. But in the
fourth quarter alone, as an example, FX could be up to $0.25 in EPS on a year-to-year basis just from the moves to
date. So it has a pretty profound impact on our profitability in the near term. And again, the hedging programs don't
have an I&E benefit, if you will, on a year-over-year basis as the currencies continue to move.
Now next year, we'll talk more about next year when we get together in January. But that magnitude of impact is
consistent with what we see in the fourth quarter. Again, it's a pretty substantial impact on us. And as I noted in the
prepared remarks, it wasn't just that it was a sharp move. It was that, interestingly, each of the currencies seemed to
work against us. Most of the time, we see some benefits from some of the crosses, some of the cross-FXs, but we just
did not see that this quarter.
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Thanks, Sherri. Can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
The next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. You may ask your question.
<Q - Amit Daryanani>: Good morning, guys. So maybe I just want to talk a little bit on free cash flow usage as you
go forward. You're obviously talking about a bit of a downtick on the free cash flow number, but I'm curious. How do
you think of the buyback program as you go forward? [ph] It's only (1:06:10) decelerated in the last few quarters.
And then when you talk about organic – excluding initiatives into the newer IT markets, does that suggest maybe we
start to look at more deals or maybe even bigger deals? So maybe just touch on the buyback and the M&A side of the
equation as we go forward.

<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: Sure, Amit, sure. So I guess maybe I'll address the acquisition side of this first. We do
continue to see ourselves being active. Now our acquisition model, which we think is a powerful one that works quite
well for us, is really built around a couple of basic principles. One is that we are not looking to acquire to change, if
you will, who IBM is. We have a very good position in enterprise IT, and our acquisition strategy is to supplement our
view of where we see enterprise IT moving around data, cloud, and engagement. Two, we need to, in order to drive the
economics out of these acquisitions, we need to find things that we can put into our distribution channel immediately
and start to get the returns immediately. And what that tends to mean for us then is that acquisitions tend to be smaller
because they have not yet fully globalized, and we want to take advantage of that by bringing those products out to our
clients. And then three, the basics here, and my boss sitting next to me is going to remind me as well. We don't do what
I would call strategic – and I'll do the air quotes, "strategic acquisitions." They have to make sense economically, and
we'll continue to make sure that our acquisition content is on a sound economic basis.
In terms of share repurchase, we have been quite aggressive, and the share repurchase and the resulting reduction in
shares is fairly linear. It's something we've been doing for a long time. We've been returning capital to shareholders.
The result or the impact is, I've mentioned, fairly linear. So if we were to reduce our share repurchase going forward, it
would have a commensurate reduction in how many shares we take out obviously. That's not going to surprise you. But
remember, since we've been aggressive, we can still have, going forward, we can still have a very meaningful share
reduction even if we were to reduce our levels going forward. And we feel very comfortable with the capacity and the
flexibility we still have to continue to return capital to shareholders both through share repurchase as well as through
our dividend.
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Okay, we've run a little bit late here. So, Christine, why don't we take one last question?
Operator
Thank you. The last question comes from Brian White with Cantor Fitzgerald. You may ask your question.
<Q - Brian J. White>: Yes, good morning. I just wanted to be clear. What did the chip business lose in 2013 and what
are the expectations for loss in 2014? Thank you.
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: Hi, Brian. I think we have provided this detail in the portal article. But just to go through
the data, 2013 we had a loss of $700 million on a pre-tax basis. And 2014 is basically flat to what we saw in 2013.
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Maybe slightly better than that.
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: A little bit better. So 2013, $700 million loss; 2014, a little bit better. And again, the
details are in the portal.
Virginia M. Rometty
Okay, so I think it's probably a good time for me then to wrap up here, and I'd like to make a couple comments. The
first I'd like to just really summarize for everyone why I thought it was important to join the call today. As many of you
referenced in your comments, we had two strategically important announcements that we made. One was this
divestiture of the microelectronics business. It's an important strategic move and very important to us. Martin just
commented about some of the financials around it, but it is more than that. It is about strategy. And the second
important reason I wanted to join is we no longer expect to deliver that 2015 EPS objective, which have we talked
about. And as you know, it has been in place for some time.
These two things do come together and they're underpinned by what I believe is a singularly important message to our
investors, in that we are reinventing and we are managing this company for the long term. So while make no mistake,
our results this quarter were disappointing, and we don't want to minimize that, we have though been very clear that
this industry is shifting, and we have been executing a strategy that moves this company to the future.

Now I am absolutely convinced that we are over the right targets. We see evidence of it. You see it in the results and
analytics, in cloud, in mobile, social, and security. And we have taken, as I was going through, very big steps and bold
moves to move this company to higher value. And it does include divesting businesses that really don't fit our strategic
profile, including today's divestiture of microelectronics. In fact, I've asked you just to keep remembering that the
divestitures this year alone represent $7 billion of annual revenue, but revenue that is absolutely with considerable
losses. So our company is fundamentally better positioned than it was a few years ago. But as I have said, we have
more to do and we need to do it faster.
Now while many things are changing, as I always say to our team, they're changing because they must. There are some
things though that will not change and they have not changed. And I want to just end our call on those couple points.
We are going to continue to shift this company and this business to higher value. We're going to continue to manage
this business for the long term. And we will continue to deliver significant value to shareholders. In the end, I believe
these are the principles that are the hallmark of the IBM Company.
So on behalf of Martin and I, let me thank you for joining us today.
