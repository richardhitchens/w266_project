Thank you, Bill and good morning everyone. Duke Energy's value proposition, as outlined on slide four, has remained
consistent over time. We strive for excellence in our day-to-day operations, and to deliver affordable and reliable
services to our customers while leveraging our competitive advantages, including the additional capabilities we gained
from the merger with Progress Energy in 2012. This focus gives us opportunities to deliver attractive returns to our
investors through long-term earnings per share growth as well as the dividend. Our financial objectives have remained
consistent over time and we have a strong track record of delivering on our commitments. I'm very pleased with our
overall strong first quarter.
We reported first quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.17, supported by revised customer rates and strong
weather-normalized retail customer load growth. These results leave us on track to achieve our previously announced
2014 guidance range of $4.45 to $4.60. We responded well operationally to challenging winter weather conditions and
the Dan River ash discharge. I want to thank our dedicated team of employees who worked through these challenging
conditions with great discipline and resolve.
Before I turn the call over to Steve for more detail on the quarter, I'd like to provide some business updates, review the
status of our strategic initiatives in our commercial businesses and discuss our progress on our growth investment
opportunities.
Turning to slide five. Let me start with Dan River. By now you've heard a great deal about the accidental discharge of
coal ash that resulted from a pipe break under an ash basin in early February. We have taken responsibility and have
moved aggressively on a number of fronts. I'll talk about Dan River, the immediate actions we've taken and the
longer-term strategy we're putting in place.
At Dan River, we moved quickly to stop the discharge at the site and have been working on remediation of the river.
Our company, not our customers, will pay for the pipe break and associated cleanup. These costs were approximately
$15 million in the first quarter. Drinking water has remained safe throughout this incident and ongoing water sampling
by environmental experts shows that the Dan River has returned to normal water quality conditions.
Decisions regarding our remediation work will continue to be informed by federal and state environmental agencies.
Our overall goal is to ensure the long-term health of the river and its ecosystems. We also continue to cooperate with
ongoing investigations resulting from the Dan River accident and defend the company in pending litigation. What
happened at Dan River has led to a broader conversation about coal ash management in North Carolina, which calls for
some context.
Duke Energy has disposed of coal ash in line with prevailing standards and industry norms since the 1920s, when the
company began generating power from coal. Coal ash management is an industry issue. They are currently a total of
676 ash basins across the nation. Duke manages 69 of these, 33 of which are in North Carolina.
Establishing practices to safely and cost effectively close our ash basins has always been a priority for Duke. However,
the Dan River incident has accelerated a reevaluation of our ash management strategies, as outlined on slide six. We are
currently performing an engineering review of each of our ash basins in order to implement both near-term and
longer-term actions, addressing the ongoing management and retirement for each of our coal ash basins.
Near-term actions for North Carolina basins were outlined in the plan we submitted in March to the North Carolina
governor and NCDENR [North Carolina Department of Environmental and Natural Resources]. This site-specific plan
involves basin retirement at four sites: Dan River, Riverbend, Sutton and Asheville. The plan also addresses actions to
convert to dry ash handling at our remaining active sites: the two units at Asheville and Cliffside Unit 5. The North
Carolina legislature has said it intends to introduce ash basin legislation in the upcoming short session in North
Carolina, which begins May 14.
In preparation, the legislature, through the [North Carolina] Environmental Review Commission, has conducted
hearings with the express purpose of understanding more about the complex topic of ash basin management. At a
recent hearing in which we participated, we shared a broad range of cost estimates, which included a range of
site-specific closure strategies for each basin, including cap in place, beneficial reuse, and movement to a lined landfill.
We also discussed strategies for our active coal sites, including dry fly ash and dry bottom ash handling.

By year-end, we expect to complete our comprehensive longer-term strategies for all of our 69 ash basins across all
jurisdictions. We have a $5 billion to $6 billion overall environmental CapEx plan over the next 10 years, including
estimated costs for pending air, water and waste regulations. Our waste assumptions, including coal ash, represent
about 50% of this range.
Our plans, including costs, will continue to be updated and refined as options are chosen and engineering plans are
completed. These planning and cost estimates could be impacted by final regulations from the EPA, which are expected
in December. We will work constructively with all key stakeholders on this important issue, including cost recovery.
Our coal facilities have prudently served our customers with affordable and reliable power for decades. Cost recovery
is currently determined by the state Utilities Commission [North Carolina Utilities Commission]. We are striving for
prudent, environmentally sound and cost-effective solutions. We will keep you updated on our progress in the months
ahead.
During the first quarter's extreme weather, our teams rose to the challenge and quickly restored service to our
customers, affected by two significant winter storms. As highlighted on slide seven, a devastating ice storm in February
crippled the Southeast, resulting in over 900,000 customer outages in our Carolinas territories. In March, we confronted
the third largest ice storm ever to hit our North Carolina service territory, causing over 800,000 customer outages. Our
employees and contractors faced treacherous conditions caused by downed trees and power lines, but were diligent and
safely restored service. These efforts resulted in about $80 million in storm restoration costs during the quarter.
Our efforts with the February storm were recognized by the executive director of South Carolina's Office of Regulatory
Staff. He declared that this storm was the most significant weather event in the state since Hurricane Hugo in 1989, and
added: when adversity strikes, we can count on Duke to serve the public and earn our admiration and respect.
Again, I'd like to extend my appreciation to our Duke Energy teams for meeting these extraordinary challenges, and
helping to provide customers with the level of service they've come to expect from us. The severe winter also
demonstrated the value of our post merger diversified generation fleet, in particular in the Carolinas.
In January we set an all-time peak demand at Duke Energy Carolinas and a new winter peak demand at Duke Energy
Progress. Our Midwest utilities in Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky also set new winter peaks during the quarter. This
weather coupled with fuel price volatility highlighted our joint dispatch capabilities for our Carolinas customers. As
shown on slide eight, in the first quarter we generated about $85 million in fuel and joint dispatch savings for our
customers. That's the best quarter since the merger closed in mid-2012.
Through the end of March we had produced $275 million in cumulative savings toward the $687 million of guaranteed
savings over the first five years after the merger. We are on track to meet this commitment, having achieved or locked
in about 80% of the total guaranteed fuel and joint dispatch savings through renegotiated contracts. As you may
remember, one of the conditions of the Progress merger required us to execute eight transmission expansion projects to
mitigate FERC market power concerns. These projects were committed to be placed in service over time by July 1 of
2015. To-date, six projects of the eight projects have been placed in service. The remaining two projects are expected to
be in service later this month, placing us ahead of schedule and under budget for this important merger commitment.
Now let's turn to slide nine and our Edwardsport plant in Indiana, which began commercial operation last June. We
estimated that Edwardsport would build up to its long-term level of availability over 15 months. Edwardsport is a large
complex project and it has taken time to work out technical issues. Since the in-service date we have been monitoring
our success by progressing through GE's [General Electric] new product introduction protocol, conducting detailed
performance testing and optimization procedures and obtaining valuable operating experience with the new facility.
As discussed during our last earnings call, the extreme winter challenged Edwardsport's performance in the first two
months of this year. We took advantage of this downtime by accelerating a scheduled spring maintenance outage into
February. Performance significantly improved in March and April. All major technology systems have been validated
and we continue to focus on final performance testing and optimization. We are on track to be within the total revised
project estimate of $3.5 billion.

The right side of slide nine outlines the upcoming regulatory calendar associated with the semi-annual IGCC
[integrated gasification combined cycle] riders and quarterly fuel adjustment clauses. In early April the IURC [Indiana
Utility Regulatory Commission] issued its order approving our most recent quarterly fuel adjustment clause. In this
order the Commission also approved a request by intervenors to create a subdocket to examine negative generation at
the site in the fall of last year. A pre-hearing conference was held on April 23 and we are waiting on a procedural
schedule. We will continue to provide updates on these important proceedings.
Next on slide 10, I'll update you on our process to exit the merchant generation business, which we announced in
February. As you will recall, the businesses we are exiting includes 6,100 megawatts of coal and gas capacity serving
the PJM wholesale markets, as well as our competitive retail business, Duke Energy Retail. Given the price volatility in
this market, these Midwest generation assets are not a strategic fit for Duke. We have completed the required transfer
of these assets outside of the utility.
The marketing process has begun and we expect first round bids to be submitted this quarter. Our expectation is that
final bids, approvals and the closing process will likely extend into the first quarter of 2015. We expect the
redeployment of proceeds to be accretive to our adjusted earnings per share. As a result of our plan to exit from this
business, we've recognized a pre-tax impairment loss of approximately $1.4 billion in the first quarter. Steve will
discuss the accounting implications in a moment.
Next let's turn to our international business, as shown on slide 11. International includes 4,600 megawatts of generation
in Latin America, about half of which is hydro generation in Brazil. This business represents between 10% and 15% of
Duke Energy's earnings mix and has historically been a very good performer. I'll start with an update on reservoir
levels and rain conditions in Brazil.
Reservoir levels were at about 39% at the end of April versus 62% last year at this time. Thermal generation units are
being used to preserve reservoir levels and meet customer demand. In anticipation of low reservoir levels and high
electric demand, we strategically reduced our targeted 2014 contracted percentage for our hydro generation. This
strategy has supported our strong results to-date by providing greater opportunities to sell power into attractive spot
markets. We will continue to monitor conditions and we'll keep you informed as the year progresses.
Second, as announced earlier this year, we're conducting a strategic review of the international business. We are
evaluating growth opportunities, including potential tax effective strategies for domestic use of offshore cash. We have
an internal timeline to complete this review by late 2014 or early 2015 and will keep you informed on this process.
Let me also comment briefly on our growth investment opportunities. We are continuing to actively pursue a number of
projects that will support our 4% to 6% earnings per share growth rate, including new generation, infrastructure
projects, and environmental and regulatory compliance. For the period from 2014 through 2018 we are targeting $16
billion to $20 billion of growth investments as outlined on slide 12.
We're making excellent progress on all fronts and I'll mention a few of these initiatives. First, in April, the South
Carolina Public Service Commission issued a certificate enabling us to move forward with a new 750-megawatt
combined cycle natural gas plant at our existing W.S. Lee site in South Carolina. We expect the plant could enter
commercial service by late 2017.
Second, we had a very strong response to our request for proposals for regulated solar projects in North Carolina,
including both PPA [power purchase agreement] and ownership options. We announced in April that we've received
proposals amounting to nearly three times our goal of up to 300 megawatts of new solar capacity. Achieving this goal
would almost double our available solar capacity in North Carolina. We are very encouraged by this response and
expect to select the winning projects and complete negotiations in the fourth quarter. The selected project should be
online by the end of 2015.
Third, we continue to negotiate with the North Carolina Eastern Municipal Power Agency regarding our potential to
purchase their minority ownership interest in certain Duke Energy Progress plants. If we are able to finalize the
purchase agreement as well as the terms of a wholesale power contract, potential next steps would include approvals by
FERC [Federal Energy Regulatory Commission], the Department of Justice, the NRC [Nuclear Regulatory

Commission] for transfer of nuclear licenses, and the Carolinas Commissions [North Carolina Utilities Commission,
South Carolina Public Service Commission].
We also continue to move forward with plans for new natural gas generation in Florida. We are evaluating bids for
combined cycle baseload generation to be in service in 2018. These bids have been submitted through our RFP [request
for proposal] process, including our self-build option for 1,640 megawatts. The company has a need for additional
generating resources in the 2016 to 2018 timeframe. We are analyzing whether to meet these needs with new peaking
units, plant [ph] operates, (17:40) purchase power agreements, plant acquisitions or a combination of these resources.
We expect to make filings with the Florida Commission [Florida Public Service Commission] in the coming weeks,
outlining the most cost effective options for our Florida customers.
And finally, in April, Duke Energy and Piedmont Natural Gas jointly issued a solicitation for proposals to build and
operate a major interstate gas pipeline in North Carolina. This will help to meet the growing demand for natural gas in
the Carolinas, now served by a single major interstate pipeline.
Duke Energy and Piedmont Natural Gas would consider a wide range of ownership options in support of the selected
proposal. We expect to choose the winning bidder by the end of this year. This slide also includes other investment
opportunities that we are pursuing. Taken together, this diverse portfolio of investment supports our commitment to
customers and our ability to grow and achieve our financial objectives.
Now I will turn the call over to Steve to discuss our financial performance for the quarter.
Steven K. Young
Thank you, Lynn. Today I'll focus on three primary areas. First, I'll discuss the key drivers to our first quarter results
and update you on the status of our earnings guidance range for 2014. I'll also review the first quarter and full year
accounting implications related to the exit of our Midwest generation fleet. Second, I'll discuss our volume trends and
the economic conditions within our service territories. Finally, I will close with our progress toward achieving our
overall financial objectives.
First quarter 2014 adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.17. These results, as shown on slide 13, exceeded 2013's
first quarter results of $1.02 per share. Our quarterly adjusted results were supported by revised customer rates and
strong growth in weather-normal retail customer demand. The impact of favorable weather was largely offset by
increased storm restoration costs. As Lynn mentioned in her prepared remarks, we have affirmed our 2014 earnings
guidance range of $4.45 to $4.60 per share.
On a reported basis, the company experienced a quarterly net loss of $0.14 per share compared to $0.89 of per share
earnings last year. Reported earnings this quarter were impacted by a pre-tax impairment charge of $1.4 billion, or a
loss of $1.23 per share, associated with the exit of the Midwest generation business. This impairment was based upon a
fair value estimate for these assets and has been treated as a special item. Our fair value assumptions will be refined if
necessary as we move through the sales process. A reconciliation of our reported results to our adjusted results is
included in the supplemental materials.
Adjusted earnings at our regulated utilities business increased by $0.11 per share, primarily due to revised customer
rates and strong weather-normalized retail customer load growth. Increased pricing and riders led to higher earnings of
$0.12 compared to last year, primarily driven by our 2013 rate cases in the Carolinas and Ohio. The impact of this
quarter's unusually cold weather led to higher adjusted earnings per share of $0.08 compared to last year, and $0.09
when compared to normal weather conditions. The Carolinas had the second highest number of heating degree days of
any first quarter over the last 20 years, while the Midwest achieved its highest level over that same time period.
Growth in retail customer demand led to higher earnings per share of $0.06 during the quarter. I'll provide more color
on our customer load growth trends in a moment. Our wholesale business added $0.03 per share in the quarter. This
growth was supported by increased contractual commitments, colder weather and volume growth compared to last
year. These positive drivers were partially offset by around $0.07 per share of higher depreciation expense, driven by

prior-year cost of removal amortization in Florida and additional depreciation in 2014 for new plants in service.
O&M costs were around $0.05 per share higher during the quarter. Quarterly O&M was impacted by the additional
storm restoration cost that Lynn highlighted of around $0.07 per share. Excluding these storm costs, O&M was slightly
lower as a result of our ongoing cost management efforts and a $0.02 nuclear outage cost levelization benefit in the
Carolinas. Interest expense was higher by around $0.03 per share, primarily due to lower post-in-service debt returns on
projects now reflected in customer rates.
Next I'll address international's results, which were $0.04 per share higher than the prior year quarter. These results
were impacted by higher earnings in Latin America of $0.06, mostly in Brazil. Our reduced contracting strategy that
Lynn discussed resulted in more sales volumes into the spot market at higher prices. These favorable results were
partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, a $0.02 drag compared to last year.
Next, moving to commercial power. Adjusted results for this segment were flat during the quarter. However, there were
some offsetting drivers. Results from our renewables business were $0.01 per share higher than last year, driven by
increased wind production and lower development cost. We expect this business to generate around $50 million in net
income this year.
Next, let me discuss Midwest generation. Results for the Midwest gas generation units were around $0.01 higher,
driven by higher realized power prices. These results were substantially offset by lower earnings from the Midwest coal
fleet of around $0.01 per share due to outages experienced during the extreme cold weather. As a result of these
outages, we were required to purchase high-priced power to meet our hedged commitments.
Duke Energy Retail also had unfavorable earnings in the quarter of $0.01. Our retail business hedges its contracted
volumes assuming normal weather. When demand surged in January, Duke Energy Retail was forced to buy
high-priced power in the market to meet this increased demand.
Finally, let me spend a moment discussing some important accounting changes that will occur with our Midwest
generation fleet. Since we've started a process to exit this business, the plants are classified as assets held for sale in our
financial statements as of March 31. As a result of this classification, for the remainder of the year there will be no
further depreciation expense recognized on the plants. And since the assets have been reduced to their estimated fair
market value, any future maintenance capital expenditures will likely be expensed as incurred. We expect these two
changes to largely offset each other. We will continue to recognize any earnings from these plants in the company's
adjusted diluted earnings per share until a sales transaction is closed.
Slide 14 highlights our retail customer volume trends for the quarter and the economic conditions within our service
territories. Quarterly weather-normal retail customer load was 2.6% higher than 2013, along with a 1.6% higher trend
over the last 12 months. This was the third consecutive quarter we have experienced strong retail load growth. We are
very encouraged and are seeing more signs of sustained economic improvement throughout our service territories. The
economic recovery has expanded as credit has loosened, household income has increased and overall unemployment
rates have declined. In fact, over the past year, the unemployment rate in the Carolinas and Indiana has declined by
around 2%, well in excess of the national average decline of around 0.8%.
These trends have resulted in higher consumer confidence, which has led to higher electricity consumption by our
customers. Duke service territories remain attractive for business expansion. During the quarter, our commercial and
industrial customers announced significant capital investments for new facilities or the expansion of existing ones.
These investments are expected to add over 3,000 jobs across our regulated territories.
Next let me highlight some of the trends we're seeing in each of our customer classes. First, our residential customers,
where we had quarter-over-quarter growth of 2.9%; we experienced higher usage per customer of around 2% as
compared to negative usage customer trends at this time last year. Some of the first quarter growth in usage per
customer can be explained by the extreme weather across our service territories, when customers were forced to stay at
home and use more power than normal. However, improved economic data leads us to believe this strength is more
sustainable rather than a one-time event.

We also continue to experience growth in the average number of customers across our service territories. Since the first
quarter of 2013 we've added approximately 70,000 new electric customers, an average increase of around 1%. We
haven't seen this level of new customer percentage growth since 2008.
Next, our commercial class experienced growth of 3.6% in the first quarter, primarily supported by strong activity in
the Carolinas and Florida. Employment rates and real income levels have continued to improve, leading to growth in
retail sales for this segment. Office vacancy rates are also favorable throughout our service territories. In the first
quarter of 2014 we also experienced significant growth in demand from data centers and the Duke Energy Carolinas
service territory. Higher sales were also seen in the hospitality, healthcare, education and professional business services
sectors when compared to last year.
And finally, the industrial sector continues to experience steady improvement. Industrial production remains above
expectations due to strong demand for manufactured durable and non-durable goods. We are seeing continued strength
in the automotive, construction and metal sub sectors. Industrial demand in the first quarter was tempered by factory
shutdowns and delays in the delivery of raw materials due to the impact of the winter weather. We're optimistic about
the sustainability of the economic recovery across our service territories and encouraged by the growth we have
experienced over the last three quarters, as well as over a rolling 12-month basis. We will continue to monitor these
trends and provide updates throughout the year.
I will close with our financial objectives for 2014 in the longer term as outlined on slide 15. I'm very pleased with our
financial performance through the first quarter of 2014. Based upon our results to-date and assuming normal weather
for the remainder of the year, we are evaluating opportunities to accelerate some O&M expenses from future periods
into 2014. We will update you on our plans later in the year.
The balance sheet remains strong. We recently conducted annual meetings with the rating agencies. These discussions
were constructive and our ratings outlook is stable at all three agencies. Our strong balance sheet allows us the
flexibility to invest in our business and grow our dividend without the need for new equity issuances through 2016.
We are focused on growing the dividend, which is central to our investor value proposition. We expect to achieve our
long-term payout ratio of 65% to 70% in 2014, allowing greater flexibility in future dividend growth.
Finally, we continue to make progress on our growth initiatives and cost savings projects. We remain well positioned to
grow longer-term earnings within our targeted range of 4% to 6%. We continue to execute on our overall financial
objectives.
Now I'll turn it back over to Lynn.
Lynn J. Good
Thanks, Steve. I'm proud of how our team responded to the operational challenges of the first quarter while remaining
focused on our mission to provide customers with safe, reliable and cost effective service. We also made great progress
on our 2014 and longer-term financial objectives and have taken important steps on our strategic initiatives to build a
stronger future. We will continue to execute on our mission to deliver exceptional results to benefit our customers,
communities and investors.

<A - Lynn J. Good>: Good morning, Dan.
<A - Steven K. Young>: Good morning.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Just following up on maybe Steve's closing comments about load growth and what you're
seeing. First quarter represented yet another quarter of better-than-planned load growth in the trailing 12 months, is
pretty supportive of a higher growth rate than what you've talked about. When are you guys going to decide that maybe
growth is at a higher level and what bearing will that have on how you're prioritizing the growth CapEx you've laid out
in the slides today?

about what we're seeing with three quarters. I think when we look at a really weather-impacted quarter, however, the
science to pull weather out isn't perfect, and so we'd love to see another quarter of strength before we formally revise
estimates. So that's how we're looking at it, but we feel like we've seen some strength here that gives us some optimism
about the future.
In terms of prioritization of investments, we continue to focus on deploying about 85% to 90% of our capital into our
regulated businesses. We're also continuing to focus on building our commercial renewables business. And so I would
think about those initiatives progressing and the timing will really be dictated, in many ways, by regulatory approvals
and as these opportunities develop. So that's where I'd leave it on the prioritizations.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: And then I guess on commercial ops with the impairment this quarter, can you just give us an
update on, (a) where that process sits; when you expect something to be announced or formalized? And then with AEP
[American Electric Power] and FirstEnergy [FirstEnergy Corp.] both talking about the idea of long-term contracting or
some sort of reregulation in Ohio, is that going to prospectively changed your timing for moving forward with the sale?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Dan, we are continuing to progress with the sale process. We are targeting first-round bids here
in this quarter, so second quarter, and then would expect the process to continue. And we'll update as we go and meet
milestones on that process. In parallel we're, of course, monitoring what's going on in Ohio. AEP in particular has put
forward an ESP [electric security plan] that has a non-bypassable charge intended to provide customers with some
stability around what could be market volatility. I think they've introduced the OVEC [Ohio Valley Electric
Corporation] asset and potentially others. So we'll continue to monitor that. I think Ohio has begun to recognize that
extreme weather conditions such as the polar vortex may be creating reliability concerns for the state, and so we'll
monitor how that conversation progresses.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: So could that change your decision to sell if it looked like there was an alternative to contract in
Ohio or to some sort of other structure?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Dan, we're not thinking about it that way at this point. We're moving through the sale process.
We think that fits with our strategic objectives to reduce that volatility in those assets. But we'll update you as that
process progresses and as we have more to say about how it's progressing.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Thank you.

<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: So perhaps to follow up a little bit on the last question, shifting over to Indiana. Could
you perhaps give us a little bit of an update as far as you see recovery of both O&M and purchase power and how do
you see the latest subdocket working out as far as Edwardsport goes?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: So actually in the slide deck, Julien, there are a couple of slides, slide nine and slide 25, that lay
out the subdockets that are pending in Indiana. So a subdocket has been opened on fuel recovery, really focused on the
latter part of 2013 and the issue raised by intervenors on negative generation. We do not yet have a procedural schedule
on that and we'll need to just progress that and update as it occurs.
Our focus in Indiana is really on continuing to ramp up and complete our performance testing, optimizing the asset and
moving through this important transition. I'm pleased that generation has improved in March and April and the team is
very focused on continuing to deliver strong results out of the asset. So I think we'll have to move through the
regulatory process in the weeks and months to come and as we have items to update, we'll certainly do that.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Or perhaps to clarify, rather, is it that both purchase power and O&M is at risk or is
one versus the other, just if you could perhaps elaborate a little bit on that?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Julien, there are two types of riders, right? So fuel is the one I just spoke about, where the
Commission [Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission] has opened a subdocket on fuel and focusing specifically on this
negative generation in the fourth quarter. That proceeding is specific to fuel. There are also ongoing filings in the IGCC
riders, which address return and address O&M recovery.
And so I believe the Commission has approved through IGC-11 (sic) [IGCC-11] (37:01). We have IGCC-12 that we're
waiting for approval on and we are filing IGCC-13. And so those would be the dockets in which intervenors could
challenge costs and O&M and so on. And I think that's something we'll have to monitor over time.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Great. And then following up on the results in the quarter here in Brazil, especially
given the hedging, how's this meet your plan that you've articulated earlier this year or how are you feeling about that?
And ultimately, how do you think about energy rationing as it stands today and the prospects for that and how would
that impact you or what have you?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: So the Brazilian operation is off to a strong start for the first quarter, Julien, and we actually
benefited from the hedging strategy because we had the opportunity to sell generation into a high-priced spot market.
As we continue to look at the balance of the year, we're watching this very closely. We like the fact that we have a little
bit more flexibility in our contracting position, which gives us some protection if the regulator or government were to
move into a rationing or voluntary rationing situation. But we do not have any further information on that at this point.
I think given the political environment in Brazil, the World Cup, the elections, I think that's going to be reviewed very
closely by the government and by the regulator. So we're watching it every day. We're watching rainfall; we're looking
at dispatch; we're looking at spot prices; and of course also looking ahead to 2015 and how that could impact our
contracting strategy for 2015.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Great. And the last detail, have you delineated O&M versus capital cost for coal ash in
Carolina and elsewhere?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: We have not. What we have put forward are ranges of costs around closure, around investment
to dry handling, and the installation of certain of these capital costs will drive O&M, but we've not provided specific
ranges on the O&M at this point.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Thanks, Julien.

Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Yeah, hi. Good morning.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Hi, Steve.
<A - Steven K. Young>: Hi, Steve.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Hi, Lynn. So just a few questions on the coal ash issues, the independent engineering report
that you're doing that's going to be done by the end of May. Are you going to make that public right then, to us, or
how's that going to get released?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Steve, we are moving through the third-party engineering in a sequential way, working through
all of the basins and to the extent there are items identified that we should address from a maintenance standpoint, we
are addressing those. And what we've committed to do is provide periodic updates on our short-term and longer-term
actions when we reach specific milestones. We are also updating the regulators on these milestones. So we haven't
made a specific commitment on what we'll do around May 31, but you can expect us to make updates on the progress
on our short-term plans as the year progresses.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Okay. And then just on the legislative session, you said there's a short session, just what are
the proposals that you're expecting to hear and how long is this session?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: It should wrap up in early July, Steve. So May 15 to early July.
<A - Steven K. Young>: That's correct.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Okay.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: And I think proposals will develop as the session gets started. I referenced in my comments that
there's been a lot of work by the legislative body on education, trying to understand the complex topic. So I think as the
session starts we'll have more information on specifics. I think you're aware we've put forward a plan that lays out
specific actions around certain plants. We've also laid out a plan to accelerate investment in dry fly ash handling, also
moving forward with dewatering certain of the retired ponds. So we're moving forward on those actions and would
expect those to be considered. Although we can't speak fully to how the legislature will address the issue broadly, but
certainly that plan would be considered, I think, as part of the go-forward strategy.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Okay. Just last question, where do you stand overall on your coal piles? Maybe you can just
give some color there, and are you having to take any actions to preserve coal into the summer?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Steve, we're in good shape. It has been a challenging delivery time during the first quarter, but
we feel comfortable with where our inventory is across the system.

recently? Are we just talking about the combined cycle or is this also the gasifier piece of it as well? Just a bit more
color on what you mean by running better?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: So Jonathan, when I talk about running better, I'm talking about running on the gasifiers. And so
the month of April was the third best month since the plant has been in service. I don't have a specific capacity factor in
front of me. But trending up, March was a strong month and then April stronger still. We do provide monthly updates
to the IERC [International Energy Research Centre] on our generation statistics, so I think if you follow up with IR, we
could probably give you a little more specifics on how that generation is occurring.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Okay. And you feel confident that it's going to ramp from here or is there another period
where it has to go through more testing and step back a bit as we [ph] those numbers (43:24)?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Yeah, we are finalizing performance testing with General Electric, hopefully in the month of
May. And we have taken the outage in February, to address some of the issues that we experienced from severe
weather earlier in the year. So I think at this point, Jonathan, it's continuing to improve performance; it's optimizing
procedures; and I think the team, if they were on the call, would tell you they have increasing experience on the
operating profile of the plant. It's improving over time; there's greater confidence in operations. But it's a complex
project and we're learning every day, but I feel like we have the right resources devoted to it and we're working hard to
continue to improve operations.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: And is there something about the technology and very cold weather that might impair its
performance in the future in wintertime, or was it just because you were in start-up?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Jonathan, I do think we've learned some things from the weather in Indiana, which was 30
degrees below what we would normally experience. So my hope and expectation is that we saw the worst of the worst
this winter and have been able to address operational challenges as a result of that. But let me turn it over to Keith Trent
or [ph] Thea, (44:49) who've been very involved in this and see if they have anything to add to that.
<A - B. Keith Trent>: Sure. Jonathan, I would just add one thing and that is there's nothing that was unique about the
technology that was impacted specifically by the cold weather. As Lynn said, it was extremely cold, 30 degrees below
what we'd seen in the past, but it was more exposure of components to extreme cold, like transmitters, those sorts of
things, that are not any kind of unique technology. But we learned from that and we can apply heating methods, which
we have done, so that we can remedy that, but there's nothing unique about the technology that's causing us concerns.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Great. Thank you. And Lynn, if I might, on another, just a big picture, if another quarter
confirms what you seem to suspect, which is that your sales have begun to tick higher, how should we think about that
as it would impact your overall plan? Does it push out rate case timings? Does it mean we're going to have to step up
capital spending in certain areas? How would a uptick in sales change what you've laid out for us?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Jonathan, I feel like an uptick in sales is the best possible thing that can happen, not only to Duke
Energy, but to the economies that we serve. When you see improvement in the industrial base and commercial and new
customers being added, I think it's all-around a good outcome. I think it will give us some things to think about in terms
of timing of rate cases and capital deployment. And we have begun some of that thinking and when we're prepared to
share it with you, we'll give you some more feedback on it, but generally I think this is a very good thing.
<A - Steven K. Young>: Yeah, so I think that we're in the process now, Jonathan, of updating our forecasts and we go
through this process every year for the integrated resource planning process, which is our long-term planning
mechanism that we share with the Commission [Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission] and that drives a lot of our
generation planning and rate case planning and so forth. So we'll be putting through those mechanisms and these
changes and see what it yields.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: And what would the timing of resource plan updates be?
<A - Steven K. Young>: It varies per jurisdiction. We'll typically do it in the spring; in the fall in the Carolinas, as an
example.

Our next question comes from Chris Turnure with JPMorgan.
<Q - Christopher J. Turnure>: Good morning, Lynn and Steve.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Good morning.
<Q - Christopher J. Turnure>: Can you guys give us a little bit more color on the RFP process in North Carolina for
the new pipeline? I'm thinking along the lines of total cost and then when we would actually see incremental
information as to whether or not you're going to offer in a self-build proposal?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Chris, we're early in the process. So we've announced a solicitation with an expectation and a
timeline that would put us in a position to announce a winning bid, if you will, by the end of this year. And we're
evaluating a range of options, which would also include ownership interest on the part of Duke and Piedmont
[Piedmont Natural Gas] and we will update you as we go. We have not disclosed, nor do we have a broad range of
investment at this point. We are anxious to talk with the various bidders about what they see the potential to be and as
we have more information, we'll share it with you. I think this is a terrific opportunity, not only to underpin
infrastructure for electricity, but I think it's an opportunity for economic development in the Eastern part of North
Carolina. So we are at work putting together a project that we think could be very strategic for the state.
<Q - Christopher J. Turnure>: Great. And then, any updated thoughts on M&A, given what we've seen in the past
couple weeks here in utility lines?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Nothing different than what we've said previously. We like the business mix that we have. We
like the complement of jurisdictions that we serve. We would consider M&A, but it would need to be an opportunistic
type thing. It's certainly not something that we see as a must-have from a strategic standpoint. So we're monitoring all
of it, Chris, and would consider opportunities but nothing beyond that at this point.

<Q - Brian J. Chin>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Hi, Brian.
<A - Steven K. Young>: Good morning.
<Q - Brian J. Chin>: Going back to the coal ash issue. Would it be reasonable for us to think about the projections
you've given on the different options for North Carolina, that that's roughly comparable to how we think about the costs
of coal ash remediation in other states where you have similar pond issues? Is that the right way to think about it or are
the North Carolina coal ash issues so site-specific that it wouldn't be reasonable to broadly assume those cost
assumptions for other ponds?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: So let me try to jump in on that, Brian. So and I'm sure in the back of your mind you're
referencing the testimony that we presented to the Commission [North Carolina Utilities Commission] for the
Environmental Commission [North Carolina Environmental Review Commission] in the legislature. As we have put

out our $5 billion to $6 billion estimate for the 10-year environmental plan, that has included addressing ash pond
closure. It's also included addressing conversion to dry bottom ash and dry fly ash in anticipation of where the [ph]
FEMA fluent (50:51) guidelines will go.
We have, as part of our short-term action plan, modified that estimate for four sites in the Carolinas by evaluating a
closure option that actually moves all the ash to a lined landfill. And so that has added roughly $500 million to our
estimate. So it's moved from $4.5 billion to $5.5 billion, to $5 billion to $6 billion.
Further refinement of the estimate around waste will be accomplished as we complete our strategic review, site-by-site,
of all of our ash basins around our system. And so it's really premature for us to give you more specifics on the estimate
or how it'll be implicated in other jurisdictions, because it'll be dependent upon a couple of things. First of all, our
strategy, and in the case of North Carolina, what we expect to be legislation in the state. As we talk about our other
jurisdictions, we do not see an immediate push around legislation or change in policies in the same manner as we're
seeing in North Carolina.
<Q - Brian J. Chin>: Understood. Very helpful, and on that last point about other jurisdictions, is it right now your
expectation that resolution in North Carolina will likely lead how other states and your conversations will be resolved
on coal ash? Or is there a possibility that the discussion with those other jurisdictions has been accelerated given what's
happened with North Carolina and you could see resolution in other states potentially setting a precedent for how North
Carolina looks at this?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: At least among our jurisdictions, Brian, North Carolina is in the lead in terms of this discussion.
And I think if you think back into the earlier part of the 2000s, North Carolina put forward an industry leading set of
legislation called Clean Smokestacks [Clean Smokestacks Act], where they were instrumental in accelerating
investments in environmental around air. And so I think this represents an opportunity for North Carolina to do the
same around ash and as we move through this short session we'll have a better sense of how the policy will be
developed for the state. And I do think we have an opportunity in North Carolina to lead.
<Q - Brian J. Chin>: Very good, and then one last quick one. For the strategic review on the international front, in the
past when the strategic review has concluded, basically, we haven't seen a major confirmation from the company in
terms of direction one way or another. With the conclusion of this strategic review, is it the intention of the company to
provide a positive conclusion, regardless of what the decision is? Or is it more likely that it will simply be concluded
privately and no more future mention of that will happen until the next strategic review?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: We intend to disclose when the strategic review is complete and what our conclusions are.

<A - Lynn J. Good>: But, let's follow-up on that with the IR team on specific PJM bidding strategy.
<Q - Angie Storozynski>: Okay. Okay.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: To the extent we're going to disclose bidding strategy.
<Q - Angie Storozynski>: Secondly, on the load growth, I do see the other numbers. They do seem impressive.
However, they tend to be significantly skewed towards the residential and commercial load, the strength, and those two
groups tends to be most impacted by the weather, right? I mean the fact that there's such a big discrepancy in the
industrial load growth versus residential and commercial could suggest, as you said yourself, that those weather
normalization models are a little bit off. Or it could be that your service territory is simply different, meaning less
industrial. How would you describe that?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: I think there are a couple of things I would point to, and Steve can certainly add to this. We did
see an increase in usage per customer, Angie. So in addition to strong customer growth, we saw an increase in usage
per customer. It's hard to know exactly why that's occurring. But frankly, because of the extreme weather, we had parts
of the Carolinas that were home for days at a time and we do think we had a little bit of additional usage on a per
customer basis as a result of that.
The other thing I would point to is when I look at the residential trend, third quarter was up 1.1%. Fourth quarter was
up 0.7%. Both of which are pretty strong numbers. Similarly, commercial was up 1.6% in the third quarter and 1.2% in
the fourth quarter. So the other thing I would point you to is over a rolling 12-month period, we're at a 1.6%. So I don't
have a perfect answer to, do we have a little bit of weather in the volumes? I think there's a possibility we have some
weather. That's why we're continuing to monitor this. Second quarter will give us another good indication; it will not be
as weather-influenced. But when we look at all of the factors together, including the performance in third and fourth
quarter, we believe we're seeing a trend.
<A - Steven K. Young>: That's right. We have added 70,000 customers. So that's a stronger number than we've seen
and some of the data that we look at, median household income, that's looking at middle income growth, is stronger
than we've seen before in the past. The unemployment rate changes are significant as well. So it feels like the economic
recovery is broadening and deepening a bit and getting into the pockets of smaller businesses and middle-income
residences.
<Q - Angie Storozynski>: And my last question, so about your coal plants, so you're showing us this very high
potential CapEx associated with coal ash remediation. And then we are approaching June 1, when the EPA is supposed
to issue carbon dioxide emission rules. And I'm trying to understand, given that both of these actually going to probably
result in a pretty significant uptick in your electric rates, how do you think can all of this CapEx and additional costs be
recovered without actually a rate shock?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Angie, I think the thing to keep in mind on ash is that that expenditure is going to occur over a
very long period of time. So even on the short-term action plan that we put forward of $500 million, it is going to occur
over like two years to five years. And if you look at some of the higher-end numbers that we've put forward, assuming
that all ash gets moved, those numbers are over 20 years to 30 years. It'll just physically take that long to accomplish.
So I think that's an important consideration for you to think about when you think about ash.
And I think on greenhouse gases in general, we're going to have to evaluate how those rules come out, how they come
forward, what kind of flexibility is offered in the states? I do think there's a lot of focus on the part of the EPA on
reliability and giving the states flexibility. And so I think we'll have to evaluate where those rules come out before we
can conclude what the implication will be to rates.
<Q - Angie Storozynski>: But your current RFP for solar in the Carolinas and potentially putting it into the rate base is
not in any way related to potential carbon regulations and your attempt to offset your carbon footprint?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Yeah, it is in connection with both a customer demand for solar, but also, we have a renewable
energy portfolio standard in North Carolina, Angie, and this would be a part of the compliance with that standard.

strategic review like this is consider all options. So we're looking at: we've got a great business, a great position,
profitable businesses that have been a strong contributor to the company over time. We have some headwinds in the
form of foreign currency. We don't see the growth that we'd like to see in that business. So we're really solving for two
things. Is there a way we can better position the business for growth? Is there a better way we can position the business
to optimize cash flow? And over what timeframe and what are the tradeoffs that we need to consider to accomplish
that? So I wouldn't say there's anything off the table at this point. But we're trying to be open-minded and explore as
many options as we can think of.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it. And Steve, you made some comments about O&M both in the quarter, but also
about maybe moving forward some O&M. And I know you had the storm-related O&M during the first quarter of this
year. Can you just talk about O&M trajectory? How 2014 looks like versus what your original guidance for O&M was
in 2014? And then what does that mean for beyond 2014?
<A - Steven K. Young>: Certainly, certainly. The O&M trajectory has not changed. And we intend to keep non-fuel
O&M flat through 2016 and we see very positive trends thus far in 2014. When you pull the storm cost out, we actually
see O&M down a bit. And we are continuing to find, through integration projects and moving people to similar
processes and platforms and IT systems, additional benefits to offset emerging costs. So we feel very good about our
O&M trajectory.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it. Thanks, Steve. Thanks, Lynn. Much appreciated.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Thank you, Michael.
