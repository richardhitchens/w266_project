So let me now turn it over to Irene.
Irene Rosenfeld, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Chris and good afternoon.
First off, we had another good quarter in a challenging environment. Every geography delivered solid results. In North
America, we posted sequential improvement in top line performance, despite weak consumer demand and less
merchandising activity than the prior year. In Europe, we delivered another quarter of solid revenue growth, despite
soft categories. We also continued to grow our margins, and have sustained them in the low teens. In developing
markets, further investment in our power brands and in priority markets again drove strong revenue growth in Asia
Pacific and Latin America.
Second, as we told you in August, we plan to reinvest our first-half earnings upside to build a stronger foundation for
future growth. And that's exactly what we did. We continued to increase our investments in advertising, including a
double-digit increase in North America. This ensures that our brands are as strong as possible as the economy
improves. We also normalized Cadbury's trade inventories in certain developing markets. And as expected, this
tempered our top-line growth.
So overall, the third quarter played out essentially as we'd planned. A notable exception was that input costs, including
dairy, coffee, and cocoa, rose much more than we expected. To offset these higher costs, we began to price in several
categories and in several markets. This affected our results in two ways. Our top-line growth was driven more by price
than by vol/mix. And there was some pressure on gross margins because price realization trailed the increase in input
costs. The gross margin pressure we experienced in Q3 should ease as price levels better align with input costs.
The key takeaway is that the underlying momentum of our business remains strong. We're taking the necessary pricing
actions despite a difficult consumer environment. That's a testament to our strengthened brand equities. And we
continued to increase our advertising investments. This will further build our brands, stimulate our categories, and
position us well as the economy recovers.
Let me now turn it over to Tim to discuss our third quarter results in more detail.
Timothy McLevish, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Irene, and good afternoon. As Irene just mentioned, we're pleased with our third quarter results. They came in
largely in line with our expectations. Now let me provide some details.
I'll start by discussing our top line, where pricing was the primary driver of organic revenue growth as we moved
quickly to offset higher input costs. Organic net revenue for the combined business grew 2.1% as focused investments
drove continued growth in our power brands. In the Kraft base business, organic revenues increased 2.5%, including
2.3 points from pricing. In fact, net pricing was up in every one of our business units. In the Cadbury business, organic
revenue growth was essentially flat, but in line with our expectations. This was due in part to our decision to normalize
trade inventories in certain markets. Doing so reduced Cadbury's top-line growth by about 2 points and reduced our
combined revenue growth by approximately 0.5 percentage point. As you know, we're also comparing against a hard
push by Cadbury in the second half of last year.
Now turning to profit. On a combined basis, our operating income margin excluding acquisition and integration costs,
was 13.6%. In our Kraft base business, operating income margin fell by 50 basis points to 13.9%. This was entirely due
to our stepped-up advertising investment, which lowered margins by about 100 basis points. At the same time, we
continued to make excellent progress in productivity and in reducing overhead costs. For the Cadbury business,
margins were 12.4% in the quarter. This reflected stepped-up marketing investment and the impact of the trade
inventory reductions we've already mentioned. Overall, we continued to demonstrate strong underlying momentum.
But clearly there's more opportunity ahead.

Turning to EPS, two key drivers affected the comparison of third quarter earnings year on year. A lower tax rate in
2009, and as we pointed out in August, we began to reinvest the $0.10 of earnings upside from the first half. Let me
walk you through the bridge. Starting with Q3 of 2009, we earned $0.55, with $0.03 of that coming from the divested
pizza business. We also spent $0.01 on acquisition acquisition-related costs last year. So from a year-ago base of $0.53,
our operating EPS declined to $0.47. Our Kraft base business delivered $0.01 of operating gains while covering
approximately $0.05 from significantly increased advertising investments. Cadbury contributed $0.12 of operating
earnings in the quarter. And higher interest expense and the change in shares outstanding lowered EPS by $0.11. So as
you can see, the decline in operating EPS can be accounted for by $0.06 of higher year-on-year taxes. This
year-on-year increase in taxes was a function of timing, with greater benefits from discrete items in the prior-year
quarter.
Below the operating EPS line, we incurred a net impact of $0.04 from integration program and acquisition-related
costs, resulting in our reported EPS of $0.43. On a year-to-date basis, improved vol/mix, productivity, and overhead
cost savings have resulted in strong gains in operating earnings. We've done this while continuing to invest in our
brands. And throughout first nine months, we've earned $1.56, leaving us well positioned to deliver our target of at
least $2 for the year.
I'll take a few minutes now to share highlights of our business results by geography.
In North America, we continued to make progress in a very difficult environment. We delivered sequential
improvement in top-line growth. On a combined basis, organic net revenues were up 1% compared with the decline of
1.3% in the second quarter of this year. We continued to investment more behind our power brands, and they responded
by growing 3% in the quarter. Chips Ahoy, Velveeta, and Kraft Mac & Cheese, for example, grew double-digits, while
Ritz, Starbucks, and Oscar Mayer Deli Fresh grew high single digits.
This solid progress, however, was partially offset by three things. First, soft categories and less merchandising,
especially in our snacks business. Second, tough comps, particularly in our Cadbury business. While Stride and
Dentyne gum delivered strong growth, we were up against last year's highly successful launch of Trident Layers, as
well as strong shipments of Halls as customers stocked up in anticipation of an H1N1 flu season. And third, while
pricing in response to higher input costs was a key driver of our top-line growth, we did see some pressure on vol/mix.
However, as we look forward, we have solid programming in place, and we anticipate more merchandising activity.
Therefore, we expect further sequential improvement in organic growth across our North American portfolio in the
fourth quarter.
Now let's look at profitability. On a combined basis, our operating income margin in North America was 17.3%. In our
Kraft base business, OI margin declined to 16.9%. This is due primarily to a double-digit increase in advertising. These
brand-building investments were funded by continuing benefits from productivity and overhead cost reductions. While
input costs spiked in the quarter, we moved quickly to price accordingly. In fact, we've implemented or announced
price increases in about 40% of our North American portfolio. However, price realization will lag higher input cost, at
least in the short term. Our Cadbury business posted strong operating income margins of 22.9%. Productivity gains and
improved product mix were partially offset by higher spending behind new products.
In Europe, combined organic revenues increased 1.1%, fueled by our power brands, which collectively grew 3%.
Across our Kraft base business, organic revenues grew 1.7%, as vol/mix gains resulted from increased focus and
marketing support. The results were mixed across categories. Coffee and cheese both grew mid-single digits. Jacobs,
Carte Noire, Kenco, and Tassimo drove solid vol/mix gains in coffee. And new product launches and a successful
marketing campaign produced continued growth in Philadelphia cream cheese. Chocolate revenues were flat.
Continued strength of Freia and Marabou in Scandinavia was offset by weak category performance in other parts of
Europe.
In biscuits, revenues declined slightly. Strong growth in power brands including Oreo and Velveeta was offset by the
timing of promotional activity and weak category performance. In our Cadbury business, organic net revenues declined
by 0.4%. Soft markets in Continental Europe, especially in gum, offset solid growth in Britain and Ireland. Despite this,

Cadbury brands are holding or gaining share across Europe. Operating income margins in Europe rose to 12.4% on a
combined basis.
In our Kraft base business, OI margins improved by 140 basis points to 11.6%. This reflected continued productivity
gains and lower overheads. Advertising spending for the quarter was down in this region, due to the timing of
programming. I would note, however, that it's up on a year-to-date basis. In addition, we shifted some A&C spending
from the base Kraft business to Cadbury.
Our Cadbury business also made a solid profit contribution in the quarter. Product mix improved, and we continued to
realize the benefits of supply chain efficiencies. As in North America, input costs are rising significantly, and we're
pricing accordingly. In fact, we've taken pricing or announced price increases on more than half of our European
portfolio.
Turning now to developing markets, combined organic net revenue increased 4.8%. This was fueled by the continuing
strength of our power brands, which were up 12%. This drove double-digit growth in both Asia Pacific and Latin
America. In contrast to North America and Europe, however, we're seeing a sequentially smaller contribution from
pricing in this region, because inflation is now lower in many countries. In our Kraft base business, organic revenues
grew 7.4% Specifically, in Asia Pacific, China and Indonesia led the way. And power brands grew more than 30%,
propelled by Tang powder beverage and Oreo cookies. And in Latin America, power brands grew 18%, led by Oreo
and Club Social biscuits and Lacta chocolate. These gains were partially offset by weak economic conditions and
category trends in CEEMA. Despite this, we improved market shares in most markets.
In our Cadbury business, organic revenues rose just 0.7%. This was expected, as our actions to normalize trade
inventories reduced Cadbury's growth by about 4 percentage points. Cadbury growth was also tempered by weakness in
the gum category due to weak economic conditions. Our operating income margin in developing markets was 12.7%.
Our base business profit margins declined to 13.1% as we stepped up advertising investments across the region. These
investments more than offset gains in vol/mix and overhead leverage. Profit performance in our Cadbury business also
reflected incremental advertising, as well as the impact of normalizing trade inventories.
So in sum, we delivered solid top- and bottom-line performance in every geography, behind our power brands.
Now I'd like to turn the call back to Irene, who will discuss our outlook and provide an update on the Cadbury
integration.
Irene Rosenfeld, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Tim.
As we look to the fourth quarter, despite the economic challenges, we anticipate a sequential increase in top-line
growth. And we're well positioned to deliver combined organic revenue growth of 3% to 4% for the full year. This is a
solid base from which we'll generate top-tier growth in 2011 and beyond.
As we've said, pricing will contribute more to our revenue growth than we anticipated at the start of the year. To
backstop the pricing, we have solid Q4 programming in place, particularly in North America and Europe, which will
accelerate growth and deliver our revenue guidance for the year. On the bottom line, as Tim said, we expect to deliver
operating EPS of at least $2. At the same time, we'll fund increased A&C, from about 7.5% last year to about 8% of net
revenues in 2010.
Turning to the Cadbury integration, it continues to proceed smoothly. We're on track to generate cost synergies of at
least $750 million in annual savings, about 15% of which will come this year. We're also on track to greatly improve
our earnings growth trajectory. We're integrating Cadbury and driving the substantial savings and growth opportunities
now available to us. As a result, our combined operating EPS by 2012 will surpass considerably what we could have
achieved on our own. And we remain confident in our ability to deliver significantly higher long-term earnings growth
of 9% to 11%.

So to sum up, our flywheel is turning, and we're benefiting from a virtuous cycle of growth and focused reinvestment.
We're setting growth objectives off a solid base. We're managing input costs by maintaining strong brand equities and
pricing accordingly. We're driving gains in volume and mix through focused investments in power brands and key
markets. We're driving productivity and reducing overhead costs to expand margins. And we're reinvesting a portion of
our earnings upside to further strengthen our brands and lay an even stronger foundation for top-tier performance in
2011.
Now we'd be happy to take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Vincent Andrews>: Thank you; good afternoon, everyone. If I could just ask a question about the input
environment, as well as the pricing environment. And I guess as we think back to the last time all this took place and
prices went up, and if I remember correctly, there was a lot of volume/mix and share issues in the heritage Kraft
business. And it looked like that's starting a little bit here. How confident are you really that you can shore that up so
quickly?
<A - Timothy McLevish, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Well, Vincent, there's no
question there was rapid escalation of many or most of our input costs, starting late the second quarter and in through
the third quarter. One fundamental difference between last time this happened and this time is that our brands are much
stronger than they were last time. At last time we were a bit reluctant, because of the relatively weak brand equities, to
price aggressively. We've come out of the chute and quickly responded with pricing. We're entering that into generally
a weak consumer environment, but so far we're quite pleased with the reaction from our customers, direct customers,
retail partners, and the consumer response has been okay as well.
<Q - Vincent Andrews>: And I guess just as a follow-up to that, or maybe two follow-ups, on the adaptive pricing in
cheese, is that still the plan? And then also, obviously I think the other thing that's different about this time versus last
time, there's a lot more promotional spending going on. And are you seeing your competitors act rationally from a
promotional spending perspective as you take pricing? Are they following you? Is private label following? And that's
all I have. Thanks.
<A - Irene Rosenfeld, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Vincent, I'd say we feel very good that our adaptive
pricing is working. I think it's particularly important in an environment of volatile commodity costs. And so being able
to price closer to the market, I think, is serving us well. And I think we feel better about our cheese business than we
have in a long time. So we feel pretty good about that.
Generally speaking, we have priced – as Tim said, we moved rather quickly to be able to address the escalating input
costs. Generally speaking, we have not yet seen much from our competition, and I think it's one of the reasons that our
volume/mix in the quarter was a little bit softer. But the reality is, costs are going up for everyone. And we would
expect that price gaps will narrow as the fourth quarter progresses.
<Q - Vincent Andrews>: Thank you very much.
<A - Timothy McLevish, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Thank you, Vincent.

<A - Irene Rosenfeld, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Hey, Andrew.
<A - Timothy McLevish, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: How you doing, Andrew?
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Well, thank you. So Irene, a couple things. One, on some of the pricing moves you've taken,
you mentioned quite a bit of pricing on some of the pass-through categories that are larger for you, whether it be coffee,
cheese, and what-have-you. Have you taken any pricing actions or even prospectively taken some that may not have
flowed through results yet in sort of the sort of core non-pass-through sort of categories, whether that be biscuits, or
dressings, things of that nature?
<A - Irene Rosenfeld, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: The answer is yes. I mean, we've priced pretty
broadly across our categories, and it's a combination of what you would call pass-through and others, not all of which
have flowed through the P&L at this point. But as you can see in the contribution of pricing to our vol/mix
performance, to our revenue performance, in the quarter, you can see the impact of much of the pricing so far.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: In light of that, as you think out to the fourth quarter and then more importantly really in 2011,
the ongoing algorithm to get to sort of your organic top-line growth rate is typically, I think you see, two-thirds volume
and a third sort of price/mix. And I assume a more normalized sort of environment. Is that still the case, do you think,
for the fourth quarter or next year? Or should we really expect, in light of some of the pricing moves that you've taken
and are going to take, that that kind of turns on its head a little bit and becomes – maybe it's two-third price, one-third
volume? Or how should we think about that?
<A - Irene Rosenfeld, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I think the dislocation was particularly acute in this
quarter. So I think without a doubt we certainly stand behind the belief that the long-term profile will be an equal mix, a
balanced mix, of vol/mix and pricing. I think you'll start to see some of that play through in the fourth quarter and
certainly into 2011.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: The fact that it was more acute this quarter, particularly with all the brand spending that you've
done over the last three years – I guess were you surprised that the brands didn't maybe, particularly in North America,
hold up somewhat better on the volume side with some of this pricing? Or was it really just that you led in a lot of areas
and the hope and expectation is that, clearly, given the pressure everyone's facing, you're going to see everyone else
kind of come on board and ultimately volume looks a little bit less sort of – down less significantly?
<A - Irene Rosenfeld, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: No, I think as we said earlier, we moved a little
more quickly than others in the market. And as we saw input costs going up. But the reality is those costs are going up
for everyone and so we would expect to see a narrowing of those gaps over the coming weeks and months. And I think
that will be beneficial to our vol/mix in many categories.
<A - Timothy McLevish, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I'd also point out that in the third
quarter, we had difficult comps from last year. As I commented, we were comping against the Trident Layers launch,
the strong season with the H1N1 build in the retail trade. As we go into the fourth quarter and – or I'm sorry, the third
quarter also was the quarter, late in the quarter, when we kind of lapped the merchandising issue that we've talked
about for the last several quarters with one of our major retail customers.
So going into the fourth quarter, we will have much better comps, and therefore the year-on-year improvement in
vol/mix we would expect to see.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Got it. Okay, thanks. The last thing, only because all these headlines seem to be streaming
across as we speak, is just this decision, I guess, by Starbucks to end the retail distribution in coffee with Kraft. Perhaps
you can just fill us in a little bit on how significant that is, maybe what led to that, and sort of what the broader context
of that is.
<A - Timothy McLevish, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, I'll start by giving a little
context. We've had a strong partnership with Starbucks for the retail distribution of the Starbucks and Seattle's Best
Coffee for the last 12 years, since about 1998. We've built that business, along with Starbucks, from a small $50

million compounded annual growth rate, on top line of in excess of 20% per year. Today it's around a $500 million
business. We think both parties have been well served by our partnership.
Starbucks, as you perhaps know, in recent times, has expressed their desire to control their strategic brands. And we
have had some discussions in recent weeks to that effect. They have not officially – or formally announced their intent
to dismantle the agreement, but we have had some discussions. The effect that – as we get into it, and we can't at this
point speculate exactly how that may happen or when that may happen. But again, we respect their decision to consider
ending the agreements, and we'll inform you as more developments come to pass.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Okay, because I think they're, I guess, talking about it on their conference call, I think, perhaps
as we speak, and that's where this is all coming from. And to the extent that does happen, is that sort of inclusive in the
way you're thinking about 2011, from a top- and bottom-line perspective, or would that meaningfully change the
algorithm?
<A - Timothy McLevish, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Andrew, it's really premature.
Again, we have not had formal conversations. Again, with a deep and broad partnership over the years, we're in regular
discussions about a variety of topics. We know that this has been on their minds, but we haven't entered into any
specific conversations about the when or the why or the how. So it would be premature to speculate as to the impact it
may have.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Thanks very much.
<A - Timothy McLevish, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Sure.
Operator
Your next question comes from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Hi, thank you. I guess my – I have a follow-up on the Starbucks question. Most licensing
agreements, I would imagine it's within the power of the licensor to decide whether or not the contract can be broken. I
think General Mills has that in yogurt. Is this a different type of contract? I guess – does Starbucks always have the
right to exit this contract, or do you have any kind of recourse?
<A - Timothy McLevish, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Well, we really don't want to get
into the specifics of the contractual relationship we have with them. It is a perpetual agreement, and they do preserve
some rights. But again, until we get into specific conversations with them, we would prefer to reserve comment.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Okay, let me ask a different question, then. For next year, midteens EPS growth would be
kind of the most robust EPS growth that Kraft has delivered. And I'm just wondering, given what you've seen this year
in the environment, consumer environment, and also the fact that North America – it seems pretty clear, and I listened
to Tony Vernon very carefully, that it's pretty early culturally at North America. They're not totally staffed the way they
want to be yet. Maybe the marketing ideas aren't all there yet. Is this – is it too soon to grow at this pace, 15% EPS,
given that maybe – that half the business is still kind of in the early stages of a cultural turnaround?
<A - Irene Rosenfeld, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Rob, I would say we still stand behind our
commitment to midteens growth in 2010, on top of this year's earnings of at least $2. The reality is we have a lot of
good stuff going on in there. There were some anomalies in our 2010 numbers that we've talked about. And as we
begin to restore some of our merchandising support, as we find ourselves in – ideally in a more stable commodity
environment, I think there's a number of things, together with the very significant cost-focused programs that we've
been involved in over the last couple of years, in procurement and manufacturing and distribution, together with the
synergies that come from the combination with Cadbury. So I would say as we look at the overall profile, the growth
profile of the portfolio, from a category standpoint, from a geographic footprint standpoint, together with the
opportunities on the cost side, we feel quite comfortable with the forecast that we've laid out.

<A - Timothy McLevish, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I would just elaborate on Irene's
comments. She picked up on the synergies, but you may recall the phasing of synergies, we said that in 2011 we expect
to realize 70% of the $750 million of synergies on top of the 15% this year. So you can see – you can calculate the
year-on-year difference will be a significant contributor to that growth into 2011.
<A - Irene Rosenfeld, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I think the last point I'd make, Rob, is it should be
clear to you, we are doing everything we need to, to protect the business in the short term, as well as stage it for the
longer term. And I want to underscore the fact, the investments that we have made and we are planning to continue to
make are designed to ensure that this business is well positioned for long-term growth. And so I feel very good about
the profile of the portfolio, as well as the investments that we have made and will continue to make over the course of
2011.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: I appreciate the conviction. Thank you very much.
<A - Timothy McLevish, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Welcome.

Your next question comes from Terry Bivens of JPMorgan.
<Q - Terry Bivens>: Good afternoon, everybody.
<A - Timothy McLevish, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: How you doing, Terry?
<A - Irene Rosenfeld, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi, Terry.
<Q - Terry Bivens>: Very good, thank you. I guess if Rob is after conviction, I suppose I'm after a little bit more
comfort for the fourth quarter, because frankly the organic growth rate came in a little bit lighter than I was expected.
Irene, what could you give us to give us a little bit more comfort around a better organic growth rate in the fourth
quarter to get to your stated 3% to 4%?
<A - Irene Rosenfeld, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, that's a good question, Terry. I would tell you
just to do the math. To deliver 3% to 4% for the year, given our year-to-date performance, we have to do at least 4% in
the fourth quarter. I am quite confident that we will do that. I feel very good about our Q4 programs – Tim talked about
a number of the programs – and I'm pretty comfortable that we should end up somewhere in the middle of that range.
Obviously, exactly where we end up has a lot to do with how well the consumer responds to our programming, as well
as the customer execution of our merchandising activity. But that's how you should feel quite comfortable, as we do,
that we are clearly going to deliver in the 3% to 4% range, as we've targeted.
<Q - Terry Bivens>: Okay. And just a quick follow, kind of the same thing applied to Europe. The growth rates there
were a bit slower than I expected. Were they slower than you expected, or had you expected a little bit of that
deceleration from what we saw in Q2?
<A - Irene Rosenfeld, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, no, we actually – the European performance
was very much in line with our expectations. I think they're going to have a very strong year, and we feel very good
about their performance, not only on the top line, but we are very comfortably in the 12% double-digit margin range,
and they continue to make excellent progress on their margin expansion. So I think that business has good underlying
momentum, without a doubt some geographic challenges given the economic situation, but I think they've done an
excellent job of managing through it.
<Q - Terry Bivens>: Okay. And just one quick thing. Our guys at Blemling now are beginning to get worried with
grain prices going up, and they had forecasted dropping milk and cheese prices next year. If we get into a bad situation
there, is there anything you can do to kind of protect yourself ahead of time if cheese prices get a little wacky in 2011?

<A - Timothy McLevish, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Well, you know, on most of our
input costs, on our major commodity input costs, we have a very active hedging program. As a major player in this
industry, we have a pretty robust kind of a forecasting group that stays apprised of all of the developments in crop
cycles, and those sort of things. So we have some visibility into what an expectation is directionally, and we have a
very active hedging program. But the most important thing is the hedging is only there until we're able to price. And so
our expectation is with continued investment, the continued strength in brand equities, that we'll be able to price to
offset any future changes in input costs.

Your next question comes from Diane Geissler of CLSA.
<Q - Diane Geissler>: Good afternoon.
<A - Irene Rosenfeld, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Good afternoon, Diane.
<Q - Diane Geissler>: I just wanted to ask about your goal that you stated at your Analysts Day, the 1 billion in
revenue synergies. It sounds like from your commentary today that you feel like you've cleaned up the issue with
regard to some of the excess inventory in the channel, in the developing markets. Could you just talk about your
expectations for the $1 billion over the next three years, how you expect that to flow? And even if you can give us
some guidance on maybe through 2011. Is that more back-end loaded? Could you just talk about that a little?
<A - Irene Rosenfeld, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, well, first of all, what we laid out, Diane, was
about $1 billion of revenue synergies that we see. About half of that would come from route to market, putting legacy
Kraft products through the Cadbury infrastructure and vice versa. About a third of it comes from brand extensions,
simply taking some of the ideas on Cadbury, bringing it to Kraft products, and vice versa. And the rest of it comes from
bringing products like Dairy Milk to new markets that they're (33.56) distributed in today.
The opportunity, though – first of all, the profit benefit of that will come a little bit later because most of those
opportunities will require some investment. So when we talk the $750 million of synergy, that is through cost synergy.
We've not made a lot of assumptions in the near term of profit coming off of the revenue. But the top-line benefit will
come at the very least in late 2011 into 2012 and beyond. So it's going to take us a while to get some of those
opportunities jump-started to complete our integration, et cetera.
<A - Timothy McLevish, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: You'll begin seeing next year the
benefits on the top line, but you won't see any bottom-line benefit playing out until probably 2012, 2013. What profit
we do generate next year, we'll just plow into building the next year's worth of top-line growth.
<Q - Diane Geissler>: Okay, so what I'm hearing, I just want to clarify, it's more of a benefit toward the back end of
2011, and that's really contingent upon continued integration of the two entities in the first half of 2011?
<A - Irene Rosenfeld, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes, but again, I think it's back half into 2012. We
really are – the real benefit from revenue synergies will really start to impact our top line more meaningfully beginning
in 2012.
<Q - Diane Geissler>: Okay, so then I guess to hit the 5% revenue target you have for 2011, it's really the base
business itself?
<A - Timothy McLevish, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, it's the base business. We
will pick up some of the revenues synergies in the back half of the year, as Irene just mentioned. The other thing I think
important to point out is, as you know, every seven years or so in this industry, there is a 53rd week. And so 2011

represents that year that we will have a 53rd week. If do you the simple arithmetic, it would suggest you have 2%. The
reality of it is you're adding a couple – you're adding a week of the year between Christmas and New Year. But we
would expect that it's a percent to a percent and a half worth of benefit associated with kind of the calendar change and
associated 53rd week.
<Q - Diane Geissler>: Okay. And then just one quick housekeeping. Can you help me with the tax rate for 2010? What
are your expectations there?
<A - Timothy McLevish, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah. I mean, it's pretty
consistent. Earlier in the year – we started out the year with an expectation it was going to be a little bit above 30%. In
the second quarter, with some discrete items, some settlements, some audits and so forth, we dropped that a little bit
below 30%, and we don't have an update. We would still expect it to be – the rate this quarter benefited by some
discrete items, but that's reflected in our under 30% tax rate expectation for the year.
<Q - Diane Geissler>: Okay, just wanted to make sure there was no change there. Perfect, thank you.

Your next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.
<Q - Bryan Spillane>: Hi, good evening.
<A - Irene Rosenfeld, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Hey, Bryan.
<Q - Bryan Spillane>: Just a couple of points of clarification. First, Tim, I guess just your response to Diane's question
just now. Does at least 5% organic revenue growth next year include the 53rd week, or is that excluding the 53rd week?
<A - Timothy McLevish, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: No, it's including the 53rd week.
So we will pick up a point or a point and a half from – we've got some 53rd week and some other miscellaneous
calendar changes, and that would represent somewhere between 1% and 1.5%. That's included in our 5-plus.
<Q - Bryan Spillane>: Okay. So then it would be – so on an equal week basis, it would be 3.5% to 4% organic
growth?
<A - Timothy McLevish, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: That would be fair, yes.
<Q - Bryan Spillane>: Okay. All right. And then in the quarter, just two items. There was a reversal, I think, of an
accrual, a $9 million reversal of a restructuring accrual. And also, looks like – were pension expenses also higher in the
quarter? Can you kind of talk through that and also whether or not there will be more of that in the fourth quarter?
<A - Timothy McLevish, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, no, the pension expenses
were no higher in the third quarter than in prior quarters.
<Q - Bryan Spillane>: Okay.
<A - Timothy McLevish, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: And we – typically we'll
determine the pension expense for the year based upon the assets and liability position, discount rate, et cetera, the end
of the prior year. So there wouldn't be any change in the course of the year. There were some miscellaneous cleanups of
accruals and so forth that happened in the quarter that oftentimes do. But it's nothing material to worry about.
<Q - Bryan Spillane>: Okay, great. Thank you.

Your next question comes from Jon Feeney of Janney.
<Q - Jonathan Feeney>: Good afternoon, thanks. I just wanted to dig in a little bit on – for next year – maybe this is a
nitpicky question for Tim. But it seems like the – what would Kraft base businesses' trends have been on a two-year
basis, reflected in that guidance? Because I see 750 in cost synergies, and I guess I don't see a lot of other sort of
earnings growth for the base business relative to that plan. Could you kind of talk a little bit about that? What roughly
would that have been?
<A - Timothy McLevish, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Well, I think I'm picking up on
the answer to your question. There's the 750 of cost synergy that we've identified relative to the Cadbury integration.
We said that 15% of that or so, we would realize this year. We're tracking on that or ahead of that.
<Q - Jonathan Feeney>: Right.
<A - Timothy McLevish, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: We said that we would in 2011
be about a 70% run rate. The differential would be 55%. So you're talking about, say, $400 million worth of
year-on-year increase attributable to the synergies. That's probably half of the growth that we're expecting to see based
upon our midteens growth. So the rest of it is base business growth.
<Q - Jonathan Feeney>: Well, actually let me be a little bit more clear. You did $2.02 in fiscal '09 before acquiring
Cadbury. So if you took out $0.05 for the pizza business, that would get you to $1.97. 750 on a tax-adjusted basis, I'm
getting to something like in aggregate about $0.26. And if you do what you just said you're going to do, you're going to
be doing about 2.30 to 2.40-ish. So that would give me like $0.10 of EPS growth on a two-year basis for the base
business. Is that about right?
<A - Timothy McLevish, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, you're taking it back to
2009, so -
<Q - Jonathan Feeney>: Yeah.
<A - Timothy McLevish, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: you're into '09 to '10 to '11.
<Q - Jonathan Feeney>: Yes.
<A - Timothy McLevish, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, I mean, there's a variety –
we kind of walked through a bridge earlier in the year when we set out the guidance of 2009 to 2010. And we kind of
showed how we kind of went from $2 to remained at $2 for the year, with a variety of factors, including a fair amount
of investment back of some of the synergies, and building on some of the brand investments.
<A - Chris Jakubik, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Yeah, and Jon, I think in terms of how you're doing your
math, I think you're dropping 100% of the synergies. What we've said when we laid out the program, we said that
you've got integration synergies of 750 million, but we also said at the same time we'd probably reinvest about 25% of
that back into the business. So I think you got to be a little bit careful in terms of how you're doing your math and how
you're doing your attributions.
<Q - Jonathan Feeney>: That makes sense. So I guess the question, the one follow-up I then have, is as far as the –
what kind of signposts would you see, like six months out from now? Because I certainly get how you get to the
numbers, and I understand it's been a surprising cost-push environment. But would you expect – with the stronger
brands, the brand investment you're making – where would that return on that investment sort of manifest itself? Would
you expect to have like 2% or 3% volume by mid next year? Or what would you point to to say, here's where we're
getting the real return on that increase in advertising spending?
<A - Irene Rosenfeld, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well just – let me add to that one Jon. I think what
you should look for is sequential improvement in top line, which, as we've suggested to you, you would begin to see
this year, and in North America which has been one of our challenges, you are seeing that in the third quarter, and it
will continue into the fourth quarter. And you also see a better combination and contribution of pricing and vol/mix to

revenue growth. So as we said, as we get into a more normalized environment and we get most of the pricing behind
us, we should see a better balance between pricing and vol/mix. And those would be the signposts I'd look for, together
with continued progress on margins, for all the reasons that we've laid out.

Your next question comes from David Driscoll of Citi Investments.
<Q - David Driscoll>: Great, thank you. Good evening, everyone.
<A - Timothy McLevish, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Hello, David.
<A - Irene Rosenfeld, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Hey, David.
<Q - David Driscoll>: I want to focus on pricing, specifically on coffee, but this has nothing to do with Starbucks.
Coffee has hit a 13-year high, and you and your competitors have all announced price increases. How are consumers
responding to the August price hikes? And then I would note that recent Nielsen data was showing that volumes were
slowing year on year even before the price hikes, so assuming that they're fully implemented, are you actually seeing
material volume degradation, or do you expect to?
<A - Irene Rosenfeld, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I think most of our coffee franchisers are – actually
did quite well in the quarter. So we did see – one of our businesses, our Maxwell House business, we shifted some of
our promotional timing, and so you'd see that would've had some impact on our third quarter results. That'll come back
in the fourth quarter. There's no question, as we take pricing, there is a consumer response, but it takes awhile to adjust
to the new price levels. But we see nothing in the marketplace that would suggest that it's going to be an issue for us as
we go forward.
<Q - David Driscoll>: And Irene, just to follow up. Coffee, it's a tough category for me to look at, because there's
somewhat of an addiction to the product, first off. And secondly, I think consumers might be somewhat trained to
having very volatile prices. So I was just looking for any color on the elasticities that you expect. And then the
13-year-high stuff just caused me to be a little bit worried.
<A - Timothy McLevish, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I think, though, over time that
you have seen a fair amount of volatility, and it is pretty much of a pass-through category. And the consumers, I think,
are conditioned to that volatility in price. So I think there is pretty good price elasticity.
<Q - David Driscoll>: So you don't sound too worried about that one. Can you make one comment on the rate of
inflation for 2011? What is your expectation at this point?
<A - Timothy McLevish, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, we're not going to provide
specific guidance on inflation at this point. I mean, we believe the nature of our business and the strengthening of our
brands were able to respond to economic environments and cost environments, and we feel pretty comfortable with
that.
<Q - David Driscoll>: Will you do so on the fourth quarter conference call?
<A - Timothy McLevish, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: When we give 2011 guidance,
we'll give you specifics on our expectations for Kraft. But we really don't forecast GDPs, inflation rates, et cetera.
<Q - David Driscoll>: I understand. Thank you.
<A - Timothy McLevish, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Okay, thank you.

Your next question comes from Ed Aaron of RBC Capital.
<Q - Edward Aaron>: Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask a follow-up on the pricing environment in
the third quarter. I'm just trying to understand what really changed so quickly in terms of the pricing for the quarter? I
understand that the commodities obviously moved quickly, but you kind of indicated last quarter that you felt
compelled to get maybe more aggressive in the quarter to defend share in response to what some of your competitors
were doing. So it's just not entirely intuitive to me why you would be moving actually faster than your peers seem to
be.
<A - Irene Rosenfeld, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I guess I would like to distinguish, Ed,
between list pricing changes and promotional changes. We were very clear in our second quarter call, and I would say
we remain committed to the fact that we are making significant investments in the equity of our brands, and we are not
inclined to play around with short-term promotional pricing that doesn't really have a benefit for the long-term health of
the business. So we still feel that way. The reality is in many cases we were looking at costs that were up 20% and 30%
versus prior year. And they're just significant, and we feel if we intend to continue to make the necessary investments
in supporting our brands and in introducing new products, we need to make sure that we're able to cover those costs.
<Q - Edward Aaron>: Okay, thanks. And then just on the 2011 outlook, I guess I'm accustomed to thinking about
organic growth as excluding any differences in the number of weeks. Is there a fundamental reason why you wouldn't
be comfortable with a 5%-plus in organic growth number on kind of a comparable-weeks basis next year, kind of in
line with your stated algorithm?
<A - Timothy McLevish, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, I think with the recency of
the integration of – I mean, we feel very strongly that on a going-forward basis, when we build our markets and so
forth, with the Cadbury, and we do get the full integration done and so forth, that our portfolio will command a 5-plus.
With the fragility of the consumer, with the high inflation we've just talked about, with still a pretty early integration of
the Cadbury, we're not quite ready to step up to the full 5-plus percent that we expect the portfolio to deliver on a
going-forward basis. But again, we get the benefit of an extra, shortened week in 2011. So I think that 5-plus including
that extra week is the right growth for us.
<Q - Edward Aaron>: Understood, thank you.

Your next question comes from Chris Growe of Stifel Nicolaus.
<Q - Christopher Growe>: Hi, good afternoon.
<A - Timothy McLevish, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Hey.
<Q - Christopher Growe>: I have a couple questions for you. The first one, in relation to your sales growth target for
this year, you have a range of 3% to 4%. You've talked about the recovery at Walmart, one of your key customers, and
I just want to get maybe an update on how that's going, whether it's actionality or your merchandising efforts overall.
To me, in walking the stores, it sure looks like you've picked up there quite a bit in terms of activity.
<A - Irene Rosenfeld, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, we certainly feel that in a number of their
stores, we are beginning to see some of the merchandising come back. We've been working very actively with Walmart
to put back merchandising, particularly on products like our snacks products and some of our grocery products that are
particularly sensitive to the merchandising support. And as a result, we do expect to see sequential improvement in the
fourth quarter versus the growth in the third quarter. The reality, though, is given the speed with which some of this is
being executed and some of what's going on in the economic environment, I think the reality is that we're unlikely to
see the full impact of those changes until next year.

<Q - Christopher Growe>: So is that still a swing factor for your revenue growth this year?
<A - Irene Rosenfeld, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes, it is. Yes, that is the difference.
<A - Timothy McLevish, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: It's kind of the difference, as
Irene pointed out kind of somewhere in the mid-3's, so the middle part of that range, that was kind of the swing factor
to determine where in that range.
<Q - Christopher Growe>: Okay. And then do you still have further inventory changes to make at Cadbury? Are
those all complete as of this quarter?
<A - Timothy McLevish, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: We have a little bit more to go in
the fourth quarter. We're two-thirds to three-fourths finished with it. But the other 25%, 30% will come in the fourth
quarter. Then we'll be finished.
<Q - Christopher Growe>: Okay. And then just one final question for you on Cadbury. It's surprising to see it as a
drag to your revenue or a slower revenue growth versus base Kraft. And I know there's some reasons for that. I guess
what I'm trying to understand is that going forward, is it innovation, is it marketing? What are the things that are going
to help you drive stronger revenue growth at Cadbury? Or the base Cadbury business?
<A - Irene Rosenfeld, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, Chris, let me say first of all, we've continued
to feel terrific about the Cadbury acquisition. It will have, and is already having the transformational impact on our
portfolio that we had hoped it would have. If you recall, their plan was front-half loaded, reflecting a number of factors.
The first is, as Tim referenced, a number of the new product launches, Trident Layers, the reality of having a very
strong set of shipments in advance of the flu season. And there was a fairly significant push that they made in the
second half of 2009. So we had expected to see a stronger performance from the business, front half versus back half.
And then on top of it, we did choose to normalize some of the inventories, as we've described.
The business is generally delivering exactly as we had expected. We've got some issues here and there. Gum is a little
bit weaker in a number of markets in the world, but that is being offset by some chocolate strength in a number of
markets in the world. So net-net, we feel very good about the acquisition and about the integration, and I think some of
what we're seeing in the third quarter and the back half of the year was to be expected.
<Q - Christopher Growe>: Okay, thank you.

Your next question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Judy Hong>: Thanks. Just a few questions for me. Irene, the last time that the food manufacturers took pricing,
you did see the element of consumers trading down to private labels. And as you think about the fragility of the
consumers, as you've called out, this time around, I'm wondering what you think about sort of the potential for trading
down as the prices go up at the consumer level?
<A - Irene Rosenfeld, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I think the consumer is clearly sensitive to
value. And I think the first point I would make is there's so much focus on price. What we are seeing in so many of our
categories, it's much more about value. And we have spent a lot of our investment money ensuring that our brands – or
that we have good, healthy brand equity, and investing in our new product pipeline. And I think we are well positioned
to be able to support the higher levels of pricing.
Without a doubt there will be some pressure on our franchises, but I think we are well positioned, and what we've
continued to see is that it is the third and fourth brands in the category that are being most impacted by the private label
performance. Not so much our brands, and I think we will see that in the coming months.

<Q - Judy Hong>: Okay. And then Tim, I know you're not giving us the inflation number for next year, but can you
give us some perspective on your view of sort of what you think gross margins would do next year in terms of being
flat, up, or down? And then maybe more specifically, the phasing of gross margin? Because it sounds like you'll take
pricing, but you may not catch up to cost until maybe the back half of next year. So are we looking at first-half margins
down and then picking up next year? – in the back half? Or how should we think about that?
<A - Timothy McLevish, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: We've given guidance for OI
margin, said that we will be midteens beginning in 2011. That reflects, you know, continued growth of our margins, it's
driven by, you know, cost productivity, overhead reductions, procurement efficiencies, et cetera, as well as the leverage
from volume growth. I mean, my expectation is, I mean, we can't predict precisely what's in – and I don't want to go
out there and predict what's going to happen with input costs and so forth. But they are at a pretty high level. We are
pricing to compensate for those currently. That will play out over the course of the fourth quarter and probably into the
first quarter. So I would expect those to be covered.
So I would expect a reasonably balanced over the course of the year margin. Maybe it will progressively improve some
over the course of the year, just the normal seasonality, as well as allowing our productivity and overhead reductions to
kick in. But from a gross margin standpoint, I would expect to be pretty balanced over the year.
<Q - Judy Hong>: Okay. And then the midteens earnings growth target for 2011 is on a currency-neutral basis?
<A - Timothy McLevish, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I mean, it reflects kind of the
current exchange rates as they exist today. If there is material change to that, we'll have to discuss it. But I think we're
able to manage that. Quite frankly, we have a very complex portfolio of currencies. So we are less impacted by just a
decline in the value of the dollar or an appreciation of the dollar, because we have a lot of our input costs. I mean, our
manufacturing is usually in the local countries. We source some of our costs by virtue of – sourcing of cocoa is
denominated in pounds and coffee in dollars, et cetera, so we have a pretty balance. So we don't get as impacted by FX
as one might assume.
<Q - Judy Hong>: Okay. So do you mean that at spot rates, there's pretty much neutral impact on 2011 from currency?
<A - Timothy McLevish, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I would say – yeah, our midteens
would reflect kind of current currency exchange rates.
<Q - Judy Hong>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Timothy McLevish, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I mean, on balance this year,
despite a fair amount of volatility in the value of the dollar and cross currencies, we have had a penny or two maybe of
favorability for the year.
<Q - Judy Hong>: Yep, okay. Thanks.
<A - Chris Jakubik, Vice President, Investor Relations>: If we could take one more question, thanks.

Your final question comes from Eric Serotta of Wells Fargo.
<Q - Eric Serotta>: Good evening.
<A - Irene Rosenfeld, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Hello, Eric.
<A - Timothy McLevish, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Hi, Eric.
<Q - Eric Serotta>: Wanted to sneak in two questions here. First, if we could just beat the horse dead in terms of
pricing and elasticity. It seems to me that the 3% pricing in North America with a 2% volume tradeoff was actually
pretty good. It seems only going back a quarter or so that food companies were showing pricing down a couple of

percentage points and volume down a couple percentage points. Is that how you're looking at it? Or is that – is this
largely in line with your elasticity models?
<A - Irene Rosenfeld, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: No, in fact that's one of the reasons we feel quite
good about the health of our brands. I'd also tell you that certainly from a vol/mix standpoint we had some tough comps
year-ago. So I really think that as a result of all of the investments that we have made in our brands over these last
couple of years, it's playing through in our ability to take pricing when we need to in response to rising costs, as well as
our ability to continue to support the brands. So we were actually pleased with the sequential performance. We are not
yet where we need to be in North America, but I think we've been clear about what we see as the challenges and what
we're doing about them.
<Q - Eric Serotta>: Great. And on a different subject, on slide number 6, it looks like Cadbury was actually about a
penny accretive to EPS in the quarter, and a couple pennies dilutive for the year to date. I believe last quarter you
reiterated that Cadbury would be about $0.16 dilutive for the full year. Is Cadbury coming in much stronger than that?
Or are you sticking by that $0.16 dilutive number? Because it doesn't really seem to make sense with your performance
year to date.
<A - Timothy McLevish, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, Cadbury is coming about
as expected, and the dilution we would expect to be about $0.16 for the year. What you're missing – and I apologize
that by virtue of the proximity of the interest and the shares increase relative to the Cadbury operating income would
seem to imply that they're directly related. But you may recall that we had the proceeds from the pizza business that we
said was going to benefit us by about $0.09. That is manifested in the shares outstanding dilution piece of it. And so
consequently you have to offset that element of it on the – when you take your $0.12 and your $0.06 and your $0.05,
you have to reflect that the shares would be the better part of $0.09 impact of that. Actually, on a year-to-date basis,
Cadbury is $0.10 or $0.11 dilutive on the way to the 0.16 as we originally laid out.
<Q - Eric Serotta>: Okay, makes a lot more sense. Thanks a lot. I'll pass it on.
<A - Timothy McLevish, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Sure, thank you.
