Ursula M. Burns
Good morning and thanks for joining us today. We'll get started on slide three with a review of the strategic imperatives
that define our business and align with our financial performance.
First, accelerating our services business, growing it faster by diversifying our offerings, aggressively pursuing
opportunities in key growth areas like HR outsourcing, customer care, transportation and healthcare and expanding
globally. In Q1 revenue from services grew 10% in constant currency and now represents more than half of our total
revenue.

Second, maintaining our leadership in technology. Our printing business continues to benefit our bottom line and
remains core to our business model. We are focusing investments on innovation that drives down the cost of color
printing, and we're expanding distribution to extend our reach to small and midsized businesses. We made good
progress in Q1 with installs of Xerox products up 7%. According to recent external market share reports we remain the
leader in equipment revenue share for the ninth straight quarter. In fact, we're taking share from competitors,
strengthening our leadership position.
And third, driving operational excellence across our enterprise, this means adjusting our cost model so we're
competitively advantaged and have the financial flexibility to quickly adapt to changing marketplace needs while
scaling in key growth areas. During Q1 services margin pressure was partially offset by a 5% decline in selling,
administrative and general expenses.
By executing well on these three priorities, we're delivering on the fourth, creating value for our shareholders. Doing so
by growing revenue, delivering solid earnings and allocating capital in the areas of acquisitions, dividends and share
repurchase. So our execution is well aligned with our strategy and is reflected in our performance. But the heavy lifting
is in the details.
Since acquiring ACS more than two years ago we're making a seismic shift in our business. It's not just in how we
operate but also in what we do and for whom we do it, all driven by the diversity of our offerings. As a result, the
Xerox brand is now in places you wouldn't expect and serving industries – industries where our relevance extends way
beyond printing.
For example, just in the past two weeks we've been part of the conversations at two major healthcare conferences,
TEDMED and the World Healthcare Congress. At both we were acknowledged as playing an important role in
simplifying the business of healthcare through electronic medical records, health information exchanges and digital
protocols, all of which help lift administrative burdens for providers. Our technology, like advanced imaging, tends to
enable these activities, but our deep expertise and customized outsourcing offerings make up the total solution.
Please turn to slide four for more examples of what I mean. We read in the headlines that governments need to be more
efficient, but we don't often hear how that is happening each day.
For example, last month the state of Texas announced an $848 million contract with Xerox for a significant overhaul of
their IT systems that will simplify and greatly improve the efficiency of the state's operations. We're consolidating 28
data facilities in two centralized centers, modernizing one of the largest IT systems in the country with improved cloud
services and overall security and disaster recovery capabilities.
And while deals like this get a lot of attention, cloud services are not just built for large enterprises. Through our new
cloud-based platform for small and midsized companies SMBs benefit from the same infrastructure investments that
we make for our largest clients. For all of our clients, large to small, data security is paramount to maintain the integrity
of their operations.
That's why we teamed up with McAfee and Cisco to help ensure the security of data across every touch point: on PCs,
in servers, in the cloud, all the way through to the output on multifunction printers. With this technology backbone, our
services to industries like healthcare take on an even more relevant position. When we're dealing with patient data and
the complexities of modern-day pharmaceuticals all of our innovations, from digital nurse assistants to customized
medication packaging is based on strong security protocols and infrastructures.
That's a quick glimpse of the stories behind the numbers. We'll share more with you each quarter and hopefully these
examples will begin to reframe your perception of Xerox, showcase the amazing opportunity that's in front of us and
better explain the evolving nature of our business mix and model.
Let's look at how this translates into our financial results. Turn to slide five. I'll provide a top-level review, then Luca
will take you through the details. I'll close with our expectations for quarter two and then we'll take your questions.
Slide five. In the first quarter we delivered adjusted EPS of $0.23. On a GAAP basis earnings were $0.19 per share.
This includes $0.04 related to the amortization of intangibles. Earnings which are flat from a year ago are in line with

our expectations and reflect the investments that we're making to grow our services business. Services revenue was up
10% in constant currency and revenue from our technology business declined 5%. In total, revenue of $5.5 billion was
up 1% and 2% in constant currency. Technology revenue was impacted by the continued weak macro environment, the
timing of one distributor's purchase supplies and by clients increasingly shifting to Xerox managed print services,
which was reported in our services segment.
Demand for our industry leading management services led to a 7% increase from revenue from document outsourcing.
ITO revenue was flat, an improving trend from prior quarters, and revenue from business process outsourcing grew
13%. Total signings in the quarter were flat on a trailing 12-month basis, which is what we expected considering the
absence of any mega-deals during the 90-day period.
All in all I'm quite pleased with our growth in services and the benefit it brings to our top-line growth, all while
contributing to our business for the long-term through a healthy base of recurring revenue. Yet in the near term and as
expected, we're facing pressure on margins as we make initial involvements to implement new service contracts. As a
result, operating margin of 8.5% was down 0.6 point and Q1 gross margin of 31% was down two points. This is in the
range of our expectations for the first half of this year and we balanced our investments by continuing to improve SAG
which is now at 19.4% of revenue compared to 20.5% a year ago.
Q1 was a use of cash of $15 million, again, in line with expectations and reflecting the seasonality of our cash flow. We
remain confident in our guidance to generate $2 billion to $2.3 billion in full-year operating cash and we're continuing
to use available cash for acquisitions and share repurchase.
Turn to slide six for a closer look at our top line results. Q1 2012 is the first quarter where services represents more
than half of our total revenue. At 51%, it's up from 47% a year ago and it's an important metric that reflects investment
in building our outsourcing portfolio, expanding our offerings globally and the shifting mix of our business. As I
mentioned, total revenue of $5.5 billion was up 2% in constant currency. Annuity revenue, which is 85% of the total,
was up 2%. Equipment sale revenue was down 1%.
We're still seeing weakness in Europe although it has moderated for the fourth quarter – from the fourth quarter of last
year. Sales in the U.S. were stable in a competitive environment and we're seeing initial benefits from our new sales
coverage strategy. Our wholly owned global imaging dealers are focusing on midsized clients while our direct sales
force becomes more exclusive in pursuing enterprise level technology and MPS opportunities.
In our developing markets we had a strong quarter in equipment sales reflecting the strength of our channel distribution
and competitively priced color devices that serve small and midsized businesses and as I said earlier, all of this activity
included a 7% increase in installs of Xerox document technology. Building up the number of Xerox machines in the
field, what we call MIF, is a good indicator of future annuity growth. Our approach is to lead in color so Xerox ink is
being used to generate the color pages printed in workplaces of any size.
During the quarter our color MIF was up 13%. Growth in services is also a big benefit to our annuity. Taking complex
businesses and simplifying them results in a major win for us and meaningful savings for our clients.
For example, with Gartner and IDC giving Xerox a top ranking for our leadership in Managed Print Services, we're
able to sign large scale MPS deals like the one that we announced recently with WellPoint. We're saving WellPoint
more than $3 million a year by consolidating 9,000 document devices into a lot fewer multifunction system. We've now
assumed full management of California's Medicaid program, a massive undertaking and a milestone as part of our
10-year, $1.6 billion contract signed in 2010. It's the nation's largest Medicaid program serving 7.5 million people and
we've processed more than 90 million claims totaling $7.5 billion just in the past six months.
In Europe and Latin America we are expanding our sales activities and services capabilities. We're signing new
business like the recently – like the recent multimillion dollar contract to manage call center operations for a large IT
organization and one for a global tech manufacturer. We are an extension of their customer care operations, the voice
on the phone and over the web to support their clients' needs.

These and hundreds of other examples represent our real business and the business problems that we're solving for
clients. They bring us value and annuity revenue, they bring us incremental growth opportunities that boost our bottom
line and they prove the sustainable success of the new Xerox.
With that, let me turn it over to Luca. I'll be back to wrap up and open the call to your questions. Luca?
Luca Maestri
Thank you, Ursula. Good morning, everyone.
Ursula just covered revenue and of course we're pleased with the acceleration in services and we expect it to continue.
Technology was lower but should show decline improvement going forward because Q1 of 2011 represented the most
challenging compare of the year for us.
As we expected, gross margin was lower, 200 basis points year-over-year. Two main drivers for the decline: first, half
of the impact can be attributed to the services margin compression due to the ramping of a significant number of new
contracts along with a few higher margin contracts running off. Second, the increasing services mix also drove almost 1
point of decline. The gross margin on our services business is half that of our technology segment, so the strong growth
in services has a direct impact on overall gross margin.
We continue to drive cost and expense efficiencies with SG&A improvement of 110 basis points which went to
partially offset the gross margin pressure. As a result, operating margin was down 60 basis points. We expect both
gross margin and operating margin to improve as we move through the year, and by Q4 expect to see year-over-year
improvement.
Restructuring of $17 million was $32 million higher year-over-year and is fully reflected in our adjusted results.
Adjusted EPS of $0.23 was flat from 2011 with the only adjustment to reported EPS being the amortization of
intangibles.
Let us move to the segment slides. We have updated the content of these pages to also provide a trend view of our
results. Starting with Services we see a very positive trend on revenue with 10% growth in Q1 at constant currency.
This is driven by the strong signs we have had the past two years. The California MMIS deal we're ramping contributed
about a point of growth. Even without that we would have seen significant acceleration with good contribution across
all lines of business, both government and commercial. In particular, government and commercial healthcare and
financial services began the year very strongly. Signings in Q1 were lower year-over-year and flat on a trailing
12-month basis which is not abnormal after the second half that was very strong for us and reflects the fact that we had
no mega-deals signed in the quarter.
New business signings on a trailing 12-month basis are up 12% and drive our revenue growth. We anticipate Q2 will be
a stronger signings quarter given our pipeline. As important as signings, our renewal rates, which are within our target
range of 85% to 90% for our combined BPO and ITO businesses.
We've highlighted the pressure on services margins the past few quarters so the Q1 results were not unexpected: The
largest factor is the ramp of new contracts, which we estimate is two-thirds of the margin decline. The main driver of
the remaining impact comes from lost contracts, specifically, ITO from prior periods. We track margins down to the
contract level and we are taking actions to improve the profitability of those contracts that are in a startup phase. Given
the accelerated growth, we expect the services margin pressure to continue, but we see sequential improvement as we
move through the year and year-over-year margin growth by Q4.
Let's now turn to the technology slide. Technology revenue in Q1 was down 5% at constant currency. Two main factors
drove this performance. The largest impact came from unbundled supplies revenues, which were down 8%. Unbundled
supplies represent a little less than 20% of our technology revenues and are predominantly aligned with entry products.
They can be volatile given channel inventory dynamics which is what we saw this quarter and they were facing a
different compare because Q1 of 2011 was the highest supplies revenue quarter of the year. We expect supplies

revenue to be closer to flat for the rest of the year.
The second and important factor is the continuing impact from the launch of our Partner Print Services offering. This
has been very successful and it's helping to fuel the document outsourcing growth. At the same time it does shift
revenue from technology to services.
From a geographic perspective, Europe was weak, but improved sequentially. Trends in North America and our
developing markets were roughly in line with last year absent the supplies decline. Segment margin of 10.5% was
down slightly from 2011 but reflected continued cost and expense control and a good performance when considering
the lower supplies mix.
The most recent market share results show that we continued to gain share on an equipment revenue basis and we
expect to continue to build on our leadership position in 2012.
Moving on, I'll comment briefly on the key metrics slide. Total services signings of $2.2 billion was lower
year-over-year and were flat on a trailing 12-month basis. As mentioned, previously we did not have any mega-deals in
the quarter but the pipeline remains strong and we expect to have a good Q2 quarter in signings.
We add the renewal rate to this slide as it is an important metric to us and one we want to give more visibility to. In Q1
it was 86%, which is in our target range. Looking at the product related metrics, please keep in mind that these include
the technology segment plus document outsourcing. Total color revenue was flat at constant currency. If we exclude
color printers, which is where we saw the supplies impact, color revenue would be up 3%. Digital machines in field
continue to grow and was up 2% in total and 13% for color capable devices. Digital pages show a stable trend. We're
down 2% with pages from color devices up 10%. Installs were strong with good growth in all color segments except
printers, which was down, driven by lower OEM sales.
We saw strong growth in A4 color multifunction devices and entry production color both areas where we've recently
launched new products. We also continue to see growth in midrange color. Install growth did not translate into
equipment revenue growth given price erosion and mix impacts but this will feed annuity over time.
Moving on to the cash flow slide, cash from operations was in line with our expectations and was a use of $15 million
which compares to a use of $30 million in 2011. Earnings contributed $276 million and consistent with normal
seasonality, working capital during the quarter was a use of $635 million.
Cash contributions to our global pension plans in the quarter were $79 million and combined with $130 million in stock
contribution resulted in total funding in Q1 of $209 million. As mentioned last quarter the timing of pension
contributions this year will be skewed towards the first half. Balance of the year we expect to contribute approximately
another $350 million to our pensions, all in cash.
In terms of investing cash flow, we spent $128 million on CapEx and $87 million on acquisitions. Dividends paid were
$63 million and we repurchased $50 million in stock. We continue to guide for $2 billion to $2.3 billion of operating
cash flow for the year and we continue to plan to use available cash to repurchase between $900 million and $1.1
billion for the year weighted towards the end of the year.
Let us turn to the next slide to quickly review our capital structure. Our Q1 ending debt balance increased to $9.6
billion. Given favorable market conditions, we issued $1.1 billion of notes in March to prefund the $1.1 billion in
senior notes which come due in May. From a maturity standpoint we maintain a well-balanced debt ladder with just
about $1 billion coming due annually.
During the course of the year our debt balance may change moderately given the timing of our cash flows but we
continue to plan for $8.6 billion for year-end debt. The vast majority of our debt is in support of our financing of
customer leases. Of the $9.6 billion debt balance, $6 billion can be associated with the financing of Xerox equipment
for our customers. The finance debt is calculated assuming a seven-to-one leverage of our finance assets of $6.8 billion.
The finance assets represent committed revenue streams from our customers.

In summary, Q1 is seasonally a lighter results quarter, but overall we came in as expected with a standout positive
being the services revenue acceleration. Our number one challenge is to improve services margin. We're very focused
on this objective and see this as an opportunity going forward in terms of future earnings expansion.
In terms of capital allocation, we remain committed to using our strong cash flow to return value to shareholders
through share repurchase, dividends and accretive tuck-in acquisitions. With that, I will hand it back to Ursula.
Ursula M. Burns
Thanks, Luca. Let me quickly wrap up so that we can get to your questions.
Q1 results were as expected. We have work to do on improving margins while we're scaling services growth through
the ramp of new contracts, expanding globally and increasing revenue with existing accounts. In technology, our focus
on competitively advantaged color systems and broader distribution led to strong Q1 install growth and double-digit
digit color MIF growth. We're disciplined in managing expenses, giving us the flexibility we need on margins to
support our services growth. We'll see a sequential improvement in margins throughout the year and continued benefits
from operational efficiencies.
Our guidance on cash remains unchanged as we remain committed to investing in share repurchase throughout the year.
For the second quarter we expect adjusted earnings of $0.25 to $0.28 per share. This includes a cent or two of
restructuring. And our full year earnings expectations continue to be an adjusted EPS of $1.12 to $1.18.
You've heard me say this before, but it bears repeating. Some companies talk about transformation, we're actually
doing it. Our results this quarter and our expectations for the balance of this year reflect the shifts happening in our
business. They're all centered on building a sustainably successful enterprise with a healthy annuity stream and
significant growth opportunities.
We're making progress on every front and I remain impatient to make even more. I'm also confident that we have the
right strategies, the competitive strengths, the skilled leadership team and the disciplined focus on execution that will
deliver more value for you and for all of our stakeholders.
With that, I thank you again for joining us today. As we get into your questions, I know that you'll want to dive deeper
into services, so this quarter I asked Lynn Blodgett, the President of Xerox Services to join us for the Q&A. On
occasion we'll bring in other members of the senior team during our investor webcast. This way, like me, you can
appreciate the breadth and the depth of the team that helps me lead this business.
Now let's open it up to your questions and I'll field them and ask Luca and Lynn to chime in as well. Questions?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator instructions] Your first question comes from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Thank you very much, I guess my first question, Ursula, is if you could talk just a little bit
more about what you're seeing in Europe and perhaps some of the other geographies. I know you mentioned that it was
improving a bit sequentially but I'm curious as to in the various segments and what you're seeing both, like I said, in
Europe and other geos.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Europe was weak but we did see modest – modest improvement this quarter, particularly in
the equipment sale line and clearly in the areas that we're focusing on, color, throughout the spectrum from small to
large, a modest, very modest improvement there. But Southern Europe, weak, the rest of Western Europe a little bit
better than Southern Europe and the Eastern European nations, which are reported in our developing markets
operations, generally stronger than all of the rest of Europe.

In North America we saw a continued trend from the fourth quarter which was a little bit stronger than throughout the
rest of 2011, which is – which is good. We didn't see any downturn there at all. We did see a little bit of weakness in
supplies, primarily driven by timing of, you know, pricing increases and OEM sales that kind of thing, but nothing
systemic at all there.
DMO continues strength, throughout the regions in DMO, just about every place that we do business we're seeing
growth as those economies grow. We see SMB everywhere around the world doing better, particularly in our North
American operations where we have a particular focus in moving coverage; we're seeing our global imaging operations
do even well there.
By the way, Fuji Xerox is having good results as well, particularly in China and the Asia-Pac areas that they cover,
that's also seeing growth. So I think that – services, by the way, one last – services in Europe in particular we're starting
to see expansion there, which is very good. It's still a very small portion of our business, but we're signing contracts and
as we go forward and get more traction there we'll be able to actually call it out to you more specifically. As I told you
before, services in Latin America actually were stronger to start off with, particularly in our transportation segment.
So across the world, we didn't see a significant change except for in Europe a little bit of pickup from a very depressed
level and particularly in equipment sales.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Okay, great. And then Lynn, since you're joining us, can you give us some of your
perspective on, you know, services, what segments you're seeing growth in, what you're hearing from your customers
and then perhaps how you're thinking about sort of the margin improvement and how it should sort of progress through
the year?
<A - Lynn R. Blodgett>: You bet. The areas that we're seeing the most activity in would be in healthcare, both
government and commercial healthcare, for obvious reasons given the pressures that everybody feels on healthcare
costs. Our customer care area is continuing to grow very strongly, and we have some great new tools that we're going
to implement there that we think will even make us even stronger in customer care. Financial services is very strong,
and HR outsourcing we've really sort of disciplined ourselves and we're much better at focusing on point solutions so
those things are all helping us to grow strongly in those areas. Transportation, as Ursula mentioned, is very – very
strong and transactional BPO just continues to just rock along. It's just a very strong operation.
As far as the margins, obviously, the fact that we have as much new business which we're obviously very excited about,
but much new business growth that is going to put a certain amount of pressure on margins. If you look at the decline in
services this – this last quarter, about 70% of it was due to new business startup and half of that was driven by the state
of California and about 30% of it was driven by the fact that we have last year, as you know, lower than we like
renewal rates, especially in ITO so we're seeing impact from that.
The vast majority of the pressure is coming because of new business signings, so we're confident that we're going to see
– we like the new signings and we'll see, you know, nice, incremental type growth through the year in margins.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Great, and then just my last question for Luca: Can you talk a bit about how we should think
about the yen and FX as we go through the year in terms of contributions versus the hedging programs you have in
place?
<A - Luca Maestri>: Yes, Shannon. Let me start with the impact on revenue because it's important to highlight also
the effect on revenue. It was a negative 1% in Q1. We expect it to be a negative 2% on revenue during the second
quarter because euro was particularly strong last year, but for the full year we expect currency to be one point negative
to our growth rates.
When you go down to the profit level, directionally, as you know very well, for us weak yen and strong euro is the best
of both worlds. At this point, at the beginning of the year, we had talked about – about $40 million to $50 million
negative for the year when we started the year. Rates have improved marginally, so you probably the impact is $30
million to $40 million for the year and that's the way you need to think about it.

We are, you know, fully hedged for the current quarter. We tend to be hedged 60% to 70% for the next quarter then and
then, at different levels for the following, you know, couple of quarters again. So the whole concept of the hedging
program is to smooth out the volatility of the exchange, but this is the type of impact that we should be seeing this year,
at current rates, of course.

<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Hey, Richard.
<Q - Richard E. Gardner>: Thank you. I'd just like to address the printer supplies inventory correction that you talked
about. Can you talk about what prompted that and where we are and how comfortable you are right now with inventory
levels and just any additional color would be helpful, thanks.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: We are really thrilled with the activity levels that we saw in the quarter. They were up 7% in
particular in the entry-level, was up 9% which definitely fuels the supplies revenue. I'll turn it over to Luca to talk a
little bit more about the supplies revenue details.
<A - Luca Maestri>: Yeah. So last year we had some fairly significant price increases at this time of the year so we
were facing a very significant compare year-over-year. Obviously, this is a revenue stream that is very affected by the
levels of inventory in our channel partners. I think that, you know, the decline in Q1 will not be repeated going
forward. What we think is that supplies revenues are going to be closer to flat for the rest of the year so I think we're
going to work through this issue starting from Q2, Rich.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Rich, if I could add, I wouldn't read a whole lot into this correction. If you've followed us,
which you have, for a long time, you'll see depending on the timing of pricing changes by us or our competitors, you'll
see ups and downs, it's a fairly lumpy revenue line for us, so you'll see ups and downs. We're seeing great activity, great
install through all of our channel partners, through all of the lines that we get to the market through. So the expectation
is that with those equipment sales, there will be supplies improvement so I would not read a whole lot into this – to this
correction.
<Q - Richard E. Gardner>: Okay, thanks. And if I could follow up quickly, I believe the restructuring charge on the
technology side was smaller than you had talked about previously. Correct me if I'm wrong, but could you talk about
why that's the case? And I think, Ursula, you had suggested there's potential for technology margins, operating margins
to be up this year for a variety of reasons and I'd love to get your latest thoughts on that, thanks.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Turn it over to Luca.
<A - Luca Maestri>: So the restructuring charge, maybe a shade below what we thought at the beginning of the
quarter, but we still see a lot of good opportunities across the enterprise, so in the guidance that we're giving out for the
second quarter again we're talking about additional opportunities for restructuring, it's just, I think, a timing issue,
nothing more than that.
On the operating margin side, as we said, we believe that from this point, we're going to start seeing sequential
improvement year-over-year both in services and in technology. and that will take us, you know, to a point in Q4 where
we're going to have, we believe, good year-over-year improvement when you do the math, we think operating margins
should be flat to slightly up for the year. But, you know, with some level of revenue growth, of course.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: If I can just add one last point. Since we will see higher equipment sale revenue in Q2, the
margins for the technology business will be a little pressured. As you know our margins on our supplies are

significantly higher than the margins on our equipment. But at the end of the day it will all balance out in the year. It's
literally just a timing issue. So nothing more there. Next question, please.
<Q - Richard E. Gardner>: Okay, thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Barclays Capital.
<Q - Ben Alexander Reitzes>: Yeah, thanks. Could you just talk a little bit more about services margins, what are you
specifically doing to get them up and what kind of trajectory should we see going from the 9.3? How quickly – it
sounds like you need to be well into the 12s by the end of the year to hit your numbers. Is that right and what are you
specifically doing to get there and how does the margin play out sequentially just for that line?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: I'll have Luca like walk you through it and maybe Lynn could add something, some color
needed.
<A - Luca Maestri>: So, yes, 9.3 for Q1. We see that expand sequentially, Ben, as we go through the year and getting
into an improvement, very significant improvement year-over-year in Q4. Really, you know, the reason is clearly the
fact that we are ramping a lot of new business all at the same time, very large contracts, state of California, that's a big
example and also the fact that we, you know, we are ramping off some of higher-margin contracts particularly in ITO
some of the losses that we had last year.
We essentially follow these contracts, and I'll let Lynn expand on it, but we follow all these contracts at the granular
level so each one of them, and we've got specific, you know, actions for all of them, starting from California, but all the
other big ones that we are starting up and I think it's just going to be the way that we go through the year that some of
those pressures are going to mitigate as we actually get these contracts to a steady state.
<A - Lynn R. Blodgett>: Yeah, the natural thing that happens to a contract, whether it's in startup mode or through its
life is that the margins continue -- continue to improve and so as the contracts that we have, the big things that hit us in
terms of margin pressure, those things will continue to mature, and their margins naturally improve so you're going to
see a natural progression in margins because the contracts that we're currently focused on are going through that life.
We haven't seen anything that's unusual in terms of the kind of startup costs that we're seeing.
We are doing a number of things, we think, to continue to drive margin improvement. We have some tools that we've
developed, we have a product called Simplicity that will help us a great deal in our customer care area and we're
shifting a lot of our work to platforms, our new MMIS platform that was a significant investment is the kind of thing
that will help drive higher margins and, of course, as Ursula said we're just focused on operational excellence, that's our
daily bread and butter, so we have to never take our eye off that ball.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: If I can add to wrap this one up, losses, we actually have a lower set of renewal opportunities
in the quarter, actually and throughout the year, it's actually good news and good news for us so there's less chances
that we can actually lose a contract. But even on the contracts that are up, all the contracts that are up for renewal, we
are on them. Meaning executives are engaged, operational managers are engaged and we're engaged with the leaders of
the other companies that we're doing business to assure that they know that we're paying attention to this.
So I think you heard that we're focused on the normal operation of the business, we're focused on contract renewals,
we're focused on tools to simplify the business and we've modeled this out and we're pretty confident that we'll be able
to see the margin expansion, very confident that we'll see the margin expansion throughout the year with the high point
in margins in the quarter, at the end of the year, in the fourth quarter.

<A - Ursula M. Burns>: One of the reasons that we gave you the additional detail on slide eight, it's a little bit
dangerous to put out but we decided to put it out to show – we'll continue to fill this in throughout the year but we'll be
able to show you how the margins are improving on a sequential basis. Sorry; go ahead, next question.

Your next question comes from the line of Deepak Sitaraman with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Deepak Sitaraman>: Oh, great. Thank you very much. Ursula for the full year can you speak about how you're
thinking about the revenue growth outlook? Is there any change to your 2% outlook for 2012?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: No, we're sticking to the two-plus percent revenue outlook driven by the mix of business that
we saw, high single-digit growth in the services portfolio, BPO, ITO, document outsourcing together and still a little bit
of pressure, so flat to slight declines in the technology business, all at constant currency, of course. So we see that still
coming through, you know, any kind of upside that we do – we will – that we do see we'll actually pass on in future
guidance but we really don't see that changing: high single-digit on services and flat to marginal declines in the
technology business.
<Q - Deepak Sitaraman>: Okay. I guess just to follow up, then, on that high single-digit outlook for services, you
know, just given the trends that you're seeing in terms of pipeline growth and signings on a trailing 12-month basis, can
you speak about the level of visibility you have there?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Yes, I'll have Lynn take it, but I'll summarize for him before he starts. We have a fair amount
of visibility on the revenue side in services but go ahead, Lynn.
<A - Lynn R. Blodgett>: Yeah, the pipeline is, even though we had record -- very strong record bookings the last two
quarters of last year the pipeline continues to grow and, in fact, it's up 5% notwithstanding those very strong bookings.
So that gives us great visibility in terms of ramp. Growth right now is driven by the ramp of signings, primarily the
signings that we had last year.
One of the great things about this business, because it's so oriented to recurring revenue, is that you can pretty well
predict that if you have a pipeline it's going to translate into a certain amount of bookings and then, those bookings will
contribute very, very predictably to the revenue growth, so we feel really confident in the ongoing revenue growth.
<Q - Deepak Sitaraman>: Okay, and maybe just a last one for Luca. Luca, you mentioned margins overall could be
flat to up slightly on a year-over-year basis for the full year, is that commentary appropriate for just service margins as
well?
<A - Luca Maestri>: I think it's going to be – I – yes, you know, overall but keep in mind that we also have, you
know, the other segment which is also helping. Yeah, but, you know, pretty close to that.
<Q - Deepak Sitaraman>: Okay, great, thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Chris Kinney Whitmore>: Thanks very much, I had a balance sheet question for Luca, specifically around your
buyback on a medium to longer term basis. You've committed to buying back $1 billion of stock this year. How should
we think about that as an ongoing commitment, should we expect buybacks to continue in 2013-2014 at this type of
scale?

<A - Luca Maestri>: Very clearly we, you know, we will have a, you know, place for share repurchase on an ongoing
basis. As we think about capital allocation, you know, we want it to be well-balanced. Clearly there's going to be room
for dividend and possibly a consideration for a dividend increase as we go forward and some element of acquisition
that is very important to our business model, particularly on the services side.
So we will, you know, as we get toward the end of the year and we're going to have the investor conference in
November, we'll give you a full debrief on the way we're thinking about capital allocation. Certainly for the remainder
of the year it's what we mentioned and clearly going forward it will remain particularly, you know, at this level of the
stock valuation, it will remain a very significant element of our capital allocation strategy.
<Q - Chris Kinney Whitmore>: Do think that the – the commitment to the buyback is limiting your opportunity set
on the M&A side, in other words, do you think you're missing out on opportunities to accelerate the growth of services
given the size of the buyback commitment?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Absolutely not. We are – we have a pipeline, an active fishing and pipeline net out there and
anything that we see that fits into the parameters that we buy, buy. We operate on. So we do not believe, more than I do
not believe, I know we're not limiting our M&A opportunities for – because we're buying back shares.
<Q - Chris Kinney Whitmore>: And my last one goes back to the issue around supplies and the recurring elements of
the technology business. I mean, we've been hearing about pretty strong MIF growth for many quarters now, yet that
doesn't seem to be translating into the annuity revenue stream and now we're actually seeing downsides on supplies
usage. So can you help me understand the disconnect between past growth in MIF and continued declines on the
recurring elements in tech services? Thanks.
<A - Luca Maestri>: There are two, you know, primary elements to that. Obviously there's an element of price
erosion. It's there, it's in the market and we know that that causes some pressure on revenue. And the second one is a
mix. Mix is big as well. We're seeing particularly the way we've launched products recently, we've seen very good
growth in installs in our entry segment which, obviously, carries different levels of pricing and so I would say those are
the two reasons from a pricing and mix perspective and then obviously we've had macroeconomic environment in
Europe which has not helped in that respect.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: If I may, Chris, add another piece here. If you think about our business the way that we're
reporting it today, we report activity to you. That activity is from our technology business and from our document
outsourcing business, we just don't – it makes sense to do it that way as that total activity.
The revenue splits between the technology business and the document outsourcing business or the services business, if
you were to take into account in the technology business the revenues from the services businesses that we now book in
services, the technology revenue would have been down 2%. That is almost totally attributable to the weakness that we
see in Europe. We offset everything else, you know, price is up, down, activity up, color pages up, digital pages, we
manage all of that in a box that's pretty consistent and in line with what we have said in the past except for a very
significant downturn in business in Europe.
So all that Luca said but you've got to actually start to look at the business and we try to give you all of this information
to look at the business such that you can actually translate activity into – which we split into two different – we show in
one segment that actually comes from two different segments, into the rest of the results, revenue, etcetera. So I do not
– okay? Thank you.
<Q - Chris Kinney Whitmore>: Thank you, Ursula. Thanks for that color.

Your next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Brean Murray.

and then reaching, I guess, exiting this year, going into next year steady state in services operating margins or could we
see, I guess, some sort of a similar dynamic in 2013, you know, where we're still trying to stand up deals and we're not
yet reaching steady state operating margins?
<A - Luca Maestri>: I think we're going to exit 2012 at a level that – where we feel it's pretty steady state. So you're
going to see some progression during the course of 2012 and then steady state. But you also need to keep in mind,
Ananda, you know it very well, right? A lot of what we do is driven by the cadence of new contracts and so obviously
if we continue to see the level of revenue acceleration that we've seen this year then obviously you're going to see some
ups and downs in margins but I would say end of 2012 is going to be pretty much our steady state.
<Q - Ananda Baruah>: And then, Luca, what would be the opportunity for services operating margin expansion in
2013?
<A - Luca Maestri>: Well, of course, on a year-on-year basis it's going to be obviously significant, right, because
we're starting from a relatively low point in Q1.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: [indiscernible] (47:59)
<Q - Ananda Baruah>: Yeah, I'm used to that. I guess I'm wondering is on a like for like basis, December quarter,
services margins going forward through 2013 what inside the services business could improve the margins?
<A - Lynn R. Blodgett>: I think that the – as I said earlier, the maturing of the contracts. We track very closely each
contract and we know the margins, we know the startup costs, we compare it against the models that we have built, and
occasionally we have things that we have to focus on more than we expected and others go a little bit better than we
expected, but we're confident that as we move forward that natural maturing will occur.
The other thing that will happen in the fourth quarter is that we will essentially lap this big jump in growth and that's
one of the big reasons that we're confident you're going to see a margin increase. If we can tack another 5% growth on
top so we're growing 15%, but you'd see same kind of activity I guess that would be a really good problem to have.
<Q - Ananda Baruah>: Got it. I guess I'm trying to get your thoughts on the opportunity to expand margins, you
know, sort of in 2013 with what's going on with sort of as you see the book of business versus exiting the year.
<A - Lynn R. Blodgett>: Yeah, the other thing that's happening is that the use of the platforms that we've made
significant investments in, you know, the MMIS application that has taken us a long time to build. It's the first new
MMIS system that's been built in 15 years, and it's compliant with all of the new regs and everything; that is a major, a
major accomplishment to get that in and as we put applications or states on that new platform we'll see improved
margins.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: A margin pressure for a new add is significantly less than it was for California.
<Q - Ananda Baruah>: On.
<A - Luca Maestri>: Ananda, to your question, maybe it's a bit early for us to start talking about 2013 operating
margins at this point.
<Q - Ananda Baruah>: Okay, fair enough. And just one real quick one, last one from me, Luca, can you just – what
should we think of as the gross margin range for this year?
<A - Luca Maestri>: We're guiding 31% to 33%.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: We'll see that improve sequentially. Thanks, Ananda. Next question.

<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Hi, to Luca, first one to you. Could you just confirm that the EPS guidance of $1.12 to
$1.18, does that include the actuarial changes associated with the pension whereby you have significant pension
headwinds this year, I think it's $145 million?
<A - Luca Maestri>: All in, although, Keith, the increase in pension contributions is, you know, in that range in terms
of the pension expense, which I think is going to be reflected in the EPS is in the $40 million range, $40 million to $50
million range but it's all in, all in.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay, the second question I have then. Lynn, this is for you. You've talked about a lot of
confidence in the margins and yet over the past, particularly during calendar 2011 on services, margins did disappoint,
and it was fairly consistent and it was driven by, as Ursula said, the leakage on ITO. And so if you could just come
back and address from a management, from a focus, from a systems perspective, what's different now on the renewals
in particular that was – that did not exist shortly after Xerox bought ACS and fairly consistently during CY 2011.
<A - Lynn R. Blodgett>: I think the renewal rate in, particularly in ITO, was disappointing last year and this is not the
– It's not unprecedented that we've – we've seen a point where we've had disappointing renewals in IT. It seems to have
– you know there are things that drive it that sometimes we get a little bit behind. This year, because of the focus that
we've put on IT renewals specifically, we have much more executive involvement earlier in the process and, as Ursula
said, we don't have as many opportunities this year for renewal, which should help us in terms of the renewal rates as
well. So more focus, I think the attention, that's the main thing, and we've seen it before and that's what we try to do.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Ursula, one last one for you, Drupa, how should we think about it, do you think you'll get
little lift off of Drupa either in the June or September quarters or is the European backdrop such that we shouldn't be
thinking about it? And that's it from me, thank you.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: I don't think we should be thinking about a specific Drupa lift. If it happens, it happens. I
actually just don't think it's there. This show is a show of buying but that buying is generally baked into the normal
course of business. Drupa's been going on for years and years and years and everybody expects what happens at Drupa
to happen. So Drupa for us will be a color show, it will be a show that we highlight the advantages that we have in
color and in solutions wrappers, so not a product show for us but more of a workflow show for us like how do you put
together package solutions, etcetera, etcetera.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Got it.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: We'll have some new products there but it won't be a product show, as I said, and I don't
think you can bank a whole lot of, you know, hope on Drupa changing the course of European technology business.
Thank you very much, Keith.

Your final question comes from the line of Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Thanks. Ursula, I was wondering if could you walk us through your latest read on the
competitive landscape within document outsourcing. All of the key players continue to tout positive momentum here so
it's a bit tough for us on the outside to see which vendors are really breaking out as long-term leaders, so if you can give
us your perspective on that, that would be helpful.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: I would speak about two companies outside of the other group. So the other group is Canon,
RICOH, KM, you know, the normal technology people, technology hardware providers, and they are still infants in
document outsourcing. They're really not large players, they are trying to get together solutions and offer them but we
really don't compete actively against them. The places – the competitors that we compete actively against are HP,
Lexmark and us, those are the three people who are in this document outsourcing business today as mature players. I'll
break out HP of those three, as behind both Lexmark and Xerox.

HP is trying hard to reorganize themselves into having a good set of solutions on a document outsourcing space, but
they're lagging for sure. Xerox is ahead. We have not only our document outsourcing business, our Managed Print
Services play, but the fact that we have a whole set of services that attach to that actually elevates us in the minds of
particularly larger customers out there. We have an open platform, one that allows – and a standard one, meaning open
and people understand it. One that allows other people's technologies and other people's work flow and other people's
processes to kind of come under the umbrella of us very easily and we are innovative, so we continue to upgrade what
we offer.
So HP behind, the last two are Lexmark and us and Lexmark is a very specific segment kind of a player, they pick an
industry and they go after that industry. The good news about that is, it leaves all the rest of the industries for us to
focus on and we actually continue to be very, very aggressive against Lexmark in the document outsourcing market. So
I think all-in-all, if you look at the ratings of Gartner and IDC, if you look at how we're growing this business, 7%
revenue growth in the quarter and how that revenue growth positions us from a size perspective larger than anyone else,
you'll see that in document outsourcing we are definitely winning. It's a very competitive market, so we can't take our
eye off it. But we are winning and we have a gap between our next closest competitor.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Just as an extension of that, if we took a snapshot of the environment today, when you go up
against HP and Lexmark where does – which vertical type of contracts does Xerox have an advantage and where do
you think you still have some work to do?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: We have strength in the tech sector, in the telecom sector, and in banking. I think Lexmark
kind of does legal fairly well and they do some financial fairly well so they're going to try to catch us in the places that
we're good and we're going to definitely try to catch them in the places that they are -- that they are good.
So I think the market is still very wide open, which is the good thing and the fact that our reputation is very strong here.
It's not an easy thing for a customer to do, the fact that our reputation is very strong here. And the fact that we're local
and a lot of the growth comes in the X – what we call Partner Print Services base, we call it XPPS, the fact that we're
local and our global imaging partners go out with XPPS it's really a win for us. They're very intimate with their clients,
a lot of the growth is in the not big segment so we're winning there, our coverage is phenomenal there.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: All right, thank you very much.
Ursula M. Burns
Thank you very much. If there are no more questions, thank you for joining us today and have a very good summer.
