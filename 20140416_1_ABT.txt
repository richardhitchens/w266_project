In today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand
Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable
GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today which will be available on our
website at abbott.com. Our commentary on sales growth refers to operational sales growth which excludes the impact
of foreign exchange unless otherwise noted.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles.
Miles D. White
Okay. Thanks, Brian. Good morning. This morning we reported first quarter ongoing earnings per share of $0.41,
above our guidance range. Operating margin exceeded our target and sales increased modestly in the quarter, in line
with our expectations, as Tom will discuss in more detail in a moment. We're confirming our full year 2014 ongoing
earnings per share guidance, which is for double-digit growth at the midpoint of the range.
Going forward, we continue to expect accelerating sales growth as the year progresses and double-digit ongoing
earnings per share growth starting in the second quarter. We are recovering share in our international Nutrition
business, we're continuing to drive above-market sales growth in Core Laboratory Diagnostics, we're launching new
products to capture share in our Medical Devices business, and we're on track to expand full-year operating margin. I'll
summarize first quarter performance before turning the call over to Tom and Brian for more detailed commentary.
Diagnostics sales increased 5% in the quarter driven by continued momentum in Core Laboratory Diagnostics in both
developed and emerging markets, and Molecular Diagnostic sales increased strong double-digits in our core infectious
disease testing segment where our best-in-class assays provide the opportunity for significant share expansion. In our
diagnostics pipeline, we're investing in the development of multiple new instrument platforms that we'll launch over the
next several years.
Our Medical Devices includes vascular, diabetes and vision care businesses. In our Vascular business, international
sales representing 65% of our global business, increased nearly 4% in the quarter. Growth has been driven by a number
of new products including our new peripheral stent, Supera and our structural heart device, MitraClip. And in our
drug-eluting stent product portfolio, we're driving increased penetration of our bioresorbable vascular scaffold, Absorb.
In the international markets where Absorb is approved and actively promoted, it's now approaching 20% of our
drug-eluting portfolio revenue.
We're making significant progress to bring it to three major markets where it's not yet available, the U.S., Japan and
China, which represent more than 50% of the world's coronary stent market. We've recently completed patient
enrollment in the Absorb randomized clinical trials required for approval in these geographies.
Vascular sales in the U.S. were lower in the first quarter due to trialing of a competitive drug-eluting stent. We
anticipate better U.S. performance in the coming quarters as we recapture drug-eluting stent share, focusing on the
superior profile of XIENCE Xpedition and accelerate growth of our broad vascular portfolio, including MitraClip and
now Supera. Supera received U.S. FDA approval last month and expands our endovascular portfolio with the
best-in-class stent technology. It treats blockages of the superficial femoral artery, or SFA, one of the largest and
fastest-growing segments in the peripheral stent market.
In Diabetes Care, sales were in line with our expectations. In U.S., as we've discussed, the market has been impacted by
the implementation of the CMS Competitive Bidding Program. Our management team has navigated this environment
well versus the competition, remaining focused on gaining share in the more attractive market segments. Outside of the
U.S., emerging market growth was strong in the quarter and we're making progress towards CE Mark in the second half
of this year for our next-generation sensing technology.
And in Vision Care, sales increased 10% in the quarter, driven by above-market growth of our cataract lens business.
We expect double-digit sales growth for the full year with continued positive momentum from new products, including
our TECNIS Toric intraocular lens in the U.S., our TECNIS OptiBlue lens in Japan, and our new Catalys Laser cataract

system and several additional product launches throughout this year.
In Established Pharmaceuticals, total operational sales performance was roughly in line with our expectations. In our
key emerging markets for EPD, strong growth in Brazil and India was offset by a temporary decline related to an
expected plant shutdown for capacity expansion purposes to meet increasing demand. At the same time, EPD
leadership is making progress on initiatives to accelerate growth by further aligning its commercial strategy with the
opportunities these emerging markets represent. We continue to expect better momentum in EPD in the second half of
this year with improved market growth in India and the benefit of additional plant capacity to meet sales demand for
key products. And over the next several years, we anticipate continued improvement in EPD's growth rate as sales in
emerging markets become a larger component of this business.
In Nutrition, as I mentioned, we're recapturing share in our International Pediatric Nutrition business, following a
supplier recall initiated last August. As I discussed on our fourth quarter earnings call, we are executing on a recovery
plan and regularly monitoring our progress. We remain on track to return to pre-call levels in the third quarter.
In the second half of this year, we're well-positioned in Nutrition for double-digit sales growth and operating margin
expansion as we begin to anniversary the supplier recall. We opened three new manufacturing facilities to support
strong global demand for both Adult and Pediatric Nutrition. We continue to execute on our margin expansion
initiatives and launch a number of new products into the new market segments across several key geographies.
In the coming months we'll launch a new Adult Nutrition brand in Japan, our largest adult market outside of the U.S.,
and over the course of the year we're launching several new Pediatric Nutrition products in the fast-growing market
segments in China and other emerging geographies. This includes a new infant formula product, Eleva, we launched in
China just last week. These innovations bring advanced nutrition to meet the needs of our customers, drive share
expansion and grow the market.
So in summary, our first quarter ongoing earnings per share results were better than our expectations. We continue to
expect accelerating sales growth as we progress through the year, particularly in the second half. And we're on track to
achieve another year of double-digit earnings per share growth.
I'll now turn the call over to Tom and Brian. Tom?
Thomas C. Freyman
Thanks, Miles. Today we reported ongoing diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of $0.41, above our guidance
range. As we forecasted in January, first quarter sales increased modestly on an operational basis. Exchange had an
unfavorable impact of 3% on sales in the quarter, also consistent with our previous estimate. As a result, reported sales
declined 2.5% in the quarter.
It's important to keep our first quarter sales growth in perspective. As we indicated in January, we expected modest
growth before exchange as we recover from the 2013 supplier recall in Nutrition and work through certain sales
comparisons. We're right on track with the sales progression we expected in January with sales growth before exchange
essentially on our planned forecast. And exchange was close to the forecast we provided as well in what should be the
most challenging quarter of the year for currency. So as sales are progressing as we planned, our full year forecast for
sales growth remains unchanged.
The first quarter adjusted gross margin ratio was 54% of sales, also in line with our guidance. Our overall spending
levels in the first quarter were below forecasts we provided in January. Ongoing R&D came in about $20 million below
our expectations, which was simply a result of timing. We expect to fully fund our R&D initiatives over the remainder
of the year. Ongoing SG&A spending was around $80 million lower than we planned; approximately half of this was
timing, which we expect to balance out over the last three quarters. The remainder reflects our continuing focus on
managing down G&A costs and is available to either reinvest in the business or carry through to earnings for the year.

Page 4 of 17
So as we factor first quarter ongoing EPS of $0.41 into our thinking on the full year, around half of the over-delivery
compared to our guidance is attributable to the timing of spending which we expect to balance out over the remaining
three quarters.
Regarding our full year 2014 outlook for the P&L, we continue to forecast operational sales growth in the mid-single
digits. Based on current exchange rates, we expect exchange to have a negative impact of somewhat more than 1% on
our full year reported sales with most significant impact in the first half of the year. This would result in reported sales
growth in the low-to-mid single digits for the full year 2014, consistent with our forecast in January.
Operational sales growth is expected to be driven by continued strong growth in Diagnostics and Vision Care and sales
growth acceleration in Nutrition and Established Pharmaceuticals. We continue to forecast an adjusted gross margin
ratio of approximately 55% of sales for the full year, which reflects a negative impact of around 50 basis points from
foreign exchange. We also continue to forecast ongoing R&D somewhat above 6% of sales, ongoing SG&A expense of
approximately 30% of sales, and an expansion of our full year adjusted operating margin by approximately 60 basis
points in 2014.
Turning to the outlook for the second quarter, we're forecasting ongoing earnings per share of $0.50 to $0.52, reflecting
double-digit growth at the midpoint of the range. We forecast operational sales growth in the low-to-mid-single digits
in the second quarter. At current exchange rates, we'd expect a negative impact from exchange of approximately 1.5%
resulting in reported sales in the low-single digits. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 54.5% of sales,
ongoing SG&A expense of approximately 30.5% of sales, and ongoing R&D expense somewhat above 6% of sales for
the second quarter. We project specified items at $0.29 in the second quarter, reflecting the same items as we identified
for the full year in our earnings release.
As previously indicated, we expect the pace of both sales and ongoing EPS growth to accelerate throughout the year as
product launches and key initiatives ramp and as comparisons become more favorable. For the second half of 2014, we
continue to forecast operational sales growth in the mid-to-upper-single digits and steady operating margin expansion
supported by our continuing efforts to manage G&A expenses.
So in summary, sales in the first quarter were in line with our expectations. We exceeded our ongoing EPS guidance
and we're confirming our full year ongoing EPS guidance range of $2.16 to $2.26. As we start the year, we're well
positioned to deliver another year of double-digit earnings growth in 2014.
With that, I'll turn it over to Brian to review the business operating highlights and outlook. Brian?
Brian Yoor
Thank you, Tom. This morning I'll review our first quarter 2014 performance and second quarter sales outlook by
business. As I mentioned earlier, my comments will focus on operational sales growth.
Overall, our first quarter sales increased modestly and sales in emerging markets grew mid-single digits, both in line
with our expectations as we work through a couple of year-over-year comparison items, one in International Nutrition
and one in our Established Pharmaceuticals Division. We estimate that these items impacted Abbott's year-over-year
emerging market sales growth by approximately 4.5 percentage points in the quarter.
I'll now discuss each of our businesses. In our Diagnostics business, sales increased 5% in the first quarter, slightly
ahead of our expectations. Core Laboratory Diagnostics sales increased more than 5% in the first quarter as this
business continues to deliver above-market performance in both developed and emerging markets. U.S. sales increased
11%, primarily due to several large health system customers selecting Abbott's integrated and flexible solutions to
manage their testing volumes and increase operational efficiencies. International sales grew 4% in the quarter driven by
continued growth in emerging markets.
We continue to broaden and differentiate our ARCHITECT assay menu and launch a new diabetes test in the U.S. in
April. To address the growing prevalence of diabetes in the United States, our new test provides fast, accurate results to

help laboratories manage the anticipated increase in demand for testing. This test aids physicians with diagnosing and
monitoring diabetes as well as identifying people at risk for developing diabetes.
In Molecular Diagnostics, worldwide sales increased 5.6% in the first quarter, with international sales up 12.6%, led by
continued strong growth in infectious disease testing and double-digit growth in emerging markets. In the U.S., growth
of infectious disease testing, which is our largest segment where we have best-in-class assays, was offset by the
expected timing of the conclusion of a distribution agreement for a respiratory test.
In Point of Care diagnostics, worldwide sales increased nearly 3%, with international sales growing double-digits, as
this business has increased its focus on expanding in select European and emerging markets.
In the first quarter, the U.S. business experienced somewhat longer purchasing cycles and reduced utilization rates in
the hospitals. We started to see stabilization of U.S. order patterns in March and April and continue to focus on
building momentum in international markets. For the second quarter, in our global Diagnostics business we are
forecasting mid-to-high-single digit operational sales growth.
In Medical Devices, sales in our vascular business increased 1% in the quarter. International vascular sales increased
nearly 4%, driven by continued momentum of our drug eluting stent product portfolio, including Absorb, and
double-digit sales growth of MitraClip as well as our endovascular products. We expect a number of new product
launches to drive improved performance over the next several quarters.
As Miles mentioned, in March we received U.S. FDA approval for our Supera peripheral stent, which treats blockages
in the superficial femoral artery, or SFA. The global SFA market is growing at a mid-to-high-single digit pace. With
the approval of Supera, Abbott now has one of the most comprehensive and competitive portfolios in the peripheral
market.
We're also making good progress to bring Absorb to the United States, China and Japan over the next few years.
Absorb clinical data demonstrating positive long-term outcomes was presented at the American College of Cardiology
medical meeting. We expect to present one-year clinical results in the second half of this year from ABSORB II, which
is the first randomized trial to compare Absorb to standard of care. As we look ahead to the second quarter 2014, we
expect sales in our global Vascular business to increase in the low-single digits on an operational basis.
In Diabetes Care, global sales in the first quarter decreased 9.5%, in line with our expectations. International sales,
which represent approximately 65% of total Diabetes Care sales, grew for the sixth consecutive quarter increasing 4%,
led by double-digit growth in emerging markets. As Miles mentioned, we are also moving our new investigational
next-generation sensing technology through development and expect to receive European CE mark in the second half
of this year.
In the U.S., as anticipated, sales were impacted by the carry-over effect from implementation of the CMS Competitive
Bidding Program for Medicare patients in July of last year. For the second quarter in our global Diabetes business, we
continue to forecast a low double-digit decline on an operational basis.
In Vision Care, we achieved 10% sales growth in the first quarter, above our expectations, with double-digit growth in
both emerging and developed markets. Sales of our cataract products increased double-digits and represent more than
65% of our Vision Care business where we are capturing market share with multiple new products.
As we've discussed in the past, we continue to make good progress with the launch of several new cataract lenses in
both the United States and Japan. In addition, our new Catalys Laser cataract system has received very good feedback
from our customers as it continues to penetrate high volume cataract centers.
We expect continued double-digit performance in our Vision Care business throughout this year as we introduce more
new products. This includes first quarter launches in Japan of TECNIS Toric lenses for patients with astigmatism and
TECNIS OptiBlue preloaded lens, which improves the ease of use for the cataract surgeon and enhances predictability
of the procedure. For the second quarter of 2014, we expect our global Vision Care business to continue to grow
double-digits on an operational basis.

In our Established Pharmaceuticals business or EPD, sales in the quarter decreased modestly. Sales in our developed
and other market segment decreased 1.5% in the quarter. Developed markets performed largely in line with our
expectations, partially offset by better-than-expected performance in a number of emerging markets that are included in
this business segment. Sales in our key emerging market segment were relatively flat in the quarter. As we expected,
year-over-year sales comparisons in this business were affected by the timing of supply of key products in our
Women's Health portfolio, primarily due to an expected plant shutdown for capacity expansion purposes. As Miles
mentioned, we expect sales growth in key emerging markets to accelerate over the course of the year. For the second
quarter of 2014, we are forecasting sales in our Established Pharmaceuticals business to grow in the low-single digits
on an operational basis.
And lastly, our Nutrition business where global sales decreased 1.7% in the first quarter, in line with our previously
provided guidance. As expected, international Pediatric sales were impacted by the unfavorable year-over-year
comparisons created by the previously reported 2013 supplier recall. The impact of this event is estimated to have
reduced international Pediatric operational sales by approximately $75 million or 12 percentage points in the quarter.
We are recovering share in the affected markets and expect to launch a number of new products in China and other
emerging markets to help drive sales growth.
Late last year we launched our Similac simple pack into the online channel in China, and just this month we launched a
new product, Eleva, that will further enhance our competitiveness in the premium segments of the Chinese infant
formula markets.
International Adult sales increased nearly 12.5 percentage points in the quarter driven by strong growth of our Ensure
brand along with execution of several market development initiatives. We continue to shape and grow priority
international markets and expect to launch several new products this year, including the launch of a new Adult brand,
[ph] Enavo (22:36) in Japan, our largest Adult Nutrition market outside of the U.S. [ph] Enavo (22:41) is a
next-generation follow-on product for our market-leading Ensure brand.
In the United States, the severe winter weather did have some impact on Ensure, PediaSure and Performance Nutrition
brands in the retail segment. As a market leader, we partnered with retailers late in the quarter to launch demand
creation programs to boost consumer demand and are seeing positive early results. In our Infant Nutrition business, we
recently launched Similac with OptiGRO, which contains Abbott's exclusive blend of DHA, lutein and Vitamin E to
support brain, eye and immune system development.
Lastly, on a global basis, we continue to expand our manufacturing presence in Nutrition to be closer to our customers
and at the same time further expand operating margin. We expect to open three new manufacturing facilities in the
second quarter this year in China, India and the United States to support strong global demand for our products. And
we remain on track to achieve an operating margin ratio of more than 20% of sales in our Nutrition business by 2015.
For the second quarter, we are forecasting mid-single-digit sales growth on an operational basis for our global Nutrition
business.
So in summary, in the first quarter sales were in line with our expectations and we delivered ongoing earnings per share
of $0.41 ahead of our guidance. Moving forward, we remain on track to deliver continued margin expansion and expect
sales growth acceleration in our Nutrition, Established Pharmaceuticals and Vascular businesses. We are well
positioned to deliver another year of double-digit earnings growth.
We will now open the call for questions.

<Q - David H. Roman>: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. First, I had just one strategic question and then a
follow-up on the financial side. Maybe, Miles, you could just talk a little bit more about your evolving views around
capital allocation? As we sort of think about how the Abbott story has gone over the last year post the spin, I think
we've sort of seen an evolution in the growth rate as it relates to the top line and correspondingly a sort of change in the
way you thought about capital deployment with a big dividend increase last October followed by a fairly big buyback
announcement at the beginning of this year, but maybe you could sort of help frame for us how you're thinking about
using cash from here in the context of how you're seeing growth play out because even with the buyback and dividend,
you still sit on a pretty healthy net cash balance that if you believe any of the analyst forecasts out there should grow
pretty meaningfully the next several years.
<A - Miles D. White>: Yeah, you noticed that, did you? Thank you, David. Let me take you back a little bit to the time
of the split. When we split, we split with AbbVie, the balance sheet, the debt, et cetera, and we did all that proportional
with cash flow at the time. And we set our dividend rate on each side proportionally as well, and so AbbVie ended up
with a very healthy dividend, somewhat disproportionate to what Abbott had paid prior to that and Abbott's dividend as
a percent of EPS was lower. And we started out that way primarily – and the combined dividend as you'll recall was
higher than Abbott in the past.
And we started out the year, I'd say, waiting to see how the split was going to progress, cash flows, et cetera, and
debating the appropriate cash return, et cetera because Abbott, as you know, has had a long history of healthy dividend,
dividend growth, et cetera. And so in the fall made the decision to increase the dividend back to a percent of EPS that
was around 40%, I think, at the time. And that's the dividend being paid now. So we made that adjustment because I
think that the identity of this investment, this stock, has always been both growth and cash return. And it's been a very
stable, reliable performer that way because of the combination of the growth and the cash return.
As far as share repurchases have gone, we've been steady share repurchases year to year. There have been sometimes
when we've taken it lower and sometimes when we've taken it higher and so forth because there's a limit to how much
cash you want to accumulate because cash generally isn't earning much on your balance sheet these days. So we look at
where our own deployment of that cash will go. And if it starts to accumulate at some level beyond the company's good
use of it, then we think about the combination of either dividend or share repurchase and that's always our thought
around that.
We keep our debt in a proper balance, we believe. As you note, our cash flow is strong and in no way have we changed
strategy. I think there's plenty of ammo on the balance sheet should we see opportunities in acquisitions or licensing or
whatever deals may be out there that can enhance our add to our business. I don't feel constrained at all by the balance
sheet, so I think investors expect us to steward the assets well. And if there are, say, excess cash or excess assets that
we don't foresee an immediate use for that we can invest at a better rate, I think a return to investors is always kind of a
first priority.
So we have a steady policy around dividend. We have a steady policy around share repurchase. We've had significant
share repurchase early in the year this year and I still feel like I've got plenty of cash for M&A activity and not much
constraint on borrowing capacity should something significantly larger come along, et cetera. So I would tell you that
there's really been no change in philosophy. I do believe in a strong cash return to investors and we'll keep looking at
our dividend and our share buyback that way and I continue to look at M&A activity. You there?
<Q - David H. Roman>: -- continued balanced use of cash but no necessary urgency to sort of up big M&A as we've
seen elsewhere sort of in healthcare over the past couple of months?
<A - Miles D. White>: Well, I never feel pushed for M&A because of accumulation of cash. I would say M&A is
driven much more strategically by opportunity that fits our business. I think in the last couple of calls with investors,
I've commented that I haven't seen a lot on the radar screen. And I'd say during the split, there's only so much
integration or disintegration activity that an organization can absorb or sustain. So during the time of the split, some of
the M&A or deal activity we did was rather modest or smaller deals that were particularly focused on our Medical
Device business. And while a fair amount of the disintegration activity is ongoing in a lot of our back-office areas, with
AbbVie, it's also coming to a conclusion here in the coming years. So without forecasting anything specific, we've

always been opportunistic about a lot of different opportunities we've been interested in, in different geographies and
tracking those and it's possible that, that could kind of find its way back to the radar screen here.
<Q - David H. Roman>: Okay. That's helpful. Maybe as a quick financial follow-up for Tom, just on the P&L,
understandingly, the gross margin has a lot of moving parts in there, FX, you've got the plant shutdown. You did
mention in your prepared remarks your tight G&A control and focus on that line item. Can you give us maybe some
sense as to where we are sort of in the sort of self-help type of cost cutting that you can do to help improve the margin
profile here?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Certainly. We factored some of that into our original plan. We worked hard last year to
identify areas of efficiency and I'd say we made some initial steps when we put the plan together. And as you know, in
the second half of the year in our forecast, the SG&A ratios get better and that's due in part to some of those initiatives
starting to benefit the P&L. But I think we've created a culture here and people understand what we're trying to do in
terms of focusing on this G&A area. I think a little bit of what we saw in the first quarter is that playing out and people
are really working hard at it. I'd say perhaps we're a little bit ahead of what we would have thought when we put the
plan together, so we're building on that and it's something that we're going to continue to build on during the year and
certainly as we roll into 2015.
<Q - David H. Roman>: Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Good morning. Maybe just a quick one here for Miles and one for Tom. Miles, I think for most
investors they viewed this first quarter as certainly the most challenging quarter of the year and yet margin earnings
were certainly better than expected. So I wonder from here, could you help us understand the margin story and
momentum from here. And then related, your confidence in Nutritional margins is clear, but should we be thinking
about opportunities at Abbott on a segment basis, on a corporate cost basis, or both?
<A - Miles D. White>: Okay. Yeah, let me back up to the bigger context of the year and the quarter. As you know,
because of some things that happened in the second half of last year, we've got an optical challenge here. More optical
than operational really because the Nutrition recall we had in the second half of the year was significant. Exchange
went disproportionately against us in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year – there's a bunch
of comparative things I could tell you – but at the end of the day, it makes for a tale of two halves. And when you're
lapping the impact of those, it makes this first half look depressed and the second half look like a huge ramp. And the
truth is, neither is true. And it's really a comparison issue in a lot of cases here. I'd love to tell you, gee, but for these
things, the growth rate this quarter would look like X. But the fact is, that's the truth. And so the first half of the year
looks one way, the second half looks another.
And I recall, I'd say first of all, I'd remind you, when we gave our guidance we gave double-digit guidance which we've
done every year for the last seven years, I think. And we come into the year knowing the first half doesn't do that but
the second half then looks like this big ramp, and the optics of that have some people saying, gee, can you really get
there, and I think well, yeah, it's really more comparison than anything else. And the underlying fundamentals of
everything I'm looking at looks solid to me. I don't see any trends or anything that are concerning me yet. Now that
said, I'm not a forecaster of exchange, and last year exchange went the wrong way in the second half and I'm not sure I
could have forecasted it to the degree that it happened and I certainly couldn't have forecasted the recall. But in any
case, one of the challenges is that quarter-to-quarter look because you've got to constantly remind investors about the
elements that are affecting the oddness of this comparison. And I'd say the first half is trending better than I expected.
We do have a number of cost and expense initiatives and I would say they're focused – partly because of the separation
with AbbVie and partly focused on just greater efficiency and the shaping of our business, and they happen to be in a
lot of the same areas. So as you work through the separation of back-office things and so forth, with AbbVie it's the

opportunity to kind of get things resized, reshaped, located in the right places and so on. That's all going pretty well.
And there's a lot of initiatives that way inside the company that are coming along.
So as, Tom, I think pointed out, the beat here, the $0.06 beat, is partly timing because – and I'm happy about that
because otherwise that optical comparison of the first half and second half does look pretty dramatic. And there is a
timing issue in this. Part of it's in R&D, part of it's in SG&A, et cetera, but at least the optics look a little better.
And part of it's not timing. Part of it is real. And I know at some point somebody's going to ask me here, gee, why
didn't you raise guidance, and I'll wait until you get to that, and I'm sure Mike's going to ask me pretty soon, and I'll
explain it when I get there.
But the point is, there's a lot of opportunity here in real cost. We're seeing a lot of improvement in our gross margins,
first of all, above the discretionary spending line. But as I think most of you realize, whether it's been price pressure in
Europe or exchange itself, all that benefit of the gross margin improvements has largely offset what otherwise would
have been deteriorating margin because of exchange or pricing, et cetera, and we haven't deteriorated. In fact, we've
improved gross margin anyway. And I think there's still quite a bit of opportunity there for us and we are well planned
in going after it.
On the other hand, then, in expense, there's good spending and there's spending that you'd rather not spend too much
on. And in a lot of our G&A categories, I think there's opportunity for us to spend less and be more efficient, and that's
real money too. And some of that will improve margins at the bottom line and some of it will allow us to spend more
either in SG&A or R&D. But the fact is our SG&A spending I think is pretty healthy as it is. We're at 31% or 32% as a
percent of the P&L and that's a pretty healthy spend. Now could you spend more? I've never asked a general manager
yet that if they needed money would they take it to spend more, and of course they would all take it and spend more.
But I think we've got healthy spending. I think the P&L is healthy. I think that the balance is right. We've got
opportunity to improve spending and improve gross margin. And as we work through the things we're doing to improve
our top line growth and our share gain and our expansion in the number of markets, I think it's good for our investors
that they can count on a certain amount of margin expansion and profit growth while we wait for the top line and the
economies and other things to improve. So I hope that answered your question.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: All right. Thanks, Miles. And I think one additional question for Tom here. I think I may have
missed it in the commentary, Tom, but historically, when you do, do a buyback, your buybacks are heavier in the first
half than the second half. Can you just talk about the pace of the buyback in the first half of the year, how active you
were in the first quarter, and can we expect that historical Abbott practice of buybacks to occur here again in 2014?
Thank you.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Well, as you saw in the release, our average shares were about $19 million below the
prior year, which was about 1% below. We were pretty aggressive in the first quarter on the share buyback. And I
think, David, your comment is pretty accurate. We're pretty much through the vast majority of what we're going to do
in that area. We like the price of the stock and we felt it was a good time to execute. So we were down about 1% on
average in the quarter but as you know, that improves after the first quarter because we bought throughout that period
and the second and third and fourth quarters will benefit even more from the share buybacks. So you're right, the vast
majority of it was done in the quarter.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan.
<Q - Mike J. Weinstein>: Thank you for taking the questions. And, Miles, I'm not going to ask why you didn't raise
guidance. So I'm sorry. I'll save that for someone else. Let me focus on the International Nutrition business because, if
my math is right, if we back out the $75 million from Fonterra and you back out FX, you still got a business that's only

up by 4.5%, which is kind of well below what it was growing prior to Fonterra. So can you spend a minute on that? So,
again, backing out FX and backing out the $75 million from Fonterra and International Pediatric Nutrition is kind of
4.5% there.
<A - Miles D. White>: Yeah, I'm going to let Brian answer that. He's dying to answer that for you. Go ahead.
<A - Brian Yoor>: Thanks, Miles. So, Mike, yeah, same math. I mean you get about 4%. I think you need to go back
to Q1 and look at what we had said in Q1 last year in our Pediatric International Nutrition business. I think we grew
somewhere around 21%, and historically we've been saying more think of this business kind of sustainably performing
in the mid-teens. So we're up against a comparison last year. We're just worldwide. We launched a lot across our
tolerance portfolio, and adjusting for that, it puts you more back up into the double-digits. So as we move forward,
we're in a good position.
We continue to recover in China, so we're seeing the recovery there. You see where we just launched a new product, if
you will, that will help us to further compete as we segment the premium market over there. There's opportunities for
there for us with our new product that I mentioned with Eleva and even more opportunity to come here as we open our
plant in the second quarter, which will also provide further capabilities there as well and will also bolster our return
back to our historical growth rates there.
So basically when you look at the first quarter, you do have a comparable that you're facing in Q1 where we were
launching a lot of tolerance across the portfolio.
<A - Miles D. White>: Mike, I would add to that.
<Q - Mike J. Weinstein>: Okay.
<A - Miles D. White>: And I hate answering questions this way. This is not a business that's always smooth
quarter-to-quarter even though you think it should be. And so sometimes the comparisons are choppy. And in the past
when we had the pharma business with us, so much attention was paid to pharma and HUMIRA and other things that
people didn't really notice the choppiness of the Nutrition business. And factors like what Brian just highlighted have
made a difference from time to time.
I'd say that a couple of things are clear. The economy has definitely pressured the business some, particularly the U.S.
and I think in emerging markets as well. I think we see that slower underlying market rates like everybody else does,
and yet that emerging market rate is still much higher than developed markets, but we've seen that pressure.
I note that a lot of companies have pointed at the harsh winter in the U.S. and so forth. I don't know whether winter
affected us or not. I suppose it stands to reason that it could have in U.S. And internationally, the single biggest thing,
as you know, that has affected us has been this recall and lapping it because it affected more than one country.
But that said, if you ask me, am I satisfied with the growth rates in some of these countries anyway, the answer would
clearly be no. Do I think there's more potential to do better there? I do. And I think we're making the right investments
and the right changes and so forth to address that. A lot of our attention is currently being paid to the countries that
were impacted by the recall, and I'd say the teams are doing a really great job in terms of the recovery, given the
dynamics of the infant formula market. We still got tremendous opportunity there and we're investing to secure that
opportunity. We've got tremendous opportunity in Adult Nutrition in some markets where we're not present, and China
looms as a big opportunity that way.
So I'm not discouraged, I think, at all. I'm never very satisfied, but I'm not discouraged. I think that the – sometimes this
business looks like 20% in the quarter and sometimes it looks like 10% or 12% or 8% or 9% or whatever and it does
kind of roll in humps. But underlying, I think, it's still a very robust and strong market, all of us would benefit from a
little tailwind of economy, but you never take that for granted.
<Q - Mike J. Weinstein>: Okay. Let me ask a couple of quick follow-ups. One, I wanted to ask just on the Adult
Nutritionals business in the U.S. Perrigo announced in the quarter that they were going to enter that market with a store
brand Ensure, and you dominate that market with Ensure, give about 70% share. Can you just talk about how you view

Page 11 of 17
the competitive landscape and degree to which we should be watching how this plays out with Perrigo being a real
competitor potentially coming in.
And then just lastly, Tom, can you just spend another minute on the timing issue of expenses? The fact that it was so
different than your guidance in January caught us all off-guard, so what surprised you that the expenses didn't occur
this quarter that they slipped into later parts of the year? Thanks.
<A - Miles D. White>: Well, let me comment on the Nutrition first. First of all, I'd say Perrigo is a fine competitor and
I admire a lot of the accomplishments Perrigo's had in the markets that they serve. That said, we've had a private label
competition for Ensure for some time. Wal-Mart, which is one of our biggest distribution outlets, has its own private
label that competes with Ensure. So that's not new for us and we've already had that kind of competition in these
categories for years. So whether a new entrant in the category makes a difference or not is, I guess to be seen. It's not a
new thing. Our share position with Ensure hasn't been impacted significantly by the existence of the private label
competition that's already there. And I think it's in the mass outlets that you would expect to have the greatest impact.
So I would never like to predict how a fine competitor is going to do, but I think we're in a very strong position with
our brand and our product and the way our customers view it.
And now I'll let Tom address your expense question.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Yeah, Mike, it was really interesting in the quarter, usually the challenge is getting sales
forecasts accurate. And as I indicated in my remarks, we were incredibly accurate on our sales forecast and right on
track. And usually in the spending areas, when you look across our businesses and across the functional areas, everyone
forecasts their rate of spending and usually when you look at the actuals, there are few puts and takes and you're
usually pretty close to your forecast, and it was just very unusual this quarter that virtually every unit was
under-spending in the same direction. And when we worked with them and talked with them about their plans and
initiatives and the importance of that spending relative to achieving commercial objectives in the businesses and in
terms of some of the project work and some of the other areas, it was still very critical that we continue to invest in
those programs despite the fact that we didn't forecast the spending as accurately as we should.
So I think to your question, historically we've been very good at forecasting this. It was just a very unusual quarter and
everything just kind of moved the same direction, and really, this is spending we should be doing. We've got lots of
good opportunities, and I'm just talking about the timing piece of this from my remarks. We've got ton of opportunities
in the new product areas, and it's things that we should be investing in the business and will be investing over the next
three quarters.
<A - Brian Yoor>: Mike, I'd say for my part, I was also caught a little off-guard by being ahead so far in the quarter,
and we have looked at how much of it is real timing and how much of it is real. And I think the fact of the matter is, we
went into the year with a double-digit target. Our original guidance was double-digits. We did not constrain SG&A or
R&D spending in the setting of those targets relative to the goals we have, the new product launches, the expansion
opportunities and so forth, and frankly, I'm favorably pleased. I'm pleased that we are ahead on a number of the things
that we've wanted to do.
I think, even though you didn't ask me, I want to see another quarter played to see what those underlying trends are. I
still think it's early in the year to be making adjustments to expectations, but frankly, it's possible. And I think at the end
of the second quarter we'll have a pretty good feel for how things are trending for the year and into the second half. I
don't really have any desire to constrain spending, but I don't have any desire to constrain what the bottom line does
either. I mean, even though we forecasted a range that gave us 10% growth at the midpoint of the range, that's actually
low for us in terms of double-digit growth over the last seven years. We've been higher than that in our overall growth
in the last seven years every year.
So I think there's a pretty good chance some of this is sustainable. I think we'll see another quarter played. And if we
get a little boost from gradually improving economy and so forth, I feel pretty good about the second half. I feel pretty
good about the profiles of the businesses. I feel good about our spending capacity. I would like to spend more but I
know that's always a trade-off with investors who like to participate too. So I think that's possible in both directions.

to do.

Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Holford from Jefferies.
<Q - Jeffrey Holford>: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So just on the non-cost phasing part of the EPS beat, so can
you just give us a bit more color on which division that $40 million of the non-phased part of the SG&A was? Just
which division that was primarily being focused on? And then you keep reiterating the original mid-term guidance in
2015 for Nutrition of more than 20%. But that could lead investors to generally think that once you get above 20% for
that division that's kind of your ceiling on margins. When do you think you'll be able to update the market on what
more of a real long run rate of margin performance could be in that business? Thank you.
<A - Miles D. White>: Well, I never give forecasts out through the following year and I don't constrain margin. And I
look at – actually I'll tell you, interestingly, it's a rare debate that you think you've got too much margin or too much
margin growth. I think it's a fair call. There's – our Diagnostics business, for example, as you're probably aware has
enjoyed great improvement in gross margin over the last several years and that drops through to the bottom line and
operating margin and so forth.
And there is kind of a point where you'd say, okay, it's making enough money. Let's make sure we're spending enough
in SG&A and R&D, which we are. And they're in a fairly heavy investment phase in R&D because they've got multiple
systems in development, all of which remain on track and timing and so forth. And I think it's somewhat unprecedented
that way. But at some point you say, look, we can make something too profitable. I haven't had that problem, although I
think as we've noted in the improvements in Diagnostics over time they're getting up there to first best-in-class
profitability in that business.
And I think Nutrition has a way to go. There's still an opportunity there. It doesn't constrain the spending. It doesn't –
there's no limit. I mean we're not operating against some limit, nor would I forecast one for you because I don't have
one. So I'd say we're always kind of relentlessly pushing forward in the improvement of the profiles of the business.
We want to be efficient users of assets and expenses. And while there's opportunity for margin expansion, there's also
no substitute for top line growth and you've got to invest to get that top line growth. So we've got to find that balance.
Tom, there was a question there about the mix in the divisions.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Yeah. Jeff, it's kind of the same as the answer I provided to Mike. I mean it was pretty
much across the board, relatively small amounts across the various divisions. But when you added it all up, it just
turned out to be a fair amount of timing in the quarter. So no one division really stands out.
<Q - Jeffrey Holford>: And then just sort of a quick follow up on EPD if I can, just could we expect some sort of
restocking that business in Q2 with the planned manufacturing coming back on board again?
<A - Miles D. White>: Probably. Yeah. Go ahead.
<A - Brian Yoor>: Thanks, Miles. Yeah, I think, Jeff, to think about that over the Q2, Q3 timeframe, as you know, the
way this works is you had inventory with the distributors. Those distributors would be working off inventory to meet
the end consumers' demand. And likewise then we would be coming back and just working with our distributors to
restore them to their ongoing normal inventory levels here in Established Pharma.

Thank you. Our next question is from Josh Jennings from Cowen.
<Q - Josh T. Jennings>: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Just – first just to follow-up on the EPD business,
understanding that the re-acceleration in the back half is going to be pushed by continued mix shift towards emerging
markets, can you talk to us and give us an update about some of those new SKUs or new products that you're getting
registrations in and new countries that you're entering into and where we are in terms of those metrics?
<A - Brian Yoor>: Yeah, Josh, I'll kick this off and then let Tom or Miles add more color. Really this business is more
going to be about our portfolios that we're building, not really one SKU matters. But I would say the team is making
progress as it evaluates where it wants to be strong, for example, in women's health or in gastroenterology and spaces
like this where they have a very rigorous approach to go, look and where there might be gaps in the portfolio that they
could easily augment through – going through L&A. So there's a lot of activity going on there.
I would expect as part of the acceleration in the second half, we will continue to see strong growth in India. We
mentioned Brazil earlier. India has returned to, I guess, a more healthy market growth versus what the market saw last
year. Recall last year we saw this market slow as it implemented what we call this drug pricing control order which
caused a little bit of channel disruption, if you will. We're coming out of that. We're seeing the market return to nice
growth rates, our growth rates as well, so that sets us up as well for some acceleration as we move through the second
half in our largest country, if you will, in the Established Pharmaceutical business.
<A - Miles D. White>: Josh, I would add to that, on the emerging market side in particular, in this business there are
14 countries or so that we put extra emphasis on and focus on, and each has a plan that's very detailed about the
build-out of its key therapeutic categories in that country or that market and the depth and breadth of product line
within each therapeutic category. And there is a plan there that's a combination of two things in each country.
First is our internal registrations from our own creation or pipeline or existing products, and second is an L&A budget
for filling gaps or opportunities that they see in their country. That's the one place where we've decentralized a bit of
the of the L&A activity into the hands of the President of that business and his staff so that they can more rapidly go
after these smaller, say, product or product line opportunities that can enhance our position in a lot of these markets. I
can't give you a lot of detail or background about how that's going because, frankly, it's dozens and dozens of products
and opportunities and countries and so forth, but it's pretty comprehensive, pretty detailed and it's tracked very closely
by them and it's getting a lot of attention and you build it out little bit over time.
This is not a business of blockbusters, although ironically, the product for which we shut down the plant for expansion
here in the first quarter, it's a significant product for EPD, a very significant product, which is why we needed the plant
expansion. And I figure if we're going to have a plant expansion or a suppress a quarter this is the one to do it when we
knew it was going to be a tough comparison anyway, so it's good to get that out of the way. We've got some products
like that, that are fairly big sellers, but generally, this is a base hit business, a lot of base hits. And so every one of these
countries has got a plan around a whole portfolio of base hits to enhance this business and we're going at it a lot more
methodically than we did at first.
<Q - Josh T. Jennings>: Thanks. And then just one follow-up on the devices unit. Just specifically in Diabetes, with
the headwinds that you're facing here in the U.S. market, you've commented on next-generation sensing technology
platform. But what other key strategic initiatives can you put into play to help, and with the risk of the competitive
bidding to continue and pricing could continue to be a headwind in the out-years, what other strategic initiatives can
you manufacture to support the Diabetes unit? Thanks a lot.
<A - Miles D. White>: Well, I'll tell you, this is one unit I'm actually very excited about. I'm excited about the
innovation coming here. I think that our team there did a wonderful job segmenting this market in a way that
minimized the damage we took from competitive bidding. We took a hit just like everybody else did, but I think to a
lesser degree because I think we focused on segments that, frankly, were more profitable and less vulnerable in a way
than what the overall targeted competitive bidding was.
Now that said, I think we played great defense in what is a more challenged market right now. But going forward, the
innovation that's coming here, which we'll launch in Europe late this summer, is pretty significant and I think a pretty

unique product that I expect will be very well received by diabetic patients. And it hasn't had a lot of visibility yet. It
will in the coming months. We keep referring to it as next-generation, but frankly, it's quite a creative product and I
think it's going to have a lot of impact on the business. I've got great hopes for this and I think that the diabetic
community in particular, both physicians and patients, are going to think it's a terrific product. So I've got some great
expectations for that. And I think that as that mode of testing progresses over time, this is going to be a fairly good
business, a pretty good business for us.

Thank you. Our next question is from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo.
<Q - Larry H. Biegelsen>: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Let me start off with M&A. Miles, you
made some tantalizing comments earlier I think in response to David Roman's question. Could you talk a little bit about
whether your focus is on technology versus geographic expansion, large versus small deals? And then I had a
follow-up. Thanks.
<A - Miles D. White>: Yeah, Larry, I'm afraid all I can tell you is, yeah. The answer to that is yes. It's geographic, it's
– I don't know where you define big, I mean...
<Q - Larry H. Biegelsen>: Can you hear me?
<A - Miles D. White>: Almost all of this, some people would consider small and we might consider big. I mean, in the
context of this company, some of this is fairly significant to us and what we're looking at is nicely enhancing to our
businesses and our positions. Nothing is ever done until it's done, so I think it's dangerous to forecast anything in
particular, but I at least like what's on the menu and I like what I see here in a few places, and it's across a couple of our
sectors.
If you're looking for deals today, I think it's a difficult deal market because in some cases valuations are very high or
there's not great quality in the assets in some cases. I think we've said this every year for the last 15 years, I mean, I
think the deal market gets a little tougher every year. And yet we're looking in the places that can really enhance our
positions, our businesses and so forth. We've always had a pretty difficult or tough hurdle for the quality of deals.
We've had a fairly good track record that way. And I like what's on the menu right now. We'll just have to see how it
plays out.
What I'm cautious about, it's hard to forecast until something is done. But if I tell you there's nothing on my menu, then
there's nothing on my menu. And now I can't tell you that. I can't tell you there's nothing on my menu, so I don't want
to surprise you by telling you there's nothing on the menu and next week I suddenly had a great idea or a great
possibility. And it's not going to be next week, but I see a couple of things coming here that would be nice additions to
the business. I guess that's about all I can tell you.
<Q - Larry H. Biegelsen>: That's very helpful. And then just as my follow-up, the Nutritional mid-single digit growth
in the second quarter is a pretty big improvement from what we saw this quarter of I think down 1.7%. So can you give
us a little more color where you expect those improvements to come from, because that's a big part of what will drive
acceleration from this quarter in the overall business? Just lastly, the overall Abbott emerging growth rate this quarter,
you've given us that in the past, can you give that to us this quarter? Thanks.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Let me start with the first one and then I'll come back to Nutrition. With respect to the
emerging markets overall, if you take the couple [indiscernible] (01:00:57) adjustments that we talk about in my script
that refers to the plant capacity expansion affecting our Established Pharmaceuticals as well as where we're at with
respect to our recovery, it puts you closer in the 8% to 9% operational growth worldwide in the emerging market
growth. So it's still very solid growth, Larry.
Coming back to Nutrition, I'll go back to my first comment that, remember Q1, first of all, we did have a lot of
launches in Q1 of 2013 that made for a little bit more difficult comparison as I was talking to Mike there. But secondly,

our recovery is going well in China and Vietnam, and so as we move through time and we look at our ramp there of
where we're gaining share back in the markets, we would expect that impact to moderate as we move into quarter two.
That'll have a significant impact on our step-up.
The other thing I'd add is, as we saw overall in the United States, we saw a retail environment that was quite slow. I
think not only did the companies who served the retailers feel, but the retailers themselves felt it. We've been out there
and it's a great opportunity for us as the category leader, as the market leader, as Miles mentioned particularly in adults
and even in brands like PediaSure to work with our retailers to generate demand for the consumers through some retail
activation programs. And those are generating some nice early results there in March and early into April. We'll
continue to watch that but we definitely would expect a step-up in the United States.
I'll also comment too in the United States that this was the last quarter of our getting through the transition where we
were exiting the non-core, what I'd call, device or tubes and sets business in the United States. So that also will drive
some step-ups sequentially as we look at the U.S. results. So the combination of those two things, Larry, the recovery,
the U.S., and just continued underlying strong demand in our Nutrition business worldwide, both Pediatric and Adult,
will cause us to move up the chain there as we expect.
<Q - Larry H. Biegelsen>: Thanks for taking the question.
<A - Miles D. White>: So, Elan, we have time for one – we're going to do one more question here.
Operator
Thank you. Our final question today is from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Miles, my first question is for you,
Miles. The back-end acceleration, a lot of it is going to be driven by Nutritionals and a lot of it is going to be driven by
the recovery in China. And one of the push-backs I get and one of the concerns I've been hearing is the China economy
slowing. And I know, Miles, you're in China several times a year so I wonder if you could just take a moment and just
talk about what you're seeing in the China Nutritionals markets and how Abbott is positioned there so that some of that
concern can be calmed? And I had a follow-up on the U.S. infant business.
<A - Miles D. White>: I suppose it's fair to say in a general sense, the economy or the market in China has slowed
some, but there's slowed and then there's slowed. And China is not a slow market. China is not like Europe or the U.S.
or Japan or developed markets. It's by comparison a robustly growing market. The fact that it's not growing
double-digits may disappoint some people, but I think the high-single digit growth rates in the Chinese economy are
pretty attractive and in our business opportunity on top of that, pretty attractive.
And I suppose it depends on which competitor you ask and how damaged we were by the recall or the dynamics that
changed in the market or whatever. I see a market that's worthy of a significant investment and great opportunity. And
we are gaining our share back, growth rate is good, very good. I think if I expand that to the second half of the year, the
reality here of our business is we just have the quarter that we didn't want to have but had to have as a transition in the
year because of the optics and the comparison and so forth.
Next quarter gets better. And it's still part of that first half, but I'd say the second quarter is a transitional quarter for us
and second half of the year is pretty robust. There's nothing heroic that has to take place for that second half of our year
to be robust. We're well ahead on our own margin initiatives. I haven't seen any significant speed bumps around the
sales growth rates or the fundamentals of the markets.
We just have the quarter we forecasted. And we're ahead. In my mind, we're well ahead of where we wanted to be, and
we're well ahead going into Q2, and I think we're going to be well ahead going into Q3 and Q4. When we set our
guidance at the beginning of the year, that dramatic difference between the first half of the year and the second half of
the year had a number of people cautious about the second half of the year, just like you just said. And I thought if we
raised guidance here in the first quarter and raised the second half of the year even more, nobody's going to particularly

think that that's that credible because they're already cautious. Well, I'm not cautious. I know what we're going to do.
I'm pretty confident, other than things I can't predict and nobody can, I'm pretty confident about our performance, and I
think we'll wait and see how the second quarter goes. But I think the second quarter is a transitional one to a robust
second half that then takes us strongly into 2015.
And I think the underlying fundamentals of our primary geographies around the world are improving. People may be
looking at China and say, gee, it's declined. I think that already happened. And at this point, particularly given the
business we're in, we're not in mining, we're not in other things where you can say, wow, it really slowed. We're in a
segment that, frankly, isn't slowing, and it's just as robust as it's been. And I think it is a terrific opportunity for us
which is why we're going to put a fair amount of investment there, not only in China but in a number of markets around
the world.
<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: And the birth rates should increase next year and the years after. Is that correct?
<A - Miles D. White>: Well, I don't know. I suppose so. I'm not counting on birth rates. I don't even get that
microeconomic about it. We're looking at it – frankly, I'm not even counting on just the tailwind of market growth. I
want share gain. And I'm targeting share gain from competitors and share presence in that market and a lot of these
markets. We're measuring ourselves on share and that translates, as you might guess, into fairly healthy growth. But
you can fool yourself with healthy growth when it's the market. I want share gain. So that on top of whatever the
market may give us in terms of birth rate and so forth, I think we've got a very long-term market in China that's a very
healthy robust market.
And I think we had an unfortunate setback last year that was nobody's intention to have happen. It certainly wasn't our
partners' intention to have it happened but it did. And we've had great cooperation from Fonterra in resolving what
happened there. And they remain an incredibly important partner to us and a valuable partner to us. And I'd just say
look, the two of us as companies have some great plans and thoughts for China and other markets. It's an important one
for us and we remain very committed to it because I think that all the growth that we forecasted in the past is there.
One of the things I always caution investors about, we get so obsessed about a quarter in the United States because
that's how we are. We're a quarterly-driven, CNBC-driven economy. And our investments and progress in some of
these markets you can't measure in quarters. I know we need the feedback every quarter, but to know that everything is
okay and everything is on track and so forth and I'd say everything is okay and everything is on track. I expect speed
bumps out of the emerging markets. I don't expect not to have them. I mean who could forecast that you'd have issues
with Russia and the Ukraine and so forth and who could forecast that you'd have devaluations in given countries?
You can't forecast some of that stuff. There's always going to be that. But the long-term fundamentals of investing in a
lot of these countries and their healthcare systems and their need for the products that we make are strong and that's
where we're going. It may be bumpy from quarter to quarter. It's particularly bumpy this time in the first and second
quarters because of this recall we had last year, which was significant and the adjustment in exchange in the second
half. But the long-term fundamentals of these markets are very strong and we've been careful to select geographies
where we know those fundamentals remain sustainable. And, frankly, I'm pretty upbeat about the rest of this year, even
the second quarter.
I think there's great opportunity here and I see nothing but upward ramp, probably with some speed bumps to be
unpredictable. But nevertheless, pretty strong year ahead of us. And I'm glad we've got a head-start on it. And we're
well ahead in this quarter. I'm not ready to change our guidance because I want to see another quarter played because
it's a transitional quarter for us. But second quarter call should be an interesting call.
<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: That's helpful. Can I just ask also, in the U.S. Infant business, that business came in softer
and I think Brian on the call mentioned a little bit of weather. But is there anything else going on underlying in the U.S.
Infant business?
<A - Miles D. White>: Share is very stable. Our share is strong, very stable. I have a hard time blaming weather on this
one because babies got to eat. And I just cannot come up with a weather reason for that. I think the U.S. market has
always been pressured, the pediatric market. We haven't lost share. So I have to say it's probably economy phenomenon

to some degree. We're not losing share to private label or anything else. We're not losing share. So I don't know if
there's much more fundamental I can say about it other than I think the underlying fundamentals are good. And it was a
lesser quarter than we might have liked but I don't think it presages some long-term direction.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Glenn, I'd just clarify in Brian's remarks, he was referring more to the Adult segment,
which as you know is to Miles' point, infant is less discretionary and Adult segment is a little more discretionary. And
while overall there was a modest impact on the company in the quarter, that's the one area where we saw a little bit.
<A - Miles D. White>: Yeah, I think that's a fair comment. The Adult is more discretionary. But look, the bottom line
is the quarter was forecasted to be a very low-growth quarter. Well, we met expectations. It was a low-growth quarter
on the top line. It didn't miss our expectations. It is what we expected. Its ins and outs are a little different, but you
could sit here and say there's a whole list of things, comparisons and other things that make it a low-growth quarter. All
right, some of that is pretty significant and true, but at the end of the day, it was a low-growth quarter. I don't expect
that to be some sustainable growth rate. I think this gets constantly better over time and I'm glad to be ahead.
